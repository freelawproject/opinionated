In the initial complaint, ATC alleged violations of the Illinois Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act (UDTPA), 815 ILCS 510/2(a) ; the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act (the Consumer Fraud Act), 815 ILCS 505/2 ; intentional interference with prospective economic advantage; breach of contract; and intentional interference with contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   R. 1, Compl.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The claims arise from an alleged scheme by CPS and RCM to award the nurse-staffing contract for Chicago Public Schools to RCM and then have RCM take over all of ATC's nurses who were currently being used to staff the contract.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20Cow.%2008020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In June 2016, this Court dismissed the claims against RCM and CPS without prejudice.

ATC Healthcare Services, Inc. is a healthcare staffing company who Chicago Public Schools (CPS) had contracted with to provide in-school nurses for its students with disabilities and special needs. R. 51, Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 8. ATC and CPS initially entered the contract in 2006, and through a series of renewals, the contract was set to continue through the 2015-16 school year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-10. But CPS had the right to terminate the contract at any time so long as it gave ATC notice. R. 51-1 Exh. 1, 2010 Contract at 17 (Section 10.3). The contract also provided CPS with significant discretion in regulating the nursing services, Am. Compl. \u00b6 11, assigning nurses to students, and modifying those assignments, while\n   ATC had to comply with all of CPS' requirements unless it had a legitimate business reason to not do so, 2010 Contract at 5 (Section 2.2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The nurses who ultimately provided the services were employees of ATC- contracted with and paid by ATC-not CPS. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-24. They provided a range of critical services to CPS students with disabilities and special needs, including \"gastronomy tube feeding, tracheostomy care, ventilator care, medication through a nebulizer or other routes, assistance with range of motion and movement, the administration of medication, as well as urinary and bowel care.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. These nurses had unique skills and training, such as language fluencies, that allowed them to work with ESL (English as a Second Language) and special needs children in Chicago schools.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. The nurses were at-will employees of ATC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. But many of them had been with ATC for over two years, although their contracts had to be renewed for each school year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In November 2014, CPS decided to exercise its option to potentially terminate the contract and solicited bids from about 10 staffing firms, including ATC and Defendant RCM Technologies, for its outsourced nurse staffing needs. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 32-34. RCM claimed in its bid that it had \"100 nurses ready\" to staff the schools and that it would use a \"rigorous interview, screening and evaluation process\" to select nurses for assignments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. But because continuity of care is so important for the children, RCM represented that it usually attempts to \"inherit\" or \"take over\" the nurses from the current provider, which it has historically done \"on an annual basis\" \"with considerable ease.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   ATC alleges that these representations were a lie intended to deceive the public into believing that the bidding process was not a sham. Am. Compl. \u00b6 105. Out of one side of its figurative mouth, ATC alleges, CPS had privately assured RCM that it was going to win the bid.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. At the same time, CPS acted as though it intended to continue working with ATC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52. When ATC sent CPS copies of its proposed 2015-2016 employment agreement, for example, a CPS official replied, \"Thanks ....This looks great.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. CPS also asked ATC for a list of all currently assigned nurses and which schools they were assigned to, and ATC complied.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. During this time, CPS delayed its vote on the bid, causing ATC to incur training and recruitment costs to staff nurses in accordance with its existing contract, which it was still obligated to fulfill.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46-52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The first ATC heard that its contract was not going to be renewed was from a phone call on June 16, 2015, eight days before the Board publicly voted to approve RCM's competing bid. Am. Compl. \u00b6 56. CPS sent a letter stating the same the next day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   CPS would not give ATC any reason why it had opted not to award ATC the new contract despite ATC's record of success, and according to ATC, never gave any indication that it was going to help RCM take over ATC's nurses to fulfill the 2015-2016 staffing needs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. In fact, CPS still requested new nursing assignments from ATC two days after it sent them the letter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After CPS formally voted to accept RCM's proposal on June 24, 2015, Am. Compl. \u00b6 63, CPS informed ATC that it would not need any of its nurses for the remainder of the summer but did not terminate ATC's contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64, 78. CPS also sent RCM the complete list of all of ATC's nurses who were currently assigned to the schools, including the nurses' contact information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65. RCM did not have a formal contract in place with CPS but nevertheless began \"aggressively soliciting\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   ATC's nurses-in particular the ones who had worked at CPS for several years- offering them exclusive positions at CPS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66-67. RCM told them it was taking over their contracts, and CPS joined in, calling the nurses and the parents of the students, telling them that the nurses would need to work for RCM in order to keep their assignments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The solicitations grew more urgent as the school year approached. Am. Compl. \u00b6 70. RCM implied that the nurses were already working for RCM by stating that they only needed to \"confirm\" their previous assignments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71. RCM also emailed the nurses-the email was marked \"URGENT\"-to tell them that they needed to be fingerprinted (though ATC had already done that),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72, and that they would receive referral bonuses for getting other nurses to sign up.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76. ATC claims that this was a \"ruse\" to make the nurses think they were obligated to start working for RCM even though they were still ATC employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73. But CPS still told ATC that it was reserving its rights under the 2015-2016 contract, so ATC might still have to provide nurses to some schools.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78. Only two weeks before the start of the school year, on August 13, 2015, did CPS notify ATC that it was cancelling the contract,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77, and meanwhile RCM was still calling nurses to schedule them to assignments despite never hiring or screening them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81. RCM even implied that the solicitations were approved by ATC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   According to ATC, this led to problems on the first day of school. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 84-93. Scores of special needs children did not have nurses and were thus unable to attend class.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92. This led to numerous calls to ATC from parents and school officials who, confused as to whether the nurses who were supposed to be assigned to the children were employed by ATC or RCM, asked where the nurses were.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85-92. But ATC could only refer them to RCM and CPS, because ATC had no authority to send nurses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   ATC alleges that all of these actions were part of an unfair and deceptive scheme between RCM and CPS to allow RCM to take over ATC's contract and nurses. Am. Compl. \u00b6 95. So ATC sued. The Court granted a motion to dismiss, but allowed ATC to file an amended complaint. The amended complaint asserts claims under the Illinois Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act (UDTPA), 815 ILCS 510/2(a) ; the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act (the Consumer Fraud Act), 815 ILCS 505/2 ; and for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. Am. Compl. RCM and CPS now jointly move to dismiss the remaining claims under Rule 12(b)(6). R. 71, Mot. to Dismiss Am. Compl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Although ATC again attempts to make allegations to this effect, they still fall short.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   First, ATC argues that the Act should be broadly construed to eradicate deceptive and unfair business practices generally. R. 77, Pl. Resp. Br. for Am. Compl. at 16. Because the practices engaged in by RCM and CPS were unfair, ATC argues, the Act should cover them.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=698%20N.E.2d%20257\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But this argument fails to address the purpose of the statute, as interpreted by Illinois state courts: to protect\n   <em>\n    consumers\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Web Commc'ns Grp., Inc. v.

Contractors, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"906747\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-app-3d/275/452/#p459\">\n    275 Ill.

So a broad reading of the statute to cover any unfair practice would expansively empower courts to author an unmoored better-business code of competition. Requiring a connection between the requested relief and\n   <em>\n    consumers\n   </em>\n   is thus important because it ensures that non-consumers do not expand the Consumer Fraud Act beyond its intended purpose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lake Cty.

ATC's argument that unfair conduct generally should state a cause of action-even when it does not affect consumers-is thus not persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   ATC next argues that RCM targeted deceptions at the families of CPS students and that these families were affected by the deception. Pl. Resp. Br. for Am Compl. at 17. But most of the statements made by RCM in the bidding process (ATC lists tem in paragraph 39 of the Amended Complaint) are merely competitive puffery, not actual statements of\n   <em>\n    fact\n   </em>\n   , and cannot constitute actionable deceptive statements by themselves. The only arguably false or deceptive statement (and one that was capable of being verified one way or the other) that was made during the bidding process is that RCM had \"100 nurses ready\" to staff CPS schools as part of its bid. Am. Compl. \u00b6 39. ATC alleges that this statement was made to \"the public at large\" because it was made to CPS. But ATC offers no support that a statement made to a government entity in a bidding process qualifies as a statement made to end users of the contracted-for services. So far as the Amended Complaint alleges, RCM did not market the bid to parents and students, and the representation was only public because the bidding process was public. The alleged misrepresentation was directed at\n   <em>\n    CPS\n   </em>\n   , and throughout the complaint, ATC alleges that CPS was in on the scheme.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44 (alleging that CPS and RCM officials were planning to\n   execute the takeover scheme). So even if the students are consumers for purposes of the Consumer Fraud Act, they were not directly implicated by the misconduct-that is, the alleged misrepresentation. And the relief requested-\n   <em>\n    ATC\n   </em>\n   's lost profits and\n   <em>\n    ATC\n   </em>\n   's costs in losing nurses-also has zero connection to the alleged adverse effects on the students.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   To be sure, some cases have held that it is possible to state a valid claim in a business-to-business suit involving a deceptive act that flowed downstream to consumers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    YCB Int'l, Inc. v.

Dec. 3, 1997). But those cases are different from this one. In\n   <em>\n    YCB\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff-distributor was the direct recipient of the misrepresentation about the origin of ball bearings.\n   <em>\n    YCB Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%204781871\">\n    2010 WL 4781871\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *1. Here, CPS played that role-the direct recipient of the misrepresentation-not ATC. So the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    YCB\n   </em>\n   was thus harmed directly by the misrepresentation (the ball bearings were of inferior quality), and that harm was passed on to consumers in the form of products that had incorporated the inferior ball bearings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1, *5. In\n   <em>\n    Stickle\n   </em>\n   , misrepresentations about the use of contaminated grain pellets were again made directly to the claimant, CPC (which brought a counterclaim after being sued), and those misrepresentations would have directly harmed CPC by damaging its reputation in the marketplace and also would have harmed consumers by introducing contaminated feed into the market.\n   <em>\n    Stickle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1997%20WL%20767301\">\n    1997 WL 767301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *2, *4. In contrast, the middleman here, CPS-the direct recipient of the misrepresentation-is not the plaintiff and was not deceived or harmed by the alleged misrepresentation. Again, it is true that a business's actions, when akin to a consumer's actions, can help establish the necessary link to consumer harm and trigger the Consumer Fraud Act.\n   <em>\n    Brody v. Finch Univ. of Health Sciences,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1073608\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-app-3d/298/146/\">\n    298 Ill.App.3d 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=232%20Ill.%20Dec.%20419\">\n    232 Ill.Dec. 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=698%20N.E.2d%20257\">\n    698 N.E.2d 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 269 (1998). The injured distributors in\n   <em>\n    YCB\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Stickle\n   </em>\n   satisfied that standard. But here, ATC's alleged suffering at the hands of RCM, and the relief that ATC seeks (its own lost profits and costs), are dissimilar to the distributors in those two cases.

In the prior Opinion, the Court noted that ATC had sufficiently pled the first two elements of this common law tort: (1) the plaintiff must have a reasonable expectancy of a valid business relationship with a third party; and (2) the defendant must know about it. 6/28/2016 Opinion at 19 (relying on\n   <em>\n    Fellhauer v.

In the Amended Complaint, ATC has fixed this flaw by adding the allegation that dozens of ATC employees actually terminated their employment with ATC. Am. Compl. \u00b6 126. RCM and CPS now argue that ATC has failed to sufficiently allege damages because it did not allege that they were not able to fill other contracts with other clients due to the lost employees. Def.

No doubt damages will be explored during discovery and probably contested as the case progresses, but at this stage of the case, this element of the claim is sufficiently pled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   RCM and CPS also contend that ATC has failed to allege that they have intentionally interfered with the expectancy. Def. Br. to Am. Compl. at 15. They claim that the term \"actively recruited\" is a conclusion and not a factual allegation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=237%20N.E.2d%20793\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But this argument fails to take into account the rest of the allegations throughout the Amended Complaint. For example, ATC specifically alleges that both RCM and CPS made false representations to the nurses that their positions were confirmed and that needed to contact RCM for scheduling purposes only. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 71, 79. These are intentional acts which, when construed in the light most favorable to ATC, state a plausible claim for tortious interference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Finally, RMC and CPS argue that ATC has not overcome the competitor's privilege. Def. Br. to Am. Compl. at 15-18. But this does not take into account that competitor's privilege is an\n   <em>\n    affirmative defense\n   </em>\n   to tortious interference with business advantage.\n   <em>\n    Gen.

It would be one thing if Illinois law placed on a plaintiff the burden to plead a complaint in such a way as to defeat the competitor's privilege. But the Illinois Supreme Court classifies the competitor's privilege as an affirmative defense.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=862%20N.E.2d%20209\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ATC is generally not required to plead around an affirmative defense to survive a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Gypsum Co. v. Indiana Gas Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9053231\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/350/623/#p626\">\n    350 F.3d 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 626 (7th Cir. 2003) ;\n   <em>\n    Serv.

Ill. 2015). The case cited by CPS and RCM,\n   <em>\n    Flexicorps, Inc. v. Trend Technologies, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , is thus distinguishable, because it was decided on summary judgment.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%2031018353\">\n    2002 WL 31018353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 10, 2002). To be sure, sometimes a meritorious affirmative defense can be so readily obvious on the fact of the complaint that a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal is allowed.\n   <em>\n    Int'l Mktg., Ltd. v. Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11571116\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/192/724/#p731\">\n    192 F.3d 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 731 (7th Cir. 1999). But ATC has not pled itself out of court in the Amended Complaint. In\n   <em>\n    International Marketing\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff (IML) included an allegation that the defendant falsely represented that IML did\n   not have a direct contact for supplying a commodity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11571116\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/192/724/#p731\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11571116\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/192/724/#p731\">\n    at 732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court noted that this allegation would have been sufficient to state a tortious interference with prospective advantage claim even though it does not reference spite or malice because the statement does not have a competitive motivation, but IML made this allegation only in reference to its contract claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11571116\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/192/724/#p731\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, ATC has added the allegation that CPS concealed the scheme between it and RCM so that ATC would continue to pay the expenses of training and vetting the nurses even though both CPS and RCM intended to take over the nurses. Am. Compl. \u00b6 45. It remains to be seen whether those facts alone would be enough to survive the summary judgment stage (as distinct from the plausibility standard applied at this pleading stage), but for now the allegation does suggest more than mere competitive motive to survive a dismissal motion. If true, then that conduct went beyond mere competitive motive and instead plausibly represents an attempt to inflict extra costs on ATC. The claim for interference with economic advantage survives the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Illinois Tort Immunity Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, CPS argues that the Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act, 745 ILCS 10/1-101\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , provides the Board with immunity against the economic-advantage claim. In particular, CPS cites to four sections of the Tort Immunity Act. But none of them apply, at least not to all the allegations comprising the tortious interference claim. First, Section 2-106 immunizes only \"oral\" promises or misrepresentations. Some of the alleged misrepresentations to ATC's nurses were in writing, including via email. Am. Compl. \u00b6 72. As discovery progresses and a finite set of facts comprising the claim becomes clear, it might very well be that the basis for CPS's liability will be narrowed (and jury instructions to that effect would be appropriate). But dismissal of the claim is inappropriate because of the alleged written communications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Second, Section 2-210 immunizes \"negligent\" misrepresentations, whether in writing or made orally. But the allegations, which much be accepted as true, plausibly set for an\n   <em>\n    intentional\n   </em>\n   interference with economic advantage, comprised of\n   <em>\n    intentional\n   </em>\n   misrepresentations to ATC's nurses. Again, CPS might well be entitled to a jury instruction to ensure that the jury does not premise liability on negligence. But this section does not help CPS dismiss the entirety of the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Third, Section 2-107 immunizes local governments against libel or slander. But that is not the surviving claim. Tortious interference with economic advantage does not necessarily rely on libelous or slanderous statements, and indeed that is not what ATC is alleging when it says that Defendants essentially tricked ATC's nurses into thinking that they had already become RCM employees. So this section too does not defeat the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Fourth and finally, Section 2-201 immunizes local governments against claims premised on their employees' policy determinations and exercises of discretion. It would be one thing if the tortious interference claim sought to challenge CPS's decision to award the staffing contract to RCM. That decision would be a prototypical policy determination and an exercise of discretion. But that is not what ATC targets with the tortious interference claim. Instead, ATC seeks relief for CPS's alleged interference with ATC's employment relationship with its nurses, and those allegations are independent of the policy decision to terminate the contract with ATC and award it to RCM. None of the immunities\n   apply, at least not entirely to defeat the tortious interference claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   For the reasons discussed, the motion to dismiss the Deceptive Trade Practices Act and the Consumer Fraud Act claims is granted, and this time the dismissals are with prejudice, because ATC has already amended the complaint. But the claim for tortious interference with economic advantage remains intact. The status hearing of October 12, 2017, remains as scheduled. The parties shall confer on a discovery schedule and file a joint Rule 26(f) report by October 10, 2017. At the least, Rule 26(a)(1) disclosures will be due by October 23, 2017, and the first round of written discovery requests shall be issued no later than that date.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this case under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The parties are completely diverse: ATC is a Georgia corporation, with its principal place of business in New York; RCM Technologies is a New Jersey corporation, with its principal place of business also there; and the Board of Education of the City of Chicago is a citizen of Illinois.
