Ms. Agrama wants to know how IRS received the report so that she can convince the Service that Italy violated her rights and the report is inadmissible in the United States. Thus, she submitted a FOIA request asking, in part, for records from any country outside the U.S. contained in her IRS file. None of the records produced by IRS provides a paper trail indicating how IRS agents in this country received the Italian report. Ms. Agrama sues, arguing that IRS conducted an inadequate search.</p><p id=\"p-9\">Both IRS and Ms. Agrama have moved for summary judgment, contesting whether IRS fulfilled its FOIA obligations.

Ms. Agrama's FOIA Request</strong></p><p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-12\">On October 28, 2015, the IRS issued two (2) letters to [Jehan Agrama] entitled \"Failure to File Form 5471.\" These letters claim [she] had an obligation to file Forms 5471 regarding a foreign corporation, Byram Enterprises Limited[,] for the years 1982 through 2004. Moreover, these letters propose continuation delinquency penalties ... if the subject returns are not filed ....</p><p id=\"p-14\">[Ms. Agrama] does not have an ownership interest in Byram Enterprises Limited that would obligate her to file Forms 5471.</p><p id=\"p-16\">A sensible woman, Ms. Agrama would prefer to persuade IRS to withdraw its intention to penalize her for unpaid taxes rather than be required to pay the penalty and late taxes and sue to recover her money. To this end, she submitted a request on February 16, 2016 under the Freedom of Information Act, <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552</extracted-citation> <em>et seq.</em> , (2012) asking IRS to release to her \"each and every document (exclusive of the filed tax [sic] income tax returns) contained in the administrative files of the Internal Revenue Service relating to Form 5471 proposed penalty liabilities of Jehan Agrama ... for taxable years 1982-2004.\" Compl.

IRS MSJ Ex. 4, Declaration of Christopher Valvardi (Valvardi Decl.) [Dkt. 10-5] \u00b6 5. His DOJ colleague told Mr. Valvardi on August 25, 2016, presumably based on information from Ms. Agrama's counsel, that Ms. Agrama had possession of an 83-page document known as the \"Chersicla Report,\" described by Ms. Agrama as \"a 'rough translation' of a non-public Italian expert witness report,\" Pl.'s Am. Reply [Dkt. 26] at 1, of Italian origin for apparent use in Italian courts. Upon inquiry by Mr. Valvardi, Revenue Agent Pack and Supervisory Revenue Agent Steven Lepore confirmed that they had provided the Chersicla Report to Ms. Agrama. Valvardi Decl. \u00b6 8. When Mr. Valvardi received Ms. Agrama's copy of the Chersicla Report, he determined that it was substantively identical to 83 pages of the 86 pages that Ms. Coen had earlier withheld from release to Ms. Agrama. <em><extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> IRS then withdrew its reliance on any FOIA exemption to withhold those 83 pages and disclosed its version of the Chersicla Report to Ms. Agrama on September 16, 2016. <em><extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\"> \u00b6\u00b6 9-10</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-21\">\u2022 Perhaps informed by this experience, Mr. Valvardi undertook an independent review of the records that had been provided by Agents Trapp and Pack to Ms. Coen. <em><extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\"> \u00b6 11</extracted-citation>. That review demonstrated that some of the records were incomplete. Agent Pack was queried and explained that some of the responsive records were commingled in a larger file of records that was being reviewed as part <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"269\" href=\"#p269\" id=\"p269\">*269</a>of an investigation into another taxpayer. <em><extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">Id.</extracted-citation></em></p><p id=\"p-22\">\u2022 Mr. Valvardi asked Agent Pack to search the larger file manually to identify fully any responsive records, which he did. <em><extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> Agent Pack sent 27 additional potentially-responsive pages to Mr. Valvardi. <em><extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\"> \u00b6 12</extracted-citation>. After review on September 6, 2016, Mr. Valvardi determined that the additional pages were responsive to Ms. Agrama's request, but were all exempt from disclosure.</p><p id=\"p-23\">In sum, IRS identified a total of 116 pages of responsive records. Of those pages, 86 have been released to Ms. Agrama in whole. The remaining 30 pages, constituting four separate documents, have been withheld in their entirety. IRS relies on FOIA Exemptions 7(A) and 3 to assert that these records are wholly exempt and Exemptions 6 and 7(C) to assert that they are exempt in part.</p><p id=\"p-24\"><strong>B. Procedural History</strong></p><p id=\"p-25\">As the parties note, this particular FOIA lawsuit is just one of many legal proceedings touching on the question of IRS penalties. Ms. Agrama's father, Frank Agrama, has also sought IRS records under FOIA, <em>see Agrama v.

The document most at issue here, the Chersicla Report, was apparently prepared at the behest of Italian prosecutors for a criminal prosecution in that country. Pl.'s Am. Reply at 7. Ms. Agrama protests that in that process, the Italian prosecutors violated her rights to confidential communications with her attorney and that, as a result, the Chersicla Report is inadmissible in a U.S. court. <em>See</em> Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. 1, 1st Decl. of Dennis L. Perez (1st Perez Decl.) [Dkt. 11] \u00b6 17. She submitted the Request to, <em>inter alia</em> , discover exactly how the Report came to be in the possession of IRS.

IRS moved for summary judgment on November 1, 2016, <em>see</em> IRS MSJ [Dkt. 10]; Ms. Agrama opposed, <em>see</em> Pl.'s Opp'n [Dkt. 11], and filed a Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment, Pl.'s MSJ [Dkt. 12]. IRS responded, <em>see</em> Def.'s Combined Reply and Opp'n [Dkts. 17 and 18], and Ms. Agrama replied, <em>see</em> Pl.'s Reply [Dkt. 19]. Soon after, Ms. Agrama moved to supplement her reply. <em>See</em> Pl.'s Mot. to Amend Reply [Dkt. 21] at 1. This request was granted, and Ms. Agrama duly filed her Amended Reply. <em>See</em> Am.

ANALYSIS</strong></p><p id=\"p-34\">The gravamen of Ms. Agrama's complaint is that IRS did not search well enough because it has failed to release records that show the provenance of the Chersicla Report, that is, how that Report came into the hands of U.S. tax agents. She questions the legitimacy of such a search and asks the Court to question it as well.</p><p id=\"p-35\">In support, Ms. Agrama submits an affidavit from Dennis Perez, a principal in the law firm of Hochman Salkin Rettig Toscher &amp; Perez, P.C., which represents both Ms. Agrama and her father, Frank Agrama. <em>See</em> Am. Reply, Ex. 1, 2d Declaration of Dennis L. Perez (2d Perez Decl.), [Dkt. 26-1].

She argues, \"This paper trail of EOIs to other countries, particularly when combined with the IRS's admission in Jehan Agrama's investigation that it was in contact with its tax attache, makes it nearly certain that the IRS obtained the Chersicla [R]eport through its tax attache's submission of an EOI to Italy.\" <em>Id.</em> at 6.</p><p id=\"p-36\">The immediate Request occurs in the context of a much larger dispute between the IRS and Ms. Agrama and the merits of that dispute are important to her. However, the purpose, creation, and use of agency records are beyond the scope of a FOIA suit, as is the records' intended use by Ms. Agrama.

Notably, the Request was for documents contained in the \"administrative files of the Internal Revenue Service related to proposed Form 5471 penalty liabilities of Jehan Agrama.\" FOIA Request at 1.

Reply at 6. Although her Opposition appeared to challenge the good faith of IRS searches, <em>see</em> Pl.'s Opp'n at 4, she has dropped that argument in her Amended Reply and says good faith is irrelevant when a search is obviously inadequate. <em>See</em> <em>Krikorian v.

She offers two pieces of evidence to support her argument: (1) at one time, Supervisory Internal Revenue Agent Lepore referenced contact with a tax attach\u00e9, <em>see</em> 1st Perez Decl. \u00b6 22; and (2) records received in response to Frank Agrama's separate FOIA request reference multiple foreign EOI requests to unidentified nations. Pl.'s Am. Reply at 6. Neither of these points is availing.</p><p id=\"p-43\">Ms. Agrama's Request was limited to records \"relating to proposed Form 5471 penalty liabilities of Jehan Agrama.\" FOIA Request at 1. Her Request does not seek records related to IRS's separate investigation of her father. Ms. Agrama argues that the investigations of father and daughter \"significantly overlap-<em>according to the Cheriscla Report</em> \" because she \"is purported to have an interest in one foreign company, to which Frank Agrama allegedly was also connected.\" Pl.'s Am. Reply at 6 (emphasis added). Notably, Ms. Agrama does not cite IRS itself as a source for this alleged overlap. In any event, overlap or no, each person is an individual taxpayer with individual tax responsibilities. Records directly relevant to one may be relevant to the other-thus, perhaps, the commingling of records that Revenue Agent Pack manually searched-or not. EOIs to foreign nations relating to the examination of Frank Agrama's taxes may have resulted in the release of the Cheriscla Report which was then properly shared among examining revenue agents in this country.</p><p id=\"p-44\">The Court's speculation is no better than Ms. Agrama's.

Ms. Agrama does not contest that the IRS examination of her taxes and potential penalties was currently pending at the time of the Request. She argues, however that the Chersicla Report, already released by IRS, itself identifies and substantively describes the four records withheld by the Service. Thus, she contends that IRS must either demonstrate that the four withheld records are <em>not</em> those identified in the Chersicla Report, or disclose them. <em>See</em> Pl.'s Opp'n at 12-13.</p><p id=\"p-53\">This argument also fails. First, it relies solely on the fact that the Chersicla Report describes four documents and IRS withheld four documents; no further evidence exists that they are the same, and Ms. Agrama admits it may simply be a coincidence. <em><extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%20416428\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> Only her speculation connects the two groups.</p><p id=\"p-54\">Further, even if the documents were the same, the fact that they are described in the Chersicla Report does not invalidate reliance on an applicable FOIA Exemption by IRS. It is true that records that have entered the public domain, such as through disclosure in a public trial, may not be protected by Exemption 7(A). <em>Cottone v. Reno</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11563272,3671225\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/193/550/\">193 F.3d 550</extracted-citation>, 554 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (\"Under our public-domain doctrine, materials normally immunized from disclosure under FOIA lose their protective cloak once disclosed and preserved in a permanent public record.\"). However, that is not the case here; Ms. Agrama asserts only that they have been substantively described by the Chersicla Report. The burden of showing that the contested records have entered into the public domain falls on the requesting party, <em>see</em> <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11563272,3671225\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/193/550/\">id.</extracted-citation></em> , and Ms. Agrama \"has the burden of showing that there is a permanent public record of the\" records she seeks. <em>Davis v. U.S. Dep't of Justice</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519352,3499688\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/968/1276/\">968 F.2d 1276</extracted-citation>, 1280 (D.C. Cir. 1992). Even if the gist of the documents were described by the Chersicla Report, that would not be sufficient to trigger the public-domain doctrine. Ms. Agrama has not met her burden, and the government is not obligated to \"prove the negative.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519352,3499688\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/968/1276/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> It would also not mean that the government did not have a valid law enforcement interest in withholding the full documents themselves, which may contain much more information than just a summary included in another report. Ms. Agrama's argument is therefore without merit.</p><p id=\"p-55\">The Court further concludes that the records have been properly withheld under Exemption 7(A), and that no <em>Vaughn</em> Index or more detailed declarations are necessary. Ms. Agrama is quite candid: she wants access to records related to an ongoing IRS investigation of herself in order to quash any penalties before they are assessed. IRS withheld four records on the ground that disclosing them would interfere with that investigation. This justification falls well within the boundaries of Exemption 7(A). Exemption 7(A) is intended to \"prevent disclosures which might prematurely reveal the government's cases <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"275\" href=\"#p275\" id=\"p275\">*275</a>in courts, its evidence and strategies, or the nature, scope, and focus of investigations.\" <em>Maydak</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674601,11197982\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/218/760/\">218 F.3d at 762</extracted-citation>. Disclosure of the contested documents may do harm to IRS's investigation in ways that do not relate to the substantive content possibly summarized in the Chersicla Report. Ms. Agrama's call for a <em>Vaughn</em> Index, or more detailed descriptions of the withheld records, is not supported by FOIA. The Court concludes, based on the public and <em>in camera</em> submissions by the IRS, that such further detail is unwarranted. To require further disclosure of information would destroy the purpose of the Exemption.</p><p id=\"p-56\"><strong>C. Segregability</strong></p><p id=\"p-57\">While an agency may properly withhold records or parts of records under one or more FOIA exemptions, it must release \"any reasonably segregable portions\" of responsive records that do not contain exempt information. <em>Schoenman v. FBI</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3835150\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/575/136/#p155\">575 F.Supp.2d 136</extracted-citation>, 155 (D.D.C. 2008) ; <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552</extracted-citation>(b). An agency bears the burden of demonstrating that all reasonably segregable portions of a record have been disclosed, and may do so by \"offering an affidavit with reasonably detailed descriptions of the withheld portions of the documents and alleging facts sufficient to establish an exemption.\" <em>Pac. Fisheries, Inc. v. United States</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3118568\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/539/1143/#p1148\">539 F.3d 1143</extracted-citation>, 1148 (9th Cir. 2008).</p><p id=\"p-58\">IRS states that it has \"attempted to make available to the plaintiff every reasonably segregable non-exempt portion of every responsive record.\" Valvardi Decl. \u00b6 12. No evidence casts doubt on this sworn statement, and the Court finds that IRS has satisfied its obligation to release all segregable factual information.</p><p id=\"p-59\"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p><p id=\"p-60\">For reasons stated above, the Court will grant the IRS Motion for Summary Judgment [Dkt. 10], and deny Ms. Agrama's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment [Dkt. 12]. Judgment will be entered in favor of the IRS. A memorializing order accompanies this memorandum opinion.</p><p id=\"p-63\">As. Ms. Agrama indicates, \"The Internal Revenue Manual defines an 'EOI' request as an 'Exchange of Information' request, referring to 'the sharing of tax-related information between two or more countries for tax administration and enforcement purposes.' \" Am. Reply at 6 n.1 (quoting Internal Revenue Manual \u00a7 4.60.1.1 (revised 09-19-2014) ).</p><p id=\"p-64\">Typically, agencies provide to courts an itemized description of all withheld and redacted documents, with a brief description of the document, the exemptions claimed, and the bases for the claimed exemptions. This index, known as a <em>Vaughn</em> Index, allows courts to adequately assess the validity of an agency's withholdings. <em>See</em> <em>Vaughn v.

Cir. 1973).</p><p id=\"p-65\">IRS also asserts that all withheld records are exempt under Exemption 3, and that portions of them are exempt under Exemptions 6 and 7(C). Because the Court finds that all documents are appropriately withheld under Exemption 7(A), it does not further analyze the remaining proffered exemptions. <em>See</em> <em>Utahamerican Energy, Inc. v.
