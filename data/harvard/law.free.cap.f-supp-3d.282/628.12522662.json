The Social Security Administration (\"SSA\") denied Scully's application on September 24, 2013. R. 88-92.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   He requested review of the SSA's decision by an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\"), R. 96-97, and a hearing was held on January 22, 2015,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 31-62. In a written decision dated April 23, 2015, the ALJ found that Scully was not disabled. R. 14-26. Scully requested review of the ALJ's decision by the Appeals Council, R. 1-6, but it denied his request on July 18, 2016, R. 7-10. Scully filed his complaint on September 15, 2016, seeking review of that final decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Hearing Before the ALJ\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Scully was represented by attorney Scott Goldstein at the hearing before the ALJ. R. 33. Mr. Goldstein agreed with the ALJ that there was \"a complete medical record\" at the time of the hearing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Scully testified that he was involved in a traffic accident while working as a service technician on March 7, 2013, which caused injuries to his back. R. 34-35. Since the accident he had suffered from chronic back pain, numbness in his legs, loss of balance, inability to walk more than a few blocks, and inability to stay seated longer than 15-20 minutes. R. 35-36, 45. His lower back pain radiated down his legs and caused numbness in his feet, which in turn impaired his balance. R. 41, 44. The week before the hearing this balance trouble caused him to fall and hurt his shoulder, although he had not seen a doctor for that injury at the time of the hearing. R. 41-42. Scully had problems standing and walking, as \"when walking any extended distance it will aggravate the pain ... [and] the numbness gets worse and [his] balance diminishes as the pain increases.\" R. 45. The motion of his spine when bending or twisting was \"not good,\" R. 46, and it was difficult to do something \"as simple as taking a gallon of milk out of the refrigerator,\" R. 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Concerning daily activities, Scully testified that he stayed at home with his seven-year-old daughter and eight-month-old\n   son, and took care of his infant son for about six hours during the day. R. 39-40. His son weighed about 15 pounds, and Scully could lift him to diaper him or change his clothing, but with significant pain. R. 40. Scully said that his wife had to do the laundry, bathe his son, and shop for groceries. R. 48. He also testified that he could drive for around 25 minutes, but that anything longer than that required he \"stop and get out of the vehicle and walk.\" R. 41, 49. At home, Scully spent \"[t]wo or three hours combined\" laying down, and could manage on his own despite his limitations on sitting and standing because he could switch positions at will. R. 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Scully had been treated with \"several injections, which include[d] epidural injections, medial branch blocks, nerve block injections, [and] trigger points,\" as well as medication. R. 46. He was given a trial neurostimulator for seven days by pain management doctor Peter Zheng, which \"worked out very well.\" R. 36-37;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   R. 458-59 (follow-up notes from Dr. Zheng). Although he was seeking approval from Worker's Compensation for a permanent neurostimulator, without it he felt \"absolutely horrible,\" and had \"the same problems [he] had before.\" R. 37-38. Scully testified that \"of all the treatment [he] received in the past two years [the neurostimulator is] the only thing that [he] had any type of forward production with.\" R. 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The ALJ called a vocational expert witness (\"VE\"), whom Scully's counsel stipulated was \"an expert in vocational rehab.\" R. 50. Scully had testified that his past work as a propane service technician \"involve[d] sales, service, installation, diagnostic, repair, [in]stalling of oil tanks, [and] installing of propane tanks.\" R. 51. Using this testimony, the VE classified Scully's previous work as \"medium\" type work. R. 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The ALJ then described a person of Scully's age, education, and work experience who could perform only sedentary work; could only occasionally bend, kneel, squat, or lift; could lift no more than 10 pounds; and could sit for six hours and stand for four hours-that is, alternating between sitting and standing by having a short stretch break every 30 minutes. R. 52. The VE testified that such a person could perform the jobs of order clerk, call out operator, and charge account clerk, all of which existed in significant numbers in the national economy. R. 52-53. She said that all of these jobs would permit \"a sit/stand type of option\" so long as the person remained in the work station when taking a stretch break. R. 53. Although the VE said that the \"[Dictionary of Occupational Titles] doesn't necessarily address the sit/stand option,\" the rest of her testimony was consistent with that document, and in her own experience all of those jobs \"would allow for somebody to stand up as needed.\" R. 53-54. But if the hypothetical person had to walk away from the work station and would be off task \"every half hour for five to 10 minutes,\" the person could not perform those jobs. R. 58. The VE also testified that while these jobs \"fit within the sedentary category,\" they would not require lifting. R. 58-59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Medical Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Both Scully and the Commissioner have provided summaries of the medical evidence contained in the administrative record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 8-14; Comm'r Mem. at 4-12. The summaries are substantially consistent with each other. The Court had directed the parties to specify any objections they had to the opposing party's summary of the record,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Scheduling Order, filed Feb. 15, 2017 (Docket # 15), at \u00b6 5, and neither party has done so. Accordingly, the Court adopts the plaintiff's and the Commissioner's summaries of the medical\n   evidence as accurate and complete for purposes of the issues raised in this suit. We discuss the medical evidence pertinent to the adjudication of this case in section III below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    The ALJ's Decision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The ALJ denied Scully's application for benefits on April 23, 2015. R. 17-26. The ALJ found that Scully met the insured status requirements of the Social Security Act and had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since his alleged onset date of March 7, 2013. R. 19. While the ALJ found that Scully had a severe back impairment and was obese, he found that other conditions about which Scully complained, such as hyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, and impaired fasting glucose, were \"controlled, minimally treated or lack[ed] specific complaints,\" and thus \"result[ed] in no more than minimal functional limitations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He also acknowledged a right shoulder injury Scully allegedly suffered just before his hearing, but found the condition \"not severe\" because the record contained \"no objective medical evidence of a diagnosis, treatment, or functional limitations with respect to\" Scully's right shoulder. R. 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The ALJ found that Scully's impairments did not meet or medically equal an impairment listed in 20 C.F.R. part 404, subpart p, appendix 1.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The ALJ specifically considered Listing 1.04, disorders of the spine,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1, \u00a7 1.04 (\"Listing 1.04\"), but found that \"the medical evidence fail[ed] to establish that [Scully's] conditions [rose] to the level of severity contemplated by that Listing.\" R. 20. The ALJ found that \"per the evidence detailed below,\" there was \"no evidence of nerve root compression characterized by neuro-anatomic distribution of pain, limitation of motion of the spine, motor loss (atrophy with associated muscle weakness) accompanied by sensory or reflex loss, and a positive straight-leg raising test (sitting and supine); spinal arachnoiditis ; or, lumbar spinal stenosis resulting in pseudoclaudication.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The ALJ also took Scully's obesity into account, but found the record lacking \"specific allegations that this condition is disabling,\" or that it had a substantial impact on his other conditions, given that \"no medical treatment [was] recommended although diet, portion control, and exercise have been advised.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Turning to Scully's residual functional capacity (\"RFC\"), the ALJ found that Scully could perform sedentary work because he could sit for a total of eight hours per day, sitting or standing for one hour at a time before taking a one-minute stretch break; stand and walk for a total of four hours during a work day; perform occasional bending, stooping, and crouching, and frequent reaching, handling, and fingering; and could lift and carry objects that weighed up to 10 pounds.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The ALJ acknowledged the back injury Scully suffered as a result of a motor vehicle accident, as well as his complaints of pain, but noted that Scully was successfully treated with a neurostimulator on a trial basis. R. 21. The ALJ observed that Drs. Jeffrey W. Degen, Steven K. Jacobs, and Marc H. Appel found relatively normal conditions, including full range of motion and strength in Scully's extremities, normal gait and station, normal alignment of the discs in Scully's spine other than bulging at the L2-3 through L5-S1 vertebrae, \"intact sensation to light touch and pinprick\" as of December 2014, and \"no radiographic explanation\" for Scully's symptoms in March 2013. R. 22-23. The ALJ accorded \"great weight\" to the January 2015 opinion of Dr. Appel, who limited Scully to \"sedentary activities\" and who noted that Scully could not \"sit or stand more than one hour\n   <em>\n    at a time\n   </em>\n   .\" R. 23 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As to Scully's credibility, the ALJ found that Scully's \"ability to perform a full range of activities of daily living ... confirms that he is not as debilitated as he alleges.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The ALJ noted that multiple doctors reported that a neural spine stimulator trial provided Scully with significant relief from pain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 22-23. The ALJ also noted Scully's testimony that he was a \"stay-at-home dad\" for his two children, one of whom was a \"20 pound[ ]\" infant at the time of the hearing, and that he could drive a motor vehicle for a half-hour and stand for 20 minutes at a time. R. 21. The ALJ found that \"[t]he abilities to drive a motor vehicle and care for an infant child show a considerable ability to perform physical activities, so it is reasonable to conclude that [Scully] would be able to perform at least sedentary types of activities.\" R. 23. While the ALJ noted that Scully's obesity and history of back and lower extremity problems would \"adversely impact ... his ability to walk/stand,\" he found that his RFC assessment accounted for these limitations. R. 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   While the ALJ acknowledged that Scully could not return to his past work as an HVAC technician, he found that jobs existed in significant numbers in the national economy that Scully could perform. R. 24-25. Scully was 32 years old at the time of the hearing-a \"younger individual\" under the regulations-and had at least a high school education. R. 24. The ALJ relied on the VE's testimony that an individual with Scully's age, education, and RFC could perform the requirements of order clerk, call out operator, and charge account clerk. R. 25. The ALJ determined that the VE's testimony was consistent with the Dictionary of Occupational Titles \"except with respect to the issue of the claimant requiring a one minute stretch break after sitting or standing for one hour,\" but accepted the VE's testimony that, based on \"her knowledge and experience in the field,\" those occupations would permit the sitting and standing options described.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Because there was work in significant numbers in the national economy that Scully could perform, the ALJ found that Scully was not disabled.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    GOVERNING STANDARDS OF LAW\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Scope of Judicial Review Under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (g)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A court reviewing a final decision by the Commissioner \"is limited to determining whether the [Commissioner's] conclusions were supported by substantial evidence in the record and were based on a correct legal standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Selian v.

Subsequent reports, including one in January 2015, found that Scully's condition was \"about the same.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 493.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Zheng, seeing Scully on November 20, 2014, noted that Scully had \"intractable pain ... associated with fatigue, impaired walk tolerance, and difficulty sleeping, concentrating and performing activities of daily living.\" R. 460.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Commissioner attempts to explain away this deficiency by arguing that \"[t]he ALJ is not required to reconcile every shred of conflicting evidence,\" and claiming that \"just because an ALJ does [not] cite an examination finding in the record does not mean that it was not considered.\" Comm'r Mem. at 21. Certainly, the ALJ need not cite every piece of evidence. In this case, however, the uncited evidence consisted of extensive notes of treating physicians and contained findings inconsistent with the ALJ's conclusions. Nothing suggests that the ALJ considered the findings of Drs. Polepalle and Zheng, let alone explains how he weighed their findings in determining Scully's RFC. Thus, remand is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Lopez v.

Also, we note that while Dr. Appel's reference to Scully being \"unable to sit or stand more than one hour,\" R. 502, was likely intended to mean that Scully could only sit or stand for one hour \"at a time\" as the ALJ concluded, R. 23, the ALJ may wish to seek clarification on this point.
