But, the plaintiff cites no factual or legal authority or even an Architect policy that precludes the participation of a panelist from a prior interview process or the selecting official,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-26, and the Court sees no reason why such individuals would need to be precluded, particularly given that they collectively selected a candidate from the plaintiff's protected class prior to the interview for the position in 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Moreover, the plaintiff contends that Kotting \"was not eligible to interview candidates for a GS-14 position\" because he was a GS-13 employee, and because of his selection as a member of the panel for the first round of interviews, a jury could \"conclude that Clark wanted Kotting on the panel because he worked closely with ...

In any event, the plaintiff misrepresents the record concerning the factual circumstances surrounding these events. For instance, although the plaintiff alleges that \"Clark attempted to conceal the fact that she proposed Tseng's [termination],\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 43, the record shows that she never actually filed a proposal before Tseng resigned, but only shows that she\n   had intended to make that recommendation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n, Ex. 97 (Collection of emails and documents filed under seal) at AOC002035 (informing Human Resources of her intent to terminate Tseng but indicating that she was awaiting approval before starting the process);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n, Ex. 2 (Clark Dep.) at 212:8-9 (stating that she was preparing to, but never submitted any proposal). Additionally, the plaintiff claims that the announcement of the second round of interviews came after the conclusion of the first round; however, Clark testified that she explained to the first round panelists that there would be a second round of interviews for the top three candidates \"[i]n the very beginning before the interview process started.\" Pl.'s Opp'n, Ex. 2 (Clark Dep.) at 219:7-18.

And, contrary to the plaintiff's speculation, it would be entirely unreasonable for those notes to indicate that the panel should avoid candidates who spoke with accents, given that the record reflects that one of the top three candidates selected for a second interview spoke with an accent.

Thus, similar to the earlier analysis of the plaintiff's national original discrimination claim, the Court must determine whether a reasonable jury could infer intentional retaliation from the evidence. The plaintiff mainly argues that the \"very close [temporal] proximity between [his] protected activity,\" the filing of his complaint with the OOC in 2013, and the Architect's two non-selections \"creates a strong inference of retaliation\" that suggests that the Architect's legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the non-selections is pretextual.

Additionally, the Court concludes that a reasonable jury could not find that the Architect's qualifications-based explanation for the plaintiff's two non-selections was pretext for discrimination or retaliation. Therefore, the Court must grant summary judgment in favor of the Architect with respect to both of the plaintiff's Title VII claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   this 25th day of October, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    In addition to the filings previously identified, the Court considered the following submissions in reaching its decision: (1) the defendant's Memorandum of Points &amp; Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Def.'s Mem.\"); (2) the Defendant's Statement of Material Facts as to Which There Is No Genuine Issue (\"Def.'s Facts\"); (3) the Plaintiff's Opposition to Summary Judgment (\"Pl.'s Opp'n\"); (4) the Corrected Plaintiff's Local Rule 7(h)(1) Statement of Material Facts Showing Genuine Issues Necessary to Be Litigated (\"Pl.'s Facts\"); (5) the Plaintiff's Local Rule 7(h)(1) Response to Defendant's Statement of Material Facts to Which Defendant Claim[ ]s There Is No Genuine Issue (\"Pl.'s Resp.\"); (6) the Reply in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Def.'s Reply\"); (7) the Defendant's Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Oral Argument or for Leave to File a Sur-reply (\"Def.'s Opp'n\"); and (8) the Reply to Plaintiff's Motion for Oral Argument or, in the Alternative, for Leave to File a Sur-reply (\"Pl.'s Reply\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The plaintiff asserts that these allegedly disparaging comments are direct evidence of national origin discrimination.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n at 13. However, \"[t]he general rule is that 'stray remarks,'\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , comments that are not tied to the alleged adverse employment action, 'might be probative of discrimination, but are not sufficient as direct evidence of discrimination.' \"\n    <em>\n     Harris v.

Therefore, because the majority of these comments were purportedly made two or three years prior to the challenged adverse employment actions and thus are not tied to those actions, they cannot serve as direct evidence of discrimination. Furthermore, although Clark's purported comment that she would not have interviewed the plaintiff had it not been for the Architect's policy has some relationship to the adverse employment actions, it also is not direct evidence of discrimination. The Court so concludes primarily because, contrary to the plaintiff's interpretation of Clark's comment,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n at 14, Clark represented that what she actually said was that she would not have interviewed the plaintiff based on what she knew about his experience and r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and the skills she was looking for in a candidate such as \"hands-on network administration experience, the background in network infrastructure, the management of the IT team experience, and operating systems, server management, [and] systems management.\" Pl.'s Opp'n, Ex. 2 (Clark's Deposition Transcript) at 139-40. All of which have nothing to do with the plaintiff's national origin. In any event, Clark's comment does not \"show[ ] a discriminatory motive\n    <em>\n     on its face\n    </em>\n    \" or prove discrimination \"\n    <em>\n     without any need of an inference\n    </em>\n    .\"\n    <em>\n     Bhatnagar v.
