The Court allowed motions to sever Counts 1-3 and Count 9 from the remaining charges for purposes of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant pled guilty to Counts 1 and 2 on May 23, 2003 and Count 7 on February 12, 2004. Pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement dated September 20, 2003, the government agreed to dismiss Counts Four, Five, Six, Eight and Nine \"provided that Defendant is found to be a Career Offender and is sentenced as such\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the March 29, 2004 sentencing, the Court found that defendant qualified for the Career Offender enhancement under the Sentencing Guidelines.

Defendant was over eighteen at the time he committed the charged controlled substance offenses and he had two prior felony convictions that the Court determined were predicate offenses for the career offender designation. The two predicate offenses were both assault and battery convictions, one in Westborough District Court in 1997 and the second in Framingham District Court in 1998.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 271 months, followed by five years of supervised release. The Court noted that: 1) the base offense level of Counts 1 and 2 was 22 and no adjustments applied, 2) the base offense level for Count 7, taking into account defendant's designation as a career offender, was 32 and 3) the defendant was entitled to a three level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total offense level (\"TOL\") of 29. The Court determined that the defendant had 13 criminal history points, resulting in a criminal history category (\"CHC\") of VI. A TOL of 29 and a CHC of VI resulted in a guideline range of 151 to 188 months.

Roy contends that the distinction between the advisory and mandatory Guidelines is critical and that the Supreme Court recognized as much in its opinion. He stresses that while the advisory Guidelines are not subject to vagueness challenges, because they merely guide the court's exercise of discretion, the mandatory Guidelines do fix the permissible range of sentences, and are therefore subject to vagueness challenges under the rule announced in\n   <em>\n    Johnson II.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The government rejoins that the decision in\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   also applies to sentences imposed pre-\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   when the Sentencing Guidelines were mandatory. The government submits that the mandatory Guidelines did not \"fix\" minimum or maximum sentences because only Congress has the power to do so and it did not delegate that power to the Sentencing Commission. Furthermore, the government denies that courts lacked discretion under the mandatory Guidelines, pointing to a small number of \"exceptional\" cases where the Guidelines provided some authority to exceed the statutory maximum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The First Circuit recently addressed the issue of whether, post-\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   , the career offender provision of the Sentencing Guidelines is subject to vagueness challenges in pre-\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   cases.\n   <em>\n    Moore v.
