COLLYER, United States District Judge\n   Judicial Watch, Inc., a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, filed a Freedom of Information Act request seeking records from the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding any interviews of high-level Obama administration officials concerning Rod Blagojevich, the former governor of Illinois.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Unhappy with FBI's decision to withhold certain records, Judicial Watch has sued. The government now moves for summary judgment in its favor, arguing that it has met its FOIA obligations. Judicial Watch has also made a cross-motion for summary judgment in its favor. Upon review of the entire record, the Court agrees with the government; the Court will grant its motion and deny Judicial Watch's cross-motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Hardy (Hardy Decl.) Ex. A, Judicial Watch Freedom of Information Act Request (FOIA Request) [Dkt. 13-2] at 1. This request sought records related to any and all FBI interviews with Barack Obama, Rahm Emanuel, and Valerie Jarrett that concerned Rod Blagojevich.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Rod Blagojevich was criminally charged with multiple corruption-related crimes in 2008 after a federal investigation into his activities. Decl. of Debra Riggs Bonamici (Bonamici Decl.) [Dkt. 13-3] \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. After two trials, Mr. Blagojevich was convicted and appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. The Seventh Circuit ultimately affirmed his conviction,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

June 5, 2017). The parties briefed the instant motions while Mr. Blagojevich was continuing his appeal; the public record indicates that, at the time of this Memorandum Opinion's writing, the Supreme Court had most recently granted Mr. Blagojevich an extension of time to file a writ of certiorari to November 11, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice,\n   <em>\n    Blagojevich\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-3254, ECF No. 56 (7th Cir.

Hardy Decl. \u00b6 6. FBI RIDS employees searched FBI's Central Records System (CRS), a centralized records system encompassing the entire FBI organization, using the system's Automated Case Support (ACS), an electronic case management system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-18; 22. RIDS searched ACS using a phonetic breakdown of the name \"Rod Blagojevich\" and then used further keyword searches within those records using the names of the individuals named in the FOIA request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This search identified only three FD-302 forms, which are forms used to summarize \"important facts and statements made by a potential witness in the course\n   of an interview conducted by FBI Special Agents, sometimes in conjunction with federal prosecutors.\" Bonamici Decl. \u00b6 7. After concluding this search, FBI determined that all three FD-302s were exempt from disclosure because they were contained in a pending law enforcement investigative file, and informed Judicial Watch of this fact. Hardy Decl. \u00b6 23. The FBI also performed a review of the responsive material after Judicial Watch filed this lawsuit, which yielded no additional records.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus all records responsive to Judicial Watch's request were withheld as exempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Pa. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Here, the public record indicates that Rod Blagojevich still has an opportunity to contest his conviction by seeking review by the Supreme Court. Judicial Watch argues that this is insufficient to support withholding records under Exemption 7(A) because any Supreme Court review would be only of Mr. Blagojevich's resentencing, and because DOJ has failed to articulate how release of the FD-302s could reasonably be expected to interfere with what remains with Mr. Blagojevich's appeal. Pl.'s Opp'n at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   However, the fact remains that (1) the FD-302s are records contained in a law enforcement investigative file that (2) is currently being directly appealed. That appeal may be very short-lived, but it is not the Court's role to guess how or when Rod Blagojevich's appeal may be resolved. Until the appeal is fully exhausted, disclosure of investigative materials could be reasonably expected to interfere with whatever occurs going forward. Rod Blagojevich has not exhausted his options for appeal before the courts, and, until that time at least, the government is entitled to preserve the strategies, theories, and impressions found in its investigative files.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Because Rod Blagojevich was already convicted in a public trial, there is an additional concern that records otherwise exempt under Exemption 7(A) have passed into the public domain. \"Under our public-domain doctrine, materials normally immunized from disclosure under FOIA lose their protective cloak once disclosed and preserved in a permanent public record.\"\n   <em>\n    Cottone v.

Cir. 1999). Had DOJ sought to withhold its entire file, it may have been appropriate for it to detail which, if any, records had passed into the public domain as a result of the trial. However, in this instance, only three records are at issue, none of which is alleged to have been introduced as an exhibit, or otherwise passed into the public domain. The Court concludes therefore that DOJ has adequately\n   shown that the three FD-302s are exempt from disclosure under Exemption 7(A).\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    While the letter request is dated June 1, 2011, the parties agree that the request was actually made in May 2012.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s Statement of Facts (Pl.'s SOF) [Dkt. 16] \u00b6 1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Judicial Watch had previously filed a lawsuit,\n    <em>\n     Judicial Watch v.

The only records withheld were three FD-302s, interview memos prepared by FBI investigators when speaking to potential witnesses. Exemption 7(A) is meant to apply broadly to an agency's \"evidence and strategies, or the nature, scope, and focus of investigations,\" which can mean more than just simply the information contained therein.\n    <em>\n     Maydak\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674601,11197982\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/218/760/\">\n     218 F.3d at 762\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . No evidence casts doubt on DOJ's sworn statement, and the Court finds that it has satisfied its obligation to release all segregable factual information.
