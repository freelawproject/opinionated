KOELTL, District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case arises from a physical altercation between the plaintiff, Jessica Golian, a New York City public school teacher, and the mother of two of her students, Jennifer DeJesus. Golian reported to New York State child protection officials that DeJesus's children were possibly victims of child neglect after observing that the children had long-term difficulties at school. Although Golian requested that the child protection officials keep her identity confidential, DeJesus eventually learned that Golian was the person who filed the neglect report. DeJesus then allegedly assaulted Golian outside the school DeJesus's children attend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this action, Golian seeks relief pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , municipal liability, and related state law claims against the New York City Administration for Children Services (the \"ACS\"), the City of New York, and ACS attorney Jeremey Harper (collectively, the \"municipal defendants\"). Golian argues that the municipal defendants violated her Fourteenth Amendment right to substantive due process by wrongfully disclosing her identity to DeJesus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The municipal defendants have moved to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. That motion is\n   <strong>\n    granted\n   </strong>\n   . Golian's federal claims are\n   <strong>\n    dismissed with prejudice\n   </strong>\n   , and Golian's state law claims against the municipal defendants are\n   <strong>\n    dismissed without prejudice\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Golian also brings state law claims against DeJesus for the alleged physical assault. DeJesus has not appeared in this action. Nevertheless, a default judgment will not issue against her because the Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Golian's state law claims in light of the dismissal of her federal claims against the municipal defendants. Golian's claims against DeJesus are therefore\n   <strong>\n    dismissed without prejudice\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In deciding a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the allegations in the complaint are accepted as true, and all reasonable inferences must be drawn in the plaintiff's favor.\n   <em>\n    McCarthy v.

A defendant is entitled to qualified immunity in a \u00a7 1983 case \"if either (1) their conduct did not violate clearly established rights of which a reasonable person would have known, or (2) it was objectively reasonable to believe that their acts did not violate these clearly established rights.\"\n    <em>\n     Cornejo\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5687712\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/592/121/#p127\">\n     592 F.3d at 128\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Golian concedes that there is no case directly on point that establishes Harper violated her constitutional rights. Moreover, as explained below, the applicable due process case law is sufficiently unclear that the Court cannot conclude Golian's rights were clearly established, and the complaint does not set out an objectively unreasonable course of conduct by Harper. Therefore, Harper would be entitled to qualified immunity as an alternative to absolute prosecutorial immunity.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Golian asserts that New York's statutory scheme requiring teachers to report suspicions of child maltreatment creates a cognizable liberty interest.
