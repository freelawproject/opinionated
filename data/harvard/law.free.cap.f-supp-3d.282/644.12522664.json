Finally, when Knox asked JV's East Hampton store manager, Peter Ngo, about the clothing\n   allowance policy, Ngo mentioned that a former female sales associate had complained that female sales associates did not receive this allowance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Knox Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 8. Benjamin Harris, the Vice President of Retail at JV, stated in his declaration that the clothing allowance policy was in place when he began working at JV in June 2014 and has existed ever since.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Harris Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 5, 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   For its part, JV does not dispute this policy's existence.

In its memorandum in opposition to this motion, JV describes this policy as \"giving a credit to male sales professionals who, unlike female sales professionals, are required to wear expensive [JV] menswear when working.\" Def.

JV disagrees with Knox's characterization of this policy as an \"allowance\" insofar as that term implies that JV gives an additional sum of money to its male employees.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20206\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1 n.1.

In other words, Knox would seek to have the notice sent to former female sales associates whose employment with JV ended more than three years ago on the theory that one or more of these sales associates might qualify for equitable tolling were they to make the requisite showing once they joined the lawsuit. Under this scenario, notice would be sent to all current and former female sales associates who worked for JV during the three years prior to the filing of the lawsuit or the filing of this motion and the Court would determine later whether equitable tolling would be permitted for any of the employees who later join the lawsuit. Courts authorizing notice under this logic note that while they will not toll the statute of limitations before providing notice to potential opt-in plaintiffs, they will send out notice to the wider group of employees and permit \"challenges to the timeliness of individual plaintiffs' actions ... at a later date.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

Specifically, JV proposes informing employees that they may be required to \"appear for a deposition if requested, to produce documents and other tangible items in your possession, and to otherwise truthfully respond to discovery requests.\" Def. Proposed Notice at *5. Knox argues that this language is \"unnecessary and may unfairly discourage potential plaintiffs from inquiring about asserting their rights.\" Pl. Reply at 9.

We agree that opt-in plaintiffs should be fully informed about their potential responsibilities in joining a lawsuit.

Def. Proposed Notice at *6;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. at 10. This change is rejected. D&amp;S is participating in these proceedings and has not contested that it will be paid on contingency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Second, JV seeks to add language clarifying that the Court does not endorse D&amp;S and that \"D&amp;S's participation in this lawsuit and its mention in this notice should not be taken as any indication or guarantee of D&amp;S's experience or competence with respect to the matters at issue in this lawsuit.\" Def. Proposed Notice at *7;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. at 10. However, nothing in the proposed notice suggests that the Court endorses D&amp;S or holds D&amp;S out as experienced or competent counsel. To include language specifically disclaiming such an endorsement when none has been given implies that the Court believes D&amp;S may not be experienced or competent. It is sufficient for the notice to point out, as already proposed by Knox, that opt-in plaintiffs are free to secure their own legal representation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Proposed Notice. Because the notice is clear on this point, we also reject JV's proposal to inform opt-in plaintiffs that they are \"responsible\" for arranging their own representation and for negotiating fee agreements with their legal representatives. Def. Proposed Notice at *6;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Lastly, JV suggests that the notice should not direct potential opt-in plaintiffs to D&amp;S should they have questions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. at 10;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Def.

Proposed Notice at *7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Omitting this language is unnecessary and counterintuitive, as the entire point of sending notice is to enable qualified individuals to opt in to this lawsuit if they so choose, presumably by contacting plaintiff's counsel.
