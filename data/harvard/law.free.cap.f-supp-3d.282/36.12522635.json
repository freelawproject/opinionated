Those requests sought release of records relating to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of \"a non-'state.gov' email address\" and \"clintonemail.com email server.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 22-3 at 3, 21, 31. The State Department did not provide a\n   timely response to any of the three requests, prompting Judicial Watch to file this action on May 6, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1. Subsequently, the State Department conducted an extensive search, identified six responsive documents, released five of those documents to Judicial Watch with partial redactions, and withheld one in full.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 22-1 at 5-6; Dkt. 26 at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The parties have now cross-moved for summary judgment. Dkt. 22; Dkt. 26. Those motions raise three questions: First, did the State Department properly withhold the Report of Investigation (\"ROI\") for former State Department employee Bryan Pagliano? Second, is there any reasonably segregable, non-exempt information in the ROI that the State Department should have released to Judicial Watch? Third, did the State Department properly redact portions of an email chain between Secretary Clinton and General David Petraeus? For the reasons explained below, the Court concludes that the answer to the first two questions is \"yes,\" and that the answer to the third question is, in part, \"yes,\" and, in part, \"perhaps.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Accordingly, the Court will grant in part and deny in part the State Department's motion for summary judgment and will deny Judicial Watch's cross-motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Dkt. 22-4 at 1 (Def.'s SUMF \u00b6 1). The first, dated March 6, sought records relating to Secretary Clinton's \"use of a non-'state.gov' email address,\" including records \"concerning security, classification, preservation, and compliance with the Federal Records Act and/or [FOIA].\" Dkt. 22-3 at 3. Judicial Watch's second request, dated March 9, sought \"communications between officials\" at the State Department and White House concerning Secretary Clinton's \"use of non-'state.gov' email addresses.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Dkt. 11 at 2. The parties agreed that the State Department would complete its review and production of the records by January 20, 2016,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and, by that date, the Department produced three documents to Judicial Watch, Dkt. 22-4 at 2 (Def.'s SUMF \u00b6 7). It also informed Judicial Watch that it was withholding a fourth document in full-an ROI created as part of the background investigation into Bryan Pagliano, which was prepared in the course of considering his appointment to a \"Schedule C\" position at the Department. Dkt. 26-1 at 12-13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 22-4 at 2 (Def.'s SUMF \u00b6 8). Prior to his appointment, Pagliano \"ran technology for the Clinton for President campaign,\" Dkt. 26-1 at 13, and, while at the State Department, he served as an \"IT specialist\" to Secretary Clinton, Dkt. 26 at 21 (Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In mid-2016, the parties each moved for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 17; Dkt. 18. Among other issues, that original round of briefing raised the question whether the State Department had conducted an adequate search for responsive records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 18 at 5-6. On July 12, 2016, however, the FBI informed the State Department that it had \"obtained certain information that may include [State Department] agency records\" and indicated that it would \"provid[e] this information to [the Department] for review\" and \"subsequent FOIA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   processing as appropriate.\" Dkt. 22-3 at 44. \"The FBI transferred such information to [the] State [Department]\" in July and August 2016, and the Department \"agreed to conduct searches of the information being transferred\" for \"records responsive to [two of] [Judicial Watch's] FOIA requests.\" Dkt. 22-2 at 24-25 (Second Stein Decl. \u00b6 64). After reviewing the newly acquired documents, the State Department released two additional documents to Judicial Watch, including an email exchange between Secretary Clinton and General David Petraeus. Dkt. 22-4 at 2 (Def.'s SUMF \u00b6 11). That email exchange involved a staffing issue and a recommendation regarding dealing with a foreign leader. Dkt. 22-1 at 18. Because Judicial Watch \"indicated that it wishe[d]\" to add \"challenge[s] [to] the redactions applied\" to the email exchange and to \"the adequacy of [State's] supplemental search\" to its initial set of challenges, the parties \"propose[d] that the Court deny the pending cross-motions for summary judgment as moot\" and set a new schedule for summary judgment briefing that would \"encompass all of the matters ... currently at issue\" in the litigation. Dkt. 21 at 1. The Court accepted the parties' proposal,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Minute Order (Oct. 28, 2016), and the parties subsequently filed the cross-motions for summary judgment that are currently before the Court,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 22; Dkt. 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

An ROI, Stein further attests, is \"an investigative document utilized by law enforcement and personnel adjudication entities within DS for the purpose of investigating the private background of an individual for security clearance related purposes and/or adjudication of suitability for a sensitive position within the U.S. Government.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29 (Second Stein Decl. \u00b6 77).

Pagliano's ROI was produced after a \"security clearance investigation\" that \"require[d] an intensely personal set of inquiries into [his] life,\" including an examination of his \"psychological conditions, alcohol consumption, [and] sexual behavior.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32-33 (Second Stein Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 85-86). As a result, his ROI contained \"personal information\" pertaining to his \"relationships, character assessments, financial details, and medical information,\" as well as information pertaining to third parties interviewed by the State Department during the investigation. Dkt. 22-2 at 33 (Second Stein Decl. \u00b6 87). The Supreme Court has \"held 'as a categorical matter' that 'a third party's request for law enforcement records or information about a private citizen can reasonably be expected to invade that citizen's privacy,\"\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828067,3767796\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/1/\">\n    655 F.3d at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Reporters Comm.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12033433\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/749/#p776\">\n    489 U.S. at 780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12033433\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/749/#p776\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and it is difficult to contemplate an agency record with a more pronounced privacy interest than an ROI produced as part of a comprehensive background check that analyzes the subject's \"psychological conditions,\n   alcohol consumption, [and] sexual behavior.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Qui\u00f1on v.

Records that \"reveal[ ] little or nothing about an agency's own conduct\" do not further the public interest embraced by Exemption 7(C); rather, it is \"information that sheds light on an agency's performance of its statutory duties [that] falls squarely within th[e] statutory purpose\" of the exemption.\n   <em>\n    Reporters Comm.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12033433\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/749/#p776\">\n    489 U.S. at 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12033433\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/749/#p776\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Judicial Watch, however, has offered little basis for the Court to conclude that \"the public interest sought to be advanced is a significant one, [that it is] an interest more specific than having the information for its own sake\" and that the requested disclosure \"is likely to advance that interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Archives and Records Admin. v.

Instead, it merely asserts that the \"public interest in knowing more about the ... employee [who] ... maintained and serviced the private email server system is enormous,\" Dkt. 26 at 12, and it claims that the \"[r]elease of Pagliano's ROI will reveal much about [the] State Department's conduct in performing its investigative obligation in providing Pagliano's security clearance,\" Dkt. 29 at 2, and \"may shed further light on the truth of the Clinton email arrangement,\" Dkt. 26 at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   After balancing these competing interests, the Court concludes that the scale tips in favor of the State Department's decision to withhold Pagliano's ROI. First, Judicial Watch offers no reason to believe-other than its bare speculation-that the ROI might shed light on Secretary Clinton's use of the \"clintonemail.com server\" or \"non-'state.gov' \" email address.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Favish\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5929642\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/157/#p172\">\n    541 U.S. at 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5929642\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/157/#p172\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that \"where there is a privacy interest protected by Exemption 7(C) and the public interest being asserted is to show that responsible officials acted ... improperly in the performance of their duties, the requester must establish more than a bare suspicion in order to obtain disclosure\"). Second, whatever public interest there might be in learning intimate\n   <em>\n    personal\n   </em>\n   details about a State Department employee tasked with a high-profile position, that interest is not the type contemplated by Exemption 7(C). The information collected during Pagliano's background check and summarized in the ROI-details about his personal relationships, mental and physical health, and financial history-provides minimal, if any, insight about how State conducts its business. Third, the fact that the State Department placed great \"trust and confidence\" in Pagliano does nothing to distinguish him from thousands of other government employees and members of the military who perform sensitive duties of enormous national importance and who-like Pagliano-have substantial privacy interests in the information contained in their background checks and ROIs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court, therefore, concludes that State properly withheld Pagliano's ROI on the basis of Exemption 7(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Exemption 7(E)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The State Department also invokes FOIA Exemption 7(E) to protect Pagliano's ROI. Like Exemption 7(C), this exemption requires a two-step inquiry. The first step, moreover, is the same under both provisions-that is, the Court must determine whether the records were compiled for law enforcement purposes. Because the Court has just resolved that question for purposes of Exemption 7(C), it need not repeat that analysis here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The second step requires additional discussion, but is equally straightforward. The Court must determine whether release of those records \"would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7)(E). As the D.C. Circuit has observed, there is some disagreement about whether the final clause, which asks whether the disclosure would pose a \"risk of circumvention of the law,\" applies only to the disclosure of \"guidelines\" or whether it also applies to the disclosure of \"techniques and procedures.\"\n   <em>\n    PEER\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323632,3826164\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/740/195/\">\n    740 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   204 n.4. But, as the Court of Appeals has also observed, \"given the low bar posed by the 'risk of circumvention of law' requirement, it is not clear that the difference matters much in practice.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323632,3826164\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/740/195/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Treating the \"risk of circumvention of law\" requirement as applicable to the disclosure of \"techniques and procedures,\" as the D.C.

Cir. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \"It is self-evident that information revealing security clearance procedures could render those procedures vulnerable and weaken their effectiveness at uncovering background information on potential candidates.\"\n   <em>\n    Morley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566353,6046285\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/508/1108/\">\n    508 F.3d at 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Yet, that is precisely the type of information that Stein has attested would be disclosed if the Pagliano ROI were released. He asserts, for example, that \"[t]he ROI contains information demonstrating specific techniques and procedures used by DS personnel while conducting background investigations, including methods for verifying information and cooperating with other law enforcement bodies.\" Dkt. 22-2 at 34 (Second Stein Decl. \u00b6 90). That assertion comports with common sense. Knowing what information DS personnel consider, where they look, and how they evaluate that information necessarily reveals their techniques and procedures, and disclosing that information poses \"a chance of a reasonably expected risk\" of circumvention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court, accordingly, concludes that the State Department's reliance on Exemption 7(E) was also justified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Segregability\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court must also consider whether the State Department has met its burden of demonstrating that there was no reasonably segregable, non-exempt information contained in the ROI that it could release in response to Judicial Watch's\n   FOIA request. FOIA provides that \"[a]ny reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). \"While the segregability requirement applies to all documents and all exemptions in the FOIA,\" the courts have recognized that \"segregation is not required where the 'exempt and nonexempt information are inextricably intertwined, such that the excision of exempt information would impose significant costs on the agency and produce an edited document with little informational value.' \"\n   <em>\n    Covington v.

Stein also explains that, \"[b]ecause the nature of an ROI for an SSBI is to inquire into the most intimate aspects of an individual's life[,] ... the entire ROI involves privacy-sensitive material.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3531381,902110\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/566/242/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Second Stein Decl. \u00b6 91).

And, it is difficult to imagine how the State Department could disclose portions of the ROI without revealing its underlying law enforcement techniques and procedures-the fact that even a seemingly innocuous detail appears in the report conveys something about what the Department believes is significant or might lead to other relevant information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For its part, Judicial Watch does not meaningfully contest the adequacy or accuracy of State's segregability analysis. Rather, in a conclusory fashion, it states that \"[t]here are certainly facts that could be released without invading ...

First, the Court notes that, although the email chain straddles the time before and after Secretary Clinton's appointment, the Department relies on Exemption 5 to protect only communications following her appointment. As a result, the Court is not confronted with the question whether the deliberative process privilege applies to those engaged in the transition between administrations or to nominees who are preparing to take on the duties of government.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wolfe v.

To the contrary, the exchange was between the Commander of the U.S. Central Command and the U.S. Secretary of State, and it involved \"suggested actions to be taken toward a particular foreign head of state\" and \"potential personnel appointments in the Department\" of State. Dkt. 22-2 at 31 (Second Stein Decl. \u00b6 82). That description represents precisely the type of predecisional \"agency[ ] group thinking\" meant to \"work[ ] out\" State's policy as to two of its key responsibilities-staffing itself and interacting with foreign dignitaries.\n   <em>\n    Elec.

General Petraeus, for example, \"[s]trongly recommend[s]\" that she take some action. Dkt. 26-1 at 6. The Court, accordingly, has no reason to doubt Stein's representation that these exchanges between senior government officials about foreign affairs and appointments fall well within the scope of the deliberative process privilege and are thus protected by Exemption 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court, therefore, concludes that State properly redacted the email exchange pursuant to Exemption 5's deliberative process privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Exemption 6\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \"Exemption 6 protects information about individuals in 'personnel and medical files and similar files' when its disclosure 'would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.' \"\n   <em>\n    Shapiro v.

A number of additional redactions, moreover, were covered by both Exemptions 5 and 6, and because the Court has already concluded that the Department has appropriately invoked Exemption 5, the Court need not consider whether Exemption 6 also applies to those redactions. This, then, leaves only two redactions. The first is contained in a January 14, 2009, email from General Petraeus to Secretary Clinton. In redacted form, that email says: \"P.S. Any feedback on possibility of keeping [redacted] until his replacement is confirmed? As you recall this was a personal request from [redacted]. Best-Dave.\" Dkt. 26-1 at 7. And the second, again sent from General Petraeus to Secretary Clinton states: \"Thx for making it happen [redacted].

To do so, the Court \"must first determine whether ... disclosure would compromise a substantial, as opposed to a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   , privacy interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Ass'n of Retired Fed.

In its opening brief, the State Department merely asserts that \"[r]elease of this information could subject these individuals to unwanted attention and harassing inquiries,\" Dkt. 22-1 at 19-20, and, in its reply brief, it simply adds that \"Plaintiff provides no argument as to why the release of the names of personnel suggested for appointment under a different administration, more than eight years ago, would be of any public interest today,\" Dkt. 28 at 14. The analysis offered by Judicial Watch, for its part, is equally brief and conclusory. It merely asserts that \"identification of any third party discussed as [the] subject of a personal favor between high-ranking friends in the email exchange at issue does not constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy for purposes of FOIA.\" Dkt. 26 at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Based on this minimal record, the Court is unable to determine whether Exemption 6 covers the two redactions. It is certainly an overstatement, on the one hand, to claim that the identity of those considered\n   for appointment to public office-even eight years ago-is of no public interest. Yet, on the other hand, it is equally possible that the specific appointment discussed in the email exchange is, in fact, of no public interest. Nor can the Court assess the relevant privacy interests on the present record. Again, it is easy to imagine a set of facts that might implicate substantial privacy concerns, and it is equally easy to image a scenario under which a reasonable person would not care about a disclosure-and, indeed, might even welcome it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Court, accordingly, concludes that it cannot grant summary judgment in favor of either party on this issue on the present record. In order to expedite resolution of this one remaining issue, the Court will direct that the Department file a supplemental declaration addressing the specific privacy interests at stake and that it provide the Court with unredacted copies of General Petraeus's emails to Secretary Clinton dated January 10, 2009, and January 14, 2009, for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   inspection. The Court will then permit the parties to renew their respective motions for summary judgment on this one issue. Because Judicial Watch does not object to the remaining redactions based solely on Exemption 6, which simply obscured General Petraeus's email address, the Court will grant summary judgment in favor of the State Department on that issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   For the reasons explained above, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   in part and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   in part State's motion for summary judgment, Dkt. 22, and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Judicial Watch's cross-motion for summary judgment, Dkt. 26.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    The State Department also invokes FOIA Exemption 6 to justify withholding the ROI in full, but because the Court sustains the Department's action under Exemption 7, it need not consider whether this additional exemption is also available.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Roth v.
