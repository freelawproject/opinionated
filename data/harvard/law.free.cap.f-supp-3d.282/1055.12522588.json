RELEVANT FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The facts as pleaded can be briefly summarized. Harley-Davidson is, of course, a world-famous motorcycle manufacturer, and its word trademarks and logos are well known. Harley-Davidson prints those logos and marks on merchandise it sells alongside its automotive products. Those logos and word marks have appeared on goods sold on SunFrog's website, including clothing and other items. These are counterfeits, as none of them is sponsored by or affiliated with Harley-Davidson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Users of SunFrog's website create and sell these counterfeit goods either by uploading their own designs featuring Harley-Davidson's marks and logos onto blank versions of the goods in question (supplied by SunFrog), or by selecting an infringing design created by another user which is stored in the SunFrog art database. SunFrog users are largely anonymous, as they are identified on the website only by self-made account names or numerical codes that do not reveal the user's identity. Once a buyer actually purchases one of the user's infringing designs, SunFrog prints the item using an automated printer and then ships it. SunFrog also keeps the majority of the profit from the sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   SunFrog advertises these products on the Internet and through social media outlets. Further, it encourages users to track sales using its sales-tracking tools and to advertise their goods on social media. SunFrog persists in promoting and selling these goods despite receiving numerous takedown requests and other notifications from Harley-Davidson that infringement is occurring. Indeed, \"[f]rom at least as early as October 2016 to the present, H-D has submitted more than 70 complaints to SunFrog that: (a) notified SunFrog of H-D's rights in the H-D Marks, and (b) reported and objected to more than 800 Infringing Products that have been advertised, promoted, offered, and/or sold on SunFrog's Website in violation of H-D's rights.\" (Docket # 1 \u00b6 68). Moreover, even when SunFrog would try to control infringement by users, its attempts were halfhearted: it would take a long time for infringing designs to be taken down in response to requests for the same, those same designs would crop up again soon after because there was no system in place to curb infringement at the design stage, and repeat infringers would pop up again and again with few or no repercussions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Harley-Davidson claims that \"SunFrog is thus not a passive participant in the business conducted by sellers on and through SunFrog's Website.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64. According to Harley-Davidson, \"[t]his is not a situation where SunFrog's only role is to\n   provide sellers with access to an online marketplace to sell their products and everything is done by the sellers. Rather, SunFrog is an active partner of the sellers and directly involved in the sellers' business in many ways, all for SunFrog's financial gain[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The complaint recites claims for: (1) trademark counterfeiting under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) ; (2) trademark infringement under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) ; (3) trademark infringement, false designation of origin, and unfair competition under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A) ; (4) trademark dilution under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ; (5) copyright infringement under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; (6) trademark infringement under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20132\">\n    Wis.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   SunFrog does not contest that its users' conduct constitutes infringement of Harley-Davidson's intellectual property rights. Rather, its motion focuses on why it should not be responsible for this rampant infringement. First, says SunFrog, it does not itself create infringing designs. (Docket # 28 at 6). Second, it cannot be expected to review the millions of designs presently on its website and the thousands more added each day.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Third, it has made efforts to curb infringement, including requiring users to check a box stating that they are not violating the intellectual property rights of others when they submit a design.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   SunFrog claims that it will terminate users who renege on this promise.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further, SunFrog claims that in light of its explosive growth and the concerns over potential infringement, it is all the time developing and refining tools that can be used to search its database for infringing goods and remove them, including responding to takedown notices, permitting rights holders like Harley-Davidson to directly search its design databases to identify problematic offerings, and diverting profits from infringing goods to the rights holders.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20132\">\n    at 6-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   SunFrog raises four grounds for dismissal, none of which has merit. First, it claims that Harley-Davidson has not alleged facts that plausibly support their seven claims for relief.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20132\">\n    at 7-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The problem with the argument, however, is that SunFrog does no more than state this conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20132\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   SunFrog cites a host of cases about the plausibility pleading regime and its application in intellectual property cases, but omits the critical link between those legal principles and any of the facts alleged in the complaint. Why does SunFrog think that Harley-Davidson's complaint-which is lengthy, detailed, and specific-is so conclusory as to be worthy of dismissal? It does not say. To the extent that SunFrog believes that the burden here shifted to Harley-Davidson once it invoked the word \"plausibility,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   (Docket # 37 at 4), it is mistaken,\n   <em>\n    Yeksigian v.

As the Court observed in its ruling on Harley-Davidson's motion for preliminary injunction, SunFrog cites no case that colorably supports its position.\n   <em>\n    H-D U.S.A., LLC v.

Wis. July 31, 2017). Instead, SunFrog directs the Court to one 20-year-old case in which Harley-Davidson chose not to sue a printer of infringing goods and implies that such a claim must not be available under the Lanham Act. (Docket # 28 at 8-9) (citing\n   <em>\n    Harley-Davidson, Inc. v. Selectra Int'l Designs, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3889920\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/855/275/#p278\">\n    855 F.Supp. 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 278 (E.D. Wis. 1994) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As it explained in its earlier decision, the Court is not convinced, and the reason for this is related to another of SunFrog's arguments: that it cannot be liable for monetary damages because it is an \"innocent infringer\" as provided in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A). (Docket # 28 at 11-13). That Section provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Where an infringer or violator is engaged solely in the business of printing the mark or violating matter for others and establishes that he or she was an innocent infringer or innocent violator, the owner of the right infringed or person bringing the action under\n   section 1125(a) of this title shall be entitled as against such infringer or violator only to an injunction against future printing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A). Section 1114(2)(A) contemplates that injunctive relief is available to prevent future printing of infringing goods, meaning that Congress intended that an infringement action could lie directly against a printer. Indeed, because this provision supplies a defense to monetary damages only, the unavoidable conclusion is that even an innocent printer of infringing goods may be liable for infringement and can be enjoined from future infringement.\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Bus.

Cal. Mar. 25, 2008). In this case, Harley-Davidson has alleged that SunFrog uses its marks in commerce by publishing them on its website and in advertising and by printing the marks on goods and shipping them. (Docket # 34 at 9). No more is required at this juncture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This conclusion dovetails into SunFrog's argument that it should be protected from monetary damages on the trademark claims as an innocent infringer. (Docket # 28 at 11-13). Here, SunFrog's point seems to be that because its automated printers print goods at users' requests, without any involvement from SunFrog employees directly, it is not aware of infringement until such activity is brought to its attention later.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This argument flies in the face of the facts alleged. Harley-Davidson has asserted that SunFrog knows that its users infringe others' intellectual property rights, that it promotes this infringement throughout Internet advertising, that it facilitates the infringement by printing and shipping the goods, and that it does this to generate profit from the sales. It thus appears that SunFrog does far more than a mere on-demand printer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    K &amp; N Eng'g, Inc. v. Bulat\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=259%20Fed.%20Appx.%20994\">\n    259 Fed.Appx. 994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 995 (9th Cir. 2007) (because the defendants advertised and sold infringing goods rather than advertising and selling printing services, \"they were not engaged solely in the business of printing the mark or violating matter for others, and thus were [not] innocent infringers\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Drawing inferences from the facts in Harley-Davidson's favor, it is easily said that whatever the size or scope of SunFrog's business, it can be charged with knowing what goods come off of printers that it owns and operates. If the statute's reference to \"innocence\" means, as SunFrog contends, that only knowing or reckless infringement is actionable, Harley-Davidson's allegations suffice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    World Wrestling Fed'n, Inc. v.

Ill. Sept. 26, 2000).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   At a minimum, failing to police one's own manufacturing process can be viewed as reckless disregard for whether infringement is occurring.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2000%20WL%201409831\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Put differently, SunFrog equates itself with a vending machine, producing products\n   at a customer's order without oversight. (Docket # 28 at 13). But the point of this case is that SunFrog in fact operates like a self-aware vending machine, with the ongoing ability to monitor the products its users order (and that it creates) and to know that those products are infringing.

As the Seventh Circuit has explained, a plaintiff need not anticipate defenses at all; indeed, \"[o]nly when the plaintiff pleads itself out of court-that is, admits all the ingredients of an impenetrable defense-may a complaint that otherwise states a claim be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6).\"\n   <em>\n    Xechem, Inc. v.

Indeed, Harley-Davidson's allegations, liberally construed as required by the standard of review, refute each element of that defense. On the face of Harley-Davidson's complaint, it appears that SunFrog actually knows that its users create and that it prints and sells infringing\n   material. SunFrog continues to permit this to occur because it is profitable. Further, SunFrog drags its feet in responding to takedown notices, and its takedown efforts have little lasting effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, and perhaps most importantly, SunFrog has the ability to control the infringing activity. Because SunFrog indisputably receives a direct financial benefit from that activity, it must demonstrate that it does not have the right or ability to control the infringing activity to fall within the safe harbor.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20512\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2).

The evidence also shows that eBay never has possession of, or opportunity to inspect, such items because such items are only in the possession of the seller. When auctions end, eBay's system automatically sends an email to the high bidder and the seller identifying each other as such. After that, all arrangements to consummate the transaction are made directly between the buyer and seller. eBay has no involvement in the final exchange and generally has no knowledge whether a sale is actually completed (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   whether payment exchanges hands and the goods are delivered). If an item is sold, it passes directly from the seller to the buyer without eBay's involvement. eBay makes money through the collection of an \"insertion fee\" for each listing and a \"final value fee\" based on a percentage of the highest bid amount at the end of the auction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9480144\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/165/1082/#p1094\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   SunFrog's business model is quite unlike eBay's: SunFrog promotes infringing designs created by its users, it has possession of and an opportunity to inspect the goods it prints before shipment, and it knows that purchases of infringing goods are consummated because it actually prints and ships the goods to the buyer. In contrast to eBay, SunFrog is intimately-indeed indispensably-involved in transactions involving infringing goods. Regardless of the ease of doing so, then, SunFrog has \"some ability to limit or filter copyrighted material.\" (Docket # 28 at 11) (citing\n   <em>\n    MGM, Inc. v.

There, eBay claimed it never saw or inspected allegedly infringing goods offered for sale through its online marketplace, nor could it know whether certain goods offered were actual counterfeits rather than merely resales.\n    <em>\n     Tiffany\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223051\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/600/93/#p102\">\n     600 F.3d at 102\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Here, however, SunFrog operates the very printers that print infringing goods, and it does not appear to offer resale of goods. Its claim to innocence is far more tenuous than eBay's.
