BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 15, 2016, the Institute sent a FOIA request by letter to the Department's Tax Division (the \"Division\"), \"seeking production of two specific records relating to the detailing of [Department] attorneys to the White House.\" Compl. \u00b6 6.

On September 20, 2016, the Division issued its final decision regarding the Institute's July 15, 2016 FOIA request as clarified, producing in its entirety the November 2011 report, without any redactions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Facts \u00b6 7; Pl.'s Facts \u00b6 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the Division subdivided the Bringer-Wolfinger email chain into nine separate records and redacted \"Record 7\" on the basis of Exemptions 3 and 5 of the FOIA and the remaining records as non-responsive.

Later, on January 18, 2017, the Division re-processed the Bringer-Wolfinger email chain and re-produced the record to the Institute \"as a single record,\" withdrawing all of the \"non-responsive\" redactions, but \"redact[ing] significant portions of responsive material\" pursuant to FOIA exemptions 3, 5, 6, 7(A), and 7(C). Pl.'s Facts \u00b6 11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Facts \u00b6\u00b6 9-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Department now moves for summary judgment, asserting that its redactions of the re-processed and re-produced Bringer-Wolfinger email chain were proper, as those contents were exempt from disclosure under several FOIA exemptions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 3. And, given that the Department re-produced the Bringer-Wolfinger email chain as one record, and\n   because the Department asserts that withholding portions of the Bringer-Wolfinger email chain is proper pursuant to specific FOIA exemptions and not because they are \"non-responsive,\" the Department contends that the issue of \"whether the email chain constitutes one record or several records\" is now \"moot.\" Def.'s Mot. at 15. On February 8, 2017, the Institute simultaneously opposed the Department's motion and cross-moved for summary judgment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Summ. J. Mot. at 1, arguing that \"its claim against the [Department] for using 'non-responsive' as a redaction tool and improperly segmenting one record into multiple records is not moot,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Institute, however, did not oppose the Department's motion \"as to its application of exemptions and redactions in the January 18, 2017 production\" of the re-processed Bringer-Wolfinger email chain.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In response, the Department maintains its position that this case is now moot,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply at 1, and argues that the Institute now effectively seeks a broad \"sweeping [advisory] decision\" on the definition of a \"record\" as used in the Department's Guidance predicated on \"new and wholly unsupported allegations regarding the [Department's] recordkeeping practices,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"These allegations were not contained in the Complaint-let alone alleged with particularly, as required for a FOIA [policy-or-]practice claim.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 24, 2017, \"to resolve any dispute or ambiguity about whether [the] Institute[ ] ... has [ ] properly pled [an explicit policy-or-practice claim], [the] Institute move[d] the Court for leave to allow it to amend its complaint.\" Pl.'s Mot. at 3.

While it may be true that the Institute's proposed policy-or-practice claim relates to the same FOIA request, it does so only tangentially, as the Institute's Complaint is entirely predicated on the improper withholding of responsive records through the designation of those records as \"non-responsive.\"\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl.
