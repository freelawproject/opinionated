(\"RPM\") and RPM's General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer, Edward W. Moore (\"Moore\"). Compl. [Dkt. # 1] \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3 8-9, 85-105. The SEC alleges that defendants fraudulently failed to disclose loss contingencies in RPM's SEC filings at a time when they were aware that a\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   action had been filed against RPM under the False Claims Act, and that the Department of Justice was conducting an investigation to determine whether it would intervene, and even after settlement negotiations between RPM and DOJ were underway.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 17.

Notice of Def. RPM International Inc.'s Mot. to Dismiss [Dkt. # 30] (\"RPM Mot.\"). It argues that the SEC failed to state a claim that the company's financial statements were \"false\" because accounting rules do not \"require a company to disclose preliminary settlement offers and because the [c]omplaint does not allege that RPM did not subjectively believe in its accounting treatment.\" Mem. of P. &amp; A. in Supp. of RPM Mot. [Dkt. # 30] (\"RPM Mem\") at 2, 4. RPM also contends that Claims 1, 2, and 3 should be dismissed for the independent reason that the complaint fails to plausibly allege that the alleged misstatements were material, and it maintains that Claims 1 and 2 should be dismissed with respect to\n   statements made after October 2012 because the SEC has failed to allege the facts necessary to prove that RPM violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant Moore has also filed a motion to dismiss the claims against him pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 9(b) and 12(b)(6).

Moore argues that the facts in the complaint \"fail to establish that the relevant accounting rules required accrual for or disclosure of potential loss associated with the government investigation prior to the date on which RPM did accrue and disclose it,\" and that, with regard to Claim 1, the SEC has failed to adequately plead that Moore \"obtained money or property as a result of RPM's alleged failure to accrue or disclose earlier than it did.\" Moore Mem. at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The SEC opposed both motions in a consolidated brief on March 24, 2017, SEC's Opp. to Defs.'

Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the SEC, as it is required to do at this stage, the Court finds that the SEC has alleged sufficient facts, with the necessary particularity, to state plausible fraud claims against RPM and Moore, and the case will proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   RPM is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Medina, Ohio that \"manufactures and sells various chemical product lines, including paints, protective coatings, roofing systems, sealants, and adhesives.\" Compl. \u00b6 14.

Since the government claim was \"unasserted,\" Moore argues that ASC 450-20-50-6 required the SEC to allege that it was probable that a claim would be asserted, and that there was a reasonable possibility that an outcome of an asserted claim would be unfavorable, and that in the absence of those allegations, the complaint does not allege the existence of a duty to disclose.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20210.4-01\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The SEC takes the position that a claim had indeed been asserted against RPM since a private\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   complaint alleging a violation of the FCA had been filed against RPM in federal court.

Moreover, it argues that even if the original complaint did not qualify as an \"asserted\" claim because the United States had not yet intervened, the higher probability standard for an \"unasserted\" claim would not apply because DOJ had at least \"manifested ... an awareness of a possible claim,\" which would preclude the application of ASC 450-20-50-6.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20210.4-01\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , quoting ASC 450-20-50-6.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-22, 28. And, even if a claim on the part of the United States was as yet \"unasserted,\" the ASC 450 guidelines surrounding disclosure would apply because DOJ had certainly \"manifested\" an \"awareness of a possible claim\" by issuing subpoenas and engaging in communications with RPM and RPM's counsel related to the amount of the overpayments.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18, 30, 33, 48, 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   ASC 450 does not provide any guidance as to what it means to \"manifest\" an \"awareness of a possible claim.\" Moore heavily relies on\n   <em>\n    In re Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.

Further, the court concluded that the \"reasonable possibility\" standard of FAS 5 applied since the \"[c]ity had manifested an awareness of a possible, sizeable claim against\" the defendant where, among other things, the city had already filed a criminal fraud complaint against company principals that \"alluded to\" the company's improper conduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4250274\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/818/85/#p93\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Therefore, applying ASC 450, to state a claim that defendants had an obligation to disclose the DOJ investigation, the SEC must have alleged that there was a \"reasonable possibility\" that a loss could occur. And it has done so. According to the complaint, defendants \"knew or should have known\" that it was \"reasonably possible ... that RPM would incur a material loss in connection with the DOJ investigation,\" based on the fact that they knew about the\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   action, the company had already estimated that Tremco overcharged the government by at least $11.4 million, and RPM's counsel had been in communication with the DOJ about this figure. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 28, 30-31, 33, 37. These facts give rise to the plausible allegation that it was \"reasonably possible\" at the time of the October 2012 filings that RPM could have suffered a loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   RPM contends that it did not have an obligation to disclose or accrue for the DOJ investigation under ASC 450 because the guidelines do not require the disclosure\n   of contemplated or exchanged settlement offers. RPM Mem. at 22-23. But this argument is beside the point. Nowhere in SEC's complaint does it allege that RPM's filings were false and misleading because the company did not disclose its actual settlement offer or settlement discussions with DOJ. Rather, Claim 1 alleges that RPM had a duty to disclose the DOJ investigation as a loss contingency based on the information it knew prior to April 2013. And one piece of that puzzle was the contemplated settlement offer, which ASC 450 recognizes as one factor a company may consider in determining if disclosure or accrual is necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ASC at 450-20-55-12;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4250274\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/818/85/#p93\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 450-22-55-18;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4250274\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/818/85/#p93\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 45-22-55-36; Pl.'s Opp. at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Turning to whether accrual was necessary, Moore maintains that the company had no duty to accrue a loss in the October 2012 filings because a loss was not \"probable\" at this time since the government had not indicated if it planned to intervene in the\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   action. Moore Mem. at 18-19. Further, he argues that the SEC does not allege, as he insists it must, that Moore knew then that RPM was likely either to settle or lose at trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. But the SEC's allegations are sufficient at this stage to survive a motion to dismiss. The SEC claims that defendants \"knew or should have known\" that it was \"probable and reasonably estimable [ ] that RPM would incur a material loss in connection with the DOJ investigation,\" because they were aware of the\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   complaint, had already calculated $11.4 million worth of liability to the government, and had begun discussing settlement options with DOJ. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 28, 30 31, 33, 37. This information supports a plausible inference that it was probable that a loss would occur, and that the loss could be reasonably estimated to be at least $11 million. Therefore, the SEC has adequately alleged that defendants violated ASC 450 by failing to disclose and accrue for a loss contingency in RPM's three October 2012 filings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The SEC has alleged that defendants had a duty to disclose and accrue for the DOJ investigation in RPM's January 2013 filings.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Given the additional facts that had come to light by the time RPM made its filings on January 8, 2013, the Court also finds that the SEC has sufficiently alleged that defendants had a duty to disclose and accrue for the DOJ investigation in the January 2013 filings, and therefore adequately alleged that defendants violated ASC 450 at that time as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Building on the facts alleged in connection with the October 2012 filings, the complaint goes on to allege that RPM learned in November 2012 that DOJ expected any settlement offer to be reached by mid-January, and that by mid-December 2012, RPM told DOJ that it would submit a settlement offer by January 11, 2013. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 46, 49. Further, on December 21, 2012, RPM representatives, including Moore, discussed the components of the planned settlement offer, which they had calculated at $27-28 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50. RPM ultimately submitted a 44-page settlement proposal to the DOJ for $28.3 million on January 11, 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Based on these additional facts and the allegations of what transpired before October 2012, the SEC has alleged that as of January 8, 2013, it was reasonably possible that a loss would occur and that therefore RPM was obligated to disclose the DOJ investigation. And, it has sufficiently alleged that as of that date, the loss was probable, since RPM was in the process of preparing a settlement agreement involving a more than $20 million payment, and it had already promised to deliver it to DOJ by January 11, 2013. These facts, coupled with the fact that RPM delivered a\n   lengthy settlement proposal to DOJ three days after the filings, give rise to a plausible inference that by January 8, RPM and Moore knew that it was probable that it would settle with DOJ and suffer a loss. Further, the loss could be reasonably estimated since RPM had estimated its potential liability at $28.3 million and included that term in its settlement offer. Therefore, the agency has adequately alleged that defendants violated ASC 450 by failing to disclose and accrue for the loss contingency in its January 8, 2013 filings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

A \"reasonable\" degree of assurance is one that \"would satisfy prudent officials in the conduct of their own affairs.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78m(b)(7). Some examples of internal controls include \"manual or automated review of records to check for completeness, accuracy and authenticity; a method to record transactions completely and accurately; and reconciliation of accounting entries to detect errors.\"\n   <em>\n    McConville v.

RPM's Mem. at 35. The Court has already determined that the SEC has plausibly alleged that RPM's statements were false and misleading.

Moore Mem. at 35. However, given the Court's conclusion that the SEC has plausibly alleged that defendants had a duty to disclose or accrue for the DOJ investigation pursuant to ASC 450, Moore's argument is unpersuasive. Moreover, considering Moore's alleged role in communicating with RPM's outside audit firm throughout the time period during which he was responsible for RPM's responses to the DOJ investigation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 32, 51, as well as his alleged involvement in, and approval of, the reports filed with the SEC,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36, 42, 54, 65, 72, the agency has sufficiently alleged that Moore indirectly or directly caused RPM's records to be falsified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Therefore, defendant Moore's motion to dismiss Claim 6 will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   <strong>\n    VII.

But the law firm's alleged failings are not relevant to whether the SEC has alleged that Moore engaged in misleading conduct of his own. The SEC alleges that Moore himself made statements in management representation letters to RPM's outside audit firm that were materially false or misleading in that they represented that Moore had not dealt with any loss contingencies over $1.2 million despite his knowledge of the DOJ investigation and RPM's potential liability for at least $11 million.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 32, 51. Further, the SEC claims that Moore made other false or misleading statements in person to the auditors, such as when Moore told the audit firm that \"no claim ha[d] been asserted,\" \"no claim ha[d] been filed,\" and that the matter was \"investigative in nature and not in litigation,\" despite knowing that a\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   complaint had been filed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31, 52;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 67-68, 76-77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Taking the alleged facts as true, the SEC has sufficiently pled that Moore acted unreasonably in his communications with the auditors, and therefore violated Rule 13b2-2(a), so Moore's motion to dismiss Claim 7 will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   For all of the foregoing reasons, the Court will deny defendants' motions to dismiss in their entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   A separate order will issue.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-217\">\n    The Court may consider any documents attached to or incorporated by reference in the complaint.\n    <em>\n     EEOC v.
