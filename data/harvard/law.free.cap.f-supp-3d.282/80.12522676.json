Harris has brought this action,\n   <em>\n    pro se,\n   </em>\n   against defendants Tyrone Wilson and Joseph Bush, who are employees of the U.S. Postal Service (\"USPS\"), alleging that they assaulted her when she went to the post office to buy stamps on July 7, 2016. On behalf of the defendants, the United States has moved to dismiss the case. Because defendants were acting within the scope of their employment at the time of the alleged tort, this case must be brought against the United States. And since plaintiff has not exhausted the administrative steps she must pursue before she may sue the government in Court, the Court will grant the motion and will dismiss this case without prejudice. This means that plaintiff is not barred from filing a proper action in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts, which the Court must accept as true at this stage of the proceedings, are set forth in plaintiff's complaint and were supplemented by plaintiff's opposition to the motion to dismiss.

Notice of Removal [Dkt. # 1-2]. The United States then moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.
