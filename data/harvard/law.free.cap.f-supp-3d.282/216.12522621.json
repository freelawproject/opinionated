For the limited information that remains at issue, the Court will grant defendants' motion. The government is not required to disclose information under FOIA where no such record exists. And because plaintiff is not eligible or entitled to fees, the Court will deny that request as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 14, 2015, plaintiff submitted a request under FOIA and the Privacy Act to the DEA, seeking information about Special Agent Bryan Sartori, who had testified in plaintiff's criminal trial. Compl. at 4; FOIA Request. Plaintiff requested the following information:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (a) The date Special Agent Sartori was hired by the DEA;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (b) His law enforcement experience, including his dates of employment prior to joining the DEA;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (c) The dates he was trained at Quantico, Virginia;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (d) His history of field postings following training; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (e) A list of criminal cases in which he has testified, including the case names, case numbers, and the court(s) name and location(s).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FOIA Request. In a letter dated November 5, 2015, the DEA responded that it would not conduct any searches for the requested records without \"consent, proof of death, ... or an overriding public interest\" because \"any non-public records responsive to [plaintiff's] request would be categorically exempt from disclosure\" under FOIA Exemption 7(C). Ex. B. to Compl. [Dkt. # 1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff filed an administrative appeal by letter dated November 19, 2015, asserting that the requested information was \"neither non-public in nature nor an invasion of ... personal privacy,\" and he pointed out in that letter that Special Agent Sartori had already testified to much of this information during plaintiff's January 2011 criminal trial in \"the Eastern Judicial District of Michigan, Criminal Case number 10-20137.\" Ex. C to Compl. [Dkt. # 1]. The DOJ's Office of Information Policy rejected plaintiff's appeal, citing FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C). Ex. D to Compl. [Dkt. # 1] (\"Because any non-public records responsive to your request would be categorically exempt from disclosure, the FBI\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   properly asserted [FOIA] Exemptions 6 and 7(C) and was not required to\n   conduct a search for the requested records.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Katherine L.

In their reply brief, defendants represented that plaintiff had, \"for the first time, provided portions of the transcript from his criminal trial,\" in which Special Agent Sartori \"testified about the biographical information that [p]laintiff sought in his FOIA request.\" Reply in Supp. of Defs.' Mot. [Dkt. # 20] (\"Defs.' Reply\") at 1-2. While defendants maintained their position that the information would likely still be protected by Exemptions 6 and 7(C), in the interest of avoiding \"needlessly extend[ed] litigation,\" they provided the information sought by the first four parts of plaintiff's FOIA request.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 2-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Diane E.
