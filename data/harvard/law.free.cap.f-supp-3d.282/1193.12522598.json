(\"BOA\"), secured by a deed of trust encumbering property located at 3146 Barletta Lane in San Jose, CA (hereinafter, \"the Property\"). FAC, Ex. 1. (\"Deed of Trust\"). Rivera, the wife of Galindo, is not a borrower on the loan, but \"is a joint owner of the Property.\" FAC \u00b6 15. Plaintiffs defaulted on the loan on March 1, 2009. ECF No. 51-1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   A Notice of Default\n   and Election to Sell Under Deed of Trust was recorded on March 2, 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 1, 2012, Defendant acquired from BOA the servicing rights for Plaintiffs' loan.

Plaintiffs allege that they \"began applying for a [Home Affordable Modification Program (\"HAMP\") ] loan modification,\" although Plaintiffs do not specify in their Complaint a date that Plaintiffs began applying for a loan modification. FAC \u00b6 17. In 2015, \"after years of loan modification application negotiations that resulted in bad faith denials, Plaintiffs filed an administrative complaint.\" FAC \u00b6 21. On May 29, 2015, Plaintiffs received a letter from Defendant in response to Plaintiffs' administrative complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant's May 29, 2015 letter to Plaintiffs, which Plaintiffs attach to the FAC, informed Plaintiffs that \"[a] review of [Defendant]'s records indicate[d] [Plaintiffs] were approved [by Defendant] for a Trial Period Plan (TPP) Offer,\" and that an offer was sent to Plaintiffs' attention on September 14, 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"The [September 14, 2012 TPP offer] letter indicated if [Plaintiffs] completed the TPP by making all payments as stipulated in the offer,\" Plaintiffs would receive a loan modification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Under the terms of the TPP offer, Plaintiffs \"were required to make three (3) TPP payments\" in order to \"be eligible for the modification.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant's May 29, 2015 letter to Plaintiffs informed Plaintiffs that Defendant denied Plaintiffs a loan modification \"on December 13, 2012\" because Plaintiffs \"failed to make the TPP\" payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, according to Plaintiffs, \"Plaintiffs never received notice\" of the offer.

(\"BSI\") acquired from Defendant the servicing rights to Plaintiffs' loan. FAC \u00b6 26. Thereafter, Plaintiffs sent a loan modification request to BSI.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. On September 28, 2015, BSI filed a Notice of Trustee's Sale (hereinafter, \"Notice of Sale\") with the Santa Clara County Recorder's Office. FAC \u00b6 32 &amp; Ex. 3. Plaintiff alleges that when BSI recorded the Notice of Sale, \"[n]o decision had been made on Plaintiffs' loan modification application.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On January 4, 2017, Plaintiffs filed suit against BSI in this Court. ECF No. 1. Plaintiffs alleged four causes of action against BSI: (1) negligence; (2) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (3) violation of California Civil Code Section 2923.6(c) ; and (4) violation of the UCL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On January 26, 2017, BSI moved to dismiss all four causes of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 11. On February 2, 2017, Plaintiffs opposed BSI's motion. ECF No. 14. On February 9, 2017, BSI filed a reply. ECF No. 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On March 17, 2017, the Court granted BSI's motion to dismiss. ECF No. 23. As relevant here, the Court held that Plaintiffs failed to state a claim for negligence against BSI because Plaintiffs based their negligence claim, in part, on conduct that was committed by\n   <em>\n    Defendant\n   </em>\n   , not BSI.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11. For similar reasons, the Court held that Plaintiffs could not state a claim for violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing or the UCL against BSI for Defendant's conduct. The Court held that Plaintiffs also failed to state a claim that BSI violated California Civil Code \u00a7 2923.6(c). The Court granted Plaintiffs leave to amend the complaint within thirty days, but stated that Plaintiffs \"may not add new causes of action or parties without leave of the Court or stipulation of the parties pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On April 13, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file a FAC and requested leave of Court to add Defendant as a defendant. ECF No. 26. BSI did not oppose Plaintiffs' motion. ECF No. 28. On May 26, 2017, the Court granted Plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a FAC. ECF No. 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On May 29, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a FAC, which added Defendant as a defendant and alleged that BSI violated California Civil Code \u00a7 2923.6(c) and that both Defendant and BSI were negligent and violated the UCL. ECF No. 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On July 5, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\"), which asked the Court to enjoin Defendant and BSI from selling Plaintiffs' home at a trustee's sale that was scheduled to occur on July 19, 2017. ECF No. 46. That same day, the Court ordered Defendant and BSI to file a response to Plaintiffs' TRO motion on or before July 11, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On July 10, 2017, Defendant and BSI filed oppositions to Plaintiffs' motion for a TRO. ECF Nos. 52 &amp; 53. That same day, the Court issued an order for Plaintiffs to reply to Defendants' oppositions to Plaintiffs' motion for TRO. ECF No. 54. On July 11, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a reply. ECF No. 55. On July 14, 2017, the Court denied Plaintiffs' TRO motion. ECF No. 56. The Court found that Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim because at that point in time, Defendant and BSI were not the servicers of Plaintiffs' loan. Thus, Defendant and BSI \"d[id] not have the authority to stop the foreclosure sale scheduled for July 19, 2017.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Beyond that, the Court found that Plaintiffs \"failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims against [Defendant] for negligence and violation of the UCL,\" which\n   were \"the only claims that Plaintiffs brief[ed] in their TRO motion and discuss[ed] in their declaration in support of their TRO motion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   While Plaintiffs' TRO motion was pending, both BSI and Defendant moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' FAC on July 10, 2017. ECF No. 48; Def. Mot. On July 24, 2017, ten days after the Court denied Plaintiffs' TRO motion, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed BSI without prejudice. ECF No. 57. That same day, Plaintiffs opposed Defendant's motion to dismiss. ECF No. 58 (\"Pl. Opp.\"). On July 31, 2017, Defendant filed a Reply. ECF No. 62 (\"Reply\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A.
