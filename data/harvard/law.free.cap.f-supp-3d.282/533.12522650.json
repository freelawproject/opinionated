Thereafter, respondent United States of America (the \"Government\") filed a brief in opposition to Jackson's petition.

First, petitioner argues that his conviction was \"tainted by perjured testimony given by government witness Andre J. Decker,\" who has since recanted his version of events in a sworn affidavit. Second, petitioner claims the Government \"knowingly presented\" this false testimony in an effort to \"orchestrate[ ]\" his wrongful conviction. Third, petitioner contends that the logic of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , which rendered invalid the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act, should be extended to invalidate a portion of the career offender provision of the Sentencing Guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Newly Discovered Evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Jackson's first two claims for relief, which are based on Decker's allegedly\n   false trial testimony, fail to satisfy the second step in the two-part gatekeeping requirement for second or successive \u00a7 2255 petitions and must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As in this case, a second or successive habeas petition must first be certified by a panel of the appropriate court of appeals to contain a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing that there is either: (1) newly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense; or (2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(1)-(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   However, \"[e]ven where the Court of Appeals has authorized the filing of a successive petition, its order authorizing the district court to review the petition does not foreclose the district court's independent review of whether the petition survives dismissal.\"\n   <em>\n    Ferranti v.

Jan. 26, 2010). This is so '[b]ecause a '\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing' means simply a 'sufficient showing of possible merit to warrant a fuller exploration by the district court[.]' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%20307445\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bennett v.

Indeed, \"once the prisoner files his authorized \u00a7 2255 motion in the district court, the district court not only can, but must, determine for itself whether those [ \u00a7 2255(h) ] requirements are met.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5926652\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1268/#p1271\">\n    830 F.3d 1268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1271 (11th Cir. 2016) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In light of this requirement, an independent review of Decker's sworn affidavit reveals that it is not \"newly discovered evidence.\" Even assumed true and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, it is insufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found Jackson guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Importantly, courts take a \"critical view\" of recantations by a co-conspirator, especially when those recantations \"contradict sworn trial testimony that has been subject to cross examination.\"\n   <em>\n    Haouari v.

Carthen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3884824\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/681/94/#p102\">\n    681 F.3d 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 102 (2d Cir. 2012). These factors include (1) the importance of the witness's testimony in the original proceeding; (2) the existence of evidence corroborating either the conviction or the recantation; (3) the temporal proximity between the earlier trial testimony and the later recantation; (4) the consistency of the recantation with the witness's comments and behavior before, during, and after trial; and (5) the existence of evidence of outside influence suggesting either coerced testimony or coerced recantation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3884824\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/681/94/#p102\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the affidavit at issue, Decker swears that Jackson \"did not participate with [him] in the robbery\" and claims that he \"testified falsely\" against petitioner to save himself from additional prison time. According to Decker, Assistant United States\n   Attorney Robert Sharpe forced him to testify against his will before the grand jury and instructed him to state that he was unable to remember certain aspects of his story that might be \"contradictory.\" In sum, Decker claims he \"gave false testimony against Hosea Jackson to secure a reduced sentence and because [he] was forced to by the U.S. Attorney's Office.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This submission is insufficient to warrant further proceedings. Notably, unlike the submission in\n   <em>\n    Haouari\n   </em>\n   , Jackson has at least submitted his evidence in the form of a \"sworn affidavit\" from Decker. But as the Government points out, Decker's affidavit was only sworn to on March 17, 2016, meaning that he is now attempting to recant testimony he gave over five years ago, when he inculpated petitioner in the gas station robbery during a four-day trial in February of 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Further, Decker's affidavit is sparse, uncorroborated, and completely lacking in any sort of detail. At trial, testimony from Antonio Castro, another co-conspirator, established that there were three perpetrators at the scene of the crime, two of whom entered the gas station and one who remained in the van outside. These assertions were consistent with testimony from the robbery victim himself, who testified that two masked men robbed him at gunpoint before jumping into a maroon van driven by a third male.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Castro, who later chose to cooperate with police, testified that he drove the van while Decker and Jackson, the other two perpetrators, went inside to rob the gas station. In addition, Castro testified that the three men used a maroon van to commit robberies, including the gas station robbery at issue in this case. And an eyewitness who observed the robbery from the parking lot testified that he observed a male driving a maroon van park in front of the gas station before later driving away in a hurry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Importantly, Decker's trial testimony recounted a version of events that was largely consistent with the rest of this trial evidence. Among other things, Decker explained that Castro waited outside in a maroon van while he and petitioner entered the gas station to commit the robbery. Notably, Decker's purported recantation does not offer up any alternative explanations about who the third perpetrator was if not petitioner. Nor does it undermine the other details offered up at trial by Castro, the victim, or the eyewitness. In sum, Decker's two-page affidavit is insufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have convicted petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To the contrary, even crediting Decker's recantation, a reasonable factfinder would remain entitled to credit Castro's testimony as to the identities of the three co-conspirators, including Decker and Jackson. Further, the same factfinder could rely on the testimony of the robbery victim and of the eyewitness to establish the other essential elements of petitioner's conviction. Accordingly, petitioner's first two claims must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     New Rule of Constitutional Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As the Second Circuit observed in permitting him to pursue this successive \u00a7 2255 petition, Jackson's third argument is based on a claim that there is a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review, that was previously unavailable to him.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(2). According to petitioner, the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and its progeny should be extended to mean that the \"residual clause in the Career Offender guideline provision is [ ] unconstitutional.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   But the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   explicitly rejected that argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609931\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/886/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 892\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Unlike the ACCA, the advisory Guidelines do not fix the permissible\n   range of sentences ....
