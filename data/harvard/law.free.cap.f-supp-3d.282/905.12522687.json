R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). However, until this rule was amended in 2009, approval of the court was required in order to amend a pleading once a responsive pleading is filed. This changed, however, when Rule 15 was amended to its present form in 2009 so as to allow a pleader an opportunity to recover from a \"whoops\" moment when a complaint is challenged for its sufficiency by the opposing party. Under the revised Rule 15, a party has the\n   <em>\n    absolute right, without leave of court\n   </em>\n   , to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   amend its pleading once as a matter of course within: (A) 21 days after serving it, or (B) if the pleading is one to which a responsive pleading is required, 21 days after service of a responsive pleading or 21 days after service of a motion under Rule 12(b), (e), or (f), whichever is earlier.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Thus, when a pleader may have overlooked some of the basic requirements of pleading a cause of action or asserting jurisdiction in federal court, Rule 15 provides an absolute second chance, and an opportunity to convert a failing grade in to a passing one. In this case, the Court is faced with a horse that was led to water and refused to drink, and there are inevitable consequences that flow therefrom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The reluctant horse in this drama is the Plaintiff, Melinda Piper (\"Piper\"), a Maryland resident who brought a bare-bones, single-count Complaint against the Defendant, Meade &amp; Associates, Inc.
