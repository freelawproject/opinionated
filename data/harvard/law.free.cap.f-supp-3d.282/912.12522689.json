Consequently, the Court has jurisdiction over Petitioner's \u00a7 2241 habeas petition only if it has jurisdiction over Petitioner's custodian. Here, the Court lacks jurisdiction over Petitioner's current custodian, who is located in the Virgin Islands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Magistrate Judge erred in two respects in the Report. First, she suggests the Court dismiss this action. As explained above, however, binding authority counsels the Court it lacks habeas jurisdiction to entertain the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Petitioner was convicted in the Third Circuit and he is currently under supervised release there. Thus, Third Circuit, not Fourth Circuit, law controls both questions concerning the validity of his conviction and whether he is entitled to habeas relief. As such, the District Court of the Virgin Islands is in a better position to apply Third Circuit law than is this Court. More importantly, though, Petitioner's custodian's absence from the territorial jurisdiction of this Court is fatal to its jurisdiction to consider the merits of Petitioner's petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   But, even if this Court were to assess the petition and then grant the relief Petitioner seeks, Respondent lacks the ability to fulfill an order by this Court granting the petition. This is so because Petitioner is no longer in Respondent's custody. That is why Petitioner's \u00a7 2241 petition must be transferred: so it can be presented to his immediate custodian in the Virgin Islands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Magistrate Judge's second error was in adopting Petitioner's reliance on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) for the proposition transferring this case is forbidden. It is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Magistrate Judge states in the Report, \"as Petitioner points out,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) provides '[t]ransfers from a district court of the United States to the District Court of the Virgin Islands shall not be permitted under this section.' \" Report 3 n.4. (internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   But \u00a7 1401 is a change of venue statute. It concerns a transfer \"[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Here, the case must be transferred because Petitioner's current custodian is outside the jurisdiction of this Court. The convenience of the parties and witnesses issue is not before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Further, \u00a7 1401(a) allows the case to be transferred only to a district court in which the case could \"have been brought\" at the time it was filed \"or to any district or division to which all parties have consented.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Neither of those circumstances is present here. Consequently, the portion of \u00a7 1404 disallowing a transfer to\n   the District Court of the Virgin Islands is of no moment to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Controlling law, judicial economy, and the interests of justice call for this action to be transferred. Hence, the Court will reject the Report and transfer the case to the District Court for the Virgin Islands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Inasmuch as Petitioner's objections go to the merits of his Petition, the Court will overrule them for purposes of this Order. Nevertheless, he can raise them again with the District Court of the Virgin Islands if he wishes to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court notes if it were to consider the merits of this petition, it would dismiss it. But, as already noted, the Virgin Islands court can better make a merits-based determination as to the petition than can this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After a thorough review of the Report and the record in this case pursuant to the standard set forth above, the Court overrules Petitioner's objections and rejects the Report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   It is the judgment of the Court Respondent's motion to dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   and the motion to transfer is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . Therefore, this case shall be transferred to District Court of the Virgin Islands for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   To the extent Petitioner requests a certificate of appealability from this Court, that Certificate is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
