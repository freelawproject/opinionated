RUFE, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Plaintiff Dominique Jordan brings this civil action against Staffing Plus, his former employer, based on allegations of employment discrimination. He seeks to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis.\n   </em>\n   For the following reasons, the Court will grant plaintiff leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   and dismiss his complaint without prejudice to him filing an amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff was employed by Staffing Plus until his termination on March 29, 2017. By marking the appropriate locations on the Court's form complaint, plaintiff indicates that his former employer violated Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e. He also asserts claims pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . His claims against Staffing Plus are based on the following allegations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   WRONGFUL TERMINATION, STAFF PLUS wrongfully terminated Aggrieved PARTY not based off performance but because of false arrest, Negative News Article stemmed from assumption. No Facts. STAFFING PLUS did not do own investigation. Also Breach Of CONTRACT. (A Injury). Unlawful Terminated aggrieved party Based off hearsay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (Compl. \u00b6 II.E.) He seeks $300,000 in damages pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court grants plaintiff leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   because it appears he is incapable of paying the fees necessary to commence this action.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Title VII prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee based on race.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a). In general, to establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of employment discrimination, a plaintiff must show that: (1) he is a member of a\n   protected class; (2) he was qualified for the position in question; (3) he suffered an adverse employment action, and; (4) the adverse action occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

Although a plaintiff need not establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case to survive dismissal for failure to state a claim, he still must \"put forth allegations that raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of the necessary element.\"\n   <em>\n    Fowler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4049687\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/578/203/#p211\">\n    578 F.3d at 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Section 1981 prohibits race-based impairment of an individual's right to make and enforce contracts, or more specifically \"the making, performance, modification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (b), (c). \"Ordinarily, to establish a basis for relief under section 1981 a plaintiff must show (1) that he belongs to a racial minority; (2) an intent to discriminate on the basis of race by the defendant; and (3) discrimination concerning one or more of the activities enumerated in \u00a7 1981.\"\n   <em>\n    Estate of Oliva ex rel.

However, plaintiff does not allege his race or provide any facts to support his allegation that his employer's decision to terminate him was based on his race, or that any interference with an employment contract between him and Staffing Plus occurred because of his race. Accordingly, he has not stated a claim under the federal statutes prohibiting employment discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shahin v. Del.

Although the complaint does not state a claim as currently pled, the Court will give plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint in the event that he can cure the above deficiencies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grayson v.
