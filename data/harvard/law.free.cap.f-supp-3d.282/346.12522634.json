Daniel Barker, an atheist and co-President of the Freedom from Religion Foundation, challenges the modern practice in the House of Representatives, whereby he was denied the opportunity to be a guest chaplain and to deliver a secular invocation in lieu of a prayer. Mr. Barker asserts that the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Town of Greece, New York v.

His interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Town of Greece\n   </em>\n   is flawed. The legislative prayer practice of the House of Representatives is consistent with the decisions of the Supreme Court and this Circuit, as well as the Rules of the House. Mr. Barker has failed to state a claim on which he is entitled to relief. The Court also finds that extending\n   <em>\n    Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed.

As he interprets\n   <em>\n    Town of Greece\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that prayer practices must include opportunities for prayers from secularists. Mr. Barker stresses that the Town \"maintained that a minister or layperson of any persuasion, including an atheist, could give the invocation.\"\n   <em>\n    Town of Greece\n   </em>\n   , 134 S.Ct. at 1816. In view of this description of the Town's practice, Mr. Barker concludes that the Court \"conditioned its approval of the town's policy on that point: '\n   <em>\n    So long as the town maintains a policy of nondiscrimination\n   </em>\n   , the Constitution does not require additional efforts toward diversity.' \" Official Capacity Opp'n at 7 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Town of Greece\n   </em>\n   , 134 S.Ct. at 1824 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Mr. Barker's logic is persuasive within its confines, but it is not traceable to the opinion in\n   <em>\n    Town of Greece\n   </em>\n   . Mr. Barker confuses apples with oranges by connecting\n   the\n   <em>\n    facts\n   </em>\n   of the Town's practice as described in the majority opinion early on,\n   <em>\n    Town of Greece\n   </em>\n   , 134 S.Ct. at 1816, and the\n   <em>\n    analysis\n   </em>\n   of whether those practices \"reflect an aversion or bias on the part of town leaders\n   <em>\n    against minority faiths\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1824 (emphasis added). The entire paragraph from\n   <em>\n    Town of Greece\n   </em>\n   puts its point in context:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   Finally, the Court disagrees with the view taken by the Court of Appeals that the town of Greece contravened the Establishment Clause by inviting a predominantly Christian set of ministers to lead the prayer. The town made reasonable efforts to identify all of the congregations located within its borders and represented that it would welcome a prayer by any minister or layman who wished to give one. That nearly all of the congregations in town turned out to be Christian does not reflect an aversion or bias on the part of town leaders against minority faiths. So long as the town maintains a policy of nondiscrimination, the Constitution does not require it to search beyond its borders for non-Christian prayer givers in an effort to achieve religious balancing. The quest to promote a diversity of religious views would require the town to make wholly inappropriate judgments about the number of religions it should sponsor and the relative frequency with which it should sponsor each, a form of government entanglement with religion that is far more troublesome than the current approach.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1824 (internal citation omitted).

An \"officer of the United States\" is traditionally considered to \"embrace[ ] the ideas of tenure, duration, emolument, and duties,\" which are \"continuing and permanent, not occasional or temporary.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The guest chaplain position is therefore not an office of the United States because it is a temporary position, lasting only as long as the prayer itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In the alternative, Mr. Barker argues that a guest chaplain holds a position of public trust akin to those of jurors and notaries public, which have been found by other courts to constitute offices of public trust.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Official Capacity Opp'n at 15;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Torcaso v.

The position of guest chaplain is easily distinguishable from that of notaries public and trial witnesses and jurors. Notaries public are individuals authorized to swear to the validity of signatures on significant documents. The public must trust that authorization in order to conduct business and complete legal documents. Similarly, witnesses and jurors are in a position of public trust because they are entrusted with assisting in the carrying out of the law and serve under oaths. Without this trust, the judicial system would lack credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In contrast, the position of guest chaplain comes with no public expectations of trust. It is surely an honor to serve as guest chaplain and open a session of the House with prayer, but while members of the public might recognize that opportunity as unique or significant, there is no indication or allegation in the Complaint that guest chaplains hold a position of public trust or special recognition.
