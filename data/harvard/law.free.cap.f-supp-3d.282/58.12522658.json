(\"ACCJ\"), American Center for Civil Justice, Religious Liberty and Tolerance, Inc., American Center for Recovery, LLC, American Center for Freedom of Religion, and Neal Sher (collectively, \"Center Defendants\"). Plaintiff asks the Court to disqualify Mr. Sher and Mr. Both from representing the Center Defendants because of purported conflicts between counsel and their current and former clients in violation of D.C. Rules of Professional Conduct (\"D.C. Rules\") 1.7 and 1.9. Plaintiff also asserts that disqualification of Mr. Sher is necessary under D.C. Rule 3.7, which prohibits a lawyer from acting as an advocate at a trial in which the lawyer is likely to be a necessary witness. Having carefully considered the parties' written submissions, including supplemental memoranda and responses, plaintiff's motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   at this stage of the proceedings, without prejudice to being refiled should the circumstances warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 30, 1972, three members of a Japanese terrorist organization attacked passengers at the Lod Airport located near Tel Aviv, Israel, killing and wounding dozens of individuals. In 2006, ACCJ, a non-profit organization that \"advocate[s] for individuals who have been victims of foreign terrorist attacks,\" and Mr. Ambush, an attorney, began working together to seek compensation for various claimants injured as a result of the Lod Airport\n   massacre. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 33, 54-56. As part of his work with ACCJ, Mr. Ambush filed a lawsuit-\n   <em>\n    Franqui v. Syria\n   </em>\n   , No. 06-0734 (RBW) (D.D.C 2006)-on behalf of certain Puerto Rican individuals and estates against those purportedly responsible for the attack.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54-55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the summer of 2008, the governments of Libya and the United States negotiated a treaty pursuant to which Libya, one of the defendants in the\n   <em>\n    Franqui\n   </em>\n   action, agreed to create a settlement fund to compensate victims of state-sponsored terrorism, including victims of the Lod Airport massacre.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61-62. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Ambush and the ACCJ became \"embroiled in a dispute as to the management and control of the pending claims before the Department of State and Ambush's compensation,\" and ACCJ sued Mr. Ambush in an action captioned\n   <em>\n    American Center for Civil Justice v. Ambush\n   </em>\n   , No 09-233 (PLF) (D.D.C. 2011) (\"Attorneys' Fees Litigation\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 69-70, 75. Attorneys Mr. Sher and Mr. Both, among others, represented ACCJ in that proceeding and were involved in negotiating the settlement agreement that resolved that case in 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. to Disqualify Counsel (\"Mot.\"), ECF No. 11 at 1-2; Defs.' Opp. to Pl.'s Mot. to Disqualify Counsel (\"Opp.\"), ECF No. 14 at 2. Along with ACCJ, Michael Engelberg, who was then president of ACCJ, and Eliezer Perr, a member of the board of directors of ACCJ, were parties to the settlement agreement. Compl. Ex. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The instant suit stems from a purported breach of that settlement agreement. Plaintiff alleges that ACCJ, Dr. Engelberg, Mr. Perr, Mr. Sher, and others interfered with his efforts to seek compensation from his former clients and engaged in other activity in violation of both the settlement agreement and the Racketeering and Corrupt Organizations Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Attorney Efrem Schwalb is lead defense counsel in this action and represents all of the Center Defendants. Opp. at 2. On August 26, 2015, Mr. Sher and Mr. Both entered an appearance on behalf of the Center Defendants by signing a motion in which they requested additional time to answer or otherwise respond to the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D.C. Local Civil Rule 83.6(a) (\"An attorney eligible to appear may enter an appearance in a civil action by signing any pleading described in Fed. R. Civ. P. 7(a) [.]\"). In addition to serving as counsel in this case and being a co-defendant, Mr. Sher is ACCJ's General Counsel. Opp. at 2. Dr. Engelberg is represented by separate counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In this motion, plaintiff seeks to disqualify Mr. Sher and Mr. Both from representing the Center Defendants. According to plaintiff, Mr. Sher's role in this litigation as both counsel and defendant violates D.C. Rule 1.7 because it presents opportunities for \"multiple conflicts of interest\" to arise between Mr. Sher's own personal interests and the interests of the Center Defendants. Plaintiff also asserts that Mr. Sher and Mr. Both cannot represent the Center Defendants in this litigation because the interests of the Center Defendants are materially adverse to the interests of Dr. Engelberg, who is a former client of Mr. Sher and Mr. Both. Finally, because Mr. Sher was allegedly \"involved in the RICO conspiracy\" and negotiating the settlement agreement underlying this suit, plaintiff insists that Mr. Sher will be a necessary witness, thus requiring disqualification under D.C. Rule 3.7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In considering a motion to disqualify counsel, the district court must conduct a two-step inquiry: first, it must determine \"whether a violation of an applicable Rule of Professional Conduct has occurred or is occurring,\" and second, \"if so, whether such violation provides sufficient grounds for disqualification.\"\n   <em>\n    Headfirst Baseball\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4094174\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/999/199/#p204\">\n    999 F.Supp.2d at 204-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff seeks to disqualify Mr. Sher and Mr. Both based on two primary theories: (1) conflicts of interest under D.C. Rules 1.7 and 1.9 ; and (2) D.C. Rule 3.7's prohibition against a lawyer acting as an advocate when the lawyer is also a necessary witness. The Court addresses each argument in turn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Conflict of Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In his motion, plaintiff describes two sources of potential conflicts of interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   First, plaintiff points to Mr. Sher's role in this matter as both a co-defendant and an attorney representing the Center Defendants. Plaintiff contends that Mr. Sher's dual role violates D.C. Rule 1.7(b)(4), which requires disqualification where a \"lawyer's professional judgment on behalf of the client will be or reasonably may be adversely affected by ... the lawyer's\n   own financial, business, property, or personal interests.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Second, plaintiff argues that Mr. Sher and Mr. Both's prior representation of Dr. Engelberg in the Attorneys' Fees Litigation forecloses their role as counsel for the Center Defendants in this case under D.C. Rule 1.9.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 10-12. According to plaintiff, this suit is substantially related to the Attorneys' Fee Litigation and the interests of Dr. Engelberg are now materially adverse to the interests of the Center Defendants.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1512498\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/472/424/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As evidence of this adversity, plaintiff points to the derivative suit filed in 2014 by Dr. Engelberg against ACCJ, Mr. Perr, and others (\"New York state action\") in which Dr. Engelberg alleges that Mr. Perr and his son \"used their respective positions of authority ... to siphon off, both directly and indirectly, over $20 million dollars of charitable funds to other shell ... entities, owned and controlled by them.\" Mot. Ex. 1 at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Center Defendants assert that neither of these scenarios creates a disqualifying conflict of interest and further add that plaintiff lacks standing to raise these concerns. Because the Court agrees with Center Defendants on the threshold issue of standing, plaintiff's motion to disqualify counsel based on conflict-of-interest grounds is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Before a federal court can exercise its jurisdiction, a movant must establish, as an \"irreducible constitutional minimum,\" that he has suffered \"an injury in fact\" that is caused by the challenged conduct and likely redressable through relief from the court.\n   <em>\n    Lujan v.

Plaintiff cites to a number of cases, each of which confirm the principle that counsel must be disqualified where their ethical breaches infect the litigation-but none of which give plaintiff his desired result.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 (citing\n   <em>\n    Pigford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9027303\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/355/148/#p156\">\n    355 F.Supp.2d at 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (denying motion to disqualify for lack of standing);\n   <em>\n    Koller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799770,669866,3799787,669919\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/737/1038/\">\n    737 F.2d at 1064\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reversing district court's revocation of counsel's pro hac vice appearances and disqualification of law firm);\n   <em>\n    Cauderlier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%203445493\">\n    2006 WL 3445493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (finding defendant lacked standing because \"[h]e [could] not possibly claim that his right to a fair resolution of his claims w[ould] be affected by what law firm represent[ed] his opponents\")). To the contrary, as these cases make clear, courts are reluctant to disqualify counsel on fairness grounds unless the movant clears a high bar by, for example, showing that the conflict is so glaring that it \"undermines the Court's confidence in the vigor of the attorney's representation of his or her client,\"\n   <em>\n    Pigford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9027303\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/355/148/#p156\">\n    355 F.Supp.2d at 166-167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or \"threatens the non-client with immediate and actual harm by creating the substantial risk to her right to a fair and just determination of her claims,\"\n   <em>\n    Cauderlier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%203445493\">\n    2006 WL 3445493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff has failed to clear that high bar here. With respect to plaintiff's concern that Mr. Sher's personal interest as a co-defendant will cloud his judgment as an advocate for the Center Defendants, the Court finds compelling that, in their opposition brief, (1) the Center Defendants assert that they have provided consent-after being advised by another attorney-as to Mr. Sher's continued representation; and (2) Mr. Sher maintains that he reasonably believes that he will be able to provide competent and diligent representation to his co-defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 8-9; D.C. Rule 1.7(c) (a lawyer may represent a client despite a conflict if \"[e]ach potentially affected client provides informed consent\" and \"[t]he lawyer reasonably believes that the lawyer will be able to provide competent and diligent representation to each affected client\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Likewise, with respect to the allegations of adversity between the Center Defendants and Dr. Engelberg, Dr. Engelberg himself-the client whose interests are alleged to be harmed-has stated through his counsel that he does not object to Mr. Sher and Mr. Both's role in this case at this stage in the proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. Ex. C.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   D.C. Rule 1.9 (permitting a lawyer who formerly represented a client to represent another person in a substantially related matter in which that person's interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former client if the former client gives informed consent).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In short, notwithstanding plaintiff's claims to the contrary, the Court finds that any alleged conflicts here simply do not rise to the level where they affect the integrity of the proceedings or threaten plaintiff's right to a just determination of his claims. Accordingly, plaintiff lacks standing to seek disqualification of Mr. Sher and Mr. Both on conflict-of-interest grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Lawyer as Necessary Witness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff also asserts that Mr. Sher should be disqualified under D.C. Rule 3.7, which prohibits a lawyer from acting as an advocate and a witness in the same matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As a threshold matter, the Court finds that plaintiff does have standing to seek disqualification on this ground. As the comments to D.C. Rule 3.7 make clear, \"[c]ombining the roles of advocate and witness can prejudice\" the opposing party's rights in litigation by, for example, limiting an opposing party's access to evidence or affecting the orderly conduct of the trial.\n   <em>\n    See also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Colyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11663656\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/50/966/#p969\">\n    50 F.Supp.2d at 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that non-client plaintiff did have standing to seek disqualification of opposing counsel who might be needed as a fact witness, \"as it directly affect[ed] [plaintiff's] access to evidence and the orderly conduct of the trial\");\n   <em>\n    Xcentric Ventures, LLC v. Stanley\n   </em>\n   , No. CV-07-00954-PHX-NVW,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%202177323\">\n    2007 WL 2177323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (D. Ariz. July 27, 2007) (finding that \"Defendants have standing to move for disqualification on the ground of [opposing counsel's] simultaneous service as counsel and witness in the case\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff claims that there is \"no question\" that Mr. Sher will be a necessary witness in this case given his alleged involvement in the RICO conspiracy that forms the basis of this suit. While that may be so, on its face, Rule 3.7 only applies to trial counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.C. Rule 3.7 (\"A lawyer shall not act as advocate\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     at a trial\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   in which the lawyer is likely to be a necessary witness[.]\") (emphasis added). As such, even a lawyer who is likely to be a necessary witness at trial is not disqualified from representing his client during pretrial proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.C. Ethics Opinion 228 (\"Given the Rule's express limitation and the trial-stage purposes it is intended to serve, we conclude that a lawyer who is likely to be a necessary witness at trial may represent a client in most pretrial matters. This includes, but is not limited to, taking witness depositions, pre-trial discovery and argument of most pre-trial motions, and also assisting in trial preparation.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Canfield v. Stone\n   </em>\n   , No. CIV. A. 93-1022(NHJ),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1993%20WL%20468451\">\n    1993 WL 468451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-2 (D.D.C. Oct. 25, 1993) (concluding that any different result \"would deprive the defendant of his chosen representative before it is clear that trial will be necessary\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Accordingly, plaintiff's objections to Mr. Sher's role are premature at this stage in the proceedings. Should plaintiff's complaint survive any dispositive motions and proceed toward trial, plaintiff may renew this motion to disqualify Mr. Sher as trial\n   counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, it is\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that plaintiff Joshua Ambush's motion to disqualify Mr. Sher and Mr. Both as counsel for Center Defendants is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . To the extent that it becomes apparent that Mr. Sher will be a necessary witness at trial, plaintiff may re-raise his arguments for disqualification at that time. A separate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Plaintiff also suggests that Mr. Sher should be disqualified from this case because he was previously disbarred from the District of Columbia bar.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mot. at 9. But Mr. Sher is currently admitted to practice before this Court,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Opp. Ex. A, and it is the Court's understanding that Mr. Sher properly disclosed his prior disbarment on his application. As such, the Court declines to disqualify Mr. Sher on that basis alone.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Plaintiff also suggests that, given the eventual possibility of disqualification later in the proceedings, the Court should disqualify Mr. Sher now to avoid \"delaying the resolution of the case and causing additional expenses to all the parties.\" Mot. at 8. Given that the Center Defendants already have retained Mr. Schwalb as lead counsel, and given that plaintiff does not allege any disqualifying conflicts as to Mr. Schwalb, it is not clear to the Court that disqualifying Mr. Sher and/or Mr. Both at a later stage would cause significant delay or create additional expenses. In any event, because Rule 3.7 expressly limits itself to advocacy at trial, the Court is reluctant to disqualify defendants' chosen counsel at this juncture.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
