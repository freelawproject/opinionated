MARTINEZ, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   THE MATTER was referred to the Honorable Jonathan Goodman, United States Magistrate Judge, for a Report and Recommendation on Defendant's Motion to Dismiss (the \"Motion\") [ECF No. 13]. Magistrate Judge Goodman filed a Report and Recommendation [ECF No. 65], recommending that the Motion be denied without prejudice. The Court has reviewed the entire file and record and has made a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the issues that the objections\n   to the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation present. After careful consideration, it is hereby:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    ADJUDGED\n   </strong>\n   that United States Magistrate Judge Goodman's Report and Recommendation [ECF No. 65] is\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    ADOPTED\n   </strong>\n   . Accordingly, it is\n   <strong>\n    ADJUDGED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss [ECF No. 13] is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED without prejudice.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Moreover, in apparent anticipation of this Court entering an order adopting the Report and Recommendation and denying Defendant's motion to dismiss, Defendant has also moved to certify this order for interlocutory appeal, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) [ECF No. 69]. A district court may certify an order in a civil action for interlocutory appeal if the Court believes that the order \"involves a controlling question of law as to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). As such, a district court may certify for immediate review an order disposing of an important question of law, which the Court of Appeals may address, in its discretion, if application is made to it within ten days after entry of the order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McFarlin v.

In interpreting the \"controlling question of law\" requirement, the Eleventh Circuit has held that the question must be a purely legal one that is \"controlling of at least a substantial part of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    McFarlin,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9204338\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/381/1251/#p1256\">\n    381 F.3d at 1258, 1264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, \" \u00a7 1292(b) appeals were intended, and should be reserved, for situations in which the court of appeals can rule on a pure, controlling question of law without having to delve beyond the surface of the record in order to determine the facts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9204338\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/381/1251/#p1256\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9204338\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/381/1251/#p1256\">\n    at 1259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Here, the Court agrees with Magistrate Judge Goodman's analysis that \"an issue of first impression about ADA preemption should be deferred until the summary judgment stage, where the factual record can be more fully developed .... Determining whether Plaintiff's claims have an impermissible effect on [Defendant]'s prices or services is an inherently factual question; evidence is required to determine whether and how Plaintiff's claim would have such an effect.\" [ECF No. 65 at 18, 21].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Accordingly, because significant factual questions remain at this stage, Defendant's motion to certify this order for interlocutory appeal, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) [ECF No. 69], is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . Plaintiff's Motion to Lift Stay and Enter New Scheduling Order [ECF No. 74] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . The Clerk shall LIFT the stay in this action. The Court shall reset any applicable pretrial deadlines and the trial date by separate order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers at Miami, Florida, this\n   <em>\n    16\n   </em>\n   day of October, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Jonathan Goodman, UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This purported class action case concerns the language which appears on an airline's website when a customer purchases optional travel insurance (a/k/a trip insurance). It also concerns the reasonable inferences which a customer could or would make and how a customer would interpret the information provided. Although the website does not\n   <em>\n    exactly\n   </em>\n   say what Plaintiff Kristian Zamber (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Zamber\") claims it says, it does make enough representations to meet the minimum\n   Florida state law standard for alleged deception and unjust enrichment claims (when analyzed through the prism of a permissible and rationale\n   <strong>\n    interpretation\n   </strong>\n   of these representations).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff might not ultimately be able to certify a class, and he might not later survive a summary judgment motion either. But for now, for purposes of a threshold motion to dismiss, Plaintiff's Complaint survives, and the Undersigned therefore\n   <strong>\n    respectfully recommends\n   </strong>\n   that United States District Judge Jose E. Martinez\n   <strong>\n    deny\n   </strong>\n   the dismissal motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Nevertheless, the Undersigned feels compelled to note that the issue is a close one. In addition, as outlined below, some of the allegations appear to overstate or incorrectly state what language is actually on the website. Plaintiff may therefore wish to clean up the problematic allegations in a newer version of the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Moreover, Plaintiff may need to confront again the threshold issue of whether the Airline Deregulation Act (\"ADA\") forecloses (or preempts) the claims here. Neither party has called my attention to an on-point authority addressing the critical issue of whether travel insurance is encompassed by the ADA's prohibition-i.e., whether travel insurance is \"related to a price, route or service of an air carrier that may provide air transportation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2041713\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Because this issue appears to be one of first impression, the Undersigned recommends that the Court postpone ruling on this issue until discovery generates additional facts necessary to better inform the analysis of the ADA preemption issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In an effort to highlight some of the points which affect the analysis of the two counts here, the Undersigned will outline later in this Report the allegations which Plaintiff did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   make in his Complaint (and the representations which Plaintiff\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   make, but in an arguably inconsistent or problematic way). I will also note the allegations which Defendant American Airlines, Inc. (\"American\") did not expressly make either (in its website or ticket/travel insurance confirmation). Plaintiff's omissions or inaccurate summaries of what American represented may ultimately be just as important as the representations and allegations which were in fact expressly made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   By way of overall procedural background, American filed a Motion to Dismiss [ECF No. 13], which is ripe for a ruling. Judge Martinez referred the motion to the Undersigned, [ECF No. 39], and I held a hearing on March 7, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Factual and Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Because this Report concerns a motion to dismiss, the Undersigned must treat the allegations as true. But I will flag those allegations that are inconsistent with the actual facts (i.e., at odds with the specific and actual representations made by American).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Complaint alleges the following scenario:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff bought a travel insurance policy on American's website. On its website, American represents that, despite being sold via American's website, the travel insurance is \"sold by third-party insurance providers,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     not American\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\" [ECF No. 1, \u00b6 33]. (emphasis added). Plaintiff contends that this representation necessarily informs a reasonable consumer that the insurance premium is a \"pass through\" fee paid to the third-party insurer. But, according to Plaintiff, \"in reality, [American] receives an\n   <strong>\n    undisclosed kickback\n   </strong>\n   from every policy sold.\" [ECF No. 1, \u00b6 1] (emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   When a customer buys an airline ticket on American's website, American requires the customer to elect whether to purchase a trip insurance policy from an independent\n   insurer, Allianz Global Assistance (\"Allianz\"). [ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 8]. The customer must check either a \"yes\" or \"no\" box before American allows the customer to complete the ticket purchase. [ECF No. 1, \u00b6 5]. The \"yes\" option is highlighted in bold type, next to which is a checkmark in bright green typeface, followed immediately by the word \"Recommended,\" which is also in bright green typeface. [ECF No. 1, \u00b6 5].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Following the bright green checkmark and \"Recommended\" line, American includes a quote from U.S. News &amp; World Report that states: \"It's a smart idea to consider investing in travel insurance.\" [ECF No. 1, \u00b6 6]. The \"no\" option is below the \"yes\" option and not in bold type. [ECF No. 1, \u00b6 5]. A customer is unable to proceed with buying a ticket until electing whether to buy trip insurance. [ECF No. 1, \u00b6 4].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On the same website, American makes the following representations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 \"This insurance is offered by a third party, Allianz Global Assistance, not American Airlines.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 \"Recommended by AGA Service Company, the licensed producer and administrator of this plan.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 \"Trip insurance products are sold by third-party insurance providers, not American, so you'll receive a separate confirmation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 \"When you purchase a plan from Allianz Global Assistance....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [ECF Nos. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 29, 33; 1-1; 1-2; 1-3].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Further, when a customer buys trip insurance (a/k/a travel insurance) on American's website, the premium is not itemized on the airfare bill. Rather, it is itemized separately even though paid via a one-time credit card charge on American's website. [ECF No. 1, \u00b6 31]. This contrasts with the election of other \"add-ons,\" like seat selection, which are included as part of the listed fare price. [ECF No. 1, \u00b6 31].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff contends that these representations inform a reasonable consumer that the premiums paid for a trip insurance policy on American's website are a \"pass through\" charge, meaning that American does not have a profit interest in a customer's purchase of an insurance policy and that American simply collects the policy premium and forwards it on to the actual insurer. [ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 34, 36]. Plaintiff alleges that, despite these representations, American in fact receives a portion of the premium the customer pays for the travel insurance policy, thus making the sale of travel insurance policies a \"hidden profit center\" for American. [ECF No. 1, \u00b6 37]. Plaintiff contends that the portion of the travel insurance premium received by American is \"an undisclosed kickback\" on \"every policy sold.\" [ECF No. 1, \u00b6 1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On March 20, 2016, Plaintiff bought a trip insurance policy on American's website. [ECF No. 1, \u00b6 40]. On September 12, 2016, based on the above-discussed \"kickback\" scheme, Plaintiff filed a two-count class action against American for violation of Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (FDUTPA), Florida Statute \u00a7 501.201\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and unjust enrichment. American moved to dismiss based on: (1) lack of standing; (2) failure to state a claim; and (3) preemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    What is not alleged (or what is inconsistently or incorrectly alleged)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In the Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that \"American\n   <strong>\n    affirmatively\n   </strong>\n   leads the consumer to believe that it has\n   <strong>\n    no profit\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    participation\n   </strong>\n   in the sale of this insurance by, among other things,\n   <strong>\n    expressly disclaiming any role\n   </strong>\n   in the actual provision of the insurance that its customers purchase.\" [ECF No. 1, \u00b6 7] (emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   But neither American's website nor the confirmation page affirmatively represents that American has no profit participation. Likewise, American's website does not\n   <em>\n    expressly\n   </em>\n   disclaim anything about its role (or lack of a role) in the trip insurance. The only material representation it makes is that the insurance is provided by (and sold by) Allianz, a third party, not American.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges that \"American\n   <strong>\n    denies\n   </strong>\n   that it is\n   <strong>\n    involved in\n   </strong>\n   the insurance, and even denies that it is the party that is offering the insurance to the consumer.\" [ECF No. 1, \u00b6 8] (emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   But American makes no such denial in its website or on the travel insurance confirmation page. It does represent that Allianz, not American, provides the insurance, but that is significantly different than denying all involvement in the insurance. Moreover, assuming that a representation that Allianz, not American, provides the insurance, what, if anything, is false or deceptive about\n   <em>\n    that?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff has not alleged that Allianz does not provide the insurance. At the hearing, Plaintiff's counsel argued\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   that\n   <strong>\n    American\n   </strong>\n   does in fact also provide the insurance because it is acting as an agent or broker for American. But that argument is not alleged in the Complaint. The Undersigned will not consider attorney rhetoric not also included as an actual allegation in the Complaint when evaluating the Complaint's sufficiency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the \"lack of inclusion of the trip insurance cost in the customer's airfare purchase further represents to the consumer that American treats the insurance cost as a 'pass through' charge, not as a profit vehicle for itself.\" [ECF No. 1, \u00b6 31]. But neither the website nor the ticket confirmation uses the term \"pass through\" and Plaintiff's counsel admitted at the hearing that the pass through theory is the\n   <em>\n    impression\n   </em>\n   left with the consumer. Despite the allegations in the Complaint, American does not expressly represent that travel insurance is a pass through charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In the Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that American \"represents the cost of the trip insurance policies as a 'pass through' charge, where\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Defendant\n    </em>\n    simply collects the money\n   </strong>\n   for the insurance policy from the consumer and\n   <strong>\n    forwards it on\n   </strong>\n   to the actual insurance provider.\" [ECF No. 1, \u00b6 36] (emphasis added). As noted, American does not affirmatively represent the trip insurance cost as a pass through charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   But there is an additional issue arising from paragraph 36 of the Complaint. At the hearing, Plaintiff's counsel said he was not sure whether the funds go directly to Allianz or whether they first go to American or to another entity. He explained that discovery would reveal how the money traveled and further argued that the path the money takes does not matter. This lack of certainty is inconsistent with the Complaint, which unequivocally alleges that there is no suggestion that American \"\n   <strong>\n    is\n   </strong>\n   retaining a portion of this charge for itself.\" [ECF No. 1, \u00b6 38] (emphasis added). Moreover, the Complaint contends that\n   American itself collects the money and forwards it to Allianz.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In addition, the Complaint alleges that certain statements \"reinforce the\n   <strong>\n    representation\n   </strong>\n   of the trip insurance as a 'pass through' charge, one where American has no role in the provision of the product nor any profit interest.\" [ECF No. 1, \u00b6 34] (emphasis supplied). But, as highlighted earlier, American does not actually and affirmatively represent the trip insurance to be a \"pass through,\" nor does it expressly represent that it has \"no role\" or no \"profit interest.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   So these may be inferences or interpretations which a reasonable consumer might reach, but they are not express \"representations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Zamber's Complaint does not allege that he ever made a claim under his policy or that any claim filed by him was not paid by Allianz. Nor does it allege that the policy issued to him was different in any respect from the policy he contracted with Allianz to purchase. In addition, the Complaint does not allege that Zamber was charged an amount different than the amount he agreed to pay. And it does not allege that the travel insurance coverage he purchased was worth less than he paid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In addition, the Complaint does not allege that Zamber could have procured travel insurance of comparable value at a lower price, nor does it allege that Zamber would not have paid the premium anyway had he known that some portion of it was going to American for additional profit. And he does not allege that the insurance would have been offered for a lower price but for American's purported action of arranging to keep some portion of the premium as additional profit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On the other hand, American has not alleged, in its opposition memorandum or at the hearing, that it has absolutely no financial stake in the travel insurance provided by Allianz. It asserts other arguments and theories, of course, but that is not one of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Applicable Legal Principles and Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Standing\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As required, the Undersigned first addresses standing, which both parties agree is a threshold issue which must be resolved before any other argument.\n   <em>\n    Steel Co. v.
