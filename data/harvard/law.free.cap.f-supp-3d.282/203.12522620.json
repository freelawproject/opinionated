On March 12, 2014, after the resolution of the federal claim, plaintiff filed a motion for attorney's fees under the fee-shifting provision of the FDCPA for her counsel's work on that claim. Pl.'s Mot. for Award of Att'y's Fees &amp; Costs [Dkt. #15] (\"Pl.'s 1st Fee Mot.\"); Pl.'s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Award of Att'y's Fees &amp; Costs [Dkt.\n   <em>\n    #\n   </em>\n   15-1] (\"Pl.'s 1st Fee Mem.\"). The motion originally sought $155,700.00 in attorney's fees and $442.95 in costs for 346 hours of work. Pl.'s 1st Fee Mot. at 2. Plaintiff amended her request for fees multiple times thereafter, arriving ultimately at a request for $220,712.00 in attorney's fees and $442.95 in costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court referred the matter to a Magistrate Judge for preparation of a Report and Recommendation under Local Civil Rule 72.2.

The Court, applying the \"clearly erroneous standard\" set out in Local Rule 72.2, observed that the award was \"quite generous,\" but it upheld the award under that standard.\n   <em>\n    Baylor v.

Both sides appealed the Court's decision-plaintiff's counsel claimed the award was too low, and defendant claimed it was too high.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On appeal, the D.C. Circuit determined that since Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(2)(D) provides that a Court \"may refer a motion for attorney's fees to a magistrate judge under Rule 72(b) as if it were a dispositive pretrial matter,\" a ruling on a motion for attorney's fees must be evaluated under Rule 72(b)'s standard, \"which requires that a district judge 'determine de novo any part of the magistrate judge's disposition that has been properly objected to.' \"\n   <em>\n    Baylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276710\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/939/#p951\">\n    857 F.3d at 945\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting Fed.

Counsel filed a complaint and secured for her client the $1001.00 statutory damages on plaintiff's federal claim, but she was completely unsuccessful with respect to all of the other claims. The majority of plaintiff's state law claims were dismissed, and only her claims under sections 28-3814(f)(5) and 28-3814(g)(5) of the D.C. Debt Collection Law survived defendant's motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6878783\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/55/43/#p55\">\n    55 F.Supp.3d at 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Discovery, which should have been relatively circumscribed given the limited nature of the remaining allegations, was wide ranging and marked by extraordinary contentiousness, all of which does little to alleviate the impression that the litigation was largely driven by fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   There is no doubt that counsel invested time and effort at the outset to vindicate the rights of her client, and that therefore, under the statute, she is entitled to some compensation for the work she performed to draft the complaint and some of the effort to either settle or litigate the matter thereafter. But the Court agrees completely with the concurring opinion filed by the Circuit Judge in this case that the fee request was not reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276710\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/939/#p951\">\n    857 F.3d at 955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Henderson, J., concurring). It is clear from this Court's January 2015 decision adopting the Magistrate Judge's recommendation that while the Court was aware of the scope of a judge's discretion when awarding fees, it felt constrained by its understanding at the time that it was required to apply a clearly erroneous standard and reduce the award only if it was contrary to law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4251471\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/77/113/#p121\">\n    77 F.Supp.3d at 118-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But those constraints no longer apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Looking at the matter\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , though, the Court finds that the fee request was excessive in light of the limited work that was necessary to achieve plaintiff's minimal success in this case. Therefore, the fees will be reduced substantially. Moreover, the Court does not find it to be a reasonable exercise of its discretion to require the defense to pay for the time counsel chose to invest in pursuing the excessive fees, and therefore, while it has the authority to do so, it will not award any fees for the extensive amount of time spent litigating the fee issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Fee Requests\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff originally moved for an award of attorney's fees in the amount of $155,700.00. Pl.'s 1st Fee Mot. at 2. As of the time of filing that motion, plaintiff's counsel represented that she had expended 346 hours of work on plaintiff's behalf through the acceptance of defendant's offer of judgment at the \"prevailing market rate\" of $450.00 per hour.

Specifically, the 346 hours of work reflected the \"considerable time and effort\" counsel spent on three settlement attempts prior to the filing of the complaint, drafting a twenty-seven page opposition to defendant's motion to dismiss, and negotiating the Rule 68 offer and achieving its acceptance by her client.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s 1st Fee Mem. at 3-5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After defendant opposed the motion for attorney's fees,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s 1st Fee Opp., plaintiff subsequently requested additional fees for drafting and filing her reply to defendant's opposition, bringing her fee request to $195,332.00 for a total of 434.07 hours of work expended on pre-litigation settlement discussions, the complaint, the opposition to defendant's motion to dismiss, the Rule 68 offer and acceptance, and the fee petition and reply.

Regardless of whether plaintiff's counsel has the requisite level of experience that would justify that rate under the\n   <em>\n    Laffey\n   </em>\n   Matrix, the Court finds this rate to be inappropriate given counsel's agreement to represent her client at a rate of $325.00 per hour.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14 (\"The rate quoted in [p]laintiff's contingency agreement and signed almost a year ago in 2013 is $325 per hour.\").

This cannot be justified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court sees a number of problems with awarding plaintiff fees for all of the 434.07 hours supposedly spent on these tasks. First, while counsel's efforts to obtain a settlement prior to the filing of a lawsuit were commendable, these activities occurred prior to the commencement of this lawsuit, and they are therefore outside of the scope of the statutory provision authorizing an award of attorney's fees to a prevailing party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Further, counsel states that she spent approximately 56 hours drafting, editing, and serving the complaint, as well as researching legal issues relevant to the claims in the complaint.\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    See\n   </em>\n   Time Records.

While it may be true that plaintiff's counsel did not pick up the offer of judgment from her mailbox until January 29, 2014, two days after she filed the opposition, the offer was delivered to the only address counsel provided on this Court's docket,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl.; Civil Cover Sheet [Dkt.\n   <em>\n    #\n   </em>\n   2], on January 17, 2014, well before the opposition was due.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. A to Pl.'s 1st Fee Reply [Dkt.\n   <em>\n    #\n   </em>\n   21-1]. The Court cannot deny that plaintiff's counsel performed the work related to opposing\n   the motion to dismiss; but it also cannot ignore the fact that all of counsel's work with regard to the FDCPA claim, set forth on pages 6-17 of the opposition,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp. to Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss [Dkt.\n   <em>\n    #\n   </em>\n   8-1] at 6-17, was unnecessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s 1st Fee Mem. at 5 (\"Plaintiff spent 87 hours disproving the numerous claims and defenses averred by Defendant[ ] in spite of the fact that Defendant[ ] had already offered to accept judgment on said claims.\"). Moreover, the remainder of plaintiff's counsel's time spent on the opposition,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp. to Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss [Dkt.\n   <em>\n    #\n   </em>\n   8-1] at 17-28, was devoted to the unsuccessful state law claims for which counsel is not entitled to attorney's fees. Therefore, the Court concludes that no fees should be awarded for the hours counsel spent opposing the motion to dismiss. Even if the Court were inclined to recognize the time spent on the federal claim, applying the same percentage used on the complaint would reduce the hours reasonably expended to 34.8 hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Turning to the hours spent opposing defendant's five-page motion for relief from judgment, the Court finds that a percentage reduction in the hours claimed is necessary here as well. For her filing of the twelve-page opposition, plaintiff's counsel seeks to be compensated for an additional 43.2 hours.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s 2nd Fee Mot. However, a review of the filings in this portion of the case indicates that plaintiff wasted time and effort engaging in the sort of antagonism for which she had already been chastised.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp. to Mot.

Moreover, the amount of time spent on this one motion seems unreasonable given the limited nature of the issue presented and the total amount of time invested in the case as a whole. Therefore, the Court concludes that the time spent on the opposition to defendant's motion for relief from judgment should be reduced by 75%, and counsel will be compensated for 10.8 hours of work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Finally, plaintiff seeks to recover for the 85 hours counsel spent drafting the fee petition, 110 hours spent (over 13 days) drafting a reply to the opposition to the motion, and 13.2 hours expended drafting a reply to defendant's opposition to counsel's fee amendment. These hours far exceed the time spent in dealing with the federal claim on the merits. The Supreme Court has made it clear that the initial fee calculation should exclude any \"hours that were not 'reasonably expended.' \"\n   <em>\n    Hensley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p434\">\n    461 U.S. at 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p434\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Applying that standard, the Court cannot require defendant to fund plaintiff's inefficient pursuit of an unacceptably large fee for an extremely modest gain for her client.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Therefore, the Court will award fees only for the reasonable time counsel spent on the complaint (22.4 hours), the Rule 68 offer and settlement (40.7 hours),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Time Records at 2-3, and the opposition to the motion for relief from judgment (10.8 hours), which adds up to 73.9 hours. The total would increase to 108.7 hours if some portion of the time spent on the opposition to the motion to dismiss (34.8 hours) were included. The Court finds that these totals accurately reflect the reasonable number of hours it would take to perform the work that was necessary in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Application of the Lodestar Method\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Applying the lodestar approach to these calculations, plaintiff's counsel would be awarded $24,017.50 for 73.9 hours of work at $325.00 an hour, or $35,327.50 for 108.7 hours at the same rate if one includes a portion of the opposition to the\n   motion to dismiss. But that does not end the analysis; the Court has the discretion to assess the award in the context of the entire case, including the reasonableness of the fee petition itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Counsel's original request sought an award\n   <em>\n    220 times larger\n   </em>\n   than the $1,001.00 she obtained for plaintiff; even after a reduction of hours to account only for those reasonably expended and the lowering of counsel's hourly rate, counsel would still receive a fee that is 24 or 35 times larger than the result obtained for plaintiff if the Court applies the lodestar method.
