Plaintiff Jack Saade (\"plaintiff\" or \"Saade\"), who appears\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   , alleges that Option One Mortgage Company (\"Option One\"), the original mortgagee of property he owns, misrepresented the status of his mortgage refinancing. He contends that 1) Security Connection Inc. (\"SCI\"), a facilitator of mortgage assignments, committed fraud and 2) Ocwen Loan Servicing LLC (\"Ocwen\"), the mortgage servicer, engaged in various unfair trade practices, 3) Orlans Moran PLLC (\"Orlans Moran\"), legal counsel for the mortgagee, engaged in unfair debt collection practices, and 4) HSBC Bank, USA, National Association (\"HSBC\"), the purported assignee of the mortgagee, was not a legitimate assignee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the Court are 1) motions to dismiss of defendants Orlans Moran, Ocwen and SCI, defendant 2) Ocwen's motion to continue and defer plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment, 3) plaintiff's motions for summary judgment generally and, in particular, as to Counts II, III and IV and to vacate the Court's order granting defendant Homeward's motion to dismiss, and 4) plaintiff's request for notice of default as to HSBC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff alleges a number of illicit incidents by several entities on a number of occasions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The first nucleus of allegations concerns the refinancing of plaintiff's mortgage. Mr. Saade obtained a mortgage from Option One in 2003. In 2009, he sought to refinance that mortgage. Saade alleges that Option One was evasive and misinformed him that the request was under review when, in fact, it was not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A second alleged wrong-doing involves a series of assignments of the 2003 mortgage. According to plaintiff, Option One assigned the mortgage to American Home Mortgage Servicing, Inc., (\"AHMSI\"), the original mortgage servicer, which, in turn, assigned the mortgage to Homeward Residential, Inc. Homeward was eventually acquired by Ocwen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff's third claim focuses on an affidavit that Ocwen filed with the registry of deeds averring the authenticity of what plaintiff alleges were fabricated mortgage records produced by SCI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The final alleged misconduct involves Ocwen's servicing of the loan. Saade alleges that Ocwen placed \"forced insurance\" on the property, knowing that it was already adequately insured and causing Saade additional expense. In addition, Saade claims that his loan servicer was replaced without proper statutory notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff originally brought this suit in the Massachusetts Land Court (Suffolk County) in January, 2017. The case was removed to this Court later that month. Plaintiff filed an amended complaint in February, 2017, and the multiple motions to dismiss and for partial summary judgment followed\n   <em>\n    seriatim\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court will address each count of the amended complaint in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \"state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl. Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    550 U.S. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 570,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    167 L.Ed.2d 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007).

Furthermore, the Court must accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor.\n   <em>\n    Langadinos\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Am.

Threadbare recitals of the legal elements which are supported by mere conclusory statements do not suffice to state a cause of action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, a complaint does not state a claim for relief where the well-pled facts fail to warrant an inference of any more than the mere possibility of misconduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1950.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Count I-Intentional Misrepresentation and fraudulent assignment of mortgage\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Count I in the amended complaint alleges two different claims. First, plaintiff avers that Option One misrepresented to plaintiff the status of his refinancing application. Second, plaintiff contends that Option\n   One, AHMSI, Homeward and Ocwen fraudulently assigned the mortgage in a scheme facilitated by SCI. Saade alleges that SCI employees fraudulently represented themselves to be employees of the assignor (Sand Canyon) to fabricate the assignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Although intentional misrepresentation and fraud claims often arise in the context of a contract, Massachusetts state courts consistently construe such claims as torts.\n   <em>\n    Salois\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dime Sav. Bank of New York, FSB\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"978031\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/128/20/#p24\">\n    128 F.3d 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 24 (1st Cir. 1997). The issue presents a threshold determination for this Court. Actions of contract, under Massachusetts law, must be commenced within six years after the cause of action accrues, M.G.L. ch. 260, \u00a7 2, while tort actions must be commenced within three years. M.G.L. c. 260, \u00a7 2A. For \"[a]ctions arising on account of violations of any law intended for the protection of consumers,\" a plaintiff has four years to commence an action. M.G.L. ch. 260, \u00a7 5A (\"including but not limited to ... chapter ninety-three A\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Here, plaintiff's intentional misrepresentation claim arises from his frustrated attempts to refinance his mortgage in 2009. Plaintiff filed his complaint in this action in January, 2017, more than seven years after the complained-of conduct. This action is time barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The second claim within Count I arises from the allegedly fraudulent assignment of a mortgage executed on January 3, 2013 and recorded on January 31, 2013. Plaintiff filed his complaint in this action on January 31, 2017, exactly four years after the alleged wrongful conduct. Because the Massachusetts statute of limitations for tort claims is three years, the plaintiff's common law fraud claim is time barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff's claims for fraud and intentional misrepresentation are barred by the statute of limitations and therefore Count I will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Count II-Violations of\n     <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n      15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (e)(6),\n     <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=940%20C.M.R.%207\">\n      940 CMR 7\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .04 (1)(A) and\n     <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=209%20C.M.R.%2018\">\n      209 CMR 18\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .16(2) (Unfair debt collection)\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Ocwen and Homeward, Ocwen's subsidiary, transferred plaintiff's account between the two loan servicing companies to \"preclude a favorable refinancing term\" that would have lowered plaintiff's monthly payments. Such conduct, plaintiff contends, is a violation of federal and Massachusetts law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Section 1692 of Title 15 of the United States Code is better known as the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\"). The text of the FDCPA provides that a violation thereof \"is an unfair or deceptive act or practice in violation of\" the Federal Trade Commission Act (\"FTCA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692l(a). Chapter 93A of the Massachusetts General Laws incorporates the FTCA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McDermott\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Marcus, Errico, Emmer &amp; Brooks, P.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340554\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/775/109/#p122\">\n    775 F.3d 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 122 (1st Cir. 2014). Furthermore, Massachusetts has enacted its own equivalent of the FDCPA in M.G.L. c. 93, \u00a7 49. Accordingly, conduct that violates the FDCPA also violates the FTCA, Chapter 93A and Chapter 93, \u00a7 49.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McDermott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340554\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/775/109/#p122\">\n    775 F.3d at 122-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The plaintiff frames Count II as an FDCPA claim. That claim is time barred. The FDCPA requires a plaintiff to file suit within one year from the date on which the violation occurs. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(d). Here, plaintiff alleges that defendants violated the FDCPA by virtue of a notice on February 13, 2013 of a service transfer to Ocwen to occur on March 1, 2013. Plaintiff filed his complaint in this action in January, 31, 2017, more than three years after the alleged violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff's FDCPA claim is barred by the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff also relies in Count II on the Massachusetts Code of Regulations but the provisions upon which he relies do not provide for a private cause of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ishaq v.

Because plaintiff filed this action in January 2017, this claim is not time barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A viable claim for violation of the FDCPA requires that a plaintiff establish three elements: (1) that she was the object of collection activity arising from consumer debt, (2) that defendants are debt collectors as defined by the FDCPA, and (3) defendants engaged in an act or omission prohibited by the FDCPA.\n   <em>\n    O'Connor\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nantucket Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325453\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/992/24/#p30\">\n    992 F.Supp.2d 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 30 (D. Mass. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   To the extent that Ocwen's conduct in this matter can be found to be an unfair, unreasonable or deceptive collection of debt under M.G.L.c. 93 \u00a7 49, it can also constitute an unfair or deceptive act under Chapter 93A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The alleged misconduct by Ocwen does not concern the fraudulent assignment that occurred in 2013 but rather an affidavit filed with the registry of deeds averring the authenticity of the allegedly fraudulent assignment. Thus Count III will not be dismissed and Ocwen's motion in that regard will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiff does not, however, allege that Orlans Moran is a debt collector or that it acted with knowledge of the fraudulent assignment. Plaintiff has not stated a claim for violation of the FDCPA or \u00a7 49 against Orlans Moran. Orlans Moran's motion to dismiss will therefore be allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Count IV-Violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA)\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As a general rule, RESPA requires that a borrower be given 15 days' notice before his loan is transferred to a new servicer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202605\">\n    12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A).

His amended complaint, does not, however, assert any claims under that chapter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The First Circuit Court of Appeals has explained that the fact a plaintiff files a complaint\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   \"militates in favor of a liberal reading.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boivin\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Black\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11230906\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/225/36/#p43\">\n    225 F.3d 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 43 (1st Cir. 2000).
