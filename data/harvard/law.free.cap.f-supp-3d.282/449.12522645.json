(Docket Nos. 4729 and 4911.) Defendant Rosario alleges,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that this Court participated in plea negotiations contrary to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1) (\" Rule 11\"). (Docket Nos. 4911 and 4928.) Consequently, defendant Rosario seeks to withdraw his guilty plea, and requests that this case be reassigned to another district court judge. (Docket No. 4928 at p. 8.) For the following reasons, the Court: (1)\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   defendant Rosario's motion to withdraw his guilty plea, and (2)\n   <strong>\n    REFERS\n   </strong>\n   this case to the Clerk of the Court for reassignment to another district judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 2, 2008, a grand jury returned an indictment charging defendant\n   Rosario with, among other offenses, conspiring to possess with intent to distribute controlled substances within 1,000 feet of a public school, and conspiring to use and carry firearms during, and in relation to, a drug trafficking crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 4 and 2663.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After a three-month trial, a jury found defendant Rosario guilty of counts one through six of the indictment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docket No. 2663.) The Court also entered a preliminary order of forfeiture as to all defendants pursuant to what the government incorrectly labeled as count 14 of the indictment. (Docket No. 2664.) Defendant Rosario received a sentence of life imprisonment as to counts one through five (\n   <em>\n    i.e\n   </em>\n   ., the drug trafficking counts), and a consecutive 240-month sentence as to count six (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the firearm conspiracy count). (Docket No. 3136.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 25, 2015, the First Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the convictions of defendant Rosario and the other defendants who were tried with him because \"the closure of the courtroom during jury selection was a structural error.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Negr\u00f3n-Sostre\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273833\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/790/295/#p311\">\n    790 F.3d 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 311 (1st Cir. 2015). The First Circuit Court of Appeals, however, noted that \"there was sufficient evidence to establish that each of the defendants aided and abetted each of the others in the possession with intent to distribute all of the types of drugs charged.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273833\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/790/295/#p311\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273833\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/790/295/#p311\">\n    at 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The government pursued the conviction of defendant Rosario in a second prosecution. During the first status conference in anticipation of the second trial, \"the Court recommended defendants to consider the possibility of entering into plea agreements with the government\" because, according to the First Circuit Court of Appeals, \"there was sufficient evidence to sustain the defendants' convictions.\" (Docket No. 4550.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the final status conference held on February 17, 2016, the Court set a trial date for March 28, 2016. (Docket No. 4655.) Defendant Rosario filed a change of plea motion on February 24, 2016, noting that the parties reached a plea agreement. (Docket No. 4661.) The government and defendant Rosario proposed a \"C\" plea agreement pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 1(c)(1)(C) ; under the terms of the parties' agreement, defendant Rosario admitted guilt as to count one, with a stipulated offense level of 38. (Docket No. 4673.) At the change of plea hearing on March 1, 2016, the Court stated that \"[b]ecause this is a C plea, I will wait for the presentation of the pre-sentence investigation report before accepting the plea.\" (Docket No. 4672.) The United States Probation Officer assigned to this case filed the pre-sentence investigation report (\"PSR\") on May 18, 2016. (Docket No. 4724.) Defendant Rosario filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion to withdraw his guilty plea on May 31, 2016. (Docket No. 4729.) The Court never entered an order accepting defendant Rosario's guilty plea after the PSR was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion, defendant Rosario argues that he is entitled to withdraw his guilty plea for the following reasons: there was fabricated evidence presented at the first trial, that a \"package plea offer\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   coerced him to admit culpability, and the government withheld discovery. (Docket No. 4729.) In a separate motion, defendant Rosario further argued that the \"record shows a violation of the Criminal Procedure Rules: Plea Agreement Procedures, 11(c)(1).\" (Docket No. 4820 at p. 5.) The Court appointed Assistant Federal Defender Judith Mizner to represent defendant Rosario in January 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant Rosario, through counsel, then submitted a supplemental motion to withdraw his guilty plea on May 18, 2017. (Docket No. 4911).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Withdrawal of Defendant Rosario's Guilty Plea Pursuant to Rule 11(d)(1)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(d)(1), \"[a] defendant may withdraw a guilty a plea ... before the court accepts the plea, for any reason or no reason.\" At defendant Rosario's change of plea hearing, the Court explicitly stated that it would \"wait for the presentation of the pre-sentence investigation report\n   <strong>\n    before accepting the plea.\n   </strong>\n   \" (Docket No. 4867 at p. 27, emphasis added.) To date, the Court has never accepted defendant Rosario's plea. Accordingly, defendant Rosario has an absolute right to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In opposing defendant Rosario's motion, the government asserts that the Court accepted the guilty plea but not the plea agreement, arguing that \"acceptance of the plea and acceptance of the plea agreement are not the same thing.\" (Docket No. 4946 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The government's argument\n   that guilty pleas and plea agreements are distinct from each other is true, but irrelevant. Notably, at the change of plea hearing the Court did not state that its acceptance of the\n   <strong>\n    plea agreement\n   </strong>\n   remained contingent on the PSR; rather, it stated that it would review the PSR before accepting the \"\n   <strong>\n    plea\n   </strong>\n   .\" (Docket No. 4867 at p. 27, emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The circumstances of this case are similar to those of\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In\n   <em>\n    Shaker\n   </em>\n   , the trial judge stated the following at the change of plea hearing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   I am deferring my decision on acceptance or rejection of your plea of guilty and your plea agreement until after I've had an opportunity to study the Pre-sentence Report.

Following the change of plea hearing, but before the trial judge accepted the plea, the defendant moved to withdraw his plea; the trial judge denied the motion. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals held that, because the district court had not accepted the defendant's guilty plea, he \"should have permitted [defendant] to withdraw his plea freely, without any inquiry into [defendant's] reasons for seeking to set it aside.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9395292\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/279/494/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 498 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

(Docket No. 4925.) The Court, according to the government, merely inquired about plea negotiations, never foreclosing the possibility of a trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340003\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/774/812/#p820\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

(Docket No. 4925 at p. 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A glaring omission from the government's opposition is any reference to what the Court actually said during the status conferences in this case. The government never cites to the status conference transcripts, failing to confront the comments that allegedly transgressed Rule 11. For example, although the Court never addressed defendant Rosario personally before the change of plea hearing, the Court instructed defense counsel to communicate its impressions regarding the propriety of the plea agreement to defendant Rosario. The Court stated to defense counsel: \"You've got to hammer it into their heads, 25 years is better than life imprisonment.\" (Docket No. 4741 at p. 15.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 4-8.) The government does, however, suggest implicitly that these cases are distinguishable because they involve comments from the bench during or on the eve of trial, or during a change of plea hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) By contrast, in this case the Court's allegedly inappropriate comments occurred during status conferences. This is a difference without significance for purposes of Rule 11, because the case law teaches that what matters in terms of the timing of a judge's comments for Rule 11 purposes is whether the comments precede or post-date the defendant's acceptance of a plea offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Hemphill\n   </em>\n   , for instance, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals determined that a trial judge's comments to the defendant concerning the benefits of plea agreement\n   <strong>\n    after\n   </strong>\n   the defendant had decided to accept the same were not improper because a \"district court is expected to take an active role in evaluating a plea agreement, once it is disclosed.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5887696\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/748/666/\">\n    748 F.3d at 672-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Yet, the Court's allegedly improper comments in this case took place during the course of\n   <strong>\n    ongoing\n   </strong>\n   plea negotiations between the parties.

The government, nonetheless, contends that \"in the present case, there were no objections to what defendant claims was judicial participation in plea negotiations.\" (Docket No. 4925 at pp. 3-4.) This assertion has no basis in fact. Defendant Rosario objected to the voluntariness of his plea subsequent to the change of plea hearing, but before sentencing and before the Court ever accepted his plea. (Docket Nos. 4729 and 4911.)

Indeed, the Court's comments are most analogous to those made by the trial judge in\n   <em>\n    Bruce\n   </em>\n   , a case in which the trial judge implored defendants to \"think carefully\" about the fact that they faced\n   <strong>\n    life sentences\n   </strong>\n   if convicted at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11289199\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/976/552/#p555\">\n    976 F.2d at 555, 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
