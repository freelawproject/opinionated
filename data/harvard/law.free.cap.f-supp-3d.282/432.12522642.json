The Technology\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The '709 patent issued in February, 2007. The '589 patent is a continuation of the '709 patent and issued in July, 2010. The patents relate to spring-enabled desktop staplers. The spring present in the stapler is linked to a striker and, when the striker is raised and released, the stored energy of the spring drives the staple through a \"stack of papers\". When compared with a conventional desktop stapler, the spring-enabled desktop stapler has a lower operating force which makes it easier to use with an extended hand on a desk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.

In support of its contention, defendant avers that the intrinsic evidence shows that 1) the \"body\", \"base\" and \"handle\" are listed as separate elements in every disputed claim, 2) the components must be separate structures so they can connect with each other as is claimed and 3) each visual embodiment shows the three components as separate structures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Furthermore, defendant submits that plaintiffs are estopped from contending that the \"handle\" and \"body\" are anything but separate because of the position adopted by plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Accentra, Inc. and WorkTools, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Staples, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 07-5862,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%2012113238\">\n    2013 WL 12113238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C.D. Cal. June 5, 2013) [hereinafter \"the\n   <em>\n    Accentra\n   </em>\n   case\"]. Although Amax was not a party to that case, WorkTools was a party. Defendant suggests that Amax is also bound by issue preclusion because it acquired the assets of Accentra in 2012, thereby establishing privity with Accentra.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs dispute defendant's contention that the three terms should be construed as structures separate from each other. Instead, plaintiffs assert that the Court should adopt the plain and ordinary meaning of the terms \"base\" and \"handle\". Plaintiffs submit that the \"body\" is a multi-part structure that houses components. They contest defendant's constructions which add the limitation \"separate\" to each component and maintain that there is nothing in the intrinsic evidence requiring separateness of each component.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs also reject ACCO's contention that they are estopped from presenting their proposed constructions because they were not a party to the\n   <em>\n    Accentra\n   </em>\n   case and that litigation did not involve the '589 patent. Defendant rejoins that because the\n   <em>\n    Accentra\n   </em>\n   case involved the '709 patent\n   which is a continuation of the '589 patent, estoppel applies in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The claim language does not, as defendant contends, require a reading that the connected components are distinct from one another. Defendant's proposed construction imports the limitation \"separate\" to the terms. The ordinary meaning of \"separate,\" however, suggests components that are\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [p]arted, divided, or withdrawn from others; disjoined, disconnected, detached, set or kept apart.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Electro Scientific Indus.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dynamic Details, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11362251\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/307/1343/\">\n    307 F.3d 1343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed. Cir. 2002). Contrary to defendant's suggestion, the base, for example, need not be \"separate\" from the body in order to be \"pivotably attached to the body\" as is required in claim 1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Powell\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Home Depot U.S.A., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879829\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/663/1221/#p1231\">\n    663 F.3d 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1231 (Fed.

Similarly, the handle need not be \"separate\" from the body in order to be \"hinged to the body\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendant relies on\n   <em>\n    Becton, Dickinson &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tyco Healthcare Grp., LP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050211\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/1249/\">\n    616 F.3d 1249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed. Cir. 2010) in its contention that separately listed claim elements must be constructed as distinct, separate components. In\n   <em>\n    Becton\n   </em>\n   , however, the claim language did not \"suggest that the hinged arm and the spring [could] be the same structure\".\n   <em>\n    Powell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879829\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/663/1221/#p1231\">\n    663 F.3d at 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Cir. 2010) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The claim language at issue here does not indicate that the three components must be physically separate. The use of two terms within a claim can indicate that those components have distinct meanings without requiring that the components represent separate structures.\n   <em>\n    Applied Med. Resources Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Surgical Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6045930\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/448/1324/\">\n    448 F.3d 1324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1333 n.3 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (making clear that the use of two terms in a claim merely \"requires that they connote different\n   <em>\n    meanings\n   </em>\n   , not that they necessarily refer to two different\n   <em>\n    structures\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis in original)). Here, the specification and figures support a reading of the claims that makes clear that the body can be connected to and operable with the base and the handle and need not be physically detached. The plain language of the claims include no \"separate structures\" limitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendant's reliance on judicial estoppel is unavailing here. As defendant notes, the Federal Circuit has held that \"the same claim term in the same patent or related patents carries the same construed meaning\".\n   <em>\n    Omega Engineering, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Raytek Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1530191\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/334/1314/#p1334\">\n    334 F.3d 1314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2003). As this Court ruled in its summary judgment order, however,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   there is a material difference between the previously litigated '709 patent claims and the asserted claims of the '589 patent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Amax, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Acco Brands Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-10695,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264622\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/301/\">\n    268 F.Supp.3d 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203399995\">\n    2017 WL 3399995\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Mass. Aug. 8, 2017). Furthermore, the district court in the\n   <em>\n    Accentra\n   </em>\n   case did not construe the terms \"handle\", \"base\" or \"body\" in its claim construction order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Accentra, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Staples, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 07-05862,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%205787777\">\n    2008 WL 5787777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C.D. Cal. Dec. 23, 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Accordingly, the Court will decline to import the negative limitation of \"separate\" into each asserted claim. The plain language of the claims does not require a construction of three separate structures for the body, base and handle. Instead, the Court will construe the three terms to comport with their ordinary meanings and will adopt the plaintiffs' proposed constructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    2. \"a channel of the body\" (Claim 1 of the '589 patent )\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Here, the parties dispute the phrase \"a channel of the body\" which appears in claim 1. Claim 1 describes \"a striker moving within a channel of the body\". Defendant adds the additional wording \"partially enclosed passage\" to describe the \"U\"-shaped passage shown in the specification. Plaintiffs contend that the channel is not truly enclosed because the \"U\"-shaped passage leaves at least one side open.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendant's proposal adds an additional limitation to the claim that is not supported by the claim language or the specification. The Federal Circuit has reiterated that it is not the district court's role in construing claims \"to redefine claim recitations or to read limitations into the claims\" but rather to \"give meaning to limitations\n   <em>\n    actually contained\n   </em>\n   in the claims\".\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am. Piledriving Equip.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Geoquip, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197103\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/637/1324/\">\n    637 F.3d 1324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed. Cir. 2011) (emphasis added). Accordingly, the Court concludes that no further construction is needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    3. \"bumper\" (Claims 6, 13 and 22 of the '589 patent )\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendant's proposed construction imports the dictionary definition of \"bumper\" which emphasizes its role in \"absorbing shock\". By contrast, plaintiffs' construction tracks the claim language and focuses on \"provid[ing] a stop for the spring. Plaintiffs' construction more accurately reflects the language of the claim terms in the patent.

The Federal Circuit has cautioned district courts to avoid \"heavy reliance\" on dictionary definitions because they can often transform the language of the claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8948489\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/415/1303/#p1312\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' construction more accurately reflects the claim language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    4. \"a handle rest position\" (Claims 1, 2, 7, 16 and 18 of the '589 patent )\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The parties dispute whether \"a handle rest position\" most accurately describes the handle in relation to the body or the base. Plaintiffs maintain that the claim language refers to the handle rest position relative to the body and contest defendant's attempt to add the additional limitation of \"handle pressing area\" that is not found in claims 1 or 2. Defendant counters that the body and base are both below the handle and disputes plaintiffs' contention that \"handle pressing area\" is an added term because the handle is defined as \"having a pressing area near a front end thereof\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendant also contends that plaintiffs are judicially estopped from proposing their construction because of a construction adopted by the district court in the\n   <em>\n    Accentra\n   </em>\n   case. As already noted, however, the plaintiffs in the\n   <em>\n    Accentra\n   </em>\n   case did not assert claims from the '589 patent and asserted different claims from the '709 patent than those asserted here. Claims 24 and 27 of the '709 patent, asserted in the\n   <em>\n    Accentra\n   </em>\n   case, refer to the handle rest position in relation to the \"base\" rather than to the \"body\". On the other hand, the claim language in the '589 patent refers to the handle rest position in relation to the \"body\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The plain language of the claims supports plaintiffs' construction. The claims specifically refer to the handle rest position \" where the handle is moved to a position farthest away from the body\" as opposed to the base. Defendant's proposed construction improperly imports a limitation\n   from the specification contrary to the plain language of the claim.\n   <em>\n    Liebel-Flarsheim Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Medrad, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9296196\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/358/898/#p913\">\n    358 F.3d 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 913 (Fed.

They also contest whether the construction should refer to the position of the handle or just the striker. Finally, they disagree about whether the asserted claims include the limitation of the \"staple loading chamber\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendant suggests that there is nothing in the claim language that requires the pre-release position to refer to the time \"immediately\" before the power spring ejects. Plaintiffs do not otherwise give support for their contention that the word \"immediately\" is necessary. Their proposed construction of \"immediately before\" thus adds unnecessary language to the subject claim terms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    IXYS Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"405169\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/114/1149/#p1152\">\n    114 F.3d 1149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1152 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (rejecting construction of a term that \"contribute[d] nothing but meaningless verbiage\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Moreover, the plain language of the claim contemplates that at the \"pre-release position\", the striker has already been freed. For example, the language in claim 1 denotes that when the striker is at the pre-release position of the handle, \"the striker under bias from the power spring ejects the staple\". The pre-release position is not consistent with a time \"immediately before\" the striker is freed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The defendant's proposed construction, however, improperly conflates the handle position and the striker position. The plain language of the claims refers to the \"handle\" pre-release position and not the \"striker\" pre-release position. Furthermore, the term \"staple loading chamber\" is found in only some dependent claims and not all independent claims. There is a presumption that dependent claim limitations are not automatically included in the independent claims.\n   <em>\n    GE Lighting Sols., LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    AgiLight, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4066341\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/750/1304/#p1310\">\n    750 F.3d 1304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1310 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (finding that the district court \"erred by importing limitations from the dependent claims of the [patent] into the independent claims\"). Thus, the court declines to import the \"staple loading chamber\" limitation here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the Court will adopt defendant's construction with the exception that it will not include the terms \"striker\" or \"staple loading chamber\". \" Pre-release position\" is construed as: \"the position of the handle wherein the power spring causes the striker under bias from the power spring to eject a staple\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    6. \"a lever\" (Claims 9 and 18 of the '589 patent )\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The parties dispute whether the term \"lever\" is readily understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art of staplers without further construction. Plaintiffs aver that nothing in the claim language suggests that the lever must be physically separate such that the \"separate structure\" language is required. Moreover, plaintiffs contend that the three points described in defendant's construction add additional limitations not found in the claim language. Defendant disputes that the word \"lever\" is readily understood without a construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Just as with the terms \"handle,\" \"base\" and \"body,\" the Court declines to import the separate structures limitation here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Powell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879829\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/663/1221/#p1231\">\n    663 F.3d at 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The inclusion of the three-point description constitutes\n   unnecessary verbiage. The claim language here makes the construction of \"lever\" clear because the lever is described as \"pivot[ing] within the body to link the power spring\". The description of the pivot obviates the need for the three point limitation proposed by defendant. Accordingly, the meaning of the word \"lever\" is clear and the description of the three pivot points is unnecessary.\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8948489\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/415/1303/#p1312\">\n    415 F.3d at 1314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiffs reply that the Court should not import that negative construction because, with respect to the first term, it appears only in the preamble, and with respect to the second and third, they appear only in dependent claims 10 and 19, respectively. Defendant avers that the prosecution history supports its reading of the terms because the applicant distinguished prior art, the Perez stapler, by describing \"[t]he flat base of Perez\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Although evidence from prosecution history is often relevant to \"shed useful light on the relevant art,\" the Federal Circuit has emphasized that it is\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   less significant than the intrinsic record in determining the legally operative meaning of claim language.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8948489\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/415/1303/#p1312\">\n    415 F.3d at 1317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citation omitted).

The evidence proffered by defendant from the prosecution history lacks a clear specification of the flat base stapler and a concise picture of how the inventor understood that limitation during the prosecution. Accordingly, the court will not import the broad limitation to limit otherwise clear claim language here. No further construction is necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Indefiniteness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The parties also dispute whether six sets of claims are indefinite and whether the Court should consider indefiniteness at this stage of the case. Defendant contends that all asserted claims but one are invalid as indefinite because they contain both apparatus claims and method steps. According to defendant, the preamble to each claim makes clear that an apparatus (the stapler) is being claimed. Each claim, however, also recites a method step. For example, defendant points to claim 2, which states that \"the handle, at the location of the pressing area, moves one inch toward the body\". Defendant emphasizes that these limitations\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   an action by the user and that the limitations do not merely describe a stapler that is\n   <em>\n    capable\n   </em>\n   of movement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Furthermore, defendant submits that five additional groups of claim terms are indefinite because they fail to claim distinctly the subject matter that the applicant regards as the invention. For example, defendant avers that \"stack of papers\" is indefinite because it fails to specify the number of sheets of paper in the \"stack\" or to give a person of ordinary skill in the art any way to determine whether a given stapler would succeed in binding a \"stack of papers\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Plaintiffs maintain that the Court should not consider arguments of indefiniteness at the\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   stage. They suggest that, although indefiniteness is ultimately a question of law, the issue is often predicated on underlying questions of fact. Plaintiffs also dispute defendant's specific contentions that many of the claims are indefinite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The requirement that claims be definite is set forth in the second paragraph of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20112\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which provides that claims must particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention. The requirement essentially serves a public notice function and assures that patent claims will be \"sufficiently precise to permit a potential competitor to determine whether or not he is infringing\".\n   <em>\n    Amgen Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hoechst Marion Roussel, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9388209\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/314/1313/#p1342\">\n    314 F.3d 1313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1342 (Fed.
