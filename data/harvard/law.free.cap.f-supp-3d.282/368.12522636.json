Sullivan, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In January 2014, a water sprinkler burst inside the condominium property located at 1441 Rhode Island Avenue, NW in the District of Columbia. The insurer of the 1441 Rhode Island Avenue Condominium Association (\"Association\"), plaintiff Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance Company (\"Philadelphia Indemnity\"), compensated the Association for its losses. Philadelphia Indemnity, as subrogee of the Association, then filed this action against defendant Lend Lease (U.S.) Construction, Inc. (\"Lend Lease\") for negligence due to its alleged faulty construction of the condominium building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On March 18, 2016, the Court ordered limited discovery on the question of whether the Association should be deemed a successor of the building's original owner, Fairfield D.C. Limited Partnership (\"Fairfield\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Philadelphia Indem. Ins. Co. v.

The parties subsequently engaged in discovery on this limited issue. Lend Lease now moves for summary judgment on the ground that Philadelphia Indemnity's insured-the Association-is a successor of Fairfield, and therefore, Philadelphia Indemnity's action is barred by the waiver-of-subrogation clause contained in the contract between Lend Lease and Fairfield.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 22. As set forth below, because a genuine dispute of material fact remains as to whether the Association is a successor to Fairfield, Lend Lease's motion for summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

J. (\"Pl.'s Opp.\") at 2, ECF No. 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The General Conditions Contract contains a waiver of subrogation clause that provides that the Owner and Lend Lease \"waive all rights\" against one another \"for damages caused by fire or other causes of loss to the extent covered by property insurance.\" General Conditions Contract \u00b6 11.4.7. The General Conditions Contract also specifies that the waiver-of-subrogation applies to insurance policies purchased after the construction period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.4.5.

Sale of Property to 1441 LLC and Completion of Construction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2003, \"about three quarters of the way into the project,\" Fairfield informed Lend Lease that it intended to sell the property to 1441 Rhode Island, LLC (\"1441 LLC\"), a limited liability company formed by Neil Gehani, Robert Berry, and Enrico Plati for the purpose of purchasing the property.

There is no evidence that any of the members of 1441 LLC received a copy of the Contract between Fairfield and Lend Lease either prior to or after the sale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp. Ex. 6, Deposition of Robert Berry (\"Pl.'s Berry Dep.\") 114:19-22, ECF No. 23-6; Pl.'s Opp. Ex. 9, Deposition of Neil Gehani 40:22-41:2, 42:5-6, ECF No. 23-9; Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. R, Deposition of Lawrence Bogard 17:11-17, ECF No. 22-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Fairfield and 1441 LLC closed on the property at the end of February 2004.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s SMF \u00b6 9 (stating that property closing occurred on February 28, 2004); Pl.'s Opp. at 4 (stating that 1441 LLC became the deeded owner of the property on February 26, 2004). 1441 LLC's involvement with the property began prior to closing, when construction was \"nearly complete.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s SMF \u00b6 10. The parties dispute the level of involvement 1441 LLC had in the property during this period. According to plaintiff, 1441 LLC's involvement was \"limited\" to exercising \"what ever rights Fairfield and Defendant saw fit to grant [it],\" which only included participation in the \"punch list process\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and nothing\n   more. Pl.'s Opp. at 10-11. Lend Lease, on the other hand, contends that 1441 LLC took an \"active role\" in inspecting the property \"in an effort to identify any 'imperfections' it wanted Lend Lease to fix.\" Def.'s SMF \u00b6\u00b6 9, 12-18. For example, according to Lend Lease, as part of the punch-list process, a representative from 1441 LLC inspected each of the 157 condominium units in the building and, together with a representative from Fairfield, signed a \"New Construction Interior Acceptance Letter\" to confirm inspection and note any outstanding deficiencies. Def.'s SMF \u00b6\u00b6 12-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Contract included a one-year warranty that was made to Fairfield. Def.'s SMF \u00b6 25. Fairfield subsequently assigned its warranty rights to 1441 LLC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26; Pl.'s Opp. at 11 (agreeing that \"1441 LLC acquired Fairfield's one-year warranty from [Lend Lease] by assignment\"). The parties dispute the mechanism through which that one-year warranty was assigned. Plaintiff points to a copy of an agreement titled Assignment of Warranties and Other Contractual Rights (\"Assignment Agreement\"). Pl.'s Opp. at 11 (citing Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. E, ECF No. 22-7). Lend Lease asserts that the assignment of warranty rights was made through a Public Offering Statement issued in connection with forming the condominium. Def.'s SMF \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The one-year warranty provision in the Contract obligated Lend Lease to \"require each Subcontractor to assume the obligations [of the one-year warranty] at Subcontractor's sole cost and expense with respect to work performed by each Subcontractor.\" General Conditions Contract \u00a7 12.2.2.1. Because 1441 LLC was in the process of purchasing the building, all of Lend Lease's subcontractors issued their standard one-year warranties to 1441 LLC instead of Fairfield. Def.'s SMF \u00b6 28; Pl.'s Opp. at 11 (acknowledging that, \"between December 18, 2003 and May 5, 2004, subcontractors issued one-year warranties on Defendant form warranties listing the Property owner as B &amp; P Development, LLC\" and that \"B &amp; P Development, LLC is a place holder for 1441 LLC\"). In addition, 1441 LLC paid Lend Lease $40,846.71 for an extended warranty from each subcontractor. Def.'s SMF \u00b6 30; Pl.'s Opp. at 5 (\"Prior to the expiration of the one-year warranties under the contract between Fairfield and Defendant, 1441 LLC purchased an extended warranty on April 14, 2004.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On April 9, 2004, Fairfield made the final payment for under the Contract to Lend Lease. Def.'s SMF \u00b6\u00b6 32-33; Pl.'s Opp. at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Formation of the Condominium Association and Dissolution of 1441 LLC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In March 2004, 1441 LLC filed a Condominium Declaration that ultimately formed the 1441 Rhode Island Avenue Condominium and the related Condominium Association. Def.'s SMF \u00b6 34; Pl.'s Opp. at 6. The Condominium Bylaws were also filed at this time. Pl.'s Opp. at 2. The Declaration and Bylaws together \"conveyed all of 1441 LLC's rights and responsibilities to the Unit Owners Association.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Subsequently, the Association purchased property-damage insurance from plaintiff Philadelphia Indemnity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Both Mr. Gehani and Mr. Berry purchased condominium units in the building and, when the Association created a Board in July 2004, Mr. Gehani was elected as one of its five founding members. Def.'s SMF \u00b6\u00b6 35-36; Pl.'s Opp. at 6. According to the Association's representative, Mr. Gehani was elected in part because the Association thought it useful to have someone associated with 1441 LLC on the Board. Def.'s SMF \u00b6 37; Pl.'s Opp. at 6 (conceding there was managerial overlap\n   between 1441 LLC and the Association, but characterizing that overlap as \"deminimis\"). After Mr. Gehani sold his unit and resigned from the Board in the spring of 2006, he was immediately replaced by Mr. Berry, who served on the Board until June 2010. Def.'s SMF \u00b6\u00b6 36-39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Because 1441 LLC had been created for the purpose of marketing, selling, and delivering the condominium units and then transitioning the property-and because those condominiums were sold \"very, very quickly\"-1441 LLC's business was wrapped up by 2005. Def.'s SMF \u00b6\u00b6 55-56; Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. D, Deposition of Neil Gehani 58:20-59:20, ECF No. 22-6. By January 28, 2006, 1441 LLC had been involuntarily dissolved. Def.'s SMF \u00b6 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Association's Management of the Building\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As a member of the Association's Board, Mr. Berry served as the \"middle man or intermediary\" between the Board and Lend Lease when repairs needed to be made in accordance with the warranties. Def.'s SMF \u00b6 40. In so doing, Mr. Berry testified that he sometimes acted on behalf of 1441 LLC and at other times acted on behalf of the Board.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Indeed, even in 2009-several years after 1441 LLC had been dissolved-Mr. Berry continued to communicate with Lend Lease and its subcontractors on behalf of both the Board and 1441 LLC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Within one year of completion of construction, three leaks were found in the building.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. In each of those instances, Mr. Berry requested repairs in accordance with the warranties assigned to or purchased by 1441 LLC, and Lend Lease agreed to coordinate and oversee the repair work done by its subcontractors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. In each instance, neither 1441 LLC nor the Association paid for any of the repair work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Likewise, when additional repair work was required in 2005 and 2006 with respect to water heaters and water pumps, Mr. Berry contacted Lend Lease and its subcontractors who addressed the problems in accordance with the extended warranties purchased by 1441 LLC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In January 2014, a water sprinkler line burst on the property, allegedly causing water to flow into multiple units and the common area.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 7-11. According to an engineer hired by Philadelphia Indemnity to examine the site, the water intrusion stemmed \"from inadequate insulation surrounding the sprinkler system pipe and/or other protective devices to maintain the temperature above freezing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. As a result of the burst pipe, the Association incurred losses in the amount of $107,552.74, which were paid by Philadelphia Indemnity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Instant Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Philadelphia Indemnity filed suit for breach of contract and negligence against Lend Lease in D.C. Superior Court on April 20, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1-2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lend Lease removed the action to this Court and moved for judgment on the pleadings, asserting that Philadelphia Indemnity's negligence claim was barred by the waiver-of-subrogation clause in the construction contract entered into by Fairfield and Lend Lease.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal, ECF No. 1;\n   <em>\n    Philadelphia Indem.

Specifically, Lend Lease argues that (1) 1441 LLC is a successor or assignee of Fairfield; and (2) the Association is a successor of 1441 LLC. Accordingly, Lend Lease claims that the Contract's waiver-of-subrogation clause applies to the Association and bars Philadelphia Indemnity's negligence claim. Philadelphia Indemnity counters that its negligence claim is not governed by the Contract's provisions and that, in any event, the Association is not Fairfield's successor and therefore not bound by the terms of the Contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As set forth below, the Court finds that, while the Contract's broad waiver-of-subrogation clause would encompass negligence claims, genuine factual disputes preclude a definitive finding as to whether 1441 LLC is a successor or assignee of Fairfield based on the record created by the parties. Moreover, because the Court finds that a genuine dispute of material fact exists as to whether 1441 LLC is a successor or assignee of Fairfield, the Court need not reach the question of whether the Association is a successor of 1441 LLC. Accordingly, the Court denies Lend Lease's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Instead, it requires the Court to evaluate the parties' conduct to determine whether they intended to be bound by the Contract's terms. Lend Lease argues that the language in the Assignment Agreement is contradicted by the language in the signed Public Offering Statement. Def.'s Mem. at 13. But Lend Lease does not point to any evidence-other than the fact that one document is signed and the other is not-conclusively establishing that the parties intended for the terms set forth in the Public Offering Statement to govern. To the contrary, Mr. Berry testified that it was his understanding that \"Fairfield ... was selling [1441 LLC] the building and we were assuming any\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     rights\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   that they had.\" Def.'s Berry Dep. 34:3-7 (emphasis added). As such, a factual dispute exists as to whether Fairfield and 1441 LLC intended to create an assignment of certain rights without also assigning the burdens associated with the Contract. The answer to this factual question is necessary to resolve whether 1441 LLC was Fairfield's successor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am. Prop. Const. Co. v.
