In its investigative role, Cornucopia took a tour of Shamrock Farm Dairies (Shamrock) in late 2008 to determine if the company was in compliance with its organic certificate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    \u00b6 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
