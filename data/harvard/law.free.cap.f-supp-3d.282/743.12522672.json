Here, DTI submitted no affidavits in conjunction with its motion. Nonetheless, DTI argues, the entire preliminary injunction proceeding is relevant to this question and therefore the transcripts from the hearing provide competent evidence that the Court can consider. Pl. Reply 2. While DTI is correct that the sworn testimony of witnesses during the hearing qualifies as competent evidence, the only relevant piece of this evidence that DTI cites in its briefs is the following colloquy between the Court and Adam Seskis, DTI's company's Chief Integration Officer:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   THE COURT: The question was: Can you tell me what your findings were on the potential harm to the company. Don't tell me what you looked at. What were the findings, if any, that you made as to the potential harm to the company?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   THE WITNESS: We saw risk in our financial plan and we saw harm to our good will tied to the client relationships that we had in addition-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   THE COURT: What was the basis for those conclusions?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   THE WITNESS: Perception in the marketplace and four of our top salespeople departing at the same time going to a competitor, the disruption to a large number of clients that those individuals represented that were not able to have\n   an orderly transition to other relationship individuals, in addition to having our confidential information in the hands of a competitor at that time based on the forensic analysis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Tr. at 532, ECF No. 93. Aside from the fact that DTI expected the loss of four key employees to cause disruption, which is not relevant to the redaction request, this testimony merely asserts that having \"confidential information in the hands of a competitor\" would cause DTI harm, an entirely conclusory statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Thus plaintiffs do not cite any examples from the record explaining how the 120 passages they seek to redact would harm them if they were made public. Nor do plaintiffs, as discussed below, cite legal authority supporting redacting the sort of information they propose to seal here. The Court considers each of DTI's three categories in turn:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (1)\n   <em>\n    Business Strategies, Market Share, and Financials\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   DTI divides its first heading-business strategies, market share, and financials-into three subcategories: (A) the company's expansion into Canada and Washington, D.C., (B) the revenue attributable to the Employee Defendants, and (C) the company's general financial performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (A)\n   <em>\n    DTI's Expansion in Canada and Washington, D.C.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs acknowledge that \"DTI's general presence in Canada and Washington, D.C. is not confidential, proprietary, or trade secret information.\" Pl. Mem 4. DTI argues instead that \"information about its profitability in these markets and how DTI entered them is.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4080692\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/487/374/#p375\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But DTI nonetheless seeks to redact many references that contain little more than a mention of Canada or Washington, D.C.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. at 115-21, ECF No. 87 (seeking to redact 26 different references to Canada or D.C.); Def. Mem., Ex. 1 (collecting Canada references, Nos. 1-3, 5-6, 21-24, 27-31, 33, 36, 47-49, 72-73, 75-77, 79-80, 82, 104-08, 112-13, 119, and D.C. references, Nos. 1-3, 6, 24-26, 32, 72-73, 75-78, 81, 83, 112, 119).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court finds no reason to redact these references. First, plaintiffs have already publicly disclosed that they do business in Canada and D.C. (their website publicly states that they operate in these regions, they disclosed the information in an unredacted form in their amended complaint, and they did not require that defendants redact this information from their post-hearing summations). Second, the Court already held that \"there is nothing 'confidential' about the fact that Canada and Washington, D.C. have law firms and corporate legal departments requiring document review services.\" July 5 Opinion at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   DTI points to two instances in the transcripts where DTI's operations in D.C. and Canada are tied to specific information about DTI's activities: (1) a passage regarding the dollar amount of DTI's initial investments in Canada, Pl. Mem., Ex. 1C at 498:22-499:8, and (2) a passage regarding the dollar amount of the subsequent growth of DTI's Canadian revenues,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4080692\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/487/374/#p375\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4080692\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/487/374/#p375\">\n    at 500:20-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In their briefs, plaintiffs argue that this information could be used by \"savvy competitors\" to adjust its \"business plans and gain a commercial advantage over DTI in the marketplace.\" Pl. Mem. 4. This assertion is both hypothetical and conclusory. Plaintiffs nowhere explain\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   this high-level information could be used by a competitor to gain a commercial advantage. Nor do plaintiffs explain the potential magnitude of the harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As plaintiffs do not marshal the sort of specific evidence that is required to overcome the presumption of public access, the\n   Court cannot grant plaintiffs' motion to redact these references.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (B)\n   <em>\n    Revenue Attributable to the Employee Defendants\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs also want to redact a series of references to the sales attributable to the Employee Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem., Ex. 1, Nos. 37, 44, 58, 68, 70-71, 103, 111. The Court, however, already held, more generally, that \"[t]he Individual Defendants' general revenue numbers for 2011 to 2016 ... are not trade secrets.\" July 5 Opinion at 20 n.11. Moreover, plaintiffs submit no competent evidence for the Court to weigh as to how this information would harm them if it were made publicly available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In one passage cited by defendants, for example, a witness tells the Court approximately how much revenue was generated by the Employee Defendants in a particular market and what percentage of aggregate sales the Employee Defendants generated in those markets in 2016. But plaintiffs nowhere explain how this information would harm them. They merely note that DTI \"has a significant interest in insuring that this confidential business information remains private, as it could be used by competitors to DTI's financial detriment.\" \"Business strategies, market share, and financial data,\" they continue, \"are the sort of material that courts have frequently ordered redacted.\" Pl. Mem. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The cases plaintiffs cite in support of this proposition all involve specific findings of how disclosure of certain pieces of detailed information would cause harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.

Thus, the Court has no basis to redact these portions of the hearing transcript.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (C)\n   <em>\n    DTI's General Financial Performance\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiffs also propose to redact information regarding DTI's general revenue, Def.

As plaintiffs have the burden to demonstrate that the release of this information would \"work a clearly defined and very serious injury,\" and they provide no competent evidence regarding how these general pieces of information could be used to do\n   so, there is no basis for the Court to redact these portions of the hearing transcript.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (2)\n   <em>\n    Information about DTI's Internal Business Operations and Processes\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiffs next argue that information about their \"confidential business affairs\" such as what directives were given by DTI management to employees and other aspects of how DTI manages client relationships should be redacted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem., Ex. 1, Nos. 34-35, 69. Plaintiffs specifically draw attention to two of these three redaction requests, Pl. Mem., Ex. 1B at 282:3-6 and Ex. 1A at 154:22-155:7. But there is no competent evidence in the record to support a finding that the public release of these facts would harm DTI. Each involves fairly innocuous information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As to the latter information about internal management issues, there is no indication that testimony about the Individual Defendants' reasons for leaving DTI would cause DTI economic harm. And even if it did cause harm, this sort of information is relevant to understanding the instant dispute.

In their briefs, plaintiffs draw attention to three specific references, one discussing specific DTI customers that one of the Individual Defendants reached out to after his resignation (Pl.

Mem., Ex. 1C at 519:13-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The first two references are among the many that the Court already found to be not confidential as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   July 5 Opinion, at 19-20. Indeed, DTI itself has not previously treated this sort of information as if it were confidential. For example, during the hearing, DTI's own counsel conceded that two of DTI's client names were not confidential. Tr. at 12, ECF No. 87. Also during the hearing, one of DTI's witness conceded that another client name was not confidential. Tr. at 524-25, ECF No. 93. Further, in their summation following the hearing, plaintiffs' publicly filed papers including references to two other clients.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 60. And, DTI sent one of the Employee Defendants a spreadsheet containing all of the relevant client names after that defendant had left DTI and was a member of the public. Thus with regard to the identities of DTI's clients, generally, \"the proverbial cat is out of the bag,\" and plaintiffs' request for redaction is thus \"moot.\"\n   <em>\n    SOHC, Inc. v.

Plaintiffs do not explain how this information could be used to harm either DTI or DTI's client. Indeed, this high-level description of the work DTI performed for this client hardly seems like sensitive client information. In all likelihood, the antitrust matter is already a matter of public record. In the absence of some concrete reason as to why the Court should seal this reference, some explanation as to how this information could cause harm, the Court has no basis for redacting these general references to client identities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Ultimately, portions of hearing transcripts may be redacted only \"if specific, on the record findings are made demonstrating that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Lugosch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"936330\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/435/110/#p119\">\n    435 F.3d at 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re New York Times Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747776\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/828/110/#p116\">\n    828 F.2d 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 116 (2d Cir. 1987) (internal quotations omitted)). \"Broad and general findings ... are not sufficient to justify closure.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747776\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/828/110/#p116\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As plaintiffs do not cite competent evidence suggesting that public release of these 120 passages would cause harm, there is no basis for the Court to make specific findings to support redaction.
