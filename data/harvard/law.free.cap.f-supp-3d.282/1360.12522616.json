VANCE, Chair\n  <strong>\n   Before the Panel:\n  </strong>\n  <footnotemark>\n   *\n  </footnotemark>\n  Plaintiffs in the District of Utah\n  <em>\n   Mitchell\n  </em>\n  action move under\n  <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201407\">\n   28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407\n  </extracted-citation>\n  to centralize pretrial proceedings in this litigation in the District of Utah. Plaintiffs in the Northern District of California\n  <em>\n   Jabbari\n  </em>\n  action oppose centralization or, alternatively, support centralization in the Northern District of California. All other plaintiffs support centralization and variously support the District of Utah, the District of New Jersey, the Northern District of California, the Northern District of Alabama, the Middle District of Florida, or the Central District of California as transferee district. Defendants Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., and Wells Fargo &amp; Company (together, Wells Fargo) ask the Panel to defer ruling on the motion until the Panel's May 2017 hearing session or, alternatively, to deny the motion. This litigation consists of eight actions pending in six districts.\n  <footnotemark>\n   1\n  </footnotemark>\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-7\">\n  On the basis of the papers filed and hearing session held, we conclude that centralization is not necessary at this time for the convenience of the parties and witnesses or to further the just and efficient conduct of the litigation. These actions share allegations that Wells Fargo employees used confidential information to open fraudulent accounts in customers' names to meet sales goals, and that Wells Fargo encouraged, knew of, or should have known of this practice. All actions allege overlapping putative nationwide or statewide putative class claims, and all cases will involve overlapping pretrial motions regarding class certification and arbitration. But the parties in the Northern District of California\n  <em>\n   Jabbari\n  </em>\n  action recently reached a nationwide class settlement in principle, a motion for preliminary approval of their proposed settlement is due in less than a month, and a hearing on the motion is set to take place in less than two months. At oral argument, counsel for the\n  <em>\n   Jabbari\n  </em>\n  plaintiffs represented that all interested parties will have the opportunity to object to or otherwise raise issues as to the adequacy of the proposed settlement in the Northern District of California. Centralization at this time could delay a class-wide settlement with little or no benefit to the parties and putative class members.\n  <em>\n   See, e.g.,\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   In re:JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Mortg.
