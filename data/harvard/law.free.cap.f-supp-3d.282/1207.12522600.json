BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Richard Quinones (\"Quinones\") allegedly incurred debts from Defendant Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC (\"Ocwen\"). (Second Amended Compl. (\"SAC\") \u00b6 18.) Between April 4, 2011 and June 9, 2016, Ocwen called Quinones' cellphone using an automatic telephone dialing system (\"ATDS\") in attempts to collect the alleged debt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) When Quinones answered the calls, there would often \"be silence with a click or a beep-tone, before a representative would pick up and start speaking.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) On other occasions, the caller was a recorded voice or message. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) In total, Quinones received at least 1,053 calls. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Quinones alleges he did not provide express consent to receive calls from Ocwen. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) Furthermore, Quinones states he revoked any type of prior express consent, if it ever existed, by picking up the calls and stating on several occasions that he no longer wished to be contacted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) Quinones alleges the calls continued for at least one year after the revocation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Based on these allegations, Plaintiff Quinones brought suit against Ocwen for violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\"TCPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and common law negligence.

As to injury, the SAC alleges that Quinones suffered an invasion of his privacy interests and became \"frustrated and distressed\" that the collection calls continued despite his instructions that Defendant stop calling him. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 35, 36). It further alleges that the calls \"disrupted Plaintiff's daily activities and the peaceful enjoyment of Plaintiff's personal and professional life, including the ability to use Plaintiff's phone.\" (SAC \u00b6 37). Finally, the SAC claims that the calls intruded on Plaintiff's relationships with close family members. (SAC \u00b6 38). Quinones began to \"ignore or send to voicemail many incoming calls from unknown numbers, out of frustration in dealing with Defendant'[s] unwanted and intrusive calls. In doing so, Plaintiff missed important communications from friends and family.\" (SAC \u00b6 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The court finds that the harms alleged are particularized to Quinones and sufficiently concrete to confer Article III standing.

The Ninth Circuit concluded that, in enacting the TCPA, \"Congress identified unsolicited contact as a concrete harm, and gave consumers a means to redress this harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1043. Specifically, the court opined that \"[u]nsolicited telemarketing phone calls or text messages, by their nature, invade the privacy and disturb the solitude of their recipients.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, \"a plaintiff alleging a violation under the TCPA 'need not allege any additional harm beyond the one Congress has identified.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1547\">\n    136 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1549 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Although Defendant's phone calls to Quinones were ostensibly for the purpose of debt collection and not telemarketing, the court finds that a similar reasoning applies here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the\n   <em>\n    Van Patten\n   </em>\n   court acknowledged, \"the FCC has established no rule that a consumer who gives a phone number to a company has consented to be contacted for any reason.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1046. Rather, \"the transactional context matters in determining the scope of a consumer's consent to contact.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At the pleading stage, Quinones has adequately set forth a concrete injury caused by Defendant's recurring debt collection calls, to which he\n   claims he did not consent. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 26-27, 35-38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Moreover, the court finds that the district court cases upon which Defendant relies, namely\n   <em>\n    Romero\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ewing\n   </em>\n   , are inapposite because they adopt a higher standard to satisfy Article III standing requirements under the TCPA, and were decided before the Ninth Circuit had the opportunity to construe\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   through its ruling in\n   <em>\n    Van Hutton.

In effect, \"Defendant went beyond its role as a lender to become an aggressive debt collector, calling Plaintiff 1,053 times.\" (Pl.'s Opp. at 4, Dkt. 35). Arguably, such repeated and non-consensual conduct does not fall within the typical \"scope of [a lender's] conventional role as a mere lender of money,\" and could therefore warrant the imposition of a duty of reasonable care.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mercury Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4392845\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/225/1458/#p1469\">\n    225 Cal.App.3d 1458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1469,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=275%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20871\">\n    275 Cal.Rptr. 871\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990) (\"[A] creditor has a qualified privilege to protect its economic interest, though that privilege may be lost if the creditor uses outrageous and unreasonable means in seeking payment.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Colorado Capital v.

This proposition, however, does not reflect the holdings of the cases that Defendant cites in support,\n   <em>\n    Chaconas\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Sailola\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Chaconas\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff failed to state a negligence claim arising from debt collection calls.\n   <em>\n    Chaconas v.

The\n   <em>\n    Sailola\n   </em>\n   court dismissed a negligence claim with leave to amend, holding that the plaintiff had failed to\n   identify a specific duty of care that the defendant had violated, separate from the defendant's violations of the TCPA or the Hawaii statutes.\n   <em>\n    Sailola v.
