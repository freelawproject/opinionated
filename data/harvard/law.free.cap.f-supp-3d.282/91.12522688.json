BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n   The dispute over the Dakota Access Pipeline has now taken nearly as many twists and turns as the 1,200-mile pipeline itself. On June 14, 2017, in its third Opinion on the case, this Court held that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had failed to fully follow the National Environmental Protection Act when it determined that the pipeline would not have a significant environmental impact. Although the Court found that the agency had \"substantially complied\" with the statute, the Opinion identified three discrete deficiencies in the Corps' analysis and remanded the matter to the agency for further evaluation. In doing so, the Court asked the parties to submit further briefing on the question such an action raised: what is the proper\n   <em>\n    remedy\n   </em>\n   during this remand period? Specifically, the Court must determine whether or not to\n   <em>\n    vacate\n   </em>\n   the Corps' environmental assessment, as well as the easement granted to Dakota Access in reliance on that determination. Without such an easement, the oil cannot flow through the pipeline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The propriety of vacatur during remand is determined by a two-prong test that requires the Court to consider (1) the seriousness of the deficiencies in the agency action and (2) the disruptive consequences of vacating that prior approval. As to the first, the Court ultimately concludes that the three errors identified in the prior Opinion are not fundamental or incurable flaws in the Corps' original analysis; rather, the agency has a significant possibility of justifying its prior determinations on remand. Although the Court finds that the equities of disruption do not tip sharply in Defendants' favor on the second factor, prevailing on the first is enough here for them to avoid vacatur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

June 14, 2017), and need not be repeated here. Suffice it to say that Plaintiffs, the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribes (and other intervenors and consolidated Plaintiffs), strongly oppose the current route of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), a nearly 1,200-mile domestic pipeline running from North Dakota to Illinois. In particular, the Tribes protest DAPL's crossing at Lake Oahe, a federally regulated body of water that borders their reservations. Created by the\n   Corps in 1958 via a dam constructed on the Missouri River, the Lake is a primary source of water for the Tribes, and it is considered sacred to their spiritual practices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 113-14,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202573994\">\n    2017 WL 2573994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    History of Litigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   For the past fourteen months, the Tribes have attempted to prevent oil from flowing under Lake Oahe. The instant case began on July 25, 2016, when Standing Rock filed its Complaint against the Corps for declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to the National Historic Preservation Act, National Environmental Policy Act, Clean Water Act, and the River and Harbors Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 (SRST Complaint), \u00b6\u00b6 128-212. The following month, Dakota Access LLC successfully moved to intervene in support of the Corps,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 7, and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe intervened as a Plaintiff, subsequently filing its own Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 11-12 (CRST Complaint). The Tribes' first pass at preventing the pipeline was a motion for a preliminary injunction based solely on the NHPA, asserting that the ongoing clearing and grading of the land along DAPL's route disrupted sacred Tribal sites.\n   <em>\n    SeeStanding Rock Sioux Tribe v.

The next day, Cheyenne River filed a motion for preliminary injunction and an application for a temporary restraining order, this time alleging violations of RFRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 98, 99;\n   <em>\n    Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v.

Now focusing on their environmental claims, the Tribes challenged the Corps' decision to issue the easement on the basis of its July 25, 2016, Environmental Assessment (EA) and Mitigated Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI), asserting that the agency had violated NEPA by failing to complete an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). NEPA requires that federal agencies evaluate the environmental effects of major government actions, but it does not \"mandate particular results.\"\n   <em>\n    Robertson v.

If a project will \"significantly\" affect the \"quality of the human environment,\" NEPA requires that the agency complete a detailed EIS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204332\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C). To determine whether or not there will be such significant effects, however, the agency first prepares a shorter EA. This \"concise public document\" discusses the need for the proposal, the alternatives, the environmental impacts of the proposed action, and the agencies and persons consulted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201508.9\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). If the EA concludes that there will be no significant\n   environmental impact, the agency may forgo completing a full EIS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This was the route chosen by the Corps in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 172-1, 172-2 (EA and FONSI). The agency's EA and FONSI explained that, given the proposed mitigation measures and Defendants' assessment of DAPL's \"anticipated environmental, economic, cultural ... social[, and] cumulative effects,\" the pipeline's crossing at Lake Oahe would not \"significantly affect the quality of the human environment.\" FONSI at 6.

It rejected Plaintiffs' motion with respect to their claims under the Clean Water Act and the Mineral Leasing Act, and it also upheld the majority of the Corps' determinations under NEPA-including the agency's \"top-line conclusion\" that the risk of an oil spill was sufficiently low so as to not require an EIS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 126-27, 131-33,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202573994\">\n    2017 WL 2573994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12, 16. It granted the Tribes' motion, however, with respect to three discrete flaws in the Corps' environmental analysis. The Court held that the Corps had insufficiently addressed: (1) the degree to which the project's effects are likely to be highly controversial; (2) the consequences of a spill for the Tribes' fishing and hunting rights; and (3) the environmental-justice impacts of the project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 111-12,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202573994\">\n    2017 WL 2573994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. Although the Court remanded these issues to the Corps for further analysis, it did not decide whether the easement should be vacated pending such remand. Instead, it ordered the parties to submit briefing on \"whether remand with or without vacatur is appropriate in light of the deficiencies herein identified and any disruptive consequences that would result given the current stage of the pipeline's operation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 147-48,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202573994\">\n    2017 WL 2573994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This briefing is now complete, and the Court must determine whether or not oil may continue to flow under Lake Oahe. Although the parties dispute what, precisely, vacatur would entail,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 277 (DA Reply) at 1 n.1; 276 (Corps Reply) at 9; 280 (Tribes Sur-reply) at 1, the prior Opinion clearly stated that vacatur would require that DAPL \"cease operations\" during remand.\n   <em>\n    Standing Rock III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274679\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/255/101/\">\n    255 F.Supp.3d at 146-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202573994\">\n    2017 WL 2573994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *28.

Here, Defendants argue that the three inadequacies identified by the Court-namely, the Corps' failure to adequately address the degree to which the project's effects are likely to be highly controversial, the impacts of a spill on fish or game, and the environmental-justice impacts of a spill-are not significant deficiencies in the agency's prior analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 258 (Corps Brief).

Here, the Corps' decision to produce only an EA, rather than an EIS, is \"potentially lawful.\" The errors below were substantial, but they do not present fundamental flaws in Defendants' reasoning. Although Plaintiffs contend that the issues on remand go to the \"heart\" of their opposition to this project,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Tribes Brief at 1, the question for vacatur is not the\n    <em>\n     importance\n    </em>\n    of the issue, but the\n    <em>\n     extent\n    </em>\n    of the error. Here, the Court cannot say that the deficiencies in the prior EA and FONSI are \"crippling\" flaws in the Corps' analysis. The Court previously found that the Corps \"largely complied\" with NEPA's requirements, and it granted remand on only a narrow subset of the Tribes' NEPA claims.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Standing Rock III\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274679\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/255/101/\">\n     255 F.Supp.3d at 146-47\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202573994\">\n     2017 WL 2573994\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *28. The lengthy procedural history of this case shows, moreover, that there has been nothing hasty about the Corps' decisionmaking thus far. There is no reason to think that it will be any less thorough in analyzing the three deficiencies on remand. In light of the agency's substantial compliance with NEPA, the Court finds that the Corps has a significant likelihood of being able to substantiate its prior conclusions and determines that the first prong of the\n    <em>\n     Allied-Signal\n    </em>\n    framework thus counsels in favor of remand without vacatur.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Disruptive Consequences\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    The second consideration in determining whether to remand without vacatur is \"the disruptive consequences of an interim change that may itself be changed.\"\n    <em>\n     Allied-Signal\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3813033,10510774\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/988/146/\">\n     988 F.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    150-51 ;\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Conservation Law Found. v.

On this issue, the parties have much to say about the disruption, or lack thereof, that will result if the Court vacates the Corps' prior decisions. As discussed below, the Court concludes that this factor weighs only slightly in favor of remand without vacatur.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Direct Disruption\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Defendants and their\n    <em>\n     amici\n    </em>\n    spend much of their briefing spelling out what they believe are potentially dire economic consequences of vacatur. Dakota Access, for example, asserts that if the pipeline is paused, North Dakota's oil producers will face severe costs and delays.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    DA Brief at 14; ECF No. 279 (\n    <em>\n     Amici Curiae\n    </em>\n    Brief of American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers) at 6 (stating that \"direct financial impact\" of taking DAPL out of service \"would be staggering\"). The company contends that other pipelines, refineries, and downstream users of the oil currently transported in DAPL would also \"suffer greatly\" and would be forced into \"emergency arrangements\" to compensate for the shutdown.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    DA Brief at 14. The impact of vacatur, Dakota Access posits, would place in peril the jobs of all those currently involved in DAPL's operations and would prevent Dakota Access from being able to perform the contracts it has entered into with producers.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 18.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Defendants assert that such a halt in pipeline operations would also deprive state and local governments of millions of dollars in tax revenue and would undermine new industries that support DAPL operations.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Brief of American Fuel Manufacturers,\n    <em>\n     et al.\n    </em>\n    at 8, 10. Finally, Defendants argue that these effects would be passed on to consumers, claiming that the disruptive market effects of vacatur would have \"significant ripple effects.\" DA Brief at 15. In total, Dakota Access declares that issuing vacatur in this case would incur costs of hundreds of millions of dollars. Id. at 18.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The Tribes contest both the accuracy and the relevance of Defendants' economic concerns. As to the former, Plaintiffs have submitted declarations asserting that \"DAPL revenues\" are likely \"substantially less than indicated\" by Defendants and stating that a DAPL shutdown \"will not result in the severe disruptions claimed by the Corps and Dakota Access.\" ECF No. 272-5 (Declaration of Ian Goodman), \u00b6\u00b6 41, 43. They therefore argue that the company's claims \"regarding loss of revenues and other potential impacts of a DAPL shutdown should not be relied upon to determine the likely impacts\" of vacatur.\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    ., \u00b6 41. As to the latter, the Tribes question whether \"financial impacts\" carry \"much or even any weight\" when evaluating the second\n    <em>\n     Allied-Signal\n    </em>\n    factor in NEPA cases.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tribes' Brief at 25.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    As an initial matter, the Court rejects Plaintiffs' suggestion that it should wholly disregard the potential for financial disruption. Although this perspective has been suggested in at least one district court decision,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ctr. for Food Safety v.

Yet the pipeline did not come on line until June, and no apparent calamity ensued.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF 277-12 (Second Declaration of Lee Hanse), \u00b6 4 (stating that \"no contracts have been renegotiated or terminated\"). The Court thus cannot conclude that, in the case of a halt in DAPL operations, the company would have no alternative option.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    The empirical basis for Defendants' assertion that vacatur would have catastrophic economic effects is, additionally, sharply contested by the Tribes.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Goodman Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 43-48, 75 (asserting that impacts to energy systems and market due to vacatur would likely be \"small to very small\"). Indeed, it is unclear from the current record how much oil is even flowing through the pipeline at this time.\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6\u00b6 19-25 (stating that DAPL appears to be operating at partial capacity)\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    DA Brief at 13 (claiming that DAPL carries equivalent of 500,000 barrels per day)\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    DA Reply at 6 (citing figure of 300,000 barrels per day). The parties ask the Court to wade into this war of the crude-oil experts. Yet, because it declines to rely heavily on economic impact as a justification for issuing vacatur, the Court need not resolve this factual dispute.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pub.

Dakota Access and its\n    <em>\n     amici\n    </em>\n    focus almost exclusively on the financial and industrial implications of a temporary DAPL shutdown. In doing so, they address the \"potentially disruptive effects of vacatur as if they occur in a vacuum,\" thus giving short shrift to the \"potentially disruptive effects that could flow from remand without vacatur.\"\n    <em>\n     Friends of the Capital Crescent Trail v.

Here, there is no doubt that allowing oil to flow through the pipeline during remand risks the potentially disruptive effect about which the Tribes are most concerned-a spill under Lake Oahe. The likelihood of any such rupture may be low, but pausing the operation of the pipeline would mitigate even this small risk. By emphasizing the financial impacts of vacatur, Defendants ignore the \"devastating\" consequences that the Tribes allege could result from remand\n    <em>\n     without\n    </em>\n    such a remedy in place.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Archambault Decl., \u00b6 10-11.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    This economic myopia ignores the fact that the possible effects of an oil spill on the Tribes' treaty rights and communities were at the center of this Court's prior Opinion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Standing Rock III\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274679\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/255/101/\">\n     255 F.Supp.3d at 123-24\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202573994\">\n     2017 WL 2573994\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *10. Defendants unfairly downplay these concerns. Indeed, the Corps alleges that \"loss of life is notably absent from Plaintiffs' discussion of potential worse-case spills.\" Corps Reply at 8. Yet one need only refer to the Tribes' declarations to see that they do, in fact, assert that such drastic harms could flow from a spill under Lake Oahe.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF Nos. 117-16 (Declaration of Jeff Kelly), \u00b6\u00b6 5-9 (stating that many Tribal members rely on hunting and fishing to survive); 272-3, Exh.

Lamont and Colonel Henderson) at 4 (discussing serious, life-threatening health and safety consequences of potential oil spill); 131-4 (Declaration of Harold Frazier) (stating that water shortage on reservation previously\n    caused \"death of four children in a house fire\" due to insufficient water supply for firefighting). Although the Court acknowledges the potential for economic disruption, these interests do not inherently trump the risk of environmental disruption if vacatur is withheld.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pub.

If projections of financial distress are sufficient to prevent vacatur, the Court fears that agencies and third parties may choose to devote as many resources as early as possible to a challenged project-and then claim disruption in light of such investments. Such a strategy is contrary to the purpose of NEPA, which seeks to ensure that the government \"looks before it leaps.\" ECF No. 269-1 (Brief of\n    <em>\n     Amici Curiae\n    </em>\n    of Law Professors and Practitioners) at 5. Finding that vacatur's alleged financial harms are dispositive under the second prong of\n    <em>\n     Allied-Signal\n    </em>\n    may encourage agencies to instead act first and ask later. In sum, although the Court concludes that there is likely to be\n    <em>\n     some\n    </em>\n    economic disruption from vacatur, this factor does not weigh heavily in Defendants' favor under the\n    <em>\n     Allied-Signal\n    </em>\n    test.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Alternative Transport\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    In addition to asserting that vacatur would have devastating economic effects, Defendants also argue that such a remedy would not, in fact, ameliorate Plaintiffs' concerns during the remand period. Dakota Access contends that, if vacatur is granted, the oil currently flowing through the pipeline will be re-routed onto trains.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    DA Brief at 15-16. The company states that this form of transport involves a greater risk of accidents and thus argues that vacatur would put the Tribes in more environmental peril than the current status quo.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121627\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/189/1/#p2\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs dispute both the facts and the premise of this position. The Tribes contend that there is little data supporting the proposition that train transport would be used in lieu of DAPL. They point instead to expert reports stating that, if DAPL were shut down, \"much of\" the crude currently flowing under Lake Oahe would \"shift back to ... other pipelines, rather than to rail.\" Goodman Decl., \u00b6 62. The Tribes also contest the relative safety of the two modes of transport, referring to their expert's conclusion that it is \"incorrect to state that pipelines are 'undeniably safer' than rail,\" and that pipelines such as DAPL are \"capable of releasing substantially more oil than trains.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6\u00b6 87-88. Examining the respective routes and capacities of train lines and DAPL, the report concludes that, for the Tribes, \"DAPL has [a] ... much greater risk than does crude by rail.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6 114. Finally, the Tribes contend that Defendants miss the mark by relying upon the overall risks presented by train transport versus pipelines. Instead, Plaintiffs contend that the Court should concern itself solely with the risk to the Tribes from DAPL and its current crossing at Lake Oahe.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tribes' Sur-reply at 15.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    In considering the transport question, both parties acknowledge that this Circuit has \"previously remanded without vacatur ... if vacating 'would at least temporarily defeat ... the enhanced protection of the environmental values covered by [the statute at issue].' \"\n    <em>\n     Ctr. for Biological Diversity v.

On this record, Defendants have failed to persuade the Court that transport by train is significantly more dangerous than allowing oil to continue to flow beneath Lake Oahe. The record contains no concrete figures or substantiated studies regarding the risks presented by rail transportation versus DAPL's Lake Oahe crossing. Instead, the Court is left with vague projections such as Defendants' assertion that vacatur \"\n    <em>\n     could\n    </em>\n    result in at least\n    <em>\n     some\n    </em>\n    portion\" of the oil being moved via train and their broad claim that rail transport \"poses a higher accident risk\" than the use of pipelines.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Corps Brief at 13 (emphasis added).

The effects that concern the Court today are not general environmental ones throughout the Midwest, but those that may result from\n    <em>\n     this\n    </em>\n    pipeline in\n    <em>\n     this\n    </em>\n    location at Lake Oahe. Those are the impacts that the Court found were insufficiently addressed by the Corps, and those are the impacts that Plaintiffs fear during the remand period. For this reason, and because the Court does not find that alternative modes of transport required by vacatur, if any, will necessarily increase the risk of an oil spill, it rejects this argument against vacatur.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Other Considerations\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The Corps also attempts to argue that vacatur here would \"have greater disruptive consequences than in the typical NEPA case\" because the pipeline has already been completed.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Corps Brief at 12. The agency contends that vacatur is the standard remedy in NEPA cases only when it would affect the \"\n    <em>\n     prospective\n    </em>\n    application of rules or agency actions,\" rather than situations in which the challenged outcome has already gone into effect.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121627\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/189/1/#p2\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs counter that this distinction finds little footing in the facts of the case.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tribes Sur-reply at 5-6.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The Tribes have the better of this dispute.

Instead, their concerns in this case, and the deficiencies identified in the prior Opinion, involve the risks presented by the\n    <em>\n     continued\n    </em>\n    passage of oil under the Lake. This is clearly an ongoing, and prospective,\n    event. This is thus not a case in which \"[t]he egg has been scrambled and there is no apparent way to restore the status quo ante.\"\n    <em>\n     Sugar Cane Growers Coop. v.

The oil may currently be flowing, but Defendants do not dispute that it could be stopped. Although courts have declined to vacate improper agency actions when doing so would be an \"invitation to chaos,\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9432440,3698698\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/289/89/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9432440,3698698\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/289/89/\">\n     at 97\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , in this case vacatur would be, at most, an invitation to substantial inconvenience. Contracts may have to be renegotiated and alternative modes of transportation found, but there is no indication in the record that Defendants' actions under the improper EA\n    <em>\n     cannot\n    </em>\n    be undone.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Finally, the Corps' assertions regarding the timing of the remand process are also relevant to analyzing the disruption in this case. The agency now states that it anticipates completing its independent review and analysis of the remand issues by April 2018, which is several months after its initial estimate.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 281 (Notice of Revised Schedule); Corps Brief at 1. This timeline aids both parties' positions with respect to the impact of vacatur. On one hand, the multiple-month period of review increases the risk that a spill will occur prior to the new analysis and thus strengthens the Tribes' assertion that such an incident could occur during the remand process. On the other hand, this timing also supports Defendants' position that vacatur would have severe disruptive effects. To vacate the easement during the remand process would stop oil from flowing under Lake Oahe for at least six months-an interruption that could cause significant harms to numerous people and entities. The remand period thus supports both sides' arguments regarding the real-world impact of the Court's choice today, but does not dictate the outcome either way.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    * * *\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    The second prong of\n    <em>\n     Allied-Signal\n    </em>\n    , consequently, does not counsel strongly in favor of remand without vacatur. It is undeniable that stopping the flow of oil beneath Lake Oahe will have\n    <em>\n     some\n    </em>\n    disruptive effect, but all the considerations on this prong tip only narrowly in favor of Defendants. Because the Court has concluded that the Corps' errors are likely to be cured under the first prong, it need not define the precise scale of the potential disruption. This is because in circumstances in which the first prong of\n    <em>\n     Allied-Signal\n    </em>\n    supports remand without vacatur, the second prong \"is only barely relevant.\"\n    <em>\n     Fox Television Stations, Inc. v.

Compliance with NEPA cannot be reduced to a bureaucratic formality, and the Court expects the Corps not to treat remand as an exercise in filling out the proper paperwork\n    <em>\n     post hoc.\n    </em>\n    After the agency's further work on remand, the parties may well disagree over the sufficiency of its conclusion. If and when such a dispute arises, they will again have the opportunity to address whether Defendants have in fact fulfilled their statutory obligations.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
