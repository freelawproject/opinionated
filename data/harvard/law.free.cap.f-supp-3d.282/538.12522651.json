Potente (\"Potente\") and Richard J. Jankura (\"Jankura\") (collectively, the \"Plaintiffs\") brought this action against the Defendant Citibank, N.A. (the \"Defendant\" or \"Citibank\") for,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , alleged violations of the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. 1601 (\"TILA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Presently before the Court is a motion by the Defendant to dismiss the complaint in its entirety pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\"FED. R. CIV. P.\" or \"Rule\") 12(b)(6). For the following reasons, the Defendant's motion is granted in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are drawn from the complaint, and for the purposes of the instant motion, are accepted as true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Plaintiffs reside at 47 Berry Hill Road, Oyster Bay Cove, NY 11771 (the \"residence\"). The Plaintiffs have lived there since 1997. The Plaintiffs apparently had an initial mortgage of $1,000,000, secured by their interest in the residence. The complaint does not state who held the initial mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2008, the Plaintiffs applied for a mortgage refinance with Citibank. During the application process, Citibank ordered an appraisal of the residence. The appraisal valued the residence at $2,200,000. Citibank informed the Plaintiffs of the appraisal, but the Plaintiffs claim that they\n   never received a copy of the appraisal. The complaint does not state precisely when the appraisal occurred, but it happened before the final approval of the loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 18, 2008, the Plaintiffs executed a Consolidation, Extension, and Modification Agreement (the \"CEMA\") with Citibank. Pursuant to the refinance, the Plaintiffs borrowed $700,000 from Citibank. The Plaintiffs allege that they relied upon the purportedly inflated appraisal of $2,200,000 when they signed the CEMA and agreed to take the loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The CEMA loan was secured by the Plaintiffs' interest in the residence. Despite the fact that the Plaintiffs allege that it was a mortgage refinance, it is not clear from the face of the complaint whether the initial mortgage was repaid. Nevertheless, the Plaintiffs allege that the mortgage was transferred to an unknown third party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In July of 2014, the Plaintiffs \"discovered\" that the $2.2 million appraisal was \"grossly inflated,\" and that the \"actual fair market value of the property at the time of the execution of the CEMA was $1,200,000.\" (Compl. \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In April of 2016, the Plaintiffs mailed a notice of rescission to Citibank. Citibank received the notice on April 22, 2016. Citibank has allegedly refused to honor the notice of rescission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Relevant Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On July 15, 2016, the Plaintiffs commenced this action by filing a complaint. The complaint alleges four causes of action. However, one of the causes of action is merely a request for injunctive relief, which is not a cause of action.\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4067026\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/994/542/#p558\">\n    994 F.Supp.2d 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 558 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (\"[I]njunctions are remedies, not causes of action ....\"). The three remaining causes of action are for fraud in the factum, appraisal fraud, and violation of TILA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Plaintiffs did not serve the Defendant with the summons and complaint until February 23, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On April 14, 2017, the Defendant filed the instant motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

As to the Defendant's Exhibit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Defendant attached one exhibit with its motion and memorandum of law-a document that purports to be an appraisal of the residence commissioned by Potente on December 10, 2013 (the \"December 2013 appraisal\"). The December 2013 appraisal values the residence at $990,000. The Plaintiffs do not dispute that the document is what it purports to be. Indeed, the Plaintiffs state that \"at the end of 2013, [Potente] sought a reduction in the principal amount of his mortgage and ordered the appraisal of the property... The appraisal was completed on December 13, 2013[, and was] effective December 12, 2013.\" (Pl.'s Mem. of Law in Opp. at 13). Instead, the Plaintiffs argue that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [they] did not fully grasp the significance of the appraisal value until mid-2014 .... There is nothing in the appraisal that would indicate the date when the plaintiff[s] would have known or should have known that the evaluation of the property in 2008 was improper. All [they] had was a valuation as of the end of 2013 after the real estate market had suffered from a broad devaluation of property values caused by the Great Recession and the Mortgage Foreclosure Meltdown.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"When determining the sufficiency of plaintiff['s] claim for Rule 12(b)(6) purposes, consideration is limited to the factual allegations in [the] complaint, documents attached to the complaint as an exhibit or incorporated in it by reference, matters of which judicial notice may be taken, or documents either in plaintiff['s] possession or of which plaintiff[ ] had knowledge and relied in bringing suit.\"\n   <em>\n    Brass v.

Therefore, when a plaintiff chooses not to attach to the complaint or incorporate by reference a document upon which she relies and which is integral to the complaint, the court may nevertheless take that document into consideration in deciding a defendant's motion to dismiss, without converting the motion into one for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Cortec Indus., Inc. v.

Even if the Court accepted the Plaintiffs' argument that they could not have discovered the fraudulent activities until much later, the Plaintiffs received an appraisal in December of 2013 which showed that the residence was worth much less than $2.2 million. At that point, they were on notice, and had \"discovered\" the alleged fraud, and had to bring an action for fraud before December of 2015.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20C.P.L.R.%20%C2%A7%20213\">\n    N.Y.

Mar. 8, 2013) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). There are two reasons for this\n   rule: first, \"representations as to value alone are generally matters of opinion upon which no detrimental reliance can occur\"; and second, \"the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    caveat emptor\n   </em>\n   applies to real estate transactions such that a buyer has a duty to satisfy himself or herself of the quality of a bargained purchase price without trusting a seller.\"\n   <em>\n    Simms v.

This is a conclusory statement. Furthermore, it does not change the fact that the Plaintiffs knew that they were signing a promissory note with legal consequences. The Plaintiffs allege that Citibank was a party to the promissory note, and that Citibank continues to seek repayment from the Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Therefore, the Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for fraud in the factum.
