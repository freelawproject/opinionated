In his complaint, Nicaj alleged claims of false arrest, excessive force, malicious prosecution, denial of fair trial, and failure to intervene under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and for false arrest, excessive force, malicious prosecution, and conversion under New York state law.

Nicaj's Motion for a New Trial Is Denied\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As a preliminary matter, counsel for Nicaj never ordered a trial transcript, and his motion papers fail to cite the trial record. Thus, Nicaj's recitation of the evidence introduced at trial and his summary of the Court's analysis in granting Defendants' Rule 50(a) motion are based solely on counsel's memory. Even more problematic on that score is that Nicaj's motion papers were submitted by Zelman, who did not attend the trial (except to make legal arguments after all the evidence, except one witness, had been received), and therefore his description of the record and accompanying arguments are not even based on his own memory or notes from trial but received second-hand from Nicaj's trial counsel Glenn Verchick, Esq. (\"Verchick\"). Tr. at 354-63. As a result, the Court ordered the trial transcript for its own review, and, as already seen, cites to the transcript as necessary throughout this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Nicaj did not plead a state law illegal strip search claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Nicaj first argues that the Court should not have dismissed his illegal strip search claim, even though he failed to specifically identify who conducted the search. Pl. Mem. at 4-5. At trial, Nicaj testified only that he \"was strip searched,\" and that \"they put me in a private room, ... [t]hat's where they did the strip search,\" without identifying who \"they\" were. Tr. at 94.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nonetheless, he contends that \"[a] state law claim may proceed on a\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   theory against a municipality, even though the individual employee who acted in a wrongful manner has not been identified.\" Pl. Mem. at 4. While the Court does not contest this general proposition, the issue the Court had raised at trial in granting Defendants' Rule 50(a) motion was whether Nicaj had raised an illegal strip search claim pursuant to state law at all. Tr. at 354-55. Nicaj has not addressed that question in his post-trial papers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Nicaj argues that he pled and offered evidence of a \"state law strip search\n   claim,\" and therefore this claim should have been presented to the jury, because he could proceed on a theory of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   that the City was vicariously liable (even though he did not identify the individual officers responsible). Pl. Mem. at 5. However, Nicaj has not identified for the Court, neither when the claim was dismissed under Rule 50 at the trial, nor in his submissions here, whether he pled a state law strip search claim at all.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 207-08. In fact, his complaint does not contain an illegal strip search cause of action. The only references to a strip search are made in passing in the complaint's preliminary statement, and in one paragraph recounting the alleged facts in which Nicaj says he was strip searched. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 13. Though a strip search claim was included in the parties' joint proposed jury charge, both Nicaj and Defendants articulate the applicable standard based on federal law. Proposed Jury Instructions, dated June 24, 2016 (\"Jury Charge\"), Dkt. No. 81, at 51-52.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Moreover, Nicaj does not identify what the legal basis for a state law strip search claim would be. Pl. Mem. at 4-5. Although he cites to several cases discussing\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   theory under state law, none involves state law illegal strip search claims, and the only cases he cites discussing strip searches are based on federal constitutional jurisprudence. Some New York state courts have considered whether an unlawful strip search could raise an assault or battery claim.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Shields v. City of N.Y.\n   </em>\n   , No. 22414/2013,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205511116\">\n    2015 WL 5511116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *4, 2015 N.Y.

However, it does not appear that any court has found a stand-alone claim for an \"illegal strip search\" under state law to be cognizable. More importantly, at no point in advance of trial, during the proceedings related to defendants' Rule 50 motion, or in any subsequent submissions has Nicaj maintained that he pled state law claims of assault and battery based on his strip search. Nicaj has pointed to no applicable law that the Court overlooked when it determined that he had not pled a state law unlawful strip search claim, and \"[a] party seeking reconsideration is not supposed to treat the court's initial decision as the opening of a dialogue in which that party may then use such a motion to advance new theories.\"\n   <em>\n    Gottdiener\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4328232\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/35/402/#p403\">\n    35 F.Supp.3d at 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As Nicaj has not demonstrated that he pled a state law strip search claim, the Court is left to conclude that to the extent he had such a claim, it was based on federal law.

As \"the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   does not apply to claims under \u00a7 1983,\" the Court correctly dismissed Nicaj's claim when he did not identify which of the Defendants\n   conducted a strip search of him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11314166\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/21/496/#p501\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Farrell v.

In granting Defendants' Rule 50 motion to dismiss Nicaj's malicious prosecution claim, the Court concluded that there was \"no testimony or other evidence in the record to suggest that any of the three individually named defendants can be shown to have referred the charges to the prosecutor,\" and further, that \"a certificate of disposition merely noting that the criminal charges were dismissed is insufficient to constitute a favorable termination.\" Tr. at 202-03.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As to the initiation prong, Defendants argued in support of their Rule 50 motion, Tr. at 188-89, and reiterate in their opposition to the pending motion, Def. Opp. at 5-6, that the evidence introduced at trial was insufficient to establish that Defendants initiated the prosecution. Although the misdemeanor complaint signed by Beharry was admitted into evidence at trial, this occurred during Beharry's cross-examination, Tr. at 334, and was not offered as part of Nicaj's case-in-chief. That in itself presents a threshold impediment to Nicaj's argument on the initiation prong. Moreover, the supporting deposition submitted to the District Attorney signed by Arocho, now offered belatedly by Nicaj,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Declaration of David Zelman dated March 27, 2017 (\"Zelman Dec.\"), Ex.

Thus, the ownership of Nicaj's vehicle is a relevant inquiry for purposes of a conversion claim. That being said, although Nicaj focuses on new arguments about the legal ownership of the vehicle (which were not raised at the time of Defendants' Rule 50 motion), Pl.

At the time of the Rule 50 motion, Nicaj's counsel argued that \"Nicaj's vehicle was unlawfully seized,\" and that the jury should be charged that \"seizure of a vehicle based upon a charge of operating an unlicensed vehicle for hire is unconstitutional.\" Tr. at 368.

Pl. Mem. at 11. Section 19-506(h)(1) of the New York City Administrative Code permits seizure of \"any vehicle which [an officer] has probable cause to believe is operated or offered to be operated without a vehicle license,\" and to the extent that rule was held unconstitutional, it was only with regard to first-time violators of the rule.\n   <em>\n    Harrell v.

Dec. 18, 2015). At the time of his arrest and the vehicle's seizure, Nicaj had previously been ticketed for operating a for-hire vehicle without a license in January 2013, so he was not a first-time offender.

Additionally,\n   <em>\n    Harrell,\n   </em>\n   on which Nicaj solely relies, was decided two years after Nicaj's car was towed and is not binding on this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court has previously highlighted these deficiencies. At the pre-trial conference on September 16, 2016, the Court and the parties engaged in an extensive colloquy regarding the applicability of\n   <em>\n    Harrell\n   </em>\n   to this case. Transcript, dated Sept. 16, 2016 (\"Sept. Tr.\"), at 6-16, Dkt. No. 99. Additionally, at the time of the Rule 50 motion, the Court reiterated that it had rejected any due process argument based on\n   <em>\n    Harrell\n   </em>\n   , Tr. at 387-88, and although the Court reserved decision and gave the parties the opportunity to make additional submissions on the issue, when Nicaj offered the same argument about\n   <em>\n    Harrell\n   </em>\n   yet again,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl. Letter, the Court finally rejected the request to charge the jury with a due process claim, again noting that it had repeatedly considered and rejected the\n   <em>\n    Harrell\n   </em>\n   argument. Tr. at 412-13. Here, Nicaj has merely reiterated that\n   <em>\n    Harrell\n   </em>\n   applies to his situation, without identifying anything the Court may have overlooked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Finally, even had these issues not been fully aired already, Nicaj had opportunities to raise a federal due process claim (or even a state law conversion claim), but abandoned those causes of action. His complaint alleged a state law conversion claim, but no federal due process claim. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 95-98. Defendants then argued that the conversion claim was too imprecise to present to the jury. Defendants' Pretrial Submissions Concerning Matters to be Resolved In Limine, dated June 17, 2016, Dkt. No. 68, at 20. After an extensive colloquy at the September 2016 pre-trial conference, the Court directed Nicaj to articulate what damages he was seeking for this claim and their legal basis. Sept. Tr. at 44-48; Order, dated Sept. 16, 2016, Dkt. No. 89. Yet Nicaj responded with a list of damages with no accompanying legal basis for them. Letter, dated Jan. 6, 2017, at 1, Dkt. No. 94. Notably, in both the parties' proposed jury charge and in their proposed verdict sheet, Nicaj did not include a claim either for conversion or for a due process violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jury Charge; Proposed Findings and Conclusions, dated June 24, 2016, Dkt. No. 82.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Perhaps fittingly,\n   Nicaj has abandoned his conversion argument in his reply papers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Defendants' Request for Attorneys' Fees Is Denied\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendants have requested the opportunity to pursue attorneys' fees for their time spent on this motion, as they contend that Nicaj lacked a good faith basis for continuing to litigate this case. Def. Mem. at 8. Nicaj's arguments are plainly on the fringes of legitimate advocacy, as they merely attempt to revive the same issues the Court already resolved after multiple opportunities for the parties to be heard. These failings are due no doubt to Zelman's failure to attend the trial or to order the trial transcript. The Court strongly discourages such practices as, at a minimum, counsel should not prepare post-trial briefing after a trial he did not attend without citations to the record to support his positions. Nonetheless, Defendants chose not to move for summary judgment in this case, as the Court observed during trial, Tr. at 361, which would have likely narrowed the issues and permitted the Court to decide these matters on a more developed record. To the extent this motion has allowed Nicaj a formal assessment of certain of his claims and why they were dismissed, the Court cannot conclude that it was entirely frivolous. Accordingly, although it is a close call, no fees will be awarded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Because Nicaj has failed to raise any legal or factual matters that the Court overlooked or establish any extraordinary circumstances justifying relief, his motion for a new trial is denied. Defendants' request for attorneys' fees is also denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Clerk is directed to close Docket Entry 110.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Nicaj also alleged a state law cause of action denominated \"respondeat superior.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 90-94.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Although the original deadline was March 15, 2017, the Court granted Nicaj's request for an extension.

No. 109.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    In his memorandum in support of a new trial, Zelman states that \"[a]t trial, Plaintiff testified that, while at the precinct following his arrest, he was strip-searched by two non-defendant officers.\" Pl. Mem. at 3;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    at 5 (\"he was strip-searched by two uniformed officers\"). But Nicaj did not testify that\n    <em>\n     two officers\n    </em>\n    had strip searched him. He merely said that \"\n    <em>\n     they\n    </em>\n    did that to [him] that evening.\" Tr. at 95. Thus, it is not at all clear from Nicaj's testimony that the individuals who allegedly strip searched him, whoever \"they\" may be (and however many there were), were employees of the City of New York acting in their official capacity, a critical element of Nicaj's respondeat superior theory regarding this claim.
