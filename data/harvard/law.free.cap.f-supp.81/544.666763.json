Very considerable doubt upon such a holding is thrown by Swayne &amp; Hoyt, Ltd., v. U. S., 1937, 300 U.S. 297, 306, 307 and note 3, 57 S.Ct. 478, 81 L.Ed. 659, and by the legislative history of the statute, H.R.Doc. No. 805, 63rd Cong., 2nd Sess., 1914, 287-292.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-20\">But we need not decide that question now. The statute is not very explicit in its provision of an administrative remedy. It does, however, provide, 46 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 814, that the Gommission may cancel or modify any agreement \u201c * * * whether or not previously approved by it * * * \u201d, and for fifteen years the Commission has followed a procedure for reviewing on its own motion, Pacific Coast European Conference Agreement, 1948, 3 U.S.M.C. 11, and for hearing complaints concerning agreements previously approved by it. Cf. Olsen v. Blue Star Line, Ltd., 1941, 2 U.S.M.C.. 529; Rawleigh v. Stoomvart, 1933, 1 U.S.S.B. 285. That procedure has not yet been availed of by plaintiff. We should not at this stage pass on the validity of the agreements before the Commission, in accordance with its established procedure, has had an opportunity to pass thereon in an adversary proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-21\">But were the defendant carriers to institute their exclusive patronage system pending the Commission\u2019s decision upon such a proceeding, the plaintiff would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>gravely prejudiced. Since the Commission disclaims the power to afford temporary relief, and the equitable power of the court to preserve the status quo to protect the rights of all concerned has not been withdrawn by statute,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> an injunction as prayed should issue, conditioned on the plaintiff\u2019s diligent prosecution before the Commission of a complaint challenging the validity of the agreements. The defendant carriers\u2019 motion to dismiss the action is denied. \u2022</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b601-18\"> In West India Fruit &amp; S. S. Co., Inc., ,v. Seatrain Lines, Inc., 2 Cir., 170 F.2d 775, the Court of Appeals sustained an injunction granted with the Commission\u2019s approval on the theory that the Commission itself lacked power to grant relief pending its determination on a formal complaint.
