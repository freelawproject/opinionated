Bluth, J.), entered on or about August 12, 2014, which granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint based on the lack of a serious injury within the meaning of Insurance Law \u00a7 5102 (d), unanimously reversed, on the law, without costs, and the motion denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-7\">Defendants made a prima facie showing of a lack of a \u201cpermanent consequential\u201d or \u201csignificant\u201d limitation of use of plaintiff\u2019s left knee and lumbar spine (Insurance Law \u00a7 5102 [d]), by submitting their orthopedist\u2019s report finding full range of motion in those body parts <em>(see Clementson v Price, </em>107 AD3d 533, 533 [1st Dept 2013]), and by submitting the affirmed report of their radiologist who opined that the MRIs of those parts showed only degenerative conditions (see id.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-8\">Plaintiff in turn raised a triable issue of fact as to whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1392\">*1392</page-number>he sustained a serious injuries of the left knee and lumbar spine sufficient to defeat the motion <em>(see Caines v Diakite, </em>105 AD3d 404 [1st Dept 2013]; <em>Malloy v Matute, </em>79 AD3d 584, 584-585 [1st Dept 2010]; <em>Morris v Ilya Cab Corp., </em>61 AD3d 434 [1st Dept 2009]). Plaintiff, a 24-year-old male, had no history of injury to the knee or back prior to the accident on May 2, 2012. A July 25, 2012 MRI of plaintiffs spine revealed a herniation at the level of L5-S1. A July 2, 2012 MRI of plaintiffs knee revealed a \u201ctear of the undersurface of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus,\u201d a \u201chigh grade partial tear of the anterior cruciate ligament,\u201d and \u201cpartial tears of the . . . lateral collateral ligaments.\u201d Plaintiff underwent arthroscopic surgery four months after the accident to repair the medial meniscal tear <em>(see Malloy, </em>79 AD3d at 584-585).</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-3\">Plaintiffs treating physiatrist and expert, Dr. Goldenberg, and his expert orthopedic surgeon, Dr. McMahon, opined that plaintiffs injuries were traumatically induced as a result of the accident, directly controverting defendants\u2019 experts\u2019 opinions that plaintiff\u2019s injuries were degenerative in origin and/or resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-4\">Dr. Goldenberg opined that \u201c[t]he fact that [plaintiff] continues to suffer from pain and limitation in motion after lengthy physical therapy indicates that his injuries and limitations are permanent.\u201d Dr. McMahon concurred that \u201c[t]he fact that [the plaintiff] remains symptomatic to the point where he continues taking oral analgesics and wears a left knee brace, even after receiving ongoing physical therapy for a year, supports my opinion that his injuries are permanent.\u201d By ascribing plaintiff\u2019s lumbar spine and left knee injuries to a different, yet equally plausible cause, the affirmations of plaintiff\u2019s experts suffice to raise an issue of triable fact <em>(see Perl v Meher, </em>18 NY3d 208, 219 [2011]; <em>Yuen v Arka Memory Cab Corp., </em>80 AD3d 481, 482 [1st Dept 2011]; <em>Biascochea v Boves, </em>93 AD3d 548 [1st Dept 2012]; <em>Williams v Perez, </em>92 AD3d 528 [1st Dept 2012]; <em>Grant v United Pavers Co., Inc., </em>91 AD3d 499 [1st Dept 2012]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-5\">The affirmed reports of plaintiff\u2019s experts were admissible concerning the injuries to the left knee and lumbar spine, even though relying in part on unsworn contemporaneous MRI reports <em>(see Byong Yol Yi v Canela, </em>70 AD3d 584 [1st Dept 2010]; <em>Rivera v Super Star Leasing, Inc., </em>57 AD3d 288, 288 [1st Dept 2008]). The MRI reports may be considered for the further reason that they were reviewed by defendants\u2019 experts in preparing their reports and submitted by defendants in support of their motion <em>(see Johnson v KS Transp. Inc., </em>115 AD3d 425 [1st Dept 2014]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1393\">*1393</page-number>We have considered and rejected defendants\u2019 further arguments. We note that where a plaintiff has raised a triable issue of fact as to whether certain injuries constitute \u201cserious injury\u201d under the statute, he is also entitled to seek damages for other injuries caused by the accident that might not otherwise satisfy the statutory threshold <em>(see Pantojas v Lajara Auto Corp., </em>117 AD3d 577 [1st Dept 2014]; Caines, 105 AD3d at 404).
