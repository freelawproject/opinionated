The loan agreement provided that defendant would release the trust deed \u201cupon a payment of principal in the amount of $20,000.00.\u201d (Capitalization omitted.) Plaintiff made a number of payments on the loan, and, after those payments totaled more than $20,000 in principal, requested that defendant release the trust deed. Defendant, however, refused to release the trust deed because, although the aggregate of plaintiffs payments exceeded $20,000 in principal, plaintiff had not made \u201ca\u201d payment in the amount of $20,000 \u2014 that is, defendant took the position that the loan agreement required a <em>single </em>payment in the amount of $20,000 before the trust deed would be released.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Plaintiff eventually filed this action to remove the cloud on title created by the trust deed, and defendant counterclaimed with an action on the note and to foreclose the lien created by the trust deed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant then moved for summary judgment on plaintiffs claim to clear title, arguing that the loan agreement unambiguously requires a single payment of $20,000, which plaintiff indisputably had not made. The trial court agreed with defendant\u2019s interpretation of the loan agreement and granted the motion. A stipulated facts trial on the counterclaims followed, after which the trial court entered judgment in favor of defendant, foreclosing on the lien created by the trust deed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Plaintiff now appeals that general judgment, arguing that the trial court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. She argues that the loan agreement is, at the very least, ambiguous as to whether it requires a <em>single </em>payment in the amount of $20,000 before the trust deed is released or, as occurred in this case, a <em>total </em>payment of $20,000. We agree with plaintiff that the loan agreement is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation on that point, and we therefore reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>As framed above, the issue on appeal is a narrow one: Whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment based on its interpretation of the loan agreement. That, in turn, depends on whether the loan agreement\u2014 specifically, the collateral release provision of the agreement \u2014 is unambiguous. <em>Milne v. Milne Construction </em>Co., 207 Or App 382, 388, 142 P3d 475, <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 253 (2006) (a party is entitled to summary judgment regarding the meaning of a contract only if the terms of the contract are unambiguous). A term in a contract is ambiguous if, when examined in the context of the contract as a whole, including the circumstances in which the agreement was made, it is susceptible to more than one plausible interpretation. <em>Batzer Construction, Inc. v. Boyer, </em>204 Or App 309, 317, 129 P3d 773, <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 366 (2006). Thus, in determining whether summary judgment was appropriate in this case, we first examine the text and context of the collateral release provision to determine whether there is more than one plausible interpretation of that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The collateral release provision of the loan agreement provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">\u201cCOLLATERAL RELEASE. OREGON PACIFIC BANKING COMPANY WILL RELEASE THE TRUST DEED ON REAL PROPERTY LOCATED AT 24419 SUTTLE RD, VENETA, OR 97487 UPON A PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL IN THE AMOUNT OF $20,000.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">In defendant\u2019s view, the plain text of the release provision\u2014 in particular, the article \u201ca\u201d that precedes \u201cpayment\u201d \u2014 is unambiguous and, thus, ends the inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\"><em>\u201cWebster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>(unabridged ed 2002) states that the article \u2018a\u2019 is \u2018used as a function word before a singular noun followed by a restrictive clause or other identifying modifier,\u2019 and provides the example, \u2018a man who was here yesterday.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-9\">\u201cThe use of the article \u2018a\u2019 in the Release is in direct accord with the Webster\u2019s definition. \u2018A\u2019 is used as a function word before the singular noun \u2018payment,\u2019 followed by a restrictive modifier, \u2018in the amount of $20,000.00.\u2019 Consequently, the parties agreed that the Trust Deed would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>be released unless Plaintiff made a single payment in the amount of $20,000.00 against principal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Plaintiff, meanwhile, argues that \u201cassigning a single definition to the indefinite article is a mistake,\u201d and she offers competing definitions of the word \u201ca\u201d from other dictionaries. Plaintiff further argues that, in the context of a loan agreement, to read the word \u201ca\u201d as requiring a single, lump sum payment of $20,000 \u201cdefies any financial sense,\u201d yields an \u201cillogical\u201d result, and \u201ccannot be sustained unless it is divorced from the context of the parties\u2019 understanding of the agreement, industry practice, and common experience * * In plaintiffs view, \u201c[t]here is sufficient ambiguity in the language of the collateral release provision to render it unclear as to whether it means a single payment of twenty thousand dollars <em>or payment amounting to twenty thousand dollars of the principal.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The parties\u2019 extensive discussion of the meaning of \u201ca\u201d is not particularly helpful, in that it focuses on the indefinite article in isolation. In interpreting a contract, context is important. The indefinite article \u201ca\u201d must be read in the context of the noun that it precedes and the phrase in which it appears. In this instance, the more critical word is \u201cpayment.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The term appears throughout the loan agreement but is never defined. In ordinary use, the term has two possible meanings: \u201c1: the act of paying or giving compensation : the discharge of a debt or an obligation\u201d or \u201c2 : something that is paid : something given to discharge a debt or obligation or to fulfill a promise.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1659 (unabridged ed 2002). That is, in the context of a debt, \u201cpayment\u201d can refer either to the <em>act of discharging the debt </em>or to the thing that is given to discharge the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Those two possible meanings yield, at the very least, an ambiguity as to the meaning of the phrase \u201cupon a payment of principal in the amount of $20,000.00.\u201d Defendant\u2019s argument presumes the second of the two dictionary defini<em>tions </em>\u2014 i.e., \u201cpayment\u201d refers to a particular thing that is paid to discharge a debt, and the article \u201ca\u201d makes clear that such a thing is singular. However, if the first of the two dictionary definitions of \u201cpayment\u201d is employed, another plausible reading of the agreement is manifest: That the phrase \u201cupon a payment of principal in the amount of $20,000.00\u201d means upon <em>a discharge </em>of the principal in the amount of $20,000.00. In that sense, \u201ca payment of principal\u201d occurs once the borrower has paid $20,000 in principal, regardless of the number of particular payments made to accomplish that discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">That latter reading is not only supported by the text of the collateral release provision in particular, but by the loan agreement as a whole and the circumstances of the parties\u2019 transaction. There may be some commercial purpose to requiring a single payment in the amount of exactly $20,000 before releasing collateral under the loan, but it is not readily apparent what that would be. The promissory note contemplated \u201c59 regular payments of $702.65 each and one irregular last payment estimated at $33,202.86\u201d; in other words, neither the note nor the agreement refers to a particular, single $20,000 payment of principal. Moreover, defendant, at oral argument, conceded that even a check in the amount of $20,000.01 would not result in the release of the trust deed under defendant\u2019s interpretation of the collateral release provision, because the check would not constitute a single payment in the amount of $20,000.00. Again, if the parties intended that seemingly absurd result, it is not apparent from the text or context of the loan agreement, or from the circumstances of the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">In sum, plaintiffs interpretation of the collateral release provision of the loan agreement \u2014 that payment amounting to $20,000 triggers the release of the trust deed\u2014 is plausible based on its text and context within the loan agreement as a whole, and the circumstances of the parties\u2019 transaction. We therefore reverse the general judgment as to plaintiffs claims and defendant\u2019s counterclaims involving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>the validity of the lien created by the trust deed, and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">Reversed and remanded as to claims and counterclaims involving the validity of the lien created by the trust deed; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-7\"> Defendant also sought to foreclose on security interests in plaintiffs personal property. That aspect of the counterclaims is not at issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b511-8\"> The order granting summary judgment was entered by the Honorable Charles D. Carlson. The trial judge was the Honorable Gregory C. Foote.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b513-6\"> Neither plaintiff nor defendant focused on or expressly argued about the meaning of the word \u201cpayment\u201d in the trial court or in their briefs on appeal. Plaintiffs arguments about the language of the collateral release provision have been directed more generally at the ambiguity inherent in the phrase \u201ca payment of principal in the amount of $20,000.00.\u201d During oral argument, the court questioned the parties regarding the word \u201cpayment\u201d in particular, and whether that word itself is necessarily singular \u2014 an implicit premise of defendant\u2019s interpretation of the provision. As part of our role in interpreting the phrase \u201ca payment of principal in the amount of $20,000.00\u201d \u2014 which is the issue that plaintiff preserved below and frames on appeal \u2014 we must necessarily consider the meaning of each of the words in that phrase.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b515-5\"> The general judgment also resolved defendant\u2019s counterclaims for an action on the note and to foreclose on security interests in plaintiffs personal property. Our decision does not disturb the trial court\u2019s judgment as to those counterclaims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
