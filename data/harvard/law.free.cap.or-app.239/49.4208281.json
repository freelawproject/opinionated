J.</author>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">Defendant, who was convicted of four counts of first-degree criminal mistreatment (corresponding to each of her four children), appeals, contending that the evidence adduced at trial was legally insufficient to demonstrate that she \u201cintentionally or knowingly withfheld] necessary and adequate food, physical care or medical attention,\u201d ORS 163.205(l)(a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from any of her children. Defendant acknowledges that she raised no challenge in the trial court to the sufficiency of the state\u2019s proof but contends that we should review and correct the purported error as an \u201cerror of law apparent on the face of the record.\u201d ORAP 5.45(1). Although the failure to move for a judgment of acquittal is ordinarily fatal to an unpreserved challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we conclude that, given the intervening elucidation of controlling legal principles in <em>State v. Baker-Krofft, </em>348 Or 655, 239 P3d 226 (2010), the entry of convictions for criminal mistreatment on this record constitutes plain error, and we affirmatively exercise our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382, 823 P2d 956 (1991), to address and remedy that error. Accordingly, we reverse defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">It would be of little benefit to the parties \u2014 or to the bench, the bar, or the public \u2014 to recount the circumstances of this case, and specifically the conditions in defendant\u2019s home, in detail. It suffices to say that, viewing the evidence (necessarily) in the light most favorable to the state, various areas of the home and its curtilage were filthy, cluttered and strewn with garbage, and malodorous. Further, a dryer in the basement was not properly vented, and there was a buildup of lint (which was flammable) behind the dryer, and there was a Drano container, without a lid, in a downstairs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>bathroom. Three of defendant\u2019s four children, ages eleven, eight, five, and two, were at home, and they appeared, to the police officers who inspected defendant\u2019s home with her consent, to be healthy, clean, and appropriately clothed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Defendant was convicted in October 2008. At that time, the controlling standard of culpability for withholding of \u201cphysical care\u201d under the criminal mistreatment statutes was that announced in <em>State v. Damofle </em>/ <em>Quintana, </em>89 Or App 620, 624, 750 P2d 518, <em>rev den, </em>305 Or 671 (1988):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-5\">\u201cThe term \u2018physical care\u2019 is not defined in the statute. Therefore, we apply its ordinary meaning. * * * The term \u2018physical\u2019 means \u2018of or relating to the body * * * often opposed to mental\u2019 or \u2018concerned or preoccupied with the body and its needs.\u2019 <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1706 (1976). The term \u2018care\u2019 means \u2018serious attention; * * * attention accompanied by caution, pains, wariness, personal interest, or responsibility * * * responsibility for or attention to safety or well being.\u2019 <em>Webster\u2019s, supra, </em>338. <em>The term \u2018physical care\u2019 thus includes attention to the safety or well being of the body. That attention necessarily includes attention to dangers in the body\u2019s environment.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">(Emphasis added.) Applying that standard in Damofle/<em>Quintana, </em>we concluded that the trial court there had properly denied a motion for judgment of acquittal, where the conditions in the defendant\u2019s home were esthetically appalling and unsanitary \u2014 cold, wet, filthy, and noisome \u2014 two of the defendant\u2019s young children were barefoot and in their underwear, and there was an accessible, partially filled gasoline container, as well as matches \u201cwithin easy reach of the children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 622. <em>See also State v. Baker-Krofft, </em>230 Or App 517, 523-24, 216 P3d 335 (2009), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>348 Or 655, 239 P3d 226 (2010) (applying <em>Damofle</em>/<em>Quintana </em>formulation and noting \u201cbroad range of conduct\u201d encompassed within that formulation); <em>accord State v. McCants/Walker, </em>231 Or App 570, 220 P3d 436 (2009), <em>rev\u2019d by State v. Baker-Krofft, </em>348 Or 655, 239 P3d 226 (2010) (attempting, unsuccessfully, to lend precision to application of <em>Damofle</em>/<em>Quintana </em>formulation).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">In August 2010, nearly two years after defendant\u2019s trial, the Supreme Court in <em>Baker-Krofft </em>addressed for the first time the <em>Damofle</em>/<em>Quintana </em>formulation, rejected that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>construct, and consequently reversed our dispositions (and the convictions) in both <em>Baker-Krofft </em>and <em>McCants/Walker. </em>In so holding, the court rejected the state\u2019s contention that \u201cphysical care\u201d broadly encompassed protecting a child from \u201cpotential environmental dangers,\u201d <em>Baker-Krofft, </em>348 Or at 661, in the home:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-4\">\u201c[The state\u2019s proposed construction] converts a statute that prohibits a present deprivation of services or attention into one that prohibits creating a risk of future harm. To be sure, presently withholding necessary and adequate physical care can impair a child\u2019s health and safety. But it does not follow that every risk of future harm to a child\u2019s health or safety that a parent either creates or fails to correct constitutes withholding physical care. The former set of risks is far broader than the latter, but the statutory prohibition extends only to the latter set (or subset) of risks.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 663. Accordingly, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">\u201cConsidering the text and context of ORS 163.200 and ORS 163.205 in light of their legislative history, we hold that a person withholds necessary and adequate physical care from a dependent person <em>when the person keeps back from the dependent person those physical services and attention that are necessary to provide for the dependent person\u2019s bodily needs.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 666-67 (emphasis added). Consistently with that standard, the court held that the evidence of, <em>inter alia, </em>potential fire hazards in <em>Baker-Krofft </em>was legally insufficient because that evidence, at most, pertained only to a \u201crisk of future harm\u201d and there was no \u201cevidence that defendant failed to protect her child from an immediate harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">Defendant contends that that analysis is dispositive here. As noted, she acknowledges, as she must, that she did not move for a judgment of acquittal; however, she asserts that, especially in light of <em>Baker-Krofft, </em>we should review her present challenge as implicating \u201can error of law apparent on the face of the record.\u201d ORAP 5.45(1). The state, which opposed \u201cplain error\u201d review before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Baker-Krofft, </em>now acknowledges that \u201cthe issue of whether the unsafe and unsanitary condition of defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>home supports a conviction for criminal mistreatment is no longer reasonably in dispute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">We have regularly declined to invoke \u201cplain error\u201d review to consider appellate challenges based on purported insufficiency of evidence in cases in which the criminal appellant failed to move for a judgment of acquittal. There are sound prudential and institutional reasons for that general approach, including encouraging adherence to requirements of preservation. <em>Cf. Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382 n 6 (identifying, as among considerations bearing on exercise of discretion to consider and correct \u201cplain error,\u201d \u201cwhether the trial court was, in some manner, presented with both sides of the issue and given an opportunity to correct any error\u201d). However, where, as here, the controlling legal standard was materially altered in the interim between trial and appeal, that change in law not only controls the determination of whether the asserted error was \u201cplain error,\u201d <em>see State v. Jury, </em>185 Or App 132, 136, 57 P3d 970 (2002), <em>rev den, </em>335 Or 504 (2003),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but can also militate in favor of the court\u2019s exercise of discretion under <em>Ailes </em>to correct that error. <em>See, e.g., State v. Banks, </em>218 Or App 593, 598, 180 P3d 726 (2008), <em>vac\u2019d and rem\u2019d on other grounds, </em>346 Or 363, 213 P3d 577 (2009) (noting that, if at the time of trial, the defendant had \u201cwith remarkable prescience\u201d raised his appellate challenge based on subsequently announced law, \u201cthe trial court would have flatly rejected such a challenge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Consistently with those principles, we conclude that, given the Supreme Court\u2019s intervening decision in <em>BakerKrofft, </em>defendant\u2019s convictions were predicated on legally insufficient evidence. <em>See Jury, </em>185 Or App at 136. We further conclude, for two reasons, that it is appropriate to exercise our <em>Ailes </em>discretion to correct that error. First, given the intervening material change in the law, \u201ccorrecting the asserted error here will not subvert the judicial system\u2019s \u2018interest in requiring preservation of error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Banks, </em>218 Or App at 598 (quoting <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 523, 173 P3d 822 (2007)). Second, the \u201cgravity of the error,\u201d <em>Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382 n 6 \u2014 the imposition of four felony convictions based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>legally insufficient evidence \u2014 is extreme. Accordingly, we reverse defendant\u2019s convictions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b71-6\"> ORS 163.205 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-7\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of criminal mistreatment in the first degree if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-8\">\u201c(a) The person, in violation of a legal duty to provide care for another person, or having assumed the permanent or temporary care, custody or responsibility for the supervision of another person, intentionally or knowingly withholds necessary and adequate food, physical care or medical attention from that other person[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">Criminal mistreatment in the first degree is a Class C felony. <em>See </em>ORS 163.205(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b74-6\"> <em>See id. </em>(explaining that asserted \u201cplain error\u201d is determined by reference to \u201cthe law existing at the time the appeal is decided, and not as of the time of trial\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b75-5\"> There is no suggestion here that there is any apposite lesser-included offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
