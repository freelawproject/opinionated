J.</author>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction for one count of driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII). ORS 813.010. He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his petition to enter into a DUII diversion agreement. We review for legal error, ORS 138.220, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Defendant was charged with DUII for an incident that occurred on July 10, 2008. Before that incident, defendant had been convicted of DUII in 1995 and, again, in 1998. With respect to the 1998 conviction, defendant participated in a substance abuse treatment program that was ordered as a condition of his probation. Before trial in this case, defendant filed a diversion petition, and the state objected on the ground that defendant had participated in a treatment program in connection with the 1998 conviction and, therefore, was ineligible for diversion in this case under ORS 813.215(1). Defendant argued that the earlier program was not a similar alcohol or drug rehabilitation program to the diversion program for which he applied in this case and, for that reason, he was eligible for diversion. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s petition, and he now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">As pertinent here, ORS 813.215(1) (2007) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-7\">\u201cA defendant is eligible for diversion if the defendant meets all of the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-8\">Hi * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-9\">\u201c(d) The defendant was not participating in a driving while under the influence of intoxicants diversion program or in any similar alcohol or drug rehabilitation program, other than a program entered into as a result of the charge for the present offense, in this state or in another jurisdiction on the date the defendant filed the petition for a driving while under the influence of intoxicants diversion agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-10\">\u201c(e) The defendant did not participate in a diversion or rehabilitation program described in paragraph (d) of this subsection, other than a program entered into as a result of the charge for the present offense, within the period beginning 10 years before the date of the commission of the present offense and ending on the date the defendant filed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>petition for a driving while under the influence of intoxicants diversion agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">On appeal, as he did before the trial court, defendant argues that his participation in alcohol and drug treatment while on probation does not qualify as participation in a \u201csimilar alcohol or drug rehabilitation program\u201d so as to render him ineligible for DUII diversion, because \u201che did not participate in the program in exchange for a milder sanction or to avoid a judicially imposed consequence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">We have had several previous opportunities to construe the phrase \u201cany similar alcohol or drug rehabilitation program\u201d in ORS 813.215. First, in <em>State v. Dunbrasky, </em>122 Or App 90, 92-93, 856 P2d 1054 (1993), we held that, because the defendant\u2019s participation in treatment for drug and alcohol abuse while on probation \u201caddressed a substance abuse problem and was accepted by [the] defendant in exchange for a milder sanction, it was sufficiently similar to the diversion to disqualify her from diversion\u201d in that case. Then, in a subsequent case, we concluded that, under the ordinary meaning of the term \u201csimilar,\u201d which included \u201c \u2018having characteristics in common : very much alike : comparable,\u2019 \u201d a DUII diversion program and a county drug court program were \u201c \u2018similar\u2019 in the sense that both are drug or alcohol rehabilitation programs the completion of which results in the dismissal of charges.\u201d <em>State v. Young, </em>196 Or App 708, 712, 103 P3d 1180 (2004), <em>rev den, </em>338 Or 583 (2005) (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>2120 (unabridged ed 2002)). Moreover, in <em>Young, </em>we rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that, to be sufficiently similar, the prior alcohol or drug program must be related to driving a vehicle; we determined that nothing in the wording of the statute compelled such a limited construction. <em>Id. </em>at 712-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">In <em>State v. Wright, </em>204 Or App 724, 731, 131 P3d 838 (2006), the defendant was determined to be ineligible for DUII diversion by the trial court because she had previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>participated in an alcohol or drug treatment program by order of a juvenile court in the course of a juvenile dependency proceeding. On appeal, the defendant relied on <em>Dunbrasky </em>and argued that the prior treatment program was not preclusively \u201csimilar\u201d to DUII diversion because she had not received a reduced criminal sentence in exchange for her participation in that program. <em>Id. </em>at 729-30. We held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-4\">\u201cDefendant reads <em>Dunbrasky </em>too narrowly. To be sure, <em>Dunbrasky </em>arose in a context in which the defendant, through her participation in the prior treatment program, had avoided the imposition of a greater criminal sanction. But not all \u2018sanctions\u2019 are criminal \u2014 and <em>Dunbrasky </em>did not purport to impose such a limitation. Rather, a \u2018sanction\u2019 is commonly understood to be a substantial adverse consequence imposed as a result of a person\u2019s conduct, often when that conduct violates a law or legal obligation. Properly so understood, the judicially compelled loss of custody of one\u2019s child because of one\u2019s conduct is a \u2018sanction.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-5\">\u201cWith that understanding, the \u2018similarity\u2019 of defendant\u2019s participation in the [prior] treatment program to a DUII diversion program is apparent. In the [prior] treatment program, defendant, like a participant in a DUII diversion program, was given the opportunity to avoid a substantial, judicially imposed adverse consequence related to her substance abuse by successfully completing a substance abuse program. * * * The trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s petition for diversion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 730-31 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Defendant acknowledges that, at least on the surface, this case would appear to be controlled by <em>Dunbrasky, </em>because, like the defendant\u2019s situation there, defendant\u2019s prior participation in a rehabilitation program occurred while he was on probation. However, defendant notes that, after the defendant in <em>Dunbrasky </em>participated in a probationary rehabilitation program in 1988, the sentencing guidelines were adopted in 1989. Under the guidelines regime, probation is no longer an alternative to a sentence; it is now, itself, a sentence. <em>See State v. Hamlin, </em>151 Or App 481, 487, 950 P2d 336 (1997), <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 173 (1998) (\u2018With the passage of the sentencing guidelines [in 1989], the nature of\u2018probation\u2019 has changed. Probation is no longer the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>suspension of a sentence; probation <em>is </em>the sentence.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)). It follows, defendant reasons, that a rehabilitation program imposed as part of a probationary sentence constitutes the initial imposition of a criminal penalty, not a \u201cmilder sanction\u201d accepted to avoid a more onerous consequence, as <em>Dunbrasky </em>used the term and, therefore, such a program is not similar to a diversionary rehabilitation program. But, as our decisions in the wake of <em>Dunbrasky </em>show, defendant reads that case too narrowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">Most recently, in <em>State v. LaGrassa, </em>235 Or App 150, 230 P3d 96, <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 57 (2010), we held that an alcohol or drug rehabilitation program imposed as a condition of post-prison supervision was \u201csimilar\u201d to a DUII diversion program, despite the defendant\u2019s argument that a sanction imposed by the Department of Corrections, rather than a court, did not qualify as a similar program.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-5\">\u201cOur prior case law * * * has eschewed a narrow construction of the statutory phrase \u2018any similar alcohol or drug rehabilitation program,\u2019 but has not gone so far as to subsume within the statute\u2019s scope a defendant\u2019s unilateral participation in a rehabilitation program. The scope of the statutory phrase being so framed, we conclude that an essential characteristic of DUII diversion is that a defendant is required by a governmental actor to participate in a rehabilitation program in order to avoid a substantial adverse consequence. Although our prior case law referred to that adverse consequence as being judicially imposed, that reference did not describe the necessary meaning of a \u2018similar\u2019 rehabilitation program under ORS 813.215.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">\u201cWe discern no meaningful difference, or dissimilarity, between participation in an alcohol or drug rehabilitation program while on probation, which has been determined to be a \u2018similar\u2019 program to DUII diversion, <em>see Dunbrasky, </em>122 Or App at 92-93, and participation in an alcohol or drug rehabilitation program while on [post-prison supervision]. In both cases, participation in the treatment program is mandated by a governmental actor, addresses a defendant\u2019s alcohol or substance abuse, and avoids the imposition of a substantial adverse consequence that could include incarceration. The core attribute of a DUII diversion program, for purposes of the similarity of a rehabilitation program, is not which governmental actor requires the treatment or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>imposes the sanction, but rather the requirement of participation in the diagnosis and treatment program in order to avoid a governmentally imposed sanction or penalty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 157-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Although, unlike <em>LaGrassa, </em>this case does not involve the imposition of a treatment requirement by a nonjudicial governmental actor, the reasoning of that case is instructive here. An alcohol or drug rehabilitation program imposed as a condition of probation is analogous to a program imposed as a condition of post-prison supervision; it is required by a governmental actor to avoid a substantial adverse consequence. In the case of post-prison supervison, that consequence is a sanction for noncompliance. In the case of probation, if defendant had failed to participate in the mandated program, he would have violated probation and faced substantial adverse consequences as a result of that violation. Thus, for purposes of defendant\u2019s eligibility for diversion, changes in the nature of probation since the adoption of the sentencing guidelines do not require a different result from our conclusion in <em>Dunbrasky. </em>Because defendant participated in a \u201csimilar alcohol or drug treatment program\u201d while on probation so as to render him ineligible for DUII diversion, the trial court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b41-7\"> All references in this opinion are to the 2007 version of ORS 813.215(1), which has since been amended. <em>See </em>Or Laws 2009, ch 515, \u00a7 1.
