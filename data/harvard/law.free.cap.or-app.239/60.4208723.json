J.</author>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">Petitioner Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) seeks judicial review, and respondent Paul Foland cross-petitions for judicial review, of an order of the Land Use Board of Appeals (LUBA) in which LUBA remanded Jackson County\u2019s decision approving ODOT\u2019s application to site an interstate highway rest area and welcome center on land that is zoned for exclusive farm use and is approximately 500 feet south of the urban growth boundary of the City of Ashland. We reject without discussion Foland\u2019s seven assignments of error on cross-petition. We write only to address ODOT\u2019s sole legal contention that LUBA erred in concluding that Goal 11, which concerns the planning and development of public facilities and services, \u201cprohibits the extension of city water services to serve [ODOT\u2019s] urban use[, <em>viz., </em>the rest area and welcome center,] on rural land without an exception to Goal 11.\u201d We determine that LUBA\u2019s order in that regard was not \u201cunlawful in substance,\u201d ORS 197.850(9)(a), and, consequently, affirm on petition and cross-petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Because it provides context for the parties\u2019 contentions, before turning to the facts, we describe the general policy underlying Goal 11 and OAR 660-011-0065, its implementing rule concerning water systems. Generally, Goal 11 concerns the \u201cplan[ning] and develop[ment of] a timely, orderly and efficient arrangement of public facilities and services to serve as a framework for urban and rural development.\u201d Such development \u201cshall be guided and supported by types and levels of urban and rural public facilities and services[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] appropriate for, <em>but limited to, </em>the needs and requirements of the urban, urbanizable, and rural areas to be served.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Consistently with those requirements, the goal establishes several guidelines to aid in the planning of public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>facilities and services. Each guideline \u201cis advisory, not mandatory,\u201d and \u201csuggests an approach designed to aid agencies and others to comply with the Goal.\u201d <em>Audubon Society v. Dept. of Fish and Wildlife, </em>67 Or App 776, 780, 681 P2d 135 (1984).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As pertinent here, Guideline A(2) provides that \u201c[p]ublic facilities and services for rural areas should be provided at levels appropriate for rural use only and should not support urban uses\u201d and Guideline A(3) provides that \u201c[pjublic facilities and services in urban areas should be provided at levels necessary and suitable for urban uses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">In short, Goal 11 concerns the provision of public facilities and services. Specifically, the goal requires an \u201corderly and efficient arrangement of public facilities and services\u201d and is intended to regulate development by limiting facilities and services to \u201cthe needs and requirements of the urban, urbanizable, and rural areas to be served.\u201d In other words, by limiting facilities and services to the needs and requirements of the land to be served <em>(i.e., </em>urban, urbanizable, rural), Goal 11 helps prevent the proliferation of urban uses in rural areas that might otherwise result from the extension of urban-level facilities and services outside an urban growth boundary (UGB) to rural land.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Goal 11 expressly contemplates the regulation of two types of \u201cpublic facilities and services\u201d \u2014 that is, sewer systems and water systems. In 1998, the Department of Land Conservation and Development promulgated OAR 660-011-0060 and OAR 660-011-0065, two rules to implement the specific goal provisions concerning sewer and water systems. With regard to sewer systems, the text of the goal and OAR 660-011-0060, as a general matter, prohibit the establishment or extension of a sewer system to serve land outside of a UGB, without an exception to Goal ll.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Conversely, with regard to water systems, the goal and the pertinent rule, OAR 660-011-0065(2), do not, as a general matter, categorically prohibit the establishment or extension of water systems to serve land outside of a UGB. Instead, the goal provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-4\">\u201c[l]ocal governments shall not rely upon the presence, establishment, or extension of a water or sewer system to allow residential development of land outside urban growth boundaries or unincorporated community boundaries at a density higher than authorized without service from such a system.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">In turn, OAR 660-011-0065(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">\u201cConsistent with Goal 11, local land use regulations applicable to lands that are outside urban growth boundaries and unincorporated community boundaries shall not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">\u201c(a) Allow an increase in a base density in a residential zone due to the availability of service from a water system;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\">\u201c(b) Allow a higher density for residential development served by a water system than would be authorized without such service; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>\u201c(c) Allow an increase in the allowable density of residential development due to the presence, establishment, or extension of a water system.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Of significance, although the goal and the rule are clearly concerned with a local government\u2019s use of the establishment or extension of a water system as a justification to increase <em>residential </em>densities in an area outside a UGB, the goal and the rule are silent as to whether Goal ll\u2019s underlying objectives permit the extension of water systems to rural lands to serve a <em>nonresidential </em>urban use without an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">In <em>Gisler v. Deschutes County, </em>149 Or App 528, 535, 945 P2d 1051 (1997), we noted that the goal\u2019s specific proscriptions concerning sewer and water systems did not circumscribe the three \u201coverall objectives\u201d that Goal 11 was intended to further.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In that case, the petitioner sought to build a subdivision in a \u201clow-density residential zone\u201d that was outside a UGB. <em>Id. </em>at 530. With regard to subdivisions, the Deschutes Development Code required that all lots be connected to a \u201c \u2018Department of Environmental Quality-permitted community or municipal sewer system.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>However, the petitioner\u2019s proposed development \u201c[was] not connected to an existing sewer system, and there [was] no existing city or community sewer system that [was] located or ha[d] facilities outside the UGB and that [was] near the subdivision site.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In rejecting petitioner\u2019s argument that the county requirement was invalid because it was inconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>with the Goal 11 proscriptions concerning sewer systems, we explained the objectives underlying the goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">Citing <em>1000 Friends of Oregon v. LCDC (Curry Co.), </em>301 Or 447, 724 P2d 268 (1986) <em>(Curry </em>County), we reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\">\u201cthe overall objectives of [Goal 11] are to regulate development as well as services and facilities, to coordinate development levels with service and facility levels and, together with Goal 14, to channel intensive uses and development to existing urban and urbanizable land first before allowing the conversion of or intense nonresource uses on the rural land that comprises the areas outside UGBs.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-6\"><em>Gisler, </em>149 Or App at 535. In sum, we concluded that \u201cthe requirements of Goal 11 go well beyond\u201d the limitations on sewer and water systems and that more generally Goal 11 \u201cregulates the location, pace and direction of residential and other development, and it limits \u2014 and requires coordination between \u2014 the placement of urban-level development and urban-level services and facilities on rural land * * <em>Id. </em>at 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">With that essential understanding of the goal, we turn to the facts of this case, as recounted in LUBA\u2019s order. In 2008, ODOT applied to site a rest area and welcome center (rest area) on an 18-acre parcel of land located approximately 500 feet south of the UGB of the City of Ashland and zoned for exclusive farm use. ODOT\u2019s application indicated that it would obtain water service \u201cfrom the City of Ashland by extending city water lines to the subject property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">As LUBA explained, the county, in approving ODOT\u2019s application,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">\u201cgranted exceptions to Goals 3 and 14 for the proposed rest area to be sited on rural land. In approving an exception to Goal 14 for the rest area, we understand the county to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>determined that a rest area serving over a million visitors a year is an urban use of rural land that would otherwise be prohibited by Goal 14 without an exception.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-3\">With regard to the extension of city water service to the property, however, the county did not take an exception to Goal 11 because it determined that \u201c \u2018[t]he extension of water * * * service to the Rest Area is consistent with [that goal].\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Foland and others appealed the county\u2019s decision to LUBA. As pertinent to the applicability of Goal 11, they contended that the county should have taken an exception to Goal 11 for the extension of water service to the property because the proposed rest area \u201cis an urban use\u201d on rural land and that Goal 11 \u201cprohibits the extension of urban-level facilities and services onto rural lands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">ODOT intervened and asserted that the county correctly determined that an exception to Goal 11 was not required. Specifically, ODOT contended that the text of OAR 660-011-0065 controlled and \u201climited a need for a goal exception for water service to residential uses.\u201d ODOT explained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-6\">\u201c[allthough water systems and water are discussed in Goal 11, the current rule does not prohibit extending water service outside of a UGB to <em>non-residential development. </em>The Safety Rest Area/Welcome Center is not a residential development. If [the Land Conservation and Development Commission (LCDC)] had intended otherwise, it could have said so as clearly as the policy against extension of sewer systems.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">Based on the text of Goal 11 and the history of the amendments to the goal, and the promulgation of OAR 660-011-0065, LUBA ultimately concluded that \u201cGoal 11 prohibits the extension of city water services to serve that urban use[, <em>viz., </em>the rest area,] on rural land without an exception to Goal 11.\u201d Specifically, LUBA reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>\u201cOAR 660-011-0065 took effect in July, 1998, in response to the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Dept. of Land Conservation v. Lincoln County, </em>144 Or App 9, 925 P2d 135 (1996)[, <em>rev den, </em>324 Or 560 (1997)]. In <em>Lincoln County, </em>DLCD challenged the county\u2019s approval of 113 residential lots on a 50-acre parcel of land outside of an urban growth boundary (the \u2018Mariner\u2019s Village\u2019 development). The property was within the boundaries of an existing water district, and the proposed density of the subdivision was higher than would otherwise be permitted without the property\u2019s location within the water district boundaries. LUBA held that under a prior version of Goal 11, the proposed extension of water lines to each individual lot from the main water district line violated Goal 11 because it was an \u2018extension of a water system\u2019 under the then-applicable Goal 11 language. * * * The Court of Appeals disagreed, finding that the phrase \u2018establishment or extension of a water system\u2019 referred to the \u2018new <em>or </em>expanded presence of water systems in areas where none was present before.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 17 (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-4\">\u201cIn response to the court\u2019s holding, LCDC enacted OAR 660-011-0065 * * *. The rule does make clear that Goal 11 is concerned with the presence or availability of a sewer or water system facilitating increased residential density on rural land, presumably because that could lead to rural land being put to urban use in contravention of Goal 14. <em>However, the history of the enactment of that rule indicates that LCDC did not intend to address the universe of concerns under Goal 11 in enacting the rule, or to in all circumstances allow a water system to serve </em>non-residential <em>urban uses on rural land without an exception to Goal 11. </em>Thus, we agree with [the petitioner] that OAR 660-011-0065 does not purport to identify the universe of Goal 11 concerns regarding extension of water systems onto rural land. Where the extension of a water system onto rural lands is proposed to facilitate an urban use of that land, the extension is prohibited without an exception to Goal 11. In the present case, the county granted an exception to Goal 14 for the rest area * * *, presumably because a use that attracts over a million visitors a year constitutes an urban use. Goal 11 prohibits the extension of city water services to serve that urban use on rural land without an exception to Goal 11.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">(Footnotes omitted; emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number> ODOT petitioned for judicial review. On review, the parties renew the core contentions presented to LUBA. Specifically, ODOT reiterates that, although \u201c[t]he underlying policy of Goal 11 is to match public facilities with appropriate development plans [,]\u201d the text and context of Goal 11 and the history surrounding the enactment of OAR 660-011-0065 conclusively demonstrate that Goal 11 only \u201cprohibits a local government from increasing <em>residential densities </em>in rural areas, based on * * * an extension\u201d of \u201ccity water services outside the [UGB].\u201d (Emphasis added.) In other words, ODOT contends, without qualification, that the goal does not \u201climit the extension of water systems to <em>non-residential </em>uses on rural land.\u201d (Emphasis added.) For the reasons that follow, we disagree with ODOT and conclude that the county was required to take an exception to Goal 11 to extend water service to the rest area.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Resolution of the parties\u2019 competing contentions requires that we discern the meaning of Goal 11. In doing so, we are guided by the principles described in <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 859 P2d 1143 (1993), as amplified in <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). In sum, here, we attempt to determine the meaning of the goal most likely intended by LCDC \u2014 the agency that adopted it \u2014 examining the text in context along with the history concerning the goal\u2019s amendments offered by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">ODOT is correct that \u2014 unlike the provisions concerning sewer systems \u2014 neither the goal nor OAR 660-011-0065 governing water systems expressly and categorically prohibits the extension of water services to rural areas. Nonetheless, reference to the overarching policies of Goal 11 and the history of amendments to the goal contradict ODOT\u2019s characterization of the significance of that distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">As noted, at the time that we decided <em>Gisler, </em>the text of Goal 11 included substantively similar proscriptions concerning water and sewer systems. <em>See </em>239 Or App at 66 n 4. In <em>Gisler, </em>we reasoned that a proper understanding of Goal 11 required that we look at the goal in its entirety rather than with a view only to the particular proscriptions concerning water and sewer systems. Ultimately, we concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Goal 11 \u201cregulates the location, pace and direction of residential and other development, and it <em>limits </em>\u2014 and requires coordination <em>between </em>\u2014 the <em>placement of urban-level development and urban-level services and facilities on rural land * * Gisler, </em>149 Or App at 536 (emphasis added). Consistently with that objective, we conclude that, in this case, the extension of water services to the rest area \u2014 a nonresidential urban use \u2014 on rural land does not comport with Goal 11 and, consequently, the county was required to take an exception to extend the water services in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">Further, we disagree with ODOT that the history surrounding the 1994 and 1998 goal amendments and the promulgation of OAR 660-011-0065 in 1998 conclusively lead to a contrary conclusion. Specifically, as further support for its contention that Goal 11 does not \u201climit the extension of water systems to non-residential uses on rural land,\u201d ODOT refers to various documents from the Department of Land Conservation and Development (DLCD) as well as LCDC that demonstrate that the 1994 and 1998 changes were grounded in an intent to prevent urban-level residential densities in rural areas due to the establishment or extension of a water system.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Although we agree with ODOT that the prevention of urban-level residential densities was the chief concern that led to the amendments to the goal and the promulgation of the rule, the documents do not, as LUBA indicated, \u201cpurport to identify the universe of Goal 11 concerns regarding extension of water systems onto rural land.\u201d In fact, in a memorandum from DLCD to LCDC regarding a public hearing concerning the 1998 amendments, DLCD acknowledges that, even in light of the 1998 amendments,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-6\">\u201c[t]he other general requirements of Goal 11, especially the definitions of rural facilities and services, could be interpreted to mean that water systems to serve rural areas are inappropriate in some circumstances. That question is not addressed by this report.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">In other words, the documents on which ODOT relies do not purport to identify the \u201cuniverse\u201d of cognizable Goal 11 concerns or demonstrate that the general policies underlying Goal 11 as described in <em>Gisler </em>were somehow circumscribed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>by subsequent amendments. Rather those documents indicate merely that the amendments were designed to deal only with a specific concern about water systems <em>(viz., </em>the prevention of urban-level residential densities in rural areas due to the establishment or extension of a water system).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">In sum, we conclude, as did LUBA, that \u201cGoal 11 prohibits the extension of city water services to serve that urban use on rural land without an exception to Goal 11.\u201d As LUBA reasoned,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-5\">\u201cwhere an exception to Goal 14 is required in order to site an urban use on rural land, a corresponding exception to Goal 11 will be required where the intensity of urban use of land requires the provision of public sewage facilities and services for health and safety reasons. In that circumstance, it may well be that the same factors that justify an exception for extending the city\u2019s sewer system onto the subject property, or the same factors that justify the Goal 14 exception to site the urban use on rural land, could serve as justification for extending water service onto the property. However, an exception to Goal 11 to extend water service is still required.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b83-7\"> Goal 11 defines \u201crural facilities and services\u201d to mean \u201cfacilities and services suitable and appropriate <em>solely </em>for the needs of rural lands\u201d and \u201curban facilities and services\u201d to mean \u201ckey facilities and * * * appropriate types and levels of at least the following: police protection; sanitary facilities; storm drainage facilities; planning, zoning and subdivision control; health services; recreation facilities and services; energy and communication services; and community governmental services.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b84-6\"> <em>See </em>ORS 197.015(9) (\u201c \u2018Guidelines\u2019 means suggested approaches designed to aid cities and counties in preparation, adoption and implementation of comprehensive plans in compliance with goals and to aid state agencies and special districts in the preparation, adoption and implementation of plans, programs and regulations in compliance with goals.
