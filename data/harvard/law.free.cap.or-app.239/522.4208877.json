Coos STEP applied for the permit in conjunction with its proposed plan to move and reconstruct a fish hatchery on Morgan Creek. The issues in this case concern inconsistencies between the statutory standards for issuing a fill/removal permit, ORS 196.825 (2005), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2007, ch 849, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5; Or Laws 2009, ch 342, \u00a7 2; Or Laws 2009, ch 343, \u00a7 20, and the standards set out in a DSL rule, OAR 141-085-0029 (Mar 27, 2006). Broadly speaking, the statutory standards require an evaluation of the effects of the fill or removal activity, whereas some of the regulatory standards speak to the effects of the \u201cproject\u201d as a whole. DSL concluded that the broader scope of the rule exceeded its rule-making authority and applied the narrower statutory approval criteria to the permit. Petitioners claim that DSL erred in concluding that it lacked authority to broaden the permit standards in the rule and that the agency was bound to apply its own rule to the permit. Petitioners particularly contend that DSL erred in failing to apply two of the rule standards to the \u201cproject\u201d as opposed to the fill and removal activities. Petitioners finally assert that one of the findings in the order lacks substantial evidence in the record. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The relevant facts, as found by the director, are as follows. In 1982, Coos STEP, through the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW), began operating a fish hatchery on Priorly Creek in Coos County. In 1986, the hatchery was expanded to the confluence of Priorly Creek and Morgan Creek. In or about 1998, petitioner Nicole Examilotis purchased property on Morgan Creek just west of the hatchery; she later learned that the hatchery was actually on her property and not on the adjacent tax lot owned by the person who had given permission to Coos STEP and ODFW to expand the hatchery. After being notified of the situation, Coos STEP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>and ODFW proposed to move the hatchery to a site further up Morgan Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">In December 2005, DSL received a joint fill and removal permit application from Coos STEP and ODFW to fill in rock along Morgan Creek for the new hatchery and to remove silt from behind a temporary dam. The application proposed to remove 71 square yards of structures related to the existing hatchery from the waterway and reconstruct the hatchery by adding 25 square yards of concrete and rock to the creek. The work proposed in the application that related directly to the waters of the state was to install a removable, flashboard diversion dam, a fishway, a main raceway with diversions at each end, a water intake channel, a fish bypass structure, and a manually operated fish sorting ladder. Coos STEP proposed to build a spawning pool and building further from the creek. DSL provided a comment period for interested parties and received objections from local landowners to the operation and maintenance of the proposed hatchery.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">In response to concerns that arose during DSL\u2019s investigation into the impact of the proposed fill/removal on wetlands, Coos STEP submitted a revised permit application in April 2007. DSL then provided a second comment period and again received feedback from interested parties. DSL considered the comments and concluded that most were complaints regarding the operation of the proposed hatchery. In particular, DSL concluded that the neighbors\u2019 issues regarding the odor from the hatchery and traffic safety were outside its jurisdiction. In addition, the director found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">\u201cDSL considered all alternatives, including different sites for the hatchery. Coos STEP reviewed a number of alternative sites, including those suggested by [petitioners], and concluded that the alternative sites were not as good due to environmental concerns, the lack of access, or were not food fish areas designated by ODFW. ODFW considered and rejected alternatives to Coos STEP\u2019S proposal, including moving to Daniels Creek, which had inadequate water and no facilities, plus ownership issues. An alternative suggested by [petitioners] was on someone else\u2019s property and not feasible. DSL considered these alternatives and agreed with Coos STEP and ODFW that they were not feasible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>(Citations omitted.) Ultimately, on July 13, 2007, DSL granted the application from Coos STEP and issued a fill/ removal permit, subject to various conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">In August 2007, petitioners requested a contested case hearing on the permit. DSL referred the request to the Office of Administrative Hearings, and an administrative law judge (ALJ) was assigned to conduct the hearing. Among the issues to be considered by the ALJ was \u201c[w]hether the scope of DSL\u2019s review is limited to only the fill/removal parts of Coos STEP\u2019s application or whether it must review all parts of the application, including any concerns regarding the operation of the hatchery. ORS 196.825 and OAR 141-085-0029.\u201d In May 2008, the ALJ issued a proposed order resolving that issue, along with others raised by the petitioners. Following consideration of that proposed order, the director issued the final order now before us on review that, as far we can tell, is identical to the order proposed by the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">II. THE FINAL ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"AXj\">A. <em>Statutory and Regulatory Framework</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Before discussing the conclusions reached by the director in the final order, and because doing so will provide helpful context, we describe the statutory and regulatory framework governing DSL\u2019s authority to issue fill/removal permits as it existed in April 2007, when DSL received Coos STEP\u2019s revised permit application.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At that time, ORS 196.810(l)(a) generally prohibited the removal of material from beds and banks of state waters and the filling of state waters without a permit. In determining whether to issue the permit, DSL was required to consider certain criteria pursuant to ORS 196.825. That statute provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>\u201c(1) The Director of the Department of State Lands shall issue a permit to remove material from the beds or banks of any waters of this state applied for under ORS 196.815 if the director determines that <em>the removal </em>described in the application will not be inconsistent with the protection, conservation and best use of the water resources of this state as specified in ORS 196.805.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-4\">\u201c(2) The director shall issue a permit applied for under ORS 196.815 for filling waters of this state if the director determines that <em>the proposed fill </em>would not unreasonably interfere with the paramount policy of this state to preserve the use of its waters for navigation, fishing and public recreation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">\u201c(3) In determining whether or not a permit shall be issued, the director shall consider all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">\u201c(a) The public need for <em>the proposed fill </em>and the social, economic or other public benefits likely to result from <em>the proposed fill. </em>When the applicant for a fill permit is a public body, the director may accept and rely upon the public body\u2019s findings as to local public need and local public benefit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">\u201c(b) The economic cost to the public if <em>the proposed fill </em>is not accomplished.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-8\">\u201c(c) The availability of alternatives to <em>the project </em>for which <em>the fill is proposed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-9\">\u201c(d) The availability of alternative sites for <em>the proposed fill.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>\u201c(e) Whether <em>the proposed fill </em>conforms to sound policies of conservation and would not interfere with public health and safety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-4\">\u201c(f) Whether <em>the proposed fill </em>is in conformance with existing public uses of the waters and with uses designated for adjacent land in an acknowledged comprehensive plan and zoning ordinances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">\u201c(g) Whether <em>the proposed fill </em>is compatible with the acknowledged comprehensive plan and land use regulations for the area where <em>the proposed fill </em>is to take place or can be conditioned on a future local approval to meet this criterion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">\u201c(h) Whether <em>the proposed fill </em>is for streambank protection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">\u201c(i) Whether the applicant has provided all practicable mitigation to reduce the adverse effects of <em>the proposed fill </em>in the manner set forth in ORS 196.800(10). If off-site compensatory wetland mitigation is proposed, the applicant shall document the impracticability of on-site compensatory wetland mitigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">In 2006, DSL, pursuant to its general rulemaking authority in ORS 196.692,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> promulgated a rule under ORS 196.825 that established regulatory standards for its review of permit applications; those standards were substantially similar \u2014 but not identical \u2014 to the statutory criteria announced in ORS 196.825. Specifically, OAR 141-085-0029(3) (Mar 27, 2006) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-10\">\u201cTo issue an individual removal-fill permit the Department must determine that <em>the proposed removal-fill activity </em>will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>not be inconsistent with the protection, conservation and best use of the water resources of this state and would not unreasonably interfere with the paramount public policy of this state to preserve the use of its waters for navigation, fishing and public recreation, by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\">\u201c(a) Considering the public need for <em>the project </em>including the social, economic or other public benefits likely to result from <em>the project. </em>If the applicant is a public body, the Department may rely on the public body\u2019s findings as to local public need and benefit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">\u201c(b) Considering the economic cost to the public if <em>the project </em>is not accomplished;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">\u201c(c) Considering whether <em>the project </em>would interfere with public health and safety;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">\u201c(d) Considering whether <em>the project </em>is compatible with the local comprehensive land use plan. The Department will not issue an individual removal-fill permit for <em>a project </em>that is not consistent or compatible with the local comprehensive land use plan and/or zoning ordinance. The Department may issue an individual removal-fill permit requiring the applicant to obtain local land use approval prior to beginning the authorized activity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-8\">\u201c(e) Determining the degree to which, if at all, <em>the project, </em>will unreasonably interfere with navigation, fishing and public recreation uses of the waters of the state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">\u201c(f) Considering the degree to which, if at all, <em>the project </em>will increase erosion or flooding upstream and downstream of <em>the project </em>or redirect water from <em>the project </em>site onto adjacent nearby lands[;]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-10\">\u201c(g) Considering the practicable alternatives for <em>the project </em>in accordance with (4) as presented in the application;[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-11\">\u201c(h) Considering practicable mitigation (including compensatory mitigation) for all reasonably expected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>adverse impacts <em>ofproject </em>development, as required by subsection (5).[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">For purposes of OAR chapter 141, division 85, OAR 141-085-0010(169) (Mar 26, 2006) defined \u201cproject\u201d to mean \u201cthe primary development or use intended to be accomplished (e.g. retail shopping complex, residential development).\u201d In addition, OAR 141-085-0010(170) (Mar 27, 2006) defined \u201cproject area\u201d to mean \u201cthe physical space in which the removal-fill takes place including any on site or off-site mitigation site,\u201d which encompassed \u201cthe entire area of ground disturbance, even though not within waters of the state, including all staging areas and access ways, both temporary and permanent.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">B. <em>Conclusions Reached in the Final Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">In issuing the final order in this case, the director was thus tasked with reconciling OAR 141-085-0029 (the standards rule) and OAR 141-085-0010 (the definition rule) with ORS 196.825.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the final order, the director, in a footnote, stated, \u201cAs explained below, DSL\u2019s review is limited by statute only to the fill/removal parts of the plan and therefore [petitioners\u2019] issues are reviewed only under the statutory standard.\u201d The director later explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>\u201cAny attempt by DSL to expand its scope of review by rule is beyond the scope of review set out in ORS 196.825 and related sections and is not permitted. DSL exceeded its authority when defining \u2018project\u2019 in OAR 141-085-0010(169) beyond the fill/removal parts of an application. DSL has established that its review of the \u2018project\u2019 is limited to the fill/removal parts of Coos STEP\u2019S application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">Consequently, the director reviewed the remaining issues raised by petitioners under only the statutory criteria; the director did <em>not </em>review those issues under any of the regulatory standards of OAR 141-085-0029. As to the criteria in ORS 196.825, the director concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">\u201cDSL has shown that the fill and removal plan proposed by Coos STEP is consistent with the protection, conservation and best use of the water resources of this state, as specified in ORS 196.600 to 196.905, and would not unreasonably interfere with the paramount policy of this state to preserve the use of its waters for navigation, fishing and public recreation. DSL established that it considered the availability of alternatives to the proposed fill and removal plan and the availability of alternative sites. It further showed that the proposed fill or removal conforms to sound policies of conservation and would not interfere with public health and safety.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Regarding practical and feasible alternatives, the director stated further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">\u201cDSL\u2019s review is not whether there were more practical and feasible alternatives to the proposed hatchery, but only whether there are more practical and feasible alternatives to the fill and removal plan proposed by Coos STEP. [Petitioners] argued that the barrier between the raceway and Morgan Creek was deteriorating and was not a good place for fill and removal, but as explained above, the barrier is reinforced by riprap and DSL accounted for possibility of deterioration by imposing a condition that the barrier be reinforced with the planting of vegetation. If this planting has not been done or if efforts to stop deterioration do not work, DSL has reserved authority in the permit to require more measures to prevent erosion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">The director thus determined that \u201cDSL properly issued a permit to Coos STEP.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>III. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">On review, petitioners raise several interrelated challenges to the final order. We address those challenges to the final order for errors of law and substantial evidence. <em>See </em>ORS 196.835 (2009) (providing, in part, that \u201c[a]ppeals from the director\u2019s final order may be taken to the Court of Appeals in the manner provided by ORS 183.482\u201d); ORS 183.482(8)(a), (c) (orders in a contested case reviewed to determine if \u201cthe agency has erroneously interpreted a provision of law and that a correct interpretation compels a particular action\u201d and if supported by \u201csubstantial evidence in the record\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">In their first three assignments of error, petitioners contend that (1) two particularly relevant parts of OAR 141-085-0029(3) require DSL to assess the effects of \u201cthe project,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the entire fish hatchery facility: OAR 141-085-0029(3)(c) (\u201cwhether the project would interfere with public health and safety\u201d) and OAR 141-085-0029(3)(f) (\u201cthe degree to which, if at all, the project will increase erosion or flooding upstream and downstream of the project or redirect water from the project site onto adjacent nearby lands\u201d); (2) DSL lacks authority to not apply those rules by construing them to be outside of its statutory authority to adopt; and, therefore, (3) DSL erroneously interpreted its rules and a remand is necessary for their application to the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">DSL counters that (1) \u201cthe project,\u201d as used in the administrative rules, means the fill and removal activities, and DSL did not err in confining its review to those activities; (2) alternatively, the agency did not err in failing to apply those parts of OAR 141-085-0029 that exceeded the permit criteria set out in ORS 196.825. We conclude that (1) the term, \u201cthe project,\u201d is used in the administrative rules to cover activities and uses beyond any fill and removal; (2) DSL had authority to not apply rules that exceeded its rulemaking authority; and (3) DSL did not err in confining its review of the permit to the criteria announced in ORS 196.825.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\"> Again, OAR 141-085-0029(3)(c) and OAR 141-085-0029(3)(f) apply standards to \u201cthe project.\u201d In determining the meaning of an administrative rule, our role is the same as in determining the meaning of a statute, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cto determine the meaning of the words used, giving effect to the intent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>the enacting body.\u201d <em>Abu-Adas v. Employment Dept., </em>325 Or 480, 485, 940 P2d 1219 (1997). Our inquiry begins with an examination of the text and context of the rule itself. <em>Id. </em>To recall, OAR 141-085-0010(169) defined \u201cproject\u201d to mean \u201cthe primary development or use intended to be accomplished (e.g. retail shopping complex, residential development).\u201d In addition, as context, OAR 141-085-0010(170) defined \u201cproject area\u201d to mean \u201cthe physical space in which the removal-fill takes place including any on site or off-site mitigation site,\u201d including \u201cthe entire area of ground disturbance, even though not within waters of the state, including all staging areas and access ways, both temporary and permanent.\u201d Thus, \u201cproject,\u201d as defined by OAR 141-085-0010(169), and as used in OAR 141-085-0029, possessed an expansive scope, reaching beyond the proposed fill or removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">DSL, however, did not err in not applying those parts of OAR 141-085-0029 that required consideration of issues outside DSL\u2019s authority to issue permits under ORS 196.825. It is axiomatic that \u201can agency has only those powers that the legislature grants and cannot exercise authority that it does not have.\u201d <em>SAIF v. Shipley, </em>326 Or 557, 561, 955 P2d 244 (1998). \u201cIn the absence of a statute which grants a presumption of validity to administrative regulations, an administrative agency must, when its rule-making power is challenged, show that its regulation falls within a clearly defined statutory grant of authority.\u201d <em>Ore. Newspaper Pub. v. Peterson, </em>244 Or 116, 123, 415 P2d 21 (1966) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Under ORS 196.692(1), the rulemaking authority of DSL is limited to those rules that \u201ccarry out the provisions\u201d of various statutes, including ORS 196.825. Put another way, the agency\u2019s rulemaking authority is confined to policies that implement its statutory authority and does not include the authority to issue rules that expand or neglect those responsibilities. OAR 141-085-0029 \u201ccarr[ies] out the provisions of\u2019 ORS 196.825, a statute that <em>requires </em>the director to issue a fill or removal permit if certain criteria are met. ORS 196.825(1) (the director \u201cshall issue a permit to remove material * * * if the director determines that * * * [the proposed removal meets particular standards]\u201d); ORS 196.825(2) (the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>director \u201cshall issue a permit * * * for filling waters of this state if the director determines that [the proposed fill meets specified criteria]\u201d). DSL did not err, then, in confining the scope of its rule to the statutory directives in ORS 196.825. The question becomes whether ORS 196.825 allows consideration of the effects of \u201cthe project,\u201d as defined by OAR 141-085-0010(169), in issuing a fill or removal permit. We conclude that only one part of the statute applies to \u201cthe project,\u201d as distinguished from evaluation of fill and removal activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">In construing ORS 196.825, we employ the familiar methodology of <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-73, 206 P3d 1042 (2009), <em>and PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). Under ORS 196.825(3)(c), the director was required to consider \u201c[t]he availability of alternatives to <em>the project </em>for which <em>the fill is proposed.\u201d </em>(Emphases added.) There are no other statutory references to \u201cproject\u201d in the approval criteria set out in ORS 196.825 and ORS 196.805.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Conversely, ORS 196.825(3)(d) required consideration of \u201calternative sites for the <em>proposed fill.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Given the separate requirements to consider alternatives to both \u201cthe project for which the fill is proposed\u201d and alternative sites \u201cfor the proposed fill,\u201d it is plain that \u201cproject\u201d means something different from \u201cthe proposed fill.\u201d The word \u201cproject\u201d was not defined by any provision in ORS chapter 196. Therefore, as a word of common usage, we give \u201cproject\u201d its \u201cplain, natural, and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>See PGE, </em>317 Or at 611. Among its various meanings, \u201cproject\u201d is defined as \u201ca specific plan or design.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1813 (unabridged ed 2002). As used in ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>196.825(3)(c) (\u201cthe project for which the fill is proposed\u201d), then, the word \u201cproject\u201d connotes a scope that reaches beyond the proposed fill, that is, the development facilitated by the proposed fill.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">That meaning of \u201cproject\u201d is corroborated by two other related statutes. ORS 196.825(ll)(b) defined a \u201ccompleted application\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">\u201ca signed permit application form that contains all necessary information for the director to determine whether to issue a permit, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">\u201c(A) A map showing <em>the project site </em>with sufficient accuracy to easily locate <em>the removal or fill </em>site;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-7\">\u201c(B) A <em>project plan </em>showing <em>the project site </em>and proposed alterations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\"><em>* </em>\u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\">\u201c(E) If <em>the project </em>may cause substantial adverse effects on aquatic life or aquatic habitat within this state, documentation of existing conditions and resources and identification of the potential impact if <em>the project </em>is completed; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-10\">H: * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-11\">\u201c(G) If <em>the project is to fill and remove </em>material from wetlands, a wetlands mitigation plan[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-12\">(Emphases added.) \u201cProject\u201d is used in ORS 196.825(11) to mean an activity beyond the specific fill or removal; that meaning of \u201cproject\u201d likely is the same as the term is used in ORS 196.825(3)(c). <em>See also </em>ORS 196.830(4) (use of \u201cproject\u201d in statutory provision on criteria for waiving estuarine resource replacement as requiring consideration of the \u201ceconomic and public need for the project,\u201d \u201cpublic benefits resulting from the project,\u201d whether the \u201cproject is for a public use,\u201d and whether the \u201cproject is water dependent or * * * publicly owned and water related\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-13\">Thus, ORS 196.825(3)(c) required consideration of \u201calternatives to the project for which the fill is proposed,\u201d with \u201cproject\u201d meaning the development facilitated by the proposed fill. In other respects, however, ORS 196.825 confined the approval criteria for a fill or removal permit to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>characteristics or effects of the proposed fill or removal. DSL was obligated to apply OAR 141-085-0029 consistently with those statutory parameters. This brings us to petitioners\u2019 specific contentions about the director\u2019s failure to apply OAR 141-085-0029(3)(c) and OAR 141-085-0029(3)0).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\">Petitioners argue that DSL improperly failed to consider various public health and safety issues associated with the proposal to move the fish hatchery, including fecal matter, odor, and upland traffic impacts. Petitioners cite OAR 141-085-0029(3)(c) (regarding the public health and safety impacts of \u201cthe project\u201d) in support of their position. Under that regulatory standard, petitioners contend that, given the broad scope of the definition of \u201cproject\u201d in OAR 141-085-0010(169), DSL was required to consider public health and safety issues beyond the areas of actual fill and removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">The problem with petitioners\u2019 argument is that it assumes the validity of OAR 141-085-0029(3)(c). In the final order, however, the director stated that \u201cDSL\u2019s review is limited by statute only to the fill/removal parts of the plan and therefore [petitioners\u2019] issues are reviewed only under the statutory standard.\u201d Further, the director explained that \u201c[a]ny attempt by DSL to expand its scope of review by rule is beyond the scope of review set out in ORS 196.825 and related sections and is not permitted.\u201d We infer, consistent with those statements and the director\u2019s decision not to apply any of the regulatory standards, that the director also implicitly determined that OAR 141-085-0029(3)(c) exceeded DSL\u2019s rulemaking authority. On that score, we agree with the director.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">In reviewing a permit application, OAR 141-085-0029(3)(c) required DSL to consider \u201cwhether <em>the project </em>would interfere with public health and safety.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Given the regulatory definition of \u201cproject\u201d discussed above, that standard required DSL to consider public health and safety impacts beyond those associated with the application\u2019s fill and removal components. By contrast, ORS 196.825(3)(e) required the director to consider only \u201c[w]hether <em>the proposed fill </em>* * * would not interfere with public health and safety.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cFill\u201d was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>defined by ORS 196.800(5) as \u201cthe total of deposits by artificial means equal to or exceeding 50 cubic yards or more of material at one location in any waters of this state.\u201d Thus, ORS 196.825(3)(e) required the director to review the application through a narrow lens, focused only on whether a proposed deposit in state waters of 50 cubic yards or more of material would interfere with public health and safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">We conclude that the regulatory standard exceeded the agency\u2019s authority because it required DSL to review an application more broadly than would otherwise be required by statute. Therefore, because the public health and safety issues identified by petitioners \u2014 the fecal matter, odor, and traffic impacts associated with the proposal to move the fish hatchery \u2014 fall outside the confines of the director\u2019s review under ORS 196.825(3)(e), the director did not err in failing to consider those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Petitioners next argue that DSL improperly failed to consider various erosion and flood issues associated with the proposal to move the fish hatchery, including erosion and flood impacts on adjacent uplands of neighboring properties as a result of the proposed diversion dam. Petitioners cite OAR 141-085-0029(3)(f) (regarding the erosion and flood impacts of \u201cthe project\u201d) in support of their position. Under that regulatory standard, petitioners contend that, given the broad scope of the definition of \u201cproject\u201d in OAR 141-085-0010(169), DSL was required to consider erosion and flood issues beyond those associated with the areas of actual fill and removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Again, the problem with petitioners\u2019 argument here is that it assumes the validity of OAR 141-085-0029(3)(f). We again infer, consistent with the director\u2019s statements in the final order and the director\u2019s decision not to apply any of the regulatory standards in reviewing Coos STEP\u2019S application, that the director implicitly determined that OAR 141-085-0029(3)(f) exceeded DSL\u2019s rulemaking authority. As above, we agree with the director as to that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">In reviewing a permit application, OAR 141-085-0029(3)(f) required DSL to consider \u201cthe degree to which, if at all, <em>the project </em>will increase erosion or flooding upstream and downstream of <em>the project </em>or redirect water from <em>the project </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>site onto adjacent nearby lands.\u201d (Emphases added.) Unlike the regulatory standard regarding public health and safety impacts, which had a comparable statutory analogue, the regulatory standard regarding erosion and flood impacts on nearby lands did not have such a comparable statutory analogue; on that ground alone, the regulation could exceed the statutory rulemaking authority of DSL. On the other hand, consideration of erosion and flood impacts on nearby lands may fall within the penumbra of several of the statutory criteria, including the portion of ORS 196.825(3)(e) that required consideration of \u201c[wjhether <em>the proposed fill </em>conforms to sound policies of conservation\u201d and ORS 196.825(3)(h) that required consideration of \u201c[wjhether <em>the proposed fill </em>is for streambank protection.\u201d (Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Assuming, without deciding, that consideration of erosion and flood impacts of \u201cthe proposed fill\u201d on nearby lands falls within the statutory authority, we nonetheless conclude that consideration of those impacts, as they relate to the broader \u201cproject,\u201d unquestionably exceeds the agency\u2019s statutory authority. Because the erosion and flood issues identified by petitioners- \u2014 -those associated with the diversion dam \u2014 fall outside consideration of impacts associated with the proposed fill, the director did not err in failing to consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Petitioners finally contend that DSL\u2019s analysis of practicable alternatives is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Petitioners note that, pursuant to OAR 141-085-0029(3)(g), (4), and (5), DSL was required to consider practicable alternatives to the project in issuing the permit. According to petitioners, \u201c[tjhe evidence presented by * * * DSL in the proceedings below clearly demonstrates that [Coos STEP] failed to provide substantial evidence in the administrative record to meet its burden as to the applicable approval criteria.\u201d More particularly, petitioners note that Coos STEP\u2019s application materials contained only general statements regarding the analysis of alternatives. Petitioners assert that \u201cDSL\u2019s decision to approve this permit, based solely upon the limited record submitted by Coos STEP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>constitutes a decision that is not adequately supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">DSL responds that petitioners understate the extent of evidence in the record as it pertains to analysis of alternatives under ORS 196.825(3)(c) and OAR 141-085-0029(4). DSL notes that the final order relies on the testimony of three witnesses, as well as information in Coos STEP\u2019S application. Further, DSL contends that other evidence also exists in the record to support the final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">In reply, petitioners observe that only the testimony of one witness, Lobdell, was cited to support the director\u2019s finding that \u201cDSL considered all alternatives, including different sites for the hatchery.\u201d Petitioners, citing <em>Hodgin v. PSRB, </em>127 Or App 587, 591, 873 P2d 466, <em>rev den, </em>320 Or 272 (1994), contend that all the other evidence referred to by DSL was not the basis for the director\u2019s determination on the issue of alternatives and, therefore, should not be considered as the basis for upholding the agency\u2019s decision on judicial review. In addition, petitioners contend that DSL cannot rely on evidence that other parties considered alternatives to support its finding that DSL considered alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">When we review a finding of fact for substantial evidence, we determine whether \u201cthe record, viewed as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make that finding.\u201d ORS 183.482(8)(c). An initial problem with petitioners\u2019 substantial evidence contention is that petitioners, in their opening brief, fail to specifically identify the finding(s) of fact in the order that they contend lack substantial evidence. Indeed, in their reply brief, petitioners point to only one finding of fact as lacking substantial evidence \u2014 the finding that \u201cDSL considered alternatives, including different sites for the hatchery.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>We review that finding under the applicable standard of ORS 183.482(8)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Petitioners\u2019 reliance on <em>Hodgin </em>to restrict the scope of our review to only that evidence referenced by the director in making the challenged finding is misplaced. <em>Hodgin </em>belongs to a line of cases that requires an agency to articulate the \u201csubstantial reason\u201d for its action. In <em>Hodgin </em>we explained, \u201cIn reviewing a PSRB order, it is not enough that the record contain substantial evidence to support the PSRB\u2019s findings. \u2018The question is whether the evidence on which PSRB expressly relied supports what the agency did.\u2019 \u201d 127 Or App at 591 (quoting <em>Martin v. PSRB, </em>312 Or 157, 167, 818 P2d 1264 (1991)). That explanation in <em>Hodgin </em>has been echoed in other cases that discuss our review for substantial reason. <em>See, e.g., Goin v. Employment Dept., </em>203 Or App 758, 763, 126 P3d 734 (2006) (\u201cOur substantial reason review requires a determination of whether [the agency\u2019s] findings of fact logically lead to its conclusions of law.\u201d). As such, <em>Hodgin </em>concerns the extent or adequacy of factual findings as a whole. It does not stand for the principle that petitioners suggest \u2014 that our review of a finding for substantial evidence is limited to reviewing only that evidence cited by the director in support of the challenged finding of fact.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Accordingly, our review of the record reveals the following evidence in support of the director\u2019s finding. Coos STEP, in its revised application, stated that it had researched alternative locations for the facility for over two decades; that the new facility, as compared to the old facility, would significantly reduce impacts to the Morgan Creek; and that any other areas surveyed in the basin would have significantly more impacts to the watershed than the selected site on Morgan Creek. At the contested case hearing below, Lobdell, a natural resource coordinator with DSL, testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>that, although no specific alternative locations were described in Coos STEP\u2019S application, during the period for public comment, Coos STEP responded to concerns raised by petitioners and others about alternatives to the project site. Lobdell further testified that Coos STEP had looked at several sites on Daniels Creek, including sites suggested by petitioners, and had rejected those alternatives for various reasons, including that there was already an existing facility there and the Daniels Creek area had a greater amount of wetlands in the immediate project vicinity. The record also contains evidence of the specific written response provided by Coos STEP, which stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-4\">\u201cAlternative locations, including those proposed by [petitioners], were considered. Daniels Creek already had a STEP fish facility with its own fish production level, operated by another STEP group. Another piece of property suggested by [petitioners] has significant wetland characteristics for much of the year, not just during high water/ flooding events. This property would be suitable for a wetland/wildlife habitat restoration project, but not a site suitable for an out-of-stream fish rearing facility as proposed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">In light of the above-stated evidence, we conclude that the director\u2019s finding that \u201cDSL considered all alternatives, including different sites for the hatchery\u201d is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">IV. CONCLUSIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">In sum, DSL did not err in confining the scope of its rules to the requirements for issuing a fill or removal permit under ORS 196.825. Given that limitation, the director did not err in failing to apply OAR 141-085-0029(3)(c) and OAR 141-085-0029(3)(f) to the fish hatchery operations, as opposed to the particular fill or removal activities. Further, petitioners\u2019 substantial evidence challenge is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-7\"> ORS chapter 196 was amended by the legislature in 2007, and those amendments became effective on July 1, 2007. <em>See </em>Or Laws 2007, ch 849, \u00a7\u00a7 19, 21. Because DSL received Coos STEP\u2019s revised application before the effective date of the 2007 amendments, they did not apply to DSL\u2019s determination of whether to issue the permit to Coos STEP. <em>See </em>ORS 196.825(10) (\u201cIn determining whether to issue a permit, the director [of DSL] may consider only standards and criteria in effect on the date the director receives the completed application.\u201d).

Further, to whatever extent petitioners attempt to recast their fourth assignment of error in their reply brief as including such an argument, that argument is raised too late. <em>See Johnson v.
