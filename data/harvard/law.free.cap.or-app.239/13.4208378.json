He asserts that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the sentencing departure factor that defendant had been persistently involved in similar criminal conduct. We conclude that, even though 14 years separated defendant\u2019s current offense from his most recent previous similar crime, a reasonable juror could have found that defendant had been persistently involved in similar offenses. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Defendant\u2019s current crime of conviction arose from a car break-in that he committed in 2008. At the sentencing hearing, the state sought a departure sentence based on defendant\u2019s alleged persistent involvement in similar offenses. <em>See </em>OAR 213-008-0002(l)(b)(B) (departure sentence may be imposed based on finding of defendant\u2019s persistent involvement in similar offenses). The state adduced evidence that, in 1989, defendant was convicted three times of first-degree theft and two times of second-degree theft; in 1990, defendant was convicted of first-degree aggravated theft; and in 1994, defendant was convicted of attempted first-degree burglary. Defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the allegation of persistent involvement, arguing that no reasonable trier of fact could find that his involvement in theft-related criminal conduct had been continuous and, thus, persistent. The trial court denied the motion, and defendant appeals from the ensuing judgment imposing a departure sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">In order to warrant a departure sentence, the state must prove the factual elements of an enhancement factor beyond a reasonable doubt. ORS 136.785(2). The Supreme Court has held that, in determining whether a defendant has been \u201cpersistently] involve[d] in similar offenses,\u201d the trier of fact \u201cmust do more than find that a defendant has two or more prior convictions for similar offenses.\u201d <em>State v. Bray, </em>342 Or 711, 724, 160 P3d 983 (2007). Rather, the trier of fact \u201cmust infer from the number and frequency of those prior [offenses] whether the defendant\u2019s involvement in those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>offenses is \u00a3persistent[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>In determining what \u201cpersistent\u201d entails, the court drew from the ordinary understanding of that term, <em>i.e., </em>recurring or continuing. <em>Id. </em>Given the particular record in <em>Bray, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that more than one inference could have been drawn from the defendant\u2019s criminal history as to whether his criminal conduct was recurring or continuing because, although the defendant had 10 offenses in his criminal history that were similar to his current crime of conviction, all had arisen out of a single prior criminal incident involving two victims. As a result, the court determined that the failure to submit the issue of \u201cpersistent involvement\u201d to a jury \u2014 which was a preserved claim of error in <em>Bray </em>\u2014 was not harmless. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">In light of <em>Bray, </em>the factfinder is to determine, from the \u201cnumber and frequency\u201d of the defendant\u2019s prior similar offenses whether the defendant\u2019s involvement in those offenses was so \u201ccontinuous or recurring\u201d as to be \u201cpersistent.\u201d <em>State v. Schenewerk, </em>217 Or App 243, 246-47, 174 P3d 1117 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 671 (2008). In <em>State v. Shellabarger, </em>225 Or App 527, 202 P3d 897 (2009), the defendant had two prior convictions for offenses similar to the current crime of conviction. The two convictions involved crimes that were committed five and 15 years before the current crime. We held that, under those circumstances, a jury could consider whether the defendant\u2019s involvement in similar criminal conduct had the \u201cfrequency * * * required for a finding of persistent involvement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 531. Similarly, in <em>State v. Steinhoff, </em>225 Or App 522, 201 P3d 901, <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 184 (2009), we held that a nine-year interval between the defendant\u2019s most recent similar prior offense and the current crime of conviction was not so lengthy as to preclude a \u201clegitimate debate,\u201d for purposes of discretionary plain error review, as to whether a jury would find persistent involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The foregoing cases show that the issue whether prior similar offenses were sufficiently frequent or recurring to establish the requisite persistency is, at least ordinarily, an issue for the trier of fact. In that regard, it is particularly significant that, under its ordinary meaning, persistency may partake of either continuity <em>or </em>recurrence. <em>Bray, </em>342 Or at 724; <em>see also Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1686 (unabridged ed 2002) (defining \u201cpersistent\u201d as \u201cexisting for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>long or longer than usual time or continuously : enduring, lingering\u201d). Thus, although a 14-year interval might preclude a finding of <em>continuous </em>similar criminal conduct, the commission of seven similar offenses within the previous five years, followed by the same 14-year interval, might permit a reasonable trier of fact to find that the overall course of criminal conduct was <em>recurrent. </em>Stated differently, because of the myriad possible permutations, there is no bright-line rule establishing a minimum of similar offenses in number and frequency, necessary to create a triable issue of persistency.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">The state takes that point to its limit, arguing that under <em>Bray, </em>as long as the defendant has committed more than one similar prior offense,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> regardless of the temporal remoteness of those offenses, the issue of persistency must always be decided by the trier of fact. We need not decide in this case whether that proposition is correct. Defendant had seven prior theft-related convictions over the 19 years preceding his current offense. Even though the most recent of those was committed 14 years before the current offense, we conclude that, given the number and frequency of defendant\u2019s similar prior offenses, a reasonable trier of fact could find that, by virtue of recurrence, defendant had been persistently involved in similar offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b37-6\"> We have held that the factor cannot be applied if there is only one similar prior conviction. <em>State v. Rodriquez, </em>113 Or App 696, 833 P2d 1343 (1992); <em>State v. Clark, </em>113 Or App 692, 833 P2d 1341 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
