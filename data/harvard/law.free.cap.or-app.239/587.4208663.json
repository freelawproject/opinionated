J.</author>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Defendant appeals a conviction for driving while under the influence of intoxicants (DUII). ORS 813.010. On appeal, he assigns error to the denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal and to the trial court\u2019s refusal to give a \u201cless satisfactory evidence\u201d jury instruction. We affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling with regard to the \u201cless satisfactory evidence\u201d jury instruction without further discussion. As to the claim of error regarding the denial of defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, we affirm for the reasons discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Defendant was charged with unlawfully driving a vehicle on premises open to the public while under the influence of a combination of alcohol and controlled substances. At trial, the state presented the following evidence. When a police officer contacted defendant with regard to a traffic violation at approximately 12:28 a.m., the officer observed that defendant had a slight odor of alcohol on his breath. The officer asked defendant if he had had anything to drink, and defendant responded that \u201che had a beer an hour.\u201d According to the officer, defendant appeared to be in a \u201cdazed\u201d state. Based on her observations, the officer asked defendant to perform a series of sobriety tests. After defendant attempted to perform the tests, the officer concluded that there were six discrete indicators that defendant was impaired. The officer testified that \u201ctwo or more indicators indicate more likely than not the person is impaired to drive.\u201d The officer told defendant that based on the indicators she had observed, she believed that he had more to drink than a beer an hour. Defendant admitted consuming \u201cseveral shots of Jack Daniels in addition to the beer an hour.\u201d The officer placed defendant under arrest for DUII. While searching him before placing him in her patrol car, the officer discovered a marijuana pipe on defendant\u2019s person. Defendant admitted that the pipe belonged to him and that he \u201chad smoked some marijuana earlier in the evening around 8:00 that night.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">At the end of the state\u2019s case-in-chief, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that there was no evidence that defendant was under the influence of a combination of alcohol and a controlled substance. Defendant\u2019s counsel explained to the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>\u201cSo what we\u2019re left with is really a proof issue of whether the State has presented evidence sufficient for this case to go to a jury that the defendant was not just under the influence of alcohol, but was under the influence of the combination of alcohol and marijuana. And simply without any drug recognition expert [evidence] and without any evidence to the contrary, there simply is not enough evidence for this case to even suffice to get past the motion for judgment of acquittal, and for that reason[,] we\u2019d be requesting the Court grant that motion at this time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">At the close of all of the evidence in the trial, defendant\u2019s counsel reiterated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">\u201cThere simply has been no evidence presented that [defendant] was under the influence of a combination of alcohol and marijuana. The only evidence was that through [the arresting officer] that he had ingested marijuana, no quantification, no DRE, no testing for someone being under the influence of marijuana. Quite frankly, I\u2019ve never seen a case prosecuted without a DRE on a controlled substances case * * * \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The trial court denied both motions for a judgment of acquittal, and defendant was convicted as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">On appeal, defendant again argues that there was no evidence produced by the state that defendant was under the influence of the combination of marijuana and alcohol. He argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-9\">\u201cNo rational trier of fact could determine defendant\u2019s guilt beyond \u2018reasonable doubt\u2019 because the state presented no evidence of how marijuana effects a human body, no evidence of whether marijuana combines with alcohol to effect the body, no DRE, and no toxicology report to quantify how much marijuana was in defendant\u2019s body at the time that he was driving.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">He asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-11\">\u201cEven if this court concludes that there was \u2018some\u2019 evidence based on defendant\u2019s admission to ingesting alcohol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>and \u2018some marijuana\u2019 over four hours earlier, still, that evidence is \u2018insufficient \u2018 to prove <em>beyond a reasonable doubt, </em>that at the time defendant was driving[,] his physical and mental faculties were adversely effected to a noticeable and perceptible degree by the combination of alcohol and marijuana.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">(Emphasis in original.) The state counters that \u201c[t]he evidence of [defendant\u2019s] impairment, coupled with defendant\u2019s admission to consuming both alcohol and a controlled substance, was sufficient to put the case before the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">At oral argument, the state argued that the outcome of this case is controlled by our reasoning in <em>State v. Huck, </em>100 Or App 193, 785 P2d 785 (1990). Defendant contended, on the other hand, that <em>Huck </em>is distinguishable. We agree with defendant\u2019s argument regarding <em>Huck. </em>In <em>Huck, </em>the defendant admitted that he had consumed both alcohol and Vicodin, a controlled substance. <em>Id. </em>at 196. There was also evidence that the defendant\u2019s mental and physical abilities were noticeably impaired. <em>Id. </em>After being convicted in the trial court for driving under the combined influence of a controlled substance and intoxicating liquor, the defendant appealed, arguing that the court had erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal. <em>Id. </em>at 195. He asserted that, because the state did not present evidence at trial that Vicodin acted as an intoxicant on the human body, the state\u2019s evidence was insufficient to prove its allegations and that it was legally impermissible for the jury to convict merely because Vicodin was classified as a controlled substance. <em>Id. </em>We reasoned that the statute under which the defendant was convicted did not require the state to present evidence that a controlled substance is capable of impairing a person\u2019s mental and physical abilities. <em>Id. </em>at 196. Rather, whether the controlled substance by itself or in combination with intoxicating liquor did in fact impair the ability of the defendant to operate a motor vehicle was a question for the jury. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we held that the evidence of the defendant\u2019s admissions and of the noticeable impairment of his physical and mental abilities permitted the jury to infer that he was under the influence of both substances, and, therefore, the trial court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion. <em>Id. </em>at 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>In light of <em>Huck, </em>the state argues that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-4\">\u201c[it] was not required to present evidence that the marijuana that defendant admitted to smoking was capable of causing impairment. * * * Nor was it required to establish that the marijuana, or the alcohol, or some combination thereof, was <em>responsible for causing defendant\u2019s impairment.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">(Emphasis added.) We disagree with the state\u2019s interpretation of <em>Huck </em>if the gist of the state\u2019s argument is that it was not required to prove that defendant\u2019s impairment was caused, in part, by the ingestion of marijuana. The argument made in <em>Huck </em>was that the state was required as a matter of law to present evidence that Vicodin acted as an intoxicant on the human body. In that context, we held that the governing statute did not require the state to prove that a controlled substance is capable of impairing a person\u2019s mental and physical abilities as part of its burden of proof. Rather, the questions for the jury to decide in <em>Huck </em>were whether the defendant ingested a controlled substance and whether his physical and mental abilities were impaired as a result at the time in question. In other words, our holding in <em>Huck </em>did not abrogate the requirement that the state prove that defendant\u2019s consumption of marijuana and alcoholic beverages resulted in his impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">We turn now to the issue of the legal sufficiency of the evidence offered by the state to prove that defendant was under the influence of a combination of alcohol and controlled substance at the time that he was operating a motor vehicle. The underlying premise of defendant\u2019s argument is that the law requires additional evidence of causation beyond the evidence of his admissions and impairment in order to convict him of DUII. We disagree with defendant\u2019s assertion. Rather, in <em>State v. King, </em>307 Or 332, 339, 768 P2d 391 (1989), the court set out the governing standard of review to be applied to such an issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">\u201cIn ruling on the sufficiency of the evidence in a criminal case, the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Harris, </em>288 Or 703, 721, 609 P2d 798 (1980). It is not proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>for us to hold that there is a reasonable doubt because of conflicts in the evidence. After a verdict of guilty, such conflicts must be treated as if they had been decided in the state\u2019s favor. After the conflicts have been so decided, we take such decided facts together with those facts about which there is no conflict and determine whether the inferences that may be drawn from them are sufficient to allow the jury to find defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Our decision is not whether we believe defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether the evidence is sufficient for a jury so to find. <em>State v. Krummacher, </em>269 Or 125, 137-38, 523 P2d 1009 (1974).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">Defendant\u2019s admissions regarding consumption of alcoholic beverages together with his \u201cdazed\u201d state and his lack of performance of sobriety tests are all facts from which the jury could reasonably infer beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was under the influence of alcohol at the time that he drove a vehicle in a public place. Similarly, the evidence that the odor of alcoholic beverages on defendant\u2019s breath was \u201cslight\u201d and of his claim that consumption of alcoholic beverages occurred over an extended period of time could permit a reasonable factfinder to infer that something in addition to the alcoholic beverages that he admitted drinking contributed to the extent of his impairment as observed by the officer. Those inferences particularly exist in light of defendant\u2019s admission that he had ingested an unknown quantity of marijuana within four and one-half hours of being contacted by the officer and of the evidence of his \u201cdazed\u201d mental state. As this court held in <em>Huck, </em>whether, in fact, alcohol and marijuana combined to impair defendant\u2019s abilities to the extent that he was under their influence is an issue for the jury once the facts in evidence permit the necessary inferences, which they do here.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-12\"> Counsel\u2019s reference to a \u201cDRE\u201d expert refers to expert testimony by a person trained to identify behavioral and physical characteristics in the human body caused by the consumption of controlled substances.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
