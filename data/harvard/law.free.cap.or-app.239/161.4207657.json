The State Board of Higher Education (board)\u2014 acting through the Chancellor of the Oregon University System \u2014 issued an order denying petitioner resident status. Petitioner sought judicial review of the chancellor\u2019s order in circuit court. The circuit court reversed the chancellor\u2019s order and remanded the matter to the board. Petitioner subsequently sought attorney fees, which the circuit court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">In this court, the board appeals the circuit court\u2019s reversal of the chancellor\u2019s order denying petitioner resident status, and petitioner cross-appeals the circuit court\u2019s denial of attorney fees. We review the circuit court\u2019s review of the chancellor\u2019s order to determine whether the circuit court properly applied the relevant standards of review. <em>Polaski v. Clark, </em>158 Or App 166, 168, 973 P2d 381 (1999). The circuit court\u2019s task was to review the chancellor\u2019s order for substantial evidence and errors of law. ORS 183.484(5); <em>Polaski, </em>158 Or App at 171. We conclude that the circuit court erred by unnecessarily considering petitioner\u2019s constitutional challenge to the board\u2019s residency rules when there was a subconstitutional basis for affirming the chancellor\u2019s order. That conclusion renders petitioner\u2019s cross-appeal of the denial of attorney fees moot. Accordingly, we reverse and remand on the appeal and dismiss the cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The relevant facts are undisputed. Petitioner was born and raised in Oklahoma. After graduating from high school, she attended Oklahoma Christian University (OCU). Petitioner had to leave OCU twice due to systemic lupus erythematosus, a chronic progressive illness that causes rashes, ulcers, pleurisy, arthritis, and fatigue. Petitioner\u2019s lupus-related symptoms are reduced by living in a climate with cloudy days, northern latitude, and temperatures moderated by proximity to the ocean.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">In late August 2005, petitioner moved to Portland, rented an apartment, and enrolled at Cascade College, a branch campus of OCU. She also bought a car and registered it with the Oregon Driver and Motor Vehicles Services Division (DMV). Petitioner was 22 years old and financially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>independent. Due to her lupus, petitioner received Social Security disability payments. She used an Oklahoma credit union for her checking and savings accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Petitioner attended Cascade College for the school year, from August 29,2005 through April 28,2006. She was a full-time student; she took more than 12 hours of classes each semester. While in school, petitioner obtained an Oregon driver\u2019s license and registered to vote in Oregon. After the school year ended, petitioner put her belongings in storage and returned to Oklahoma for the summer to obtain medical treatment and visit family.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">In August 2006, petitioner returned to Portland for her second year as a full-time student at Cascade College. She attended school from August 28, 2006 through April 27, 2007, and again took more than 12 hours of classes each semester. After the school year ended, petitioner left her belongings in a shared apartment and again returned to Oklahoma for the summer to obtain medical treatment and visit family. She was in Oklahoma from May 1, 2007 through August 31, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">In the fall of 2007, petitioner returned to Portland and enrolled at Portland State University. She claimed Oregon residency and sought in-state tuition. The Inter-institutional Residency Committee (IRC) denied her request for resident status on the ground that, under the relevant administrative rules, petitioner was not a resident for tuition purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Petitioner appealed the IRC\u2019s decision to the board. Acting for the board, the chancellor issued an order denying petitioner resident status. In the order, the chancellor stated that, because petitioner had been a full-time student, she was presumed to be in Oregon for educational purposes and, therefore, was a nonresident. The chancellor further stated that petitioner had not rebutted that presumption because she had not \u201cgiven up her residence in Oklahoma.\u201d Specifically, the chancellor reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">\u201cA financially independent student must fulfill two requirements in order to establish Oregon residency for purposes of tuition. Prior to the term for which residency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>status is sought, the person must have \u2018established and maintained a domicile in Oregon of not less than 12 consecutive months\u2019 and must have been \u2018primarily engaged in activities other than those of being a college student\u2019 during that time. OAR 580-010-0030(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-4\">\u201cWhen a financially independent student has been enrolled for more than eight hours per semester or quarter, the student is presumed to be in Oregon primarily for educational purposes. OAR 580-010-0030(3). In addition, the student may not use the time period of enrollment above eight hours per term as counting toward the twelve consecutive month requirement for establishing domicile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">\u201cSince moving to Oregon, [petitioner] has been a full-time student at Cascade College and Portland State University. This fact creates a presumption that [petitioner] moved to Oregon primarily for education purposes. Her presence in Oregon as a full-time student may not be counted toward the requirement that she establish a domicile for twelve consecutive months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">\u201cAlthough [petitioner\u2019s] systemic lupus is alleviated in Oregon, she continues to receive medical care in Oklahoma. She continues to bank in Oklahoma. She also spent extensive time during 2007 in Oklahoma, indicating that she has not given up her residence in Oklahoma. The fact that [petitioner] has registered her car in Oregon and votes in Oregon are insufficient to overcome the presumption that [petitioner] moved to Oregon for primarily educational purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Petitioner sought judicial review of the chancellor\u2019s order pursuant to ORS 183.484. She moved for summary judgment, arguing that the chancellor\u2019s order was not supported by substantial evidence and that the residency rules\u2014 in particular, OAR 580-010-0030(2) and (3) \u2014 were unconstitutional as applied to her because they created an irrebuttable presumption against resident status for students who attend an Oregon college or university within 12 months of moving to the state. In support of her constitutional argument, petitioner cited <em>Vlandis v. Kline, </em>412 US 441, 93 S Ct 2230, 37 L Ed 2d 63 (1973), in which the United States Supreme Court held that a state cannot create an irrebuttable presumption that students who move to the state shortly before enrolling in school are nonresidents; it must afford <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>them an opportunity to establish that they are residents and not just in the state for educational purposes. A state may not \u201carbitrarily invoke a permanent and irrebuttable presumption of nonresidence against students who [seek] to obtain in-state tuition rates when that presumption [is] not necessarily or universally true in fact.\u201d <em>Sosna v. Iowa, </em>419 US 393, 409, 95 S Ct 553, 42 L Ed 2d 532 (1975) (describing the <em>Vlandis </em>holding).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">The board responded with a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing that the chancellor\u2019s order was supported by substantial evidence and that the residency rules contained valid criteria for determining a student\u2019s residency status. In response to petitioner\u2019s constitutional argument, the board argued that the presumption created by its residency rules was constitutional because it was rebuttable. According to the board, although a full-time student is presumed to be in Oregon primarily for educational purposes and, therefore, a nonresident, a student can rebut that presumption by proving, through objectively verifiable facts, that he or she is in the state primarily for reasons other than obtaining an education.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The circuit court sent the parties a letter, asking them to respond to what it believed was \u201cthe primary issue for consideration: Does OAR 580-010-0030(2)(b) create an irrebuttable presumption that violates the Due Process Clause?\u201d (Boldface omitted.) The court set out the relevant rules and explained that it appeared that the rules create an irrebuttable presumption of nonresidency:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">\u201cOAR 580-010-0030(2) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">\u201c \u2018An Oregon resident is a financially independent person who, prior to the term for which Oregon resident classification is requested, has both: (a) established and maintained a domicile in Oregon as provided under OAR 580-010-0029(1) 12 consecutive months; and (b) during that period has been primarily engaged in <em>activities </em>other than those of being a college student.\u2019 (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">\u201cOAR 580-010-0030(3) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-9\">\u201c A student may be considered primarily engaged in educational activities regardless of the number of hours <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>for which the student is enrolled. However, a student who is enrolled for more than 8 hours in any semester or quarter during the 12-month period referred to in section (2) of this rule shall be presumed in Oregon for primarily educational <em>purposes. </em>Such period of enrollment shall not be counted toward the establishment of a bona fide domicile of 12 consecutive months in the state unless the student proves, in fact, establishment of a bona fide domicile in this state primarily for <em>purposes </em>other than educational.\u2019 (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-4\">\u201cThus, pursuant to the second sentence of subsection (3), it is presumed that a student who is enrolled for more than 8 hours during the 12-month period prior to application for resident status is in Oregon for primarily educational <em>purposes, </em>such that that 12-month period cannot be counted in calculating the 12-consecutive-months requirement of subsection (2)(a). But the third sentence of subsection (3) allows that presumption to be rebutted if \u2018the student proves, in fact, establishment of a bona fide domicile in the state primarily for <em>purposes </em>other than educational,\u2019 in which case the period of enrollment could be counted in calculating the 12-consecutive-months requirement of subsection (2)(a). Both the presumption established in subsection (3) and recognition of the student\u2019s ability to rebut that presumption, also found in subsection (3), are applicable to determining what the applicant\u2019s primary <em>purpose </em>was during [the] 12-consecutive-months period set out in subsection (2)(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">\u201cThat appears to leave the requirement of subsection (2)(b) without any qualification. Subsection (2)(b) requires, as a mandatory condition of Oregon residency, that during the 12-consecutive-months period, the applicant \u2018has been primarily engaged in <em>activities </em>other than those of being a college student.\u2019 Therefore, an applicant whose <em>activities </em>have been primarily as a student during the year preceding application is automatically disqualified for residency status, even if the student can rebut the subsection (3) presumption that his <em>purpose </em>for being in Oregon [is] not primarily educational. While subsection (3) both creates a presumption, and the ability to overcome that presumption, both of those pertain only to subsection (2)(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">\u201cThe above said, does not subsection (2)(b) then automatically and irrefutably disqualify an applicant whose activities have been primarily educational in the 12-consecutive-months period from obtaining a resident status? And, if so, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>does that not violate the Due Process Clause? <em>Vlandis v. </em>Kline, 412 US 441 (1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\u201cIf subsection (2)(b) is unconstitutional, does that end the analysis?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">\u201cAssuming that the court were to find subsection (2)(b) unconstitutional, what are the ramifications with regard to petitioner\u2019s application for residency status? Is the court to consider other regulatory provisions that might disqualify petitioner from residency status, or would the unconstitutionality of one provision become, in itself, determinative?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">(Emphasis in original; boldface in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">After receiving the parties\u2019 responses to its letter, the circuit court issued an order stating, \u201cFor the reasons set out [in the letter], the court finds that OAR 580-010-0030(2)(b) creates an irrebuttable presumption that violates the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution.\u201d In other words, the circuit court found the second residency requirement \u2014 that, during the 12-month period for establishing a domicile, a person \u201chas been primarily engaged in activities other than those of being a college student\u201d \u2014 was unconstitutional. It remanded the matter to the board \u201cto reconsider petitioner\u2019s application for resident status, which consideration shall not include the requirement established by OAR 580-010-0030(2)(b).\u201d Petitioner subsequently filed a petition for attorney fees, which the circuit court denied. This appeal and cross-appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">As mentioned, we review the circuit court\u2019s judgment to determine whether the circuit court properly reviewed the chancellor\u2019s order for substantial evidence and errors of law. ORS lSS.\u00e9S\u00e9lS);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Polaski, </em>158 Or App at 171. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>On appeal, the board makes two arguments. First, it argues that the circuit court\u2019s constitutional analysis was unnecessary. It argues that, because the chancellor found that petitioner \u201c[had] not given up her residence in Oklahoma\u201d and that finding is supported by substantial evidence, the chancellor properly concluded that petitioner had not established a domicile in Oregon and, therefore, failed to satisfy the first residency requirement. From there, the board argues that, because petitioner failed to satisfy the first residency requirement, it was unnecessary for the circuit court to determine whether the second residency requirement was constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">The board\u2019s second argument is that the circuit court\u2019s constitutional analysis was incorrect. According to the board, its residency rules do not create an unconstitutional irrebuttable presumption of nonresidency.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">We begin our analysis by setting out the residency rules at issue. OAR 580-010-0030 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">\u201c(1) For purposes of admission and instruction fee assessment, OUS [Oregon University System] institutions shall classify a student as Oregon resident or nonresident. In determining resident or nonresident classification, the primary issue is a person\u2019s intent in coming to Oregon. Intent is inferred from a person\u2019s conduct and history as they relate to the requirements of these residency rules. If a person is in Oregon primarily for the purpose of obtaining an education, that person will be considered a nonresident. It is possible for an individual to qualify as a resident of Oregon for purposes of voting or obtaining an Oregon driver\u2019s license and not meet the residency requirements established by these rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">\u201c(2) An Oregon resident is a financially independent person who, prior to the term for which Oregon resident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>classification is requested, has both: (a) established and maintained a domicile in Oregon as provided under OAR, 580-010-0029(1) 12 consecutive months; and (b) during that period, has been primarily engaged in activities other than those of being a college student.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-4\">\u201c(3) A student may be considered primarily engaged in educational activities regardless of the number of hours for which the student is enrolled. However, a student who is enrolled for more than 8 hours in any semester or quarter during the 12-month period referred to in section (2) of this rule shall be presumed to be in Oregon for primarily educational purposes. Such period of enrollment shall not be counted toward the establishment of a bona fide domicile of 12 consecutive months in this state unless the student proves, in fact, establishment of a bona fide domicile in this state primarily for purposes other than educational.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">OAR 580-010-0029(1) defines \u201cdomicile\u201d for the purposes of the residency rules. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">\u201c \u2018Domicile\u2019 is a person\u2019s true, fixed, and permanent home and place of habitation. It is the place where a person intends to remain and to which the person expects to return when the person leaves without intending to establish a new domicile elsewhere. In order to establish a domicile in Oregon, a person must maintain a predominant physical presence in Oregon for 12 consecutive months after moving to the state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">OAR 580-010-0031(1) identifies factors that have probative value in support of a claim for Oregon residency:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-8\">\u201cThe following factors, although not necessarily conclusive or exclusive, have probative value in support of a claim for Oregon resident classification:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-9\">\u201c(a) Reside in Oregon for 12 consecutive months prior to the beginning of the term for which resident classification is sought and during that period be primarily engaged in activities other than those of a college student;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-10\">\u201c(b) Reliance upon Oregon resources for financial support;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-11\">\u201c(c) Domicile in Oregon of persons legally responsible for the student;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>\u201c(d) Acceptance of an offer of permanent employment in Oregon; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-4\">\u201c(e) Ownership by the person of his or her living quarters in Oregon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The following subsection, OAR 580-010-0031(2), identifies factors that, \u201cstanding alone, do not constitute sufficient evidence to effect classification as an Oregon resident,\u201d including \u201c[v]oting or registration to vote,\u201d \u201c[t]he lease of living quarters,\u201d \u201c[a]utomobile registration,\u201d and obtaining an \u201cOregon driver\u2019s license.\u201d OAR 580-010-003l(2)(a), (c), (e), (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\"> Thus, in determining resident or nonresident status, the primary issue is the student\u2019s intent in coming to Oregon. OAR 580-010-0030(1). If the person is in Oregon primarily for the purpose of obtaining an education, the person will be considered a nonresident. <em>Id. </em>OAR 580-010-0030(2) establishes two residency requirements for a financially independent person; the person must have \u201cestablished and maintained a domicile in Oregon as provided under OAR 580-010-0029(1) 12 consecutive months\u201d and, \u201cduring that period, [have] been primarily engaged in activities other than those of being a college student.\u201d To establish a domicile, a person must intend Oregon to be the person\u2019s \u201ctrue, fixed, and permanent home\u201d and \u201cmust maintain a predominant physical presence in Oregon for 12 consecutive months after moving to the state.\u201d OAR 580-010-0029(1). A person may live in Oregon, without being domiciled in the state, and may be a resident for some purposes, including voter registration and obtaining a driver\u2019s license, but not for tuition purposes. OAR 580-010-0030(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">As mentioned, the board\u2019s first argument on appeal is that the circuit court\u2019s constitutional analysis was unnecessary. The board argues that the chancellor\u2019s finding that petitioner \u201c[had] not given up her residence in Oklahoma\u201d was supported by substantial evidence and compelled the legal conclusion that petitioner had not established a domicile in Oregon, which, in turn, compelled the legal conclusion that petitioner was not an Oregon resident for tuition purposes. According to the board, the circuit court should have affirmed the chancellor\u2019s order on that ground. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>A reviewing court should not address constitutional challenges to a rule if \u201c \u2018there is also present some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ainsworth v. SAIF, </em>202 Or App 708, 711-12, 124 P3d 616 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 216 (2006) (quoting <em>Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, </em>297 US 288, 346, 56 S Ct 466, 80 L Ed 688 (1936) (Brand\u00e9is, J., concurring)). Thus, the circuit court should not have considered petitioner\u2019s constitutional challenge to the residency rules if there was another basis for affirming or reversing the chancellor\u2019s order. Here, there was. As discussed, petitioner had to satisfy two residency requirements; she had to establish and maintain a domicile in Oregon for 12 months, and, during that time she had to have been primarily engaged in activities other than those of being a college student. OAR 580-010-0030(2). The chancellor determined that petitioner failed to satisfy the first requirement; she had not established a domicile in Oregon. That determination, if supported by substantial evidence and based on correct interpretation of the law, was a sufficient basis for denying petitioner resident status. Therefore, the circuit court should have reviewed that determination before considering whether the second requirement was unconstitutional as applied to petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Rather than remand this case to the circuit court to review the chancellor\u2019s determination that petitioner failed to satisfy the first requirement, we review the determination ourselves, in the interest of judicial economy, because the review involves only questions of law: whether the chancellor\u2019s determination was supported by substantial evidence and whether it was based on a correct interpretation of the law. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">First, we conclude that the chancellor\u2019s determination that petitioner had not established a domicile in Oregon was based on factual findings supported by substantial evidence. \u201cSubstantial evidence exists to support a finding of fact when the record, viewed as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make that finding.\u201d ORS 183.484(5)(c). Here, the chancellor found that petitioner \u201c[had] not given up her residence in Oklahoma.\u201d That finding was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>The undisputed evidence was that petitioner lived in Oregon for two school years, but as soon as the school years ended she returned to Oklahoma where she stayed for the entire summer. While in Oklahoma, she visited family and obtained medical care. Notably, petitioner did not transfer her medical care to Oregon. Nor did she transfer her bank accounts. From that evidence, a reasonable person could find that petitioner\u2019s actions were consistent with that of a person who was in Oregon primarily for educational purposes. In other words, from that evidence, a reasonable person could find that petitioner did not intend to make Oregon her \u201ctrue, fixed, and permanent home.\u201d OAR 580-010-0029(1). <em>See Portello v. Oregon State System of Higher Education, </em>122 Or App 314, 858 P2d 145, <em>rev den, </em>318 Or 170 (1993) (holding that the circuit court erred in reversing an order denying student resident status where student attended law school in Oregon for one school year \u2014 during which time he registered to vote in Oregon, obtained an Oregon driver\u2019s license, registered his vehicle in Oregon, and maintained checking and saving accounts in Oregon banks \u2014 but spent the following summer in another state).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Petitioner asserts that she moved to Oregon for health reasons and that she intends to remain in Oregon permanently. There is evidence in the record to support petitioner\u2019s assertions. But, on judicial review, a reviewing court is not to reweigh the evidence and make its own factual findings. <em>Tigard Sand and Gravel, Inc. v. Clackamas County, </em>151 Or App 16, 20, 949 P2d 1225 (1997), <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 83 (1998). It is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to which of two or more permissible inferences should be drawn. <em>City of Roseburg v. Roseburg City Firefighters, </em>292 Or 266, 271, 639 P2d 90 (1981). Instead, the question before the reviewing court \u201cis limited to whether the evidence would permit a reasonable person to make the determination that the agency made in a particular case,\u201d <em>Norden v. Water Resources Dept., </em>329 Or 641, 649, 996 P2d 958 (2000), and, as described, in this case there was evidence from which a reasonable person could find, as the chancellor did, that petitioner \u201c[had] not given up her residence in Oklahoma.\u201d Therefore, the circuit court should have concluded that the chancellor\u2019s finding was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Second, the chancellor was correct in concluding, that, if petitioner had not given up her Oklahoma residence, she had not established a domicile in Oregon, OAR 580-010-0030(2), and, therefore, she had failed to satisfy the first residency requirement. For that reason alone, the circuit court should have affirmed the chancellor\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Therefore, we conclude that the circuit court erred by reversing the chancellor\u2019s order. That conclusion renders petitioner\u2019s cross-appeal of the circuit court\u2019s denial of attorney fees moot. Accordingly, on the board\u2019s appeal, we reverse and remand with instructions to reinstate the chancellor\u2019s order, and, on petitioner\u2019s cross-appeal, we dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">On appeal, reversed and remanded; cross-appeal dismissed as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-9\"> ORS 183.484(5) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-10\">\u201c(a) The court may affirm, reverse or remand the order.
