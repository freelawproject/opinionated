On appeal, defendant makes two assignments of error. First, he assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal on the third-degree sexual abuse counts. We reject that assignment without discussion. Second, he assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his request for jury instructions on attempted third-degree sexual abuse. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that that assignment is unreviewable. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The relevant facts are procedural. At trial, defendant requested that, on each of the third-degree sexual abuse counts, the trial court also instruct the jury on attempted third-degree sexual abuse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court refused defendant\u2019s request. After the trial court instructed the jury, defendant did not take exception to the trial court\u2019s refusal to give his requested instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court was required to give his requested instructions because, as ORS 136.465 provides, \u201c[i]n all cases, the defendant may be found guilty of any crime the commission of which is necessarily included in that with which the defendant is charged in the accusatory instrument <em>or of an attempt to commit such </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number><em>crime.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In response, the state \u201cdoes not dispute defendant\u2019s underlying point: <em>i.e., </em>that, under ORS 136.465, it would have been appropriate to instruct the jury on the elements of attempted third-degree sexual abuse,\u201d but the state argues that we should not reach defendant\u2019s argument because it is unreviewable. Specifically, the state argues that defendant did not take exception to the trial court\u2019s failure to give the instruction, as required by ORCP 59 H(l),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-4\">\u201cA party may not obtain review on appeal of an asserted error by a trial court * * * in giving or refusing to give an instruction to a jury unless the party who seeks to appeal identified the asserted error to the trial court <em>and made a notation of exception immediately after the court instructed the jury.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">(Emphasis added.) As noted, defendant did not take exception to the trial court\u2019s failure to give his requested instruction after the trial court instructed the jury. Therefore, under ORCP 59 H(l), we cannot review defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court\u2019s failure to give the instruction was error. <em>See, e.g., State v.
