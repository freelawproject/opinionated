At sentencing, the court initially gave him the option of taking a nonmandatory, non-Measure 11 sentence with the condition that he have no contact with his wife, the victim, or, in the alternative, to take a Measure 11 sentence without a no-contact condition. After a colloquy with the victim, however, the court stated that it was imposing the non-Measure 11 sentence with the \u201cno contact\u201d recommendation. The actual judgment document nonetheless imposes the Measure 11 sentence and also contains the following notation:</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">\u201cSentence Instructions</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-6\">\u201cDefendant shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-7\">\u201cNot have contact with victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-8\">\u201cPay restitution in an amount to be determined as ordered and pursuant to ORS 137.106(l)(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-9\">\u201cDefendant shall have no contact with victim during period of incarceration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">(Boldface in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">On appeal, defendant argues that the court, in its written and signed judgment, imposed a condition of incarceration, and that in so doing it exceeded its authority; only the Department of Corrections may impose a condition of incarceration. The state concedes that a court does not have authority to impose a condition of incarceration. We agree. <em>State v. Wright, </em>128 Or App 88, 90, 875 P2d 1174 (1994). The state goes on to argue, however, that the court in this case did <em>not </em>impose a condition of incarceration; rather, it proposed a recommendation, leaving the choice to the Department of Corrections. We disagree. In determining a trial court\u2019s intention, we look to the signed judgment and not to in-court statements. <em>State v. Freeman, </em>127 Or App 640, 643, 873 P2d 1107 (1994). Here, the signed judgment gives the Department of Corrections an \u201cinstruction,\u201d not a recommendation or suggestion. The instruction twice states that defendant \u201cshall not\u201d have contact. That is unambiguously an imperative, and in imposing that imperative, the court exceeded its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
