On appeal, he argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence that the police obtained after stopping his vehicle. He further argues that the trial court imposed unlawful sentences on the drug offenses, because the terms of post-prison supervision (PPS) exceed the maximum allowable by law. We reject without discussion defendant\u2019s arguments regarding the motion to suppress and write only to address his challenges to his sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Defendant was sentenced on his drug offenses as follows: On Count 1 (unlawful delivery of methamphetamine), defendant received an upward departure sentence of 80 months\u2019 imprisonment and 40 months\u2019 post-prison supervision. On Count 2 (unlawful possession of methamphetamine), he received an upward departure sentence of 40 months\u2019 imprisonment and 60 months\u2019 post-prison supervision, to be served concurrently to his sentence on Count 1. On appeal, defendant argues that the maximum allowable post-prison supervision terms for those offenses were 36 months, and that the terms imposed by the trial court\u2014 40 and 60 months, respectively \u2014 were unlawful. Indeed, the state does not dispute that the sentences were <em>plainly </em>erroneous. The only question on appeal is whether this court should exercise its discretion to review for plain error and correct those erroneous terms. ORAP 5.45(1) (an \u201cappellate court may consider an error of law apparent on the face of the record\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">According to the state, this court has, since <em>State v. Graham, </em>143 Or App 85, 923 P2d 664 (1996), consistently declined to exercise discretion to correct unpreserved errors in the imposition of post-prison supervision terms. In <em>Graham, </em>the defendant was sentenced to an erroneous term of post-prison supervision just days after ORS 138.083 was amended to allow a sentencing court to \u201cmodify any erroneous term in the judgment.\u201d The defendant asked that we exercise our discretion to correct the erroneous post-prison supervision term, as had been our practice, but the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>argued that the amendments to ORS 138.083 had changed the landscape. In the state\u2019s view, the proper remedy for an erroneous post-prison supervision term was no longer plain error review, but rather a motion to correct the judgment in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">We agreed with the state\u2019s argument that the amendments to ORS 138.083 required us to revisit our \u201cpractice in the past to exercise our discretion under [ORAP 5.45] to review certain unpreserved errors in post-prison supervision terms.\u201d 143 Or App at 87. We reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">\u201c[W]e no longer believe that it is appropriate to exercise our discretion to review unpreserved errors in terms of post-prison supervision contained in judgments entered after [the effective date of the amendments to ORS 138.083]. Petitioning the trial court under ORS 138.083, not an appeal, is the proper avenue of redress for such errors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 88.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">We have since retreated, however, from the view that the failure to move to correct the judgment is fatal to our plain error review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Instead, we more recently have viewed the failure to file a motion to correct the judgment pursuant to ORS 138.083 as \u201cone factor pertaining to the court\u2019s exercise of discretion to correct the error.\u201d <em>Holloway v. Gower, </em>225 Or App 176, 184, 200 P3d 584 (2009). In <em>State v. Balogh, </em>207 Or App 377, 381, 142 P3d 473, <em>opinion withdrawn and superseded on recons, </em>209 Or App 162, 146 P3d 335 (2006), we exercised our discretion to correct an erroneous post-prison supervision term despite the state\u2019s invocation of <em>Graham:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">\u201cIn <em>State v. Galvin, </em>152 Or App 275, 277-78, 954 P2d 800 (1998), we explained that a defendant\u2019s failure to avail himself or herself of the statutory remedy provided in ORS 138.083 [w]eigh[ed] against\u2019 addressing an unpreserved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>claim of error regarding a sentence. In that case, however, we determined that the gravity of the error outweighed the defendant\u2019s failure to seek that remedy. Conversely, in <em>State v. </em>Layton, 163 Or App 37, 41, 986 P2d 1221 (1999), <em>rev den, </em>330 Or 252 (2000), we rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that having sought modification of his sentence in a proceeding under ORS 138.083 \u2018cured\u2019 a lack of preservation. Accordingly, neither availing oneself of the remedy provided in ORS 138.083, nor failing to do so, necessarily controls this court\u2019s discretion whether to reach a claimed error in sentencing. <em>See also State v. Patton, </em>201 Or App 509, 512, 119 P3d 250 (2005). Rather, as in <em>Galvin, </em>we consider that circumstance, or its absence, as one factor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-4\">\u201cThe salient other factor in this case is the gravity of the error. As discussed above, the [post-prison supervision] term for defendant\u2019s primary offense, first-degree sexual abuse, calculates as 45 months. The trial court nevertheless imposed an unqualified 60-month [post-prison supervision] term on the attempted sexual abuse conviction in that case. Accordingly, if the error is not corrected, defendant will be required to serve an additional 15 months of [post-prison supervision]. The gravity of that unlawful sentence outweighs the availability, past or future, of an ORS 138.083 proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-5\"><em>See also Holloway, </em>225 Or App at 184 (explaining that, \u201c[although our opinion [Balogh] was withdrawn because the case became moot while the appeal was pending, the reasoning remains sound\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Here, as in <em>Balogh, </em>a \u201csalient other factor\u201d is the gravity of the sentencing error. The state does not dispute that, as a result of the sentencing errors in this case, defendant will be required to serve additional months of post-prison supervision. Another salient factor is that the terms of post-prison supervision were not discussed on the record at sentencing in this case, but rather appeared for the first time when defendant\u2019s convictions and sentences were reduced to judgment. In other words, defendant did not acquiesce to the error by remaining silent in the first instance, nor is it apparent that he could have \u201ccured\u201d any preservation problem after the fact, <em>see Layton, </em>163 Or App at 41.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>reasons \u2014 namely, the circumstances surrounding defendant\u2019s failure to object and the gravity of the error \u2014 we exercise our discretion to correct the plainly erroneous terms of post-prison supervision imposed in this case. Accordingly, we remand the entire case for resentencing. ORS 138.222(5)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Reversed and remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-9\"> We nonetheless concluded that the ends of justice were best served by exercising our discretion to correct the error in <em>Graham, </em>because of the \u201cclose proximity of the judgment to the effective date of the statutory amendment\u201d and the fact that we were announcing a \u201cchange in our policy for review of such errors.\u201d 143 Or App at 88.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b466-10\"> That is to say our cases have not been consistent. Nor have our cases always distinguished when the issue is raised on direct appeal as opposed to post-conviction relief. However, we need not attempt to reconcile those inconsistencies in this case, other than to say that <em>Graham </em>does not reflect our current approach.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b467-7\"> In <em>Peeples v. Lampert, </em>345 Or 209, 220, 191 P3d 637 (2008), the court observed that, \u201c[i]n some circumstances, the preservation requirement gives way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>entirely, as when a party has no practical ability to raise an issue.\u201d We have recently applied that principle where errors have appeared for the first time in a judgment. <em>See, e.g., State v. Lewis, </em>236 Or App 49, 234 P3d 152, <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 172 (2010). Defendant, relying on that recent case law, argues that the rules of preservation give way entirely in this case because the error appeared for the first time in the judgment. We need not address that contention in this case, however, because we would correct the error regardless of whether there is a preservation requirement in these circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
