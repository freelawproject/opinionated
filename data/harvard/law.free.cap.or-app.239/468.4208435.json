He contends that the trial court erred when, despite the absence of supporting physical evidence, it admitted a nurse practitioner\u2019s diagnosis of \u201chighly concerning for sexual abuse.\u201d Specifically, he asserts that the admission of that diagnosis was improper because (1) the diagnosis lacked a proper foundation and was unfairly prejudicial and therefore did not meet admissibility requirements for scientific evidence and (2) the diagnosis constituted an impermissible comment on the credibility of the victim, a witness in the case. For the reasons explained below, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The following facts are undisputed. The victim, defendant\u2019s then three-year-old daughter, told a family friend that \u201cDaddy puts his pee-pee in my pee-pee.\u201d She repeated that statement to the friend on several different occasions. The allegations were eventually reported to the police, and the victim was referred to CARES, where she was examined by Avila, a nurse practitioner. During the examination, when questioned by Avila as to whether she had ever seen a \u201cgrownup\u2019s pee-pee,\u201d the victim stated that her \u201cdaddy has one\u201d and, while pointing to her vaginal area, she said, \u201cHe put it there.\u201d The examination revealed no physical evidence of sexual abuse. However, Avila diagnosed the victim as \u201chighly concerning for sexual abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">A police detective listened to the CARES examination from a separate room and talked with the medical staff and the victim\u2019s mother. He then contacted defendant at his place of work and had defendant come to the police station to discuss the allegations. During the interview, the detective explained that he had observed the CARES evaluation and informed defendant of what the victim alleged. Defendant told the officer that he did not know why his daughter made such statements, and stated that it was \u201ca possibility that [she was] telling the truth\u201d and that \u201che wouldn\u2019t do that to his daughter, but if she said it happened it probably did, but he [did not] remember doing that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>At the conclusion of the interview, defendant was arrested and eventually charged with first-degree rape and first-degree sexual abuse. In its case-in-chief, the state offered testimony from Avila regarding her diagnosis and its basis. Defendant objected to that testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-4\">\u201cQ * * * And are those things you just described, the spontaneous nature [of the victim\u2019s statements], her pointing and gesturing, are those things that factor into your diagnosis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">\u201cQ Tell the Court why.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Object as to a diagnosis, Your Honor. There is no\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">\u201cQ * * * Tell the Court why.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-10\">\u201cA The way in which a child makes a disclosure has a lot to do with the diagnostic process. When kids are interviewed in a neutral way, the way we do them at CARES, and they \u2014 they are more likely to say things spontaneously. She gave, you know, a fair amount to detail for a three-year-old, which makes \u2014 which makes it more \u2014 it just is more believable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-11\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Object. Opinion evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-13\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: And again the spontaneity is a big part of incorporating that into a diagnosis rather than in response to lots of questions, and kids who \u2014 who are asked a lot of leading questions might tend to agree with adults when they\u2019re that age, but she wasn\u2019t asked leading questions, and she said some of these things very spontaneously. So that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s definitely taken into account when making a diagnosis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-15\">\u201cQ * * * Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-16\">\u201cA It\u2019s assumed that when a medical provider is seeing a child or an adult and they understand that\u2019s why they\u2019re there, that the information that they give you is \u2014 is true because they don\u2019t really have any reason to go to the doctor and make up stories, even with a child as young as three.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Object, calls for speculation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">\u201cQ Okay. Ms. Avila, based on your training and experience, your 20 years [as a] nurse practitioner, your ten years specializing in pediatric child abuse medicine, based on your training and experience, your evaluation of [the victim] and \u2014 were you able to make a diagnosis in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">\u201cA Yes, I was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">\u201cQ And are you able to make that diagnosis with a reasonable degree of medical certainty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">\u201cQ What is that diagnosis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-10\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And Your Honor, I\u2019m going to object as to scientific evidence, and there\u2019s no foundation for this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Overruled. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-12\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: Highly concerning for sexual abuse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-13\">After the parties had concluded their questioning of Avila, the court itself questioned her about the diagnosis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-14\">\u201cQ Your diagnosis was highly concerning for sexual abuse, you didn\u2019t actually diagnose sexual abuse?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-15\">\u201cA Well, we have a kind of continuum in how we diagnose and in order to be consistent, and you know, and between examiners, we have a \u2014 I wish I had it here. I don\u2019t know if I do, but kind of a continuum. Things like pregnancy and certain sexually transmitted infections are considered diagnostic, and then vague behaviors might be suspicious or concerning, but not highly concerning, and then when you have very, very clear spontaneous disclosures from a child who is only three, I consider that highly, highly\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-16\">\u201cQ Okay. So there\u2019s a continuum of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-17\">\u201cA Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>\u201cQ \u2014Sexual abuse \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-4\">\u201cA Right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Avila clarified, in response to the court\u2019s questions, that her diagnosis was \u201chighly concerning for sexual abuse\u201d rather than simply \u201csexual abuse\u201d because there \u201cwasn\u2019t a sexually transmitted disease or pregnancy\u201d or other physical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The state also offered, in its case-in-chief, testimony from the family friend to whom the victim initially made her disclosures, the officer who interviewed defendant, a social worker from the Department of Human Services who was involved with the family as a result of the allegations, and the victim herself. Defendant testified in his own defense that no sexual contact had occurred. He also indicated that, during the interview with the police detective, he had been pressured to admit to the abuse but had told the officer that he \u201chad no recollection of that happening.\u201d In addition, defendant presented testimony from the police detective, several character witnesses, a pediatrician who had treated defendant\u2019s daughters over the years for a skin condition in their genital areas, and a psychologist who had examined defendant with regard to his suggestibility and compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">After deliberating, the trial court found defendant guilty of first-degree rape and sexual abuse. In announcing its verdict, the court discussed the evidence presented and emphasized defendant\u2019s statements to police:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-8\">\u201cRegarding [the witness] from the Department of Human Services, everything she said is correct if you accept the premise that the child was abused, and human nature is \u2014 and I\u2019m talking about mom at this particular point\u2014 when you love somebody, you don\u2019t just stop loving them immediately and say they\u2019re a terrible bad person. Human nature just doesn\u2019t work that way. It\u2019s \u2014 you don\u2019t go from 60 to 0 immediately, much less from 60 one direction to 60 miles per hour the opposite direction just in a second. Life just doesn\u2019t work that way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-9\">\u201cThe child did testify and there was nothing to me that indicated that she had been subjected to any kind of coercion. Based on the way the mom presented herself both in the telephone calls to the jail and the way she testified, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>was on the fence. It\u2019s human nature to be on the fence in a case like that. She tried to be fair to both her husband and her child so I credit her for that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-4\">\u201c[The detective], it\u2019s interesting to me that no matter what a suspect does, you can spin it to make it \u2014 make him look guilty. There w[ere] some things that [the detective] took as indications of guilt or deception, which to me seemed that they could just was well have been reaction[s] of a perfectly innocent \u2014 innocent, honest person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">\u201cHe, [the detective], had already observed the CAKES interview, and he\u2019d made up his mind that the abuse had occurred and he was there to get a confession. He used a conciliatory manner. He described it as sort of like a counselor, and of course, a counselor probably doesn\u2019t go in with an objective or goal, but in terms of the manner and techniques, that\u2019s exactly what he did; he didn\u2019t browbeat [defendant] and he didn\u2019t call him a scumbag or anything like that, but he was there to get a confession, he did everything he could to get a confession, and in that conciliatory manner he put a lot of pressure on [defendant] to confess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">\u201cIt was clear that [defendant] did not want to confess, and ultimately he didn\u2019t confess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-8\">\u201cGetting to [defendant], he admitted to the police that if [the victim] said it happened then it probably happened, and I think [the prosecutor] was correct in her closing remarks in that this was a very important point because it\u2019s something even the mom agrees with, that [the victim] said something happened, something happened, and in her phone call to [defendant], she encourages him to determine what really happened. It wasn\u2019t that something didn\u2019t happen, it was that something did, and he needs to get his mind straight as to exactly what it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-9\">\u201cAnd [defendant] was not easily led either in his conversations with the police or especially in his trial testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-10\">\u201c[The family friend] was pretty straightforward. I think she just told things pretty much as they happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-11\">\u201cAnd [the victim], a very young child, but bright, the rare four-year-old to be competent to as a witness, but much as Ms. Avila, the nurse practitioner indicated, she was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>rare four-year old, she had certain limitations in her mastery and understanding of numbers and of language to some extent, but she spontaneously said what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-4\">\u201cIt does come back to me to [defendant] particularly admitting that \u2014 or stating that if [the victim] said something happened, something happened. He didn\u2019t say that nothing happened, he didn\u2019t say that * * * maybe she believed that something happened, he said \u2018If she said something happened, something happened,\u2019 and I believe that I\u2019m convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that there was at least one incident as described by [the victim] to [the family friend] and the nurse practitioner Avila. And for that reason, I am required to find [defendant] guilty * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred in admitting Avila\u2019s diagnosis because, among other things, the diagnosis was an improper comment on the victim\u2019s credibility. The state responds that, because the \u201cdiagnosis only assisted, and did not supplant, the trier of fact\u2019s credibility determination, the diagnosis did not constitute an improper comment on credibility.\u201d (Boldface omitted.) According to the state, in the absence of an explicit opinion regarding the victim\u2019s credibility, the diagnosis is not \u201can impermissible comment * * * on the credibility of the victim simply because * * * an inference [that the nurse believed the victim\u2019s report] is <em>available\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) We conclude that defendant\u2019s characterization of the diagnosis in this case is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">We recently addressed this issue in <em>State v. Bainbridge, </em>238 Or App 56, 241 P3d 1186 (2010). In that case, we concluded that, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Lupoli, </em>348 Or 346, 234 P3d 117 (2010),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a diagnosis of child sexual abuse made in the absence of physical evidence constitutes an impermissible comment on the credibility of a witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">\u201cIn <em>[Lupoli], </em>the court held that an expert\u2019s diagnosis of child sexual abuse in the absence of physical evidence, \u2018necessarily was based on her assessment of the child\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>believability.\u2019 [348 Or] at 362. A diagnosis based purely on an assessment of the victim\u2019s credibility, the court held, amounts to impermissible vouching. <em>Id. </em>at 361-62.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><em>Bainbridge, </em>238 Or App at 59. We determined that, pursuant to <em>Lupoli, </em>even where the expert has not explicitly vouched for the victim\u2019s credibility, in the absence of physical evidence, the diagnosis \u201cnecessarily was based on [an] assessment of the child victim\u2019s credibility\u201d and, accordingly, could not properly be admitted into evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">That rule controls in this case. Avila\u2019s diagnosis was made without any physical evidence of abuse and was necessarily based on her belief that the victim was telling the truth. Thus, pursuant to <em>Lupoli </em>and <em>Bainbridge, </em>the diagnosis constituted impermissible vouching and, as such, should not have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Nevertheless, the state points out that \u201cdefendant was tried to the court and not a jury\u201d and urges that, pursuant to <em>State v. Cafarelli, </em>254 Or 73, 76, 456 P2d 999 (1969), \u201cthis court may presume that any impermissible comments on credibility would be ignored by the trial court.\u201d In that case, in examining asserted evidentiary errors, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\">\u201cIn a trial to the court we can assume that any questionable evidence would be disregarded. There is no indication that the court relied on the evidence in reaching the verdict of guilty. There was no need to rely on the questioned evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-8\"><em>Cafarelli, </em>254 Or at 76. It is upon that statement that the state relies in this case. However, in <em>State v. Marrington, </em>335 Or 555, 73 P3d 911 (2003), the court limited the applicability of that portion of <em>Cafarelli.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">In <em>Marrington, </em>in a trial to the court, testimony was admitted that delayed reporting was a \u201cpredominant feature of child sexual abuse[.]\u201d 335 Or at 564. The court concluded that the state had an obligation to demonstrate that that evidence was scientifically valid and that the trial court erred in admitted such evidence without a proper foundation. Pointing to <em>Cafarelli, </em>the state urged that there was no need to reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction and that, \u201c in a trial to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>court, evidentiary error is presumed harmless in the absence of an affirmative indication that the court actually relied on the erroneously admitted evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Marrington, </em>335 Or at 564. The court disagreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-4\">\u201cIt may be that the foregoing statement in <em>Cafarelli </em>describes a rule of appellate review that is applicable in the appropriate case. We have no occasion in this case, however, to undertake an extensive analysis of its origin or the appropriateness of its application in criminal cases. Nonetheless, suffice it to say that, if carried to its logical extreme, that rule \u2014 -if that is indeed what it is \u2014 would obviate the need to conduct any other kind of harmless error analysis. That cannot be true in all cases. If, for example, the erroneously admitted evidence had been crucial to a particular outcome in a case, then some further analysis must be undertaken.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 565. The court went on to explain why, in that case, the erroneously admitted evidence necessitated reversal of the conviction, notwithstanding the fact that the defendant had a court trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">\u201cThe state argues that, at most, the erroneously admitted evidence * * * was relevant only to the trial court\u2019s credibility assessment and that \u2018[n]othing in the court\u2019s remarks should lead this court to conclude that the admission of [the] testimony, if erroneous, had any impact on the trial court\u2019s decision-making [process].\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">\u201cWe disagree with the state\u2019s assertion that, in this case, the trial court\u2019s failure to mention [the] testimony in its remarks surrounding the announcement of its decision should play some role in our assessment of the impact of the erroneously admitted evidence. This case involved a swearing contest. <em>The victim claimed that there had been sexual contact in the form of inappropriate touching; defendant denied that it had occurred. There were no other witnesses to the touching, and there was no physical evidence of any kind that corroborated the alleged abuse.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 565-66 (first and third alterations in original; emphasis added). In light of those circumstances, and the fact that \u201cthere [was] nothing in the record to indicate that the testimony played <em>no role </em>in the trial court\u2019s assessment[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>566 (emphasis added), the court concluded the error was not harmless and reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">In this case, the trial court did not specifically discuss Avila\u2019s diagnosis in the remarks surrounding its verdict. However, as in <em>Marrington, </em>that does not mean the court did not consider the evidence. This was a very close case and, ultimately, came down to a \u201cswearing contest\u201d in which the court had to decide whether to believe the testimony of the victim, who was four years old at the time of trial, that defendant had subjected her to sexual contact, or defendant, who denied the contact. As the trial court noted, due to her very young age, the victim had limitations on her communication skills. Also, like in <em>Marrington, </em>there were no witnesses to the sexual contact, and there was no physical evidence of abuse. The diagnosis that the victim had been abused went to the key issue in the case, and we note that the trial court specifically questioned Avila regarding her diagnosis, providing some indication that it considered that information to be important. Ultimately, taking all the circumstances into account, we cannot conclude that the erroneously admitted evidence was unlikely to have affected the court\u2019s verdict. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In light of that conclusion, defendant\u2019s convictions must be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial. Accordingly, we do not reach defendant\u2019s other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b505-8\"> We note that <em>Lupoli </em>involved testimony from CARES nurse practitioner Avila very similar to the testimony from Avila in this case. 348 Or at 353-54; <em>see id. </em>at 361-62.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
