J.</author>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Defendant, who pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII) for riding a bicycle while intoxicated, ORS 813.010, appeals, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s revocation of his driving privileges pursuant to ORS 809.235(l)(b), the \u201cthree strikes\u201d revocation statute. On appeal, defendant raises statutory and constitutional challenges to the use of a bicycling-related DUII as a basis for revocation of <em>driving </em>privileges. We review the trial court\u2019s decision for legal error. <em>See State v. Vazquez-Escobar, </em>211 Or App 115, 117, 153 P3d 168, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 224 (2007). As amplified below, we reject defendant\u2019s statutory arguments and his challenge based on Article I, section 20, of the Oregon Constitution and reject defendant\u2019s other constitutional contentions without discussion. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The relevant facts are undisputed. Defendant pleaded guilty and was convicted of DUII for riding a bicycle while intoxicated on August 2,2008. <em>See State v. Woodruff, </em>81 Or App 484, 487, 726 P2d 396, <em>rev den, </em>302 Or 460 (1986) (holding that the DUII statute applies to bicyclists). Defendant had two prior convictions for DUII, both involving motor vehicles, from 1993 and 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">At sentencing, the state sought permanent revocation of defendant\u2019s driving privileges under ORS 809.235(l)(b), which provides that a \u201ccourt shall order that a person\u2019s driving privileges be permanently revoked * * * if the person is convicted for a third or subsequent time of* * * [d]riving while under the influence of intoxicants.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In response, defendant first contended that, as a statutory matter, a bicycling-based DUII conviction could not count for one of the three requisite convictions for permanent revocation under ORS 809.235(l)(b). That is so, defendant posited, because ORS 809.235(l)(b) pertains to loss of <em>driving </em>privileges and a driver\u2019s license is not required to operate a bicycle. Thus, defendant asserted, invoking ORS 814.400(l)(a), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>ORS 809.235(l)(b) \u201cby [its] very nature can have no application\u201d to him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">Defendant also raised a variety of constitutional challenges. Specifically, defendant contended that permanent revocation of his driving privileges, based on a bicycle DUII, was disproportionate punishment under Article I, section 16, of the Oregon Constitution and the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and violated the equal privileges and immunities guarantees of Article I, section 20, and the Equal Protection Clause of the federal Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The trial court rejected each of defendant\u2019s arguments and permanently revoked his driving privileges. On appeal, defendant assigns error to the permanent revocation, renewing the arguments he raised before the trial court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">We begin with the applicable statutes. As noted, ORS 813.010, the statute that defines the offense of DUII, applies to bicyclists pursuant to ORS 814.400. <em>Woodruff, </em>81 Or App at 487. The revocation statute, ORS 809.235(l)(b), provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">\u201cThe court shall order that a person\u2019s driving privileges be permanently revoked * * * if the person is convicted for a third or subsequent time of * * *:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">\u201c(A) Driving while under the influence of intoxicants in violation of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">\u201c(i) ORS 813.010U\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">Thus, in plain and unqualified terms, ORS 809.235(l)(b) provides that a trial court shall revoke the driving privileges of a person who has three or more convictions for DUII. Nothing in ORS 809.235(l)(b) limits its reach solely to persons with three or more DUII offenses committed while operating motor vehicles \u2014 and nothing in the plain statutory text <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>exempts individuals whose DUII convictions arose from operating bicycles while intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Defendant argues, nevertheless, that ORS 814.400 qualifies the application of ORS 809.235(l)(b) \u201c[b]ecause a driver\u2019s license is not required to operate a bicycle.\u201d ORS 814.400 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">\u201c(1) Every person riding a bicycle upon a public way is subject to the provisions applicable to and has the same rights and duties as the driver of any other vehicle concerning operating on highways * * * except:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">\u201c(a) <em>Those provisions which by their very nature can have no </em>application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">(Emphasis added.) Specifically invoking ORS 814.400, defendant asserts that the provisions pertaining to revocation of driving privileges \u201cby their very nature can have no application\u201d to offenses committed while operating a bicycle. As support for that view, defendant relies on <em>Woodruff, </em>in which we held that the vehicle code\u2019s implied consent law, <em>former </em>ORS 487.805(1) (1981),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> does not apply to persons who were stopped for DUII while on bicycles. <em>See id. </em>at 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Woodruff </em>is misplaced. In <em>Woodruff, </em>we held that the implied consent law has no application to bicycles under a former version of ORS 814.400 because, \u201cby its terms,\u201d the law applies \u201conly to a person \u2018who operates a <em>motor </em>vehicle.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>former </em>ORS 487.805(1) (1981), the antecedent to ORS 813.100) (emphasis in <em>Woodruff). </em>Thus, in <em>Woodruff, </em>we held that the implied consent law does not apply to bicyclists because the statutory language of that law limited its scope to people operating motor vehicles. In contrast, here, as noted, the statutory language of 809.235(l)(b) contains no such limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">We turn to defendant\u2019s constitutional challenge under Article I, section 20.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Article I, section 20, guarantees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>equal privileges to \u201cany citizen\u201d and to those citizens who belong to a \u201cclass.\u201d <em>State v. Clark, </em>291 Or 231, 239, 630 P2d 810, <em>cert den, </em>454 US 1084 (1981). Defendant contends that application of ORS 809.235(l)(b) denies him equal privileges both as an individual and as a member of a class.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Defendant\u2019s challenge based on his \u201cindividual situation,\u201d <em>Clark, </em>291 Or at 239, fails. Under Article I, section 20,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-5\">\u201c[ulnlawful individual-based denial (or conferral) of a privilege or immunity occurs when government engages in \u2018wholly standardless application of a general law,\u2019 <em>[Clark, </em>291 Or at 239], that is, when government distributes privileges or immunities \u2018purely haphazardly or otherwise on terms that have no satisfactory explanation.\u2019 <em>State v. Edmonson, </em>291 Or 251, 254, 630 P2d 822 (1981).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-7\"><em>State v. Davis, </em>237 Or App 351, 366-67, 239 P3d 1002 (2010) (Schuman, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Here, defendant has not demonstrated that the state has failed to apply ORS 809.235 to other similarly situated indi<em>viduals </em>\u2014 viz., persons with two prior DUII convictions, including persons with prior bicycling DUII convictions\u2014 much less that any such (unproven) purported difference in treatment was \u201cwholly standardless\u201d or \u201chaphazard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Defendant also contends that application of ORS 809.235(l)(b) denies him equal privileges under Article I, section 20, as a member of a \u201ctrue class of individuals that operate non-motorized vehicles on public highways.\u201d According to defendant, \u201c[subjecting operators of motorized vehicles and non-motorized vehicles to the same <em>permanent </em>driver\u2019s license revocation treats those classes disparately because only one of those classes <em>[viz., </em>operators of motor vehicles] actually involves conduct related to possessing a driver\u2019s license.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">Defendant\u2019s \u201cclass\u201d-based challenge is also unavailing. To succeed, defendant would have to demonstrate that (1) the class that he claims is subjected to adverse government action is truly a class (for example, Italian-Americans), and not simply a group that would have no class identity except for the challenged law (for example, persons who file late petitions for review); (2) the class is one that \u201c \u2018is based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>on <em>immutable </em>traits or traits on the basis of which class members are subjected to adverse social or political stereotyping or prejudice,\u2019 \u201d <em>Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. v. City of Portland, </em>214 Or App 534, 540, 166 P3d 580 (2007) (quoting <em>Cox v. State of Oregon, </em>191 Or App 1, 9, 80 P3d 514 (2003) (Schuman, J., concurring)) (emphasis added); and (3) the discrimination is, in fact, based on stereotype or prejudice and not some rational basis. Although \u201cbicyclists\u201d may be a true class \u2014 that is, the group exists apart from the laws that treat bicyclists differently from motorists or pedestrians \u2014 it cannot be argued that persons are bicyclists because of some immutable trait or historical prejudice or stereotyping.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-7\"> ORS 809.235 was amended in 2009. <em>See </em>Or Laws 2009, ch 320, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3.
