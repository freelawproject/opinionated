ORS 811.182. He appeals and asserts, among other things, that the trial court erred when it held a bench trial in the absence of a written waiver of his right to a jury trial. Although defendant did not preserve the asserted error before the trial court, he contends that we should review it as plain error. Because the record contains no written waiver or any other indication that defendant executed such a waiver, the state concedes that the trial court committed plain error. <em>See </em>Or Const, Art I, \u00a7 11; <em>State v. Barber, </em>343 Or 525, 173 P3d 827 (2007) (reversing as plain error a conviction based on a stipulated facts trial conducted by the court without a written waiver of the defendant\u2019s right to jury trial). We agree and, for the reasons set forth in <em>Barber, </em>exercise our discretion to correct the error. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s conviction must be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
