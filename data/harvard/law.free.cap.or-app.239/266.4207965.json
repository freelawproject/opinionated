He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal on all counts. Defendant asserts that the state\u2019s case at trial hinged on three groups of self-incriminating statements that he made. He contends that those statements were confessions because he made them with the purpose of acknowledging guilt. He argues further that the state failed to produce evidence corroborating the confessions and, consequently, that they could not serve as the basis for conviction. The state responds that defendant\u2019s statements were admissions, not confessions, and thus needed no corroboration. It goes on to argue that, even if one or more of the statements was a confession, there is sufficient corroboration to support defendant\u2019s convictions. We conclude that defendant\u2019s statements were uncorroborated confessions, and, accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The 16 counts with which defendant was charged arose from three groups of statements defendant made regarding sexual conduct with his daughter, J, and his ex-girlfriend\u2019s son, H. Defendant made the first group of statements (four separate statements) to a friend, Hayes. Defendant and Hayes worked together until February 20, 2006, when defendant quit his job. Hayes called him that day to ask why he had left work. Defendant told her that he had quit his job \u201cbecause he thought he touched his kids.\u201d Hayes asked him, \u201c[W]hat do you mean you touched them[?]\u201d Defendant replied simply, \u201cI touched them.\u201d Hayes then said, \u201c[E]ither you did or you didn\u2019t.\u201d Defendant told her that he did. Defendant did not say where he had touched the children, but Hayes testified at trial that she knew \u201cexactly what he was talking about * * * [b]ecause that\u2019s how we talk about that * * Defendant also told her, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t touch your children * * Hayes told him to \u201crot in hell\u201d and hung up.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Defendant made the second group of statements about sexual abuse on March 7, 2006, during a men\u2019s group counseling session. As part of his counseling, defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>asked to prepare a history of his sexual thoughts and practices, which he did with the assistance of another group member.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">According to defendant\u2019s counselor, Milligan, on the day he made the statements, defendant appeared to have been crying when he arrived at the session. When it was defendant\u2019s turn to speak, he told the group that he wanted to apologize for lying. He turned to the man who had helped him prepare his history of sexual thoughts and practices and specifically apologized to him, saying, \u201cI am really, really sorry because I lied to you and I need to tell the truth now. And [I] really, really am truly sorry.\u201d Defendant then told the group that he had molested his children and proceeded to tell them in some detail what he had done. He said that his ex-girlfriend, who is the mother of both children, was present during some of the abuse. He said that he had abused H on three different occasions in Beaverton and that he had abused J in Beaverton and in Grants Pass. Defendant also alleged that his ex-girlfriend had molested their younger daughter, A, but did not say that he had abused her. In Milligan\u2019s view, defendant \u201cseemed to be begging [the group] for forgiveness\u201d because he kept saying \u201cover and over\u201d that he was \u201cvery, very sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">At the end of the session, defendant gave Milligan his ex-girlfriend\u2019s name, address, telephone number, and date of birth, and he asked her to report their actions to the Department of Human Services (DHS). Milligan reported defendant\u2019s statement to both DHS and defendant\u2019s parole officer, Cassidy. Cassidy asked Milligan to attend defendant\u2019s next parole meeting, on March 16, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Defendant made the third group of statements about sexual abuse at that parole meeting. At the beginning of the meeting, Milligan told him that she had contacted DHS as he had requested. Milligan and Cassidy questioned defendant, and he detailed sexual acts with J and H, saying essentially the same things that he had said in the group counseling session. At the end of the meeting, defendant\u2019s parole officer arrested defendant for violating his parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Defendant was subsequently charged with eight counts of first-degree sexual abuse and eight counts of first-degree sodomy. While he was in custody, defendant was interviewed by Detective Pierce. Pierce asked defendant if he had told Hayes that he had touched his children, and he responded that \u201che did not think he had said that.\u201d Pierce then asked whether defendant thought Hayes was lying. He said that \u201che didn\u2019t think that that would be something she would lie about.\u201d Pierce also showed defendant a copy of notes that Cassidy had taken at the March 16 parole meeting and asked defendant whether he had made the statements reflected in the notes. Defendant replied that he \u201cprobably did say those because that is what has been written down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">At defendant\u2019s trial, Hayes, Milligan, Cassidy, and Pierce testified about the above-described statements. In addition to their testimony, the state put on evidence concerning J and H, who are in foster homes and receiving therapy. The DHS case worker who supervises J and H testified that H is attending a day treatment school for help with behavior that includes tantrums, \u201csexually acting out,\u201d and \u201cpoor boundaries.\u201d She also testified that J does not show \u201csexual reactivity,\u201d but that she \u201chas self-soothing behaviors, so she masturbates,\u201d is \u201ctouchy[-]feel[y] in inappropriate ways,\u201d and has poor \u201cstranger danger\u201d awareness.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">After the state presented its case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the basis that his statements were uncorroborated confessions and that, under ORS 136.425, they could not support convictions. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion, concluding that all of the statements were admissions. The court found that defendant\u2019s statements to Hayes were \u201cnot made in order to try to indicate to [Hayes] that he had committed some crime. They were made to explain to her why he didn\u2019t go to work.\u201d With respect to the statements to Milligan and the counseling group, the court found that defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">\u201cwas feeling as though he had been untruthful and needed to own up to some things and perhaps his conscience was bothering him. I don\u2019t know. It seems to me there were other or reasons that he wanted to make the statement to Ms. Milligan, and it seems to me the principle reason is he wanted DHS to become involved with the children. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>wanted DHS to take custody of the children and I don\u2019t know why exactly that is, but he implicated his [ex-girlfriend] in the conversation. And again I don\u2019t know that he was there to confess to \u2014 that he was committing a crime, as much as his interest was being motivated by getting his children out of her custody and into DHS\u2019s custody, for whatever reason. There may be some really good reasons for that, but I believe that\u2019s what he was being motivated by.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-4\">\u201cI also believe that he was motivated in part because his conscience in a counseling session may have been troubling him and he wanted to own up to things there, but I do not believe that again his motivation was to find himself in the midst of a criminal investigation or controversy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Finally, the court found that defendant\u2019s third statement was \u201cmade for the same reasons that he made similar statements\u201d at his counseling session.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Defendant rested without presenting any evidence. The court convicted defendant on all 16 counts. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">At issue on appeal is whether defendant\u2019s statements were confessions or admissions and, if they were confessions, whether they were corroborated by \u201csome other proof.\u201d ORS 136.425(1) (2005), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2009, ch 875, \u00a7 l,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides that \u201ca confession only [is not] sufficient to warrant the conviction of the defendant without some other proof that the crime has been committed.\u201d A statement is a confession if it is \u201cmade after the commission of the crime in question, for the purpose of acknowledging that the speaker is guilty of some criminal offense.\u201d <em>State v. Manzella, </em>306 Or 303, 316, 759 P2d 1078 (1988). A statement is an admission if it is \u201cmade for some purpose other than to acknowledge guilt.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">Defendant contends that the trial court analyzed the statements incorrectly. He relies on <em>State v. Muzzy, </em>190 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>App 306, 320, 79 P3d 324 (2003), <em>rev den, </em>336 Or 422 (2004), in which we observed that \u201c \u2018purpose,\u2019 as employed in <em>Manzella, </em>is neither an absolute nor an exclusive concept. A person may have many concurrent and collateral purposes for making a statement.\u201d Defendant argues that, although he may have had other purposes in making the statements \u2014 to explain why he quit his job, to apologize to his counseling group, and to cause DHS to become involved with the children \u2014 his purpose also was to acknowledge guilt. He contends that the trial court erroneously focused on <em>why </em>he acknowledged guilt rather than on <em>whether </em>he had done so. In defendant\u2019s view, his motivation for acknowledging guilt is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">The state\u2019s primary argument in response echoes the trial court\u2019s reasoning. In addition, the state argues that, even if defendant\u2019s statements at the group therapy session and in Cassidy\u2019s office were confessions, they were sufficiently corroborated by defendant\u2019s other statements\u2014 namely, the earlier statements to Hayes and the later statements to Pierce \u2014 and by the testimony of Burns, the DHS caseworker, concerning the children\u2019s behavioral issues. Finally, the state argues that, under ORS 136.425(1), two or more confessions may corroborate each other as long as they are sufficiently separate in time not to be considered part of a single confession. It thus contends that, even if all three groups of defendant\u2019s statements were confessions, they corroborate each other and are therefore sufficient to sustain the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">At the outset, we agree with defendant that, in light of <em>Muzzy, </em>if his statements were made for the purpose of acknowledging that he was guilty of criminal conduct, it is irrelevant that he may have had other purposes that motivated him to acknowledge his guilt. Accordingly, we consider each of defendant\u2019s statements to determine whether acknowledging guilt was at least in part his purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">We begin with defendant\u2019s four statements to Hayes. As noted, when Hayes asked why defendant had left work, he told her that he had quit because he \u201cthought he touched his kids.\u201d When Hayes asked him, \u201c[W]hat do you mean you touched them?\u201d he replied, \u201cI touched them.\u201d She then said, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>\u201cEither you did or you didn\u2019t,\u201d and defendant replied that he did. He then told her, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t touch your children * * *.\u201d Again, defendant contends that, although part of his purpose was to explain why he had quit his job, it was also to acknowledge that he was guilty of sexually abusing the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">We conclude that defendant\u2019s second and third statements to Hayes \u2014 \u201cI touched them\u201d and \u201cI did\u201d \u2014 give rise to only one reasonable inference: that defendant\u2019s purpose was to acknowledge that he was guilty of sexually abusing the children.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We also conclude that, even assuming that defendant\u2019s other two statements lacked a confessional purpose, they were so closely related to the second and third statements that they must be considered to be part of the confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The purpose of defendant\u2019s initial statement to Hayes \u2014 that he \u201cthought he touched his kids\u201d \u2014 may have been, as the trial court determined, to explain why defendant had left work and not to indicate that he had committed a crime. The statement was in response to an innocuous question \u2014 Hayes asking why defendant had left work \u2014 and was equivocal about whether he had even engaged in the conduct \u2014 he said he <em>thought </em>he had touched the children. However, defendant\u2019s subsequent two statements were no longer in response to the question about why defendant had left work, but were in response to Hayes\u2019s requests for clarification of defendant\u2019s initial statement: She effectively asked defendant, \u201cDid you molest your children?\u201d The purpose of defendant\u2019s responses \u2014 \u201cI touched them\u201d and \u201cI did\u201d \u2014 was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>unquestionably to acknowledge that he was guilty of sexually abusing the children. It follows that those statements constituted a confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Even assuming that defendant\u2019s initial statement was not itself a confession, it was \u201cso closely related to his confession as to be a part of it * * <em>Manzella, </em>306 Or at 316. As the Supreme Court emphasized in <em>Manzella, \u201call </em>statements made during the course of a confession are protected by ORS 136.425(1). The state may not dissect a confession and use isolated statements to corroborate the \u2018core\u2019 of the confession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 316 n 13 (emphasis in original). Given the immediate temporal proximity of the statements and how readily and unequivocally defendant acknowledged his guilt when Hayes asked him to clarify what he meant, the initial statement is so closely related to the confession that it must be regarded as part of it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">We reach the same conclusion with respect to defendant\u2019s final statement, assuring Hayes that he had not touched her children. Because that statement came right on the heels of his unequivocal acknowledgments of guilt, which were essential context for the statement, it was too closely related to the confession to be regarded as separate from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">We turn to defendant\u2019s statements at the group therapy session. As noted, defendant began by telling the group that he wanted to apologize for lying and then specifically apologized to the man who had helped him prepare his history of sexual thoughts and practices, saying, \u201cI am really, really sorry because I lied to you and I need to tell the truth now.\u201d He then described in detail how he had abused the children and alleged that his ex-girlfriend had been present some of the times and that she had abused their younger daughter. Finally, he asked Milligan to report the abuse to DHS.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>The state argues that defendant\u2019s purposes in making the statements to the therapy group were to seek forgiveness and to have DHS remove the children from his ex-girlfriend\u2019s custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">Defendant may well have had those purposes, but, as the trial court determined, he also had the purpose of acknowledging that he had sexually abused the children. After stating that defendant\u2019s principal reason for making the statements was that he \u201cwanted DHS to become involved with the children,\u201d the court stated, \u201cI also believe that he was motivated in part because his conscience in a counseling session may have been troubling him and he wanted to <em>own up to things </em>there,\u201d although it did not believe that \u201chis motivation was to find himself in the midst of a criminal investigation or controversy.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As noted above, it is immaterial that defendant\u2019s principal reason for making the statements may have been something other than to acknowledge guilt. <em>See Muzzy, </em>190 Or App at 320 (\u201cA person may have many concurrent and collateral purposes for making a statement.\u201d). Likewise, it is immaterial that defendant\u2019s motive may not have been to instigate a criminal investigation or prosecution. Nothing in <em>Manzella, </em>or any other case of which we are aware, suggests that, for a statement to be a confession within the meaning of ORS 136.425(1), the defendant must be so motivated. Given that defendant\u2019s purpose in making the statements to the therapy group was at least in part to \u201cown up to\u201d his criminal conduct, the statements constituted a confession.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">We turn next to defendant\u2019s statements at the parole office, which require little discussion. The state all but concedes that defendant\u2019s statements at the parole office constituted a confession. The trial court stated that defendant made those statements \u201cfor the same reasons that he made similar statements to Ms. Milligan.\u201d In light of our determination as to the purpose of the statements to Milligan and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>therapy group, the statements at the parole office also constituted a confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">We turn to the state\u2019s contention that defendant\u2019s statements were corroborated by other evidence. The state argues that the statements were corroborated by the testimony of the DHS caseworker that H was having tantrums, was acting out sexually, and had \u201cpoor boundaries,\u201d and that J engaged in masturbatory behavior and was inappropriately \u201ctouchy-feely\u201d with others. The state also contends that defendant\u2019s statements were corroborated by his subsequent statement to Pierce, in which he stated that he did not think he had told Hayes that he touched the children, but conceded that that would not be something that Hayes would lie about, and conceded further that he \u201cprobably\u201d made the statements that were reflected in Cassidy\u2019s notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">As noted, ORS 136.425(1) provides that a confession alone is not sufficient to warrant a conviction without \u201csome other proof that the crime has been committed.\u201d The Supreme Court has explained that the statute codified the common-law <em>corpus delicti </em>rule, which requires the state to show that \u201c \u2018the injury or harm specified in the crime occurred\u2019 \u201d and that the \u201c \u2018injury or harm was caused by someone\u2019s criminal activity * * *.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Lerch, </em>296 Or 377, 393, 677 P2d 678 (1984) (quoting McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 158, 346-47 (2d ed 1972)). However, \u201cit is not necessary that the corroborating \u2018proof independent of the confession prove or establish the <em>corpus delicti. </em>The statute only requires that the state introduce independent evidence that <em>tends </em>to establish the <em>corpus delicti.\u201d Id. </em>at 394 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Defendant confessed to first-degree sodomy and first-degree sexual abuse. The <em>corpus delicti </em>of first-degree sodomy is that a person engaged in \u201cdeviate sexual intercourse\u201d with the victim or caused the victim to engage in that act. <em>State v. Delp, </em>218 Or App 17, 29, 178 P3d 259, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 317 (2008) (citing ORS 163.405). The <em>corpus delicti </em>for first-degree sexual abuse is that the victim was subjected to sexual contact. <em>Id. </em>(citing ORS 163.427).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Although the threshold for corroboration is low, the evidence that the state cites is insufficient. Defendant\u2019s statement to Pierce tends to establish only that defendant previously admitted to committing the crimes. It does nothing to establish that any of the crimes occurred. The testimony of the DHS caseworker, without more, also does not suffice. The state offered no evidence showing that the children\u2019s behavior was a result of the children having been abused sexually. Again, the threshold for corroboration is low, but concluding that the children\u2019s behavior tends to show that they were sexually abused amounts to little more than speculation on the record before us. We reject the state\u2019s argument without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">Finally, the state argues that each of defendant\u2019s confessions can be used to corroborate the others. The state points out that ORS 136.425(1) provides only that <em>\u201ca </em>confession\u201d alone does not warrant conviction. According to the state, as long as two or more confessions are sufficiently separate in time so that they could not be considered part of only a single confession, they should be deemed to corroborate each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The state\u2019s argument presents a question of statutory construction. To determine the legislature\u2019s intent, we begin by considering the text in context. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). Context includes the common-law backdrop against which the statute was enacted. <em>Tyree Oil, Inc. v. BOLI, </em>168 Or App 278, 282, 7 P3d 571 (2000). On its face, ORS 136.425(1) could be read as the state proposes: It provides that \u201ca confession only [is not] sufficient to warrant the conviction of the defendant without some other proof that the crime has been committed.\u201d As the state asserts, \u201ca confession\u201d could be understood to mean \u201cone confession\u201d; thus, two or more confessions are sufficient to warrant a conviction. However, the text can also fairly be read to distinguish between confessions and other types of evidence, such that \u201csome other proof\u2019 does not include confessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The context indicates that the latter reading is correct. Again, ORS 136.425(1) codified the common-law <em>corpus delicti </em>rule. <em>Manzella, </em>306 Or at 305 n 1. The rule arose \u201cin response to celebrated cases in which alleged murder victims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>turned up alive after their alleged murderers already had been convicted and hanged for the offenses\u201d based on the alleged murderers\u2019 confessions, which, obviously, proved to have been false. <em>State v. Chatelain, </em>347 Or 278, 283, 220 P3d 41 (2009); <em>see also Manzella, </em>306 Or at 310. Thus, the purpose of the rule is to prevent convictions based on false confessions where no crime has in fact occurred. A defendant\u2019s repetition of a confession does not satisfy that aim. Accordingly, we reject the state\u2019s argument that, under ORS 136.425(1), defendant\u2019s confessions were sufficient to corroborate each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Because defendant\u2019s confessions were not corroborated, they were not sufficient to warrant conviction. The trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b297-10\"> In 2009, the legislature amended ORS 136.425 to provide that a confession alone is sufficient to warrant a conviction in some circumstances. <em>See also </em>ORS 136.427 (setting forth those circumstances). The amended version of ORS 136.425 does not apply in this case, and all references to the statute in this opinion are to the 2005 version.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b299-6\"> As we have previously observed, it is \u201cunclear to what extent the \u2018purpose\u2019 assessment under <em>Manzella </em>is objective, subjective, or some combination of the two.\u201d <em>Muzzy, </em>190 Or App at 320; <em>see also State v. Simons, </em>214 Or App 675, 684-85, 167 P3d 476 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 43 (2008) (\u201cTo the extent that the \u2018purpose\u2019 determination involves defendant\u2019s subjective intent in making the statement, that intent is a question of fact,\u201d and \u201cwe are bound by the trial court\u2019s finding on the issue if there is any evidence in the record to support it.\u201d). This case does not require us to determine whether we review the trial court\u2019s \u201cpurpose\u201d determination as a question of law \u2014 that is, without deference \u2014 or only to determine whether it is supported by evidence in the record. The result of our review is the same regardless of whether \u201cpurpose\u201d is a question of fact or of law, given that, as to two of the statements, the record gives rise to only one reasonable inference with respect to defendant\u2019s purpose and that the other two are so closely related as to be considered part of the confession.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b300-7\"> We do not understand <em>Manzella </em>to hold, nor do we mean to imply, that, if a confession is made during the course of a conversation, everything else said in the conversation must be regarded as part of the confession for purposes of ORS 136.425(1). This case does not require us to rule out the possibility that a conversation could begin with admissions being made and subsequently evolve into a confession without the admissions being \u201cso closely related to [the] confession as to be a part of it,\u201d and we express no opinion on that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b301-6\"> Again, the uncertainty about our standard of review does not prevent us from resolving this issue. Even assuming that \u201cpurpose\u201d is a question of fact and that we must defer to the trial court\u2019s finding if it is supported by the record, the trial court \u201cfound\u201d that defendant\u2019s purpose was in part to \u201cown up to\u201d his criminal conduct, and the record supports that view.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
