For that conduct he was convicted, following a jury trial, of attempted second-degree assault and fourth-degree assault. Defendant asked the sentencing court to merge those convictions, arguing that attempted second-degree assault and fourth-degree assault were alternate theories of guilt involving the same conduct and that fourth-degree assault was a lesser-included offense of attempted second-degree assault. The court denied that request and entered a judgment reflecting separate convictions for the two offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Defendant renews his argument on appeal, urging that the fourth-degree assault count was merely an alternative theory of guilt and was a lesser-included offense of the attempted second-degree assault charge. Defendant also argues that, because attempted second-degree assault is a lesser-included offense of second-degree assault and, because fourth-degree assault is a lesser-included offense of second-degree assault, fourth-degree assault must be a lesser-included offense of attempted second-degree assault. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>follows, he reasons, that his convictions should merge. The state replies that this case is controlled by our decision in <em>State v. O\u2019Hara, </em>152 Or App 765, 955 P2d 313, <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 305 (1998). We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">The so-called \u201canti-merger\u201d statute, ORS 161.067(1), provides that, \u201c[w]hen the same conduct or criminal episode violates two or more statutory provisions and each provision requires proof of an element that the others do not, there are as many separately punishable offenses as there are separate statutory violations.\u201d Under that statute, for a single criminal act or criminal episode to give rise to more than one statutory violation, three requirements must be satisfied: (1) the defendant must have engaged in acts that are \u201cthe same criminal conduct or episode\u201d; (2) the defendant\u2019s acts must have violated two or more \u201cstatutory provisions\u201d; and (3) each \u201cstatutory provision\u201d must require \u201cproof of an element that the others do not.\u201d <em>State v. Crotsley, </em>308 Or 272, 278, 779 P2d 600 (1989) (quoting <em>former </em>ORS 161.062(1) (1985), <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 1999, ch 136, \u00a7 1, the nearly identical precursor to ORS 161.067(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The indictment in this case alleged that defendant \u201cdid unlawfully and intentionally attempt to cause serious physical injury to [the victim]\u201d and thus committed attempted second-degree assault. In a separate count, the indictment alleged that defendant \u201cunlawfully and intentionally cause[d] physical injury to [the victim]\u201d and had thus committed fourth-degree assault. We held in <em>O\u2019Hara </em>that convictions for assault and attempted assault do not merge because each of those offenses includes an element that the other does not. In that case, the defendant was convicted of attempted first-degree assault and second-degree assault. He argued that his convictions should merge because second-degree assault is a lesser-included offense of attempted first-degree assault. 152 Or App at 767. We disagreed, holding that, under ORS 161.067(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">\u201cHad defendant been convicted of <em>assault </em>in the first degree, rather than <em>attempted </em>assault in the first degree, his argument would have merit, because to act intentionally presupposes acting knowingly, and to inflict <em>serious </em>physical injury presupposes physical injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>\u201cAn attempt conviction, however, does not require defendant to have <em>caused </em>serious injury, only that he have <em>intended </em>to cause such injury. In other words, although he intended to complete the greater offense, he was able only to complete the lesser. But in order to complete the lesser offense, he had to fulfill an element, actual injury, that was not present in the greater offense. Thus, the same conduct constituted two separate crimes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">152 Or App at 768-69 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">That analysis also applies here. In this case, in order to convict defendant of attempted second-degree assault, the jury had to find that defendant had intentionally attempted to cause serious physical injury to the victim. By contrast, to convict defendant of fourth-degree assault, the jury had to find only that defendant had intentionally caused physical injury to the victim. Thus, defendant\u2019s conviction for attempted second-degree assault required the jury to find that defendant had attempted to cause serious physical injury, an element not included in fourth-degree assault. The trial court properly refused to merge the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-7\"> ORS 161.405(1) provides that, \u2018\u2018[a] person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime when the person intentionally engages in conduct which constitutes a substantial step toward commission of the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">ORS 163.175, which defines the crime of second-degree assault, provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-9\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of assault in the second degree if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-10\">\u201c(a) Intentionally or knowingly causes serious physical injury to another!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-11\">ORS 163.160 provides, in part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-12\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of assault in the fourth degree if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-13\">\u201c(a) Intentionally, knowingly or recklessly causes physical injury to another!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
