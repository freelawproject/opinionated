J.</author>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Defendant, who was convicted on charges of driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII), ORS 813.010, and failure to appear on a criminal citation, ORS 133.076, appeals. She assigns error to (1) the trial court\u2019s failure to give a requested jury instruction defining \u201cdriving\u201d and (2) the admission of defendant\u2019s bench warrant as substantive evidence with respect to the failure to appear charge. Specifically, with respect to the latter, defendant contends that the bench warrant was not admissible under the \u201cpublic records\u201d exception to the hearsay rule, OEC 803(8),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that its admission violated defendant\u2019s right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">With respect to the first assignment of error, defendant requested that the court give the following \u201cspecial jury instruction\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">\u201cDEFINITION</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">\u201cDriving \u2014 Steering, or otherwise controlling the direction, of a motor vehicle that is in motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">(Boldface in original.) The state objected to that proposed instruction, and the court ultimately declined to give the instruction. <em>Before </em>the jury was instructed, defendant \u201cexcepted\u201d to that failure. However, defense counsel took no exception <em>after </em>the jury was instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">ORCP 59 H(l) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-10\">\u201cA party may not obtain review on appeal of an asserted error by a trial court in * * * giving or refusing to give an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>instruction to a jury unless the party who seeks to appeal identified the asserted error to the trial court <em>and made a notation of exception immediately after the court instructed the jury.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">(Emphasis added.) The emphasized language is explicit and unambiguous. Because defense counsel failed to make \u201ca notation of exception immediately after the court instructed the jury,\u201d the matter was not preserved for our review. <em>See, e.g., Cestaro v. State of Oregon, </em>229 Or App 8, 14, 209 P3d 851 (2009) (\u201cORCP 59 H is very clear in its requirement that, for this court to review on appeal any asserted error in a jury instruction, the party asserting the error must have taken exception to the instruction, either orally or in writing, immediately <em>after </em>the jury was instructed.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\"> Defendant asserts that, notwithstanding the strictures of ORCP 59 H, the purported error in this case is nevertheless reviewable as \u201can error of law apparent on the face of the record.\u201d ORAP 5.45(1). To be sure, ORCP 59 H does not, by its terms, completely preclude all plain error-based review of purported instructional error. <em>See, e.g., State v. Toth, </em>213 Or App 505, 509-10, 162 P3d 317 (2007); <em>State v. Pervish, </em>202 Or App 442, 123 P3d 285 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 308 (2006). However, the exceptions to the broad preclusive sweep of ORCP 59 H are narrowly circumstantially circumscribed. <em>Id. </em>This case does not present such a circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\"><em>Toth </em>is illustrative. There, the defendant, for the first time on appeal, \u201cchallenge[d] the legal sufficiency of one of the jury instructions pertaining to the finding of persistent involvement.\u201d 213 Or App at 507. The defendant acknowledged that that challenge had not been raised before the trial court but contended, over the state\u2019s invocation of the strictures of ORCP 59 H, that the matter was nevertheless subject to review as \u201cplain error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508-09. We concluded that: (1) in the peculiar circumstances of that case, ORCP 59 H did not preclude \u201cplain error\u201d review, <em>id. </em>at 509-10; but (2) the purported error did not satisfy the requisites of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>review, <em>id. </em>at 510-14. With respect to the former conclusion, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-4\">\u201cOn its face, the rule appears to apply when a party asserts for the first time on appeal that a trial court erred in \u2018giving or refusing to give\u2019 an instruction. It thus would bar review of an unpreserved objection regarding an instruction in two possible situations \u2014 first, when the court delivered an instruction that a party later contends was erroneous; and second, when the court refused to deliver an instruction that a party requested. By its terms, the rule does not appear to apply when the asserted error is that the trial court failed to deliver an instruction that was <em>not </em>requested but that a party later contends was required by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">\u201cConsistent with what the bare wording of the rule suggests, our cases have held that ORCP 59 H does not preclude review of a trial court\u2019s failure to deliver an instruction that was not requested but that the law nevertheless requires. [Citing <em>Pervish] * * </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">\u201c* * * [The defendant] argues in this case that, although the instructions that the trial court delivered to the jury were correct as far as they went, they were incomplete in that they failed to refine the meaning of\u2018persistent involvement\u2019 by explaining that the jury was required to make subsidiary findings. As in <em>Pervish, </em>we are not precluded from reviewing that contention by ORCP 59 H.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 509-10 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">This case does not fall within the limited exception identified in <em>Toth. </em>Rather, consistently with <em>Toth, </em>ORCP 59 H bars appellate review, precluding \u201cplain error\u201d review, \u201cwhen the court refused to deliver an instruction that a party requested.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 509. <em>That </em>is the circumstance here. Accordingly, the asserted error is unreviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">In her second assignment of error, defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s admission of a bench warrant as substantive evidence of her alleged failure to appear. Defendant\u2019s arguments in that regard are materially indistinguishable from those that we recently addressed in <em>State v. Carter, </em>238 Or App 417, 241 P3d 1205 (2010), and we reject them for the reasons expressed in <em>Carter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b66-11\"> As pertinent here, OEC 803 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-12\">\u201cThe following are not excluded by ORS 40.455, even though the declarant is available as a witness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-13\">\u00ab# * <em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-14\">\u201c(8) Records, reports, statements or data compilations, in any form, of public offices or agencies, including federally recognized American Indian tribal governments, setting forth:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-15\">\u201c(a) The activities of the office or agency!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b66-16\"> The Sixth Amendment provides, in pertinent part, \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b67-7\"> ORCP 59 H applies to criminal trials.
