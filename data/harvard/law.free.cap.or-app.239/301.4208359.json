Defendant was convicted following a jury trial, and the trial court merged defendant\u2019s convictions for first-degree unlawful sexual penetration and third-degree sexual abuse. Defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a mistrial. Defendant moved for a mistrial after a witness gave testimony, which, defendant argued, was inadmissible hearsay. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion and instead struck the witness\u2019s testimony from the record and instructed the jury to disregard it. Defendant argues that that ruling was an abuse of discretion. A discussion of defendant\u2019s assignment of error would not benefit the bench, bar, or public. It suffices to say that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it chose to strike the witness\u2019s testimony and instruct the jury to disregard it, rather than grant defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The state has cross-appealed, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s decision to merge defendant\u2019s convictions for first-degree unlawful sexual penetration and third-degree sexual abuse. Defendant concedes that the trial court erred in merging his convictions; we conclude that that concession is well founded, and we accept it.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Affirmed on appeal.
