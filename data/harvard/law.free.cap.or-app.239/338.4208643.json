Plaintiff alleged that defendant had misrepresented that the house was of sound quality and character and had failed to disclose the material defect that the basement leaked. <em>See </em>ORS 646.608(l)(e), (t). After a bench trial, the court awarded plaintiff $12,266.96 in damages. On appeal, defendant assigns error to (1) the trial court\u2019s denial of her ORCP 54 B(2) motion to dismiss plaintiffs claim, which asserted that the house had not been purchased for personal, household, or family purposes and, thus, that the sale to plaintiff was not subject to the UTPA; (2) its denial of defendant\u2019s motion to strike plaintiffs damages because plaintiff had not presented evidence at trial of the difference between the price paid for the house as represented and the value of the house as sold; and (3) its conclusion that defendant had violated the UTPA, because plaintiff had not presented evidence to support a finding that defendant knew when she sold the house that the basement leaked. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">We relate the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff, who prevailed at trial. <em>Rathgeber v. James Hemenway, Inc., </em>176 Or App 135, 137, 30 P3d 1200 (2001), <em>aff'd, </em>335 Or 404, 69 P3d 710 (2003). In June 2006, plaintiff received a telephone call from a friend, Tillford, who worked for defendant. Tillford knew that plaintiff was interested in purchasing a home in north Portland, so he called to tell plaintiff that defendant was selling a house in the Kenton neighborhood in north Portland.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Tillford told plaintiff that defendant had \u201ca couple other prospective buyers waiting to purchase the property if [he] wasn\u2019t interested\u201d and communicated \u201ca sense of urgency about [plaintiffs] need to inspect and make a decision on the property that day.\u201d Eight months before receiving Tillford\u2019s telephone call, plaintiff had purchased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>the home in northeast Portland in which he was then living. Nonetheless, plaintiff was interested in purchasing the Kenton house because he had a number of friends who lived in the Kenton neighborhood, which made living in that area attractive to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">Accordingly, plaintiff inspected the house on the day of the call and was accompanied by his friend Smith. When they arrived at the house, plaintiff encountered two men \u201cdoing some sheet rock repairs in the basement * * * near [a] sump pump.\u201d Plaintiff asked one of the men \u201cwhat the sump pump was for.\u201d The worker responded \u201cthat he didn\u2019t know anything\u201d and that plaintiff would need to ask defendant questions about the property. Plaintiff\u2019s inspection of the property confirmed the basic characteristics of the house that Tillford had described, and later that day he went to defendant\u2019s office \u201cto fill out paperwork\u201d for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Before going to defendant\u2019s office, plaintiff sought the advice of Smith and another friend, Frisch, about \u201cpossibly selling [his] current property[,] moving into the Kenton neighborhood[,]\u201d and purchasing defendant\u2019s property. Smith recalled that, during his conversation with plaintiff, plaintiff explained to him that \u201che was looking for another place to live, [because] a lot of his * * * friends[ and] associates[ ] lived in that part of town and he was interested in moving to a different location.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Similarly, Frisch remembered speaking with plaintiff at the time and plaintiff stating that he \u201cwas looking at purchasing an investment home, another home.\u201d Specifically, Frisch recalled that plaintiff had said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-7\">\u201chis intent was that he would move into that house and refurbish, remodel, reconstruct, upgrade if you want to call it that, and sell the house that he was currently living in in northeast Portland, and pull the equity out of that home that he had done the same thing, gone in, fixed up, refloored, put hard wood floorings in, and then subsequently do the same thing to the other house, into the new house, live in it and fix it up.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">In addition, Frisch \u201cadvised [plaintiff], don\u2019t do anything as an impulse buy. And, you know, I thought at that time two years ago the housing market was overpriced, over-inflated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>and the bubble was bursting.\u201d Plaintiff also remembered that conversation with Frisch and how Frisch</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-4\">\u201cadvised me that the market was declining, and, you know, as an investment- \u2014 -just as an investment property, it probably was not that great of an investment. And that\u2019s when we got into a conversation, you know, about my interest in living in the Kenton neighborhood, and the fact that I had other friends in that neighborhood. And he thought that, you know, as a residence that it would be a good option, because it was a smaller square footage [and] I was a single guyU\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">After speaking with Smith and Frisch, plaintiff went to defendant\u2019s office to discuss the details of the transaction. Among the details that they discussed was the condition and history of the house. According to plaintiff, he asked defendant if there had been any water leaks in the basement, and she replied that there had not been any water leaks and that the sump pump in the basement was just precautionary. Unbeknownst to plaintiff, defendant previously had sold the house to another person, Saenguraiporn, who had experienced several water leaks in the basement after heavy rainfall during the winter of 2005-06. After making various attempts to fix the leaks, and discussions with defendant about the problem, Saenguraiporn had decided that she wanted out of the purchase contract, and defendant had taken the house back. In spring 2006, defendant hired a contractor, Ross, to fix the leaking basement. Ross took several actions to fix the leak, including pouring a cement sidewalk on the side of the house, building a French drain, and installing a sump pump in the basement.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">At the conclusion of plaintiffs meeting with defendant and Tillford, plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with defendant and secured a five-year option to purchase the property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Soon thereafter, plaintiff began making improvements to the property, including adding new landscaping, hanging new window blinds, installing cedar shakes on the front of the house, and completing numerous repairs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>around the house. In August 2006, plaintiff listed the house for sale at a price roughly $50,000 higher than the price set in his option to purchase it, apparently not realizing that, at that time, the house was not his to sell. In October 2006, after realizing that he \u201cdidn\u2019t really have all the rights * * * on the property,\u201d plaintiff contacted defendant and exercised his purchase option. Plaintiff testified that, in a discussion with defendant before purchasing the house, he told her that \u201cI wanted to leave my options open. I was somewhat undecided when I purchased the house exactly what I was going to be doing with it. I let [defendant] know that my intent either was to rent it, possibly sell it, or to live in it potentially.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">One month later, heavy November rains arrived and caused significant water leaks to develop in the basement. Plaintiff attempted to make adjustments to the sump pump to alleviate the flooding, but the leaking continued. In December 2006, plaintiff again listed the house for sale and informed potential buyers in the listing that the \u201c[b]asement needs work to keep dry. Bid for sealing and mold clean up is at the house on kitchen counter. Bid came in under $3200 to cure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Plaintiff made only one payment on his purchase contract and stopped making payments after discovering the water leak in the basement. In May 2007, defendant filed a declaration of forfeiture of the purchase contract and reclaimed possession of the property. Subsequently, plaintiff filed a UTPA claim against defendant, asserting that he had entered into the purchase contract for the house based on defendant\u2019s misrepresentations of the property\u2019s history and characteristics and defendant\u2019s failure to disclose the basement leak. After a bench trial, plaintiff was awarded the full amount of his requested damages, which included the costs of his improvements to the property and associated labor, the down payment and escrow fees, and the payments made on the lease agreement and purchase contract. Defendant timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">We begin by addressing defendant\u2019s first assignment of error. Defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying her ORCP 54 B(2) motion to dismiss plaintiffs claim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>because plaintiff failed to present sufficient evidence to support a finding that he had purchased the house \u201cfor personal, family or household purposes,\u201d ORS 646.605(6), and, thus, that the sale of the house was a consumer transaction subject to the UTPA. On appeal of a denial of an ORCP 54 B(2) motion to dismiss a claim, we review the entire record to determine whether sufficient evidence was presented to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case on the applicable claim, \u201c[vjiewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from it in the light most favorable to plaintiff.\u201d <em>Thorson v. Dept. of Justice, </em>171 Or App 704, 709, 710, 15 P3d 1005 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">As relevant to this case, a person violates the UTPA</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">\u201cwhen in the course of the person\u2019s business, vocation or occupation the person * * *:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">\u201c(e) Represents that real estate, goods or services have * * * characteristics, ingredients, uses, benefits, quantities or qualities that they do not have * * *[; or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">\u201c(t) Concurrent with tender or delivery of any real estate, goods or services fails to disclose any known material defect or material nonconformity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">ORS 646.608(l)(e), (t). In turn, \u201creal estate, goods or services\u201d are defined as \u201cthose which are or may be obtained <em>primarily for personal, family or household purposes[.]\u201d </em>ORS 646.605(6) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\"> As explained by the Supreme Court in <em>Searle v. Exley Express, </em>278 Or 535, 540, 564 P2d 1054 (1977), \u201c[i]f goods are customarily bought by a substantial number of purchasers for personal, family or household uses and were, in fact, bought by the plaintiff for his or someone else\u2019s use and not for resale, the [UTPA] applies.\u201d Thus, <em>Searle </em>embodies a two-part test: Is the real estate, good, or service at issue customarily purchased by a substantial number of people for personal, family, or household use (the objective component) and was it, in fact, purchased by the plaintiff for personal, family, or household use, rather than for commercial use or resale (the subjective component). A residential home is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>undoubtedly real estate that is customarily bought by a substantial number of people for personal, family, or household use. Thus, plaintiff easily satisfies the objective component of the <em>Searle </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">The question remains whether plaintiff satisfied the subjective component. If plaintiff failed to present any evidence that, at the time of purchase in October 2006, he, <em>in fact, </em>bought the house for personal use, then the transaction is not within the scope of the UTPA, and the trial court should have granted defendant\u2019s ORCP 54 B(2) motion to dismiss plaintiffs UTPA claim. Thus, our task reduces to determining whether any evidence was presented at trial that plaintiff purchased the house intending to make personal use of it. We conclude that such evidence was presented at trial and, hence, that the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">In particular, we look to Smith\u2019s testimony about the conversation that he had with plaintiff on the day that they inspected the house. Plaintiffs counsel asked Smith if plaintiff had told him how plaintiff intended to use the house. Smith responded that plaintiff had \u201cmentioned that he was looking for another place to live, a lot of his friends and things \u2014 his friends, associates, lived in that part of town and he was interested in moving to a different location, was my understanding.\u201d From that testimony, a factfinder could reasonably infer that plaintiff did in fact intend to make personal use of the house when he purchased it in October 2006. In light of our standard of review of the denial of a ORCP 54 B(2) motion to dismiss, it does not matter that other evidence was presented that shows that plaintiff was equivocating about his intended use of the property. Rather, Smith\u2019s testimony is sufficient to defeat defendant\u2019s motion, because it is evidence from which a factfinder could reasonably infer that, at the time of purchase, plaintiff acquired the house primarily for personal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">We turn to defendant\u2019s third assignment of error, which also fails. Plaintiff made two allegations under the UTPA: (1) defendant \u201cfailed to disclose [a] material defect,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>that the basement leaked \u2014 an allegation based on ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>646.608(l)(t); and (2) plaintiff entered into the purchase contract in reliance on defendant\u2019s \u201cfalse representations\u201d about the \u201csound quality and characteristic\u201d of the home \u2014 an allegation based on ORS 646.608(l)(e). Defendant argues in her third assignment of error that the trial court erred in concluding that defendant had violated the UTPA. Specifically, she contends that, because there was no evidence presented at trial that defendant knew when she tendered delivery of the house that the basement leaked, plaintiff failed to establish that defendant had violated ORS 646.608(l)(t) by failing to disclose a material defect. As the following discussion explains, we conclude that defendant\u2019s third assignment of error fails because she cannot establish, on this record, that the trial court relied on a violation of ORS 646.608(l)(t) in rendering its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">At the close of plaintiffs case, defendant moved to strike plaintiffs allegation of misrepresentation under ORS 646.608(l)(e), arguing that plaintiff had failed to present evidence that he had relied on the alleged misrepresentations about the sound quality and character of the house. The trial court denied that motion. Notably, although defendant\u2019s counsel expressed his belief that \u201cthe only evidence that [plaintiff] adduced was for an intentional misrepresentation[,]\u201d defendant did not make a separate motion to strike plaintiffs allegation that defendant had violated ORS 646.608(l)(t) by failing to disclose a material defect \u2014 that the basement leaked. Defendant\u2019s sole contention in her third assignment of error is that there was insufficient evidence for the trial court to find liability under ORS 646.608(l)(t). For that to be error, defendant must show that the trial court, in fact, relied on ORS 646.608(l)(t) in reaching its verdict. On this record, defendant simply cannot show that.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">First, defendant did not move to strike plaintiffs allegation, based on ORS 646.608(l)(t), that defendant had failed to disclose that the basement leaked and, thus, did not ask the trial court for a legal ruling on whether sufficient evidence had been presented to support that allegation. Second, the trial court\u2019s general judgment did not differentiate between the two UTPA allegations and explain whether and how it relied on the different provisions; rather, the judgment simply stated that the court \u201creturned a verdict in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>plaintiff on his First Claim for Relief, Unlawful Trade Practices.\u201d Accordingly, defendant\u2019s third assignment of error fails because defendant cannot show that the trial court erred by relying on a violation of ORS 646.608(l)(t) as the basis for its verdict.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Finally, we address defendant\u2019s second assignment of error, which is that the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to strike plaintiffs damages and in entering judgment for $12,266.96. At the close of plaintiffs case, defendant moved to strike \u201call of the damages\u201d because, according to defendant, the proper measure of actual damages under the UTPA for the sale of property is the difference between the value of the property as represented and its actual value. Defendant asserted that plaintiff had not presented any evidence of such a difference in value and, thus, that plaintiffs damages were limited to the statutory minimum of $200 if defendant was found to have violated the UTPA. Defendant further asserted, as we understand her argument, that plaintiff \u201cpled and proved * * * rescission damages,\u201d which she maintained are not available under the UTPA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>Defendant renews those arguments on appeal, and, for the reasons that follow, we reject them.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>The UTPA provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\">\u201cany person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of willful use or employment by another person of a method, act or practice declared unlawful by ORS 646.608, may bring an individual action in an appropriate court to recover <em>actual damages </em>or $200, whichever is greater.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">ORS 646.638(1) (emphasis added). As we have previously explained, the legislative history of the 1971 enactment of ORS 646.638 demonstrates that the \u201cactual damages\u201d provision of the statute serves \u201cto provide for \u2018restitution,\u2019 i.e., restitution for economic loss suffered by a consumer as the result of a deceptive trade practice.\u201d <em>Gross-Haentjens v. Tharp, </em>38 Or App 313, 317, 589 P2d 1209 (1979). <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, \u201cORS 646.656 provides that the remedies specified in the [UTPA] are in addition to all other civil remedies existing at common law. This indicates legislative intent to create a special remedy <em>different </em>from those that exist at common law.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Raudebaugh v. Action Pest Control, Inc., </em>59 Or App 166, 171, 650 P2d 1006 (1982) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the UTPA provides an independent means for plaintiffs to obtain damages that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>provide restitution for ascertainable losses caused by a defendant\u2019s unlawful trade practice. We understand that to be true even when, as here, the purchaser relinquishes the property but does not do so by an express rescission of the contract. Thus, contrary to defendant\u2019s understanding of how \u201cactual damages\u201d must be assessed under the UTPA, plaintiff could, and did, properly claim damages reflecting the money that he had paid to defendant and the money that he had spent on improvements to the house as a result of defendant\u2019s misrepresentations. Defendant\u2019s proposed method for assessing damages would be appropriate if plaintiff had kept the house, but is inapposite here where he has relinquished possession of the home to defendant. <em>See, e.g., Martin v. Cahill, </em>90 Or App 332, 336, 752 P2d 857 (1988) (noting that, where plaintiff maintained possession of the real property in dispute, damages under the UTPA are assessed as the \u201cdifference between the value of the property as it was represented to be and as it is\u201d). Consequently, the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to strike all of plaintiffs alleged damages other than the statutory minimum damages of $200.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b366-6\"> All references to the UTPA are to the 2005 version.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b366-7\"> Defendant owns some 60 rental homes in the Portland area and sometimes will \u201cbuy, fix up and resell properties as well.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b368-8\"> Plaintiff testified that he did not realize that the lease agreement and the option to purchase \u201cdidn\u2019t give me full ownership of the property\u201d and, instead, thought that he was buying the house when he signed the purchase option agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b373-5\"> We recognize that defendant asserted in closing argument that no evidence had been presented from which to find that defendant knew when she sold the house that the basement leaked and, thus, had failed to disclose a material defect in violation of ORS 646.608(l)(t). Accordingly, the situation might be different if the trial court\u2019s judgment <em>had </em>relied on a violation of ORS 646.608(l)(t) as thebasis for its verdict, because, in that posture, defendant\u2019s closing argument might have been sufficient to preserve her third assignment of error. <em>See State v. Andrews, </em>174 Or App 354, 357-58, 27 P3d 137 (2001) (noting that, in a court trial, a \u201cmatter of law\u201d-like contention can be adequately preserved by closing argument to that effect), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by State v. Rutley, </em>202 Or App 639, 645, 123 P3d 334 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Alternatively, we also note that, even if defendant <em>had </em>moved to strike plaintiff\u2019s ORS 646.608(l)(t) allegation and the court <em>had </em>erred in denying that motion, defendant still would not he entitled to reversal and a new trial in light of the court\u2019s general verdict for plaintiff. <em>Shoup v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>335 Or 164, 174-79, 61 P3d 928 (2003). That is because sufficient evidence exists to support plaintiffs ORS 646.608(l)(e) allegation that defendant had misrepresented the quality and characteristics of the house. <em>See Shoup, </em>335 Or at 176, 178-79, 179 n 6 (\u201c[Ajppellate courts * * * may not apply the \u2018we can\u2019t tell\u2019 rule to order a new trial in a case involving a judgment on a general verdict based on multiple specifications, one of which is invalid, if there is evidence to support another, valid specification.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b373-7\"> The purpose of rescission of a contract \u201cis to unwind the transaction and to put the parties in the same position they would have been in if the transaction had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>not been entered into \u2014 so far as possible.\u201d <em>Daugherty v.

Johnson had headed a committee that had drafted that version of the bill, and he testified that the 1971 bill creating the modern version of the UTPA was necessary, among other reasons, because \u201cprivate individuals who are aggrieved by [a] deceptive trade practice should have some way of attaining restitution.\u201d Testimony, House Committee on Judiciary, HB 1088, Feb 10, 1971, Ex 3 (statement of Lee Johnson in Consumer Protection Act Proposal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b374-13\"> Furthermore, ORS 646.636 provides that</p>\n<p id=\"b374-14\">\u201c!t]he court may make such additional orders or judgments as may be necessary to restore to any person in interest any moneys or property, real or personal, of which the person was deprived by means of any practice declared to be unlawful in ORS 646.607 or 646.608, or as may be necessary to ensure cessation of unlawful trade practices.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b375-5\"> Defendant asserts in a footnote in her reply brief that, if plaintiffhad made a claim for rescission, defendant would be entitled to offset any damages awarded on that basis by the amount of the rental value of the house.
