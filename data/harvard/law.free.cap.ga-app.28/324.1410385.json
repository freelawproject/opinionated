The ground' of demurrer specifically relied on in the demurrant\u2019s brief in this court was that compliance with the statute of frauds was not shown by the petition, and that no fact was alleged that would take the case out of the statute. From the petition it appears that the alleged orders were written in duplicate forms signed only by initials of the plaintiff\u2019s \u201c representative,\u201d who it was alleged sold the goods, and were for a total of 100 coils of \u201c5/16 Bagdad Cot.

It is alleged that the defendant declined to cancel the orders. It is alleged also that \u201cthe acknowledgment . . in writing of said orders . .' by the defendant in seeking a cancellation of the same became and was a contract between petitioner and the defendant whereby petitioner contracted to sell to the defendant and the defendant contracted to buy from petitioner 100 coils of 5/16 inch Bagdad cotton rope at and for the price of 49-% cents per pound,\u201d etc. The defendant contended that the orders were not identified by these letters and that an essential element of a contract of sale \u2014 the price \u2014 was not fixed in writing, no price being mentioned in the letters, and the price figures \u201c 49-%,\u201d without the word \u201c cents,\u201d or any other indication of their meaning, not being sufficient to show that they meant 49-% cents per pound as alleged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-7\">By amendment the plaintiff alleged that no verbal or written order other than those mentioned was given to it by the defendant, and set out the plaintiff\u2019s letter to the defendant, stating that the defendant\u2019s \u201c order for 100 tubes Bagdad cotton rope has been entered.
