These patents disclose vehicle tires having tread elements or lugs disposed in the form of chevrons, the overall appearance of the tread exhibiting a herringbone effect. The lugs are distinguished by having tapered sides which feature appears to be particularly disclosed by Hale; * * *. The patents to Smith and Bigelow have been cited primarily to show that aircraft tires of the pre-rotating type are well known and that it is common practice to supply them with transversely disposed peripheral ribs or lugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-30\">\u201cIt is the Examiner\u2019s position that the design here claimed is substantially the same in appearance as that shown in each of the four mentioned patents, the difference therebetween being minor and such as to involve only the expected skill of the routine designer.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-31\">This court is in complete accord with the views stated in the above quotation and deems it unnecessary to add thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-32\">Appellant made no appearance nor was he represented by counsel during the oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>argument of this case before us. In his one-page brief filed in this court, appellant stated that he preferred to \u201clet the merits of the Design stand on its own individual presentation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">A careful study of the record and the cited prior art brings us to the conclusion that the decision of the Board of Appeals was correct. That decision is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
