The corner member has a fist top- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>and sides, with a curved portion connecting the top with the outer side. One of the end collars is relatively large and is provided with a round, tapered, webbed boss on its outer surface.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-5\">\u201cThe Examiner points out that the instant design differs from the elected design by disclosing a relatively larger cylindrical collar with a round, tapered, webbed boss on its outer surface, whereas the elected design discloses the form of the corresponding end in broken lines and hence is unessential. * * * It is his opinion that to add such a collar for the one illustrated in dotted lines would not produce any unexpected or unobvious appearance and would not require invention.' He also contends that the difference due to the merging of the edges of the corner member with one end collar is a minor detail, and does not create any unexpected distinctive appearance in the design.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">The board sustained the action of the examiner on the ground of rejection herein-before explained. The comparable general view between appellant\u2019s elected design and his claimed design which we have considered in the instant appeal compels us to conclude that no error was made in the decision of the board from which the instant appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">It is noted that the appealed claim was further rejected as not patentable over appellant\u2019s elected application in view of certain prior art references. We consider that no useful purpose would be served here by a discussion of that rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">For the reasons stated, the decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
