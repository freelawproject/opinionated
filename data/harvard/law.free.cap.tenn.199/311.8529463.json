Mr. Todd was 51 years old and had worked for many years as a farmer in Sumner County, Tennessee. He had come to Nashville and gone to work for the Nashville Bridge Company about a week before his death. His health was good so far as known by any one, his wife having testified that he had never complained of any heart trouble and he had been given a physical examination by the Nashville Bridge Company upon beginning his employment there and apparently was in good health.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">His work was that of a scraper on the inside of the compartments of the river barges. These barges are divided up into several compartments with one manhole opening into each compartment and these holds are about 12 feet deep. Since there is but one hole in each compartment the company provided a 20-inch fan at each of these openings which fan forced air down into same so as to ventilate it. These barges are made of steel and the evidence shows, and it is a commonly known physical fact that the temperature inside the compartment on warm days especially, would be higher than the outside temperature. There were several men on this day, May 20, 1953, working in this same compartment with Mr. Todd. They were scraping the inside of the steel barge preparatory to painting same. The evidence shows that the outside temperature that day was 82 degrees but there is no showing what the inside temperature was.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>' Deceased worked from 7:00 o \u2019clock in the morning until noon without any trouble. After he had eaten his lunch, which the witnesses testified he had brought, along with him, and which consisted of some bologna sausage, he became sick about 2:30 or 3:00 p. m., and said that his stomach was cramping. His co-workers tried to get him to leave the hold and go to the hospital but he declined to do so and said he- would be all right. They turned the fan on him and he remained in the hold until quitting* time at 3:30 p. m., when he left the barge under his own power.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">After the foreman had checked out at some indefinite time after 3:30 o\u2019clock, he found Mr. Todd lying on the steps in a yard just off a street which was on his way to his son\u2019s home where he had been living. An ambulance was called and he was taken to the hospital but was dead upon arrival, and the death certificate shows cause of death unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The fundamental basis of petitioner\u2019s claim to the right of recovery is that the working conditions were such as that Todd was working in a temperature well over 100 degrees and that since he was not accustomed to working under those conditions he became sick as a result of it, which brought about heat stroke, heat exhaustion or a heart attack of some kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">His Honor, the Trial Judge rendered a very brief opinion which is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">\u201cTo ease your mind I have marked off heat-stroke, sun-stroke, heat exhaustion. In my mind, whether or not the condition there caused this thrombosis, or thrombus, that is what was already there, nobody knew it was there, got in the blood stream, got in the heart and stopped it, got in the coronary artery or aorta.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>\u201c (Further argument by Mr. Harbison.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-4\">\u201cThe Court: There must be some positive proof. You can\u2019t speculate. The law is \u2014 I must lean toward the injured person. I am afraid I am g\u2019oing to have to decide in favor of these people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">\u201cMr. Harbison: Would your Honor state upon what theory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">\u2018 \u2018 The Court: I have already done so. I thought it was a coronary trouble, anything in the circulation. Anything that came from the heart is circulation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">\u201cMr. Harbison: Note exception.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">The trouble with petitioner\u2019s theory and case is, however, that there is positively no evidence as to excessive heat. All that the proof shows is that outside temperature was 82 degrees on this day and that inside the hold it was some undetermined degree warmer and that a fan forced in fresh air, but there is no proof that Mr. Todd was too hot. In fact, the only witnesses who testified stated just the opposite. For example: \u2014 Ernest Woodward (r. 43) testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">\u201cA. He said his stomach was hurting and I tried to get him to come out and get some air and we turned the fan on him. He didn\u2019t seem to be too hot. I was not hot myself. He didn\u2019t seem to be hot. I tried to get him to come out about 2:30 and he wouldn\u2019t come out. He said he thought he would be all right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-10\">\u201cQ. Did he say why he wouldn\u2019t? A. No, he wouldn\u2019t come out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-11\">\u201cQ. Did you put the fan on him just the same? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">The same witness testified (r. 52) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-13\">\u201cQ. Did you ever know anybody getting too hot over there? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>\u201cQ. Ton have had no heat strokes there since yon have been there? A. No \u2014 not that I know of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">\u201cQ. None that yon know of? A. That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">\u201cQ. Bert didn\u2019t complain of being dizzy or having a headache, did he? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">\u201cQ. He didn\u2019t complain of being too hot? A. No, he said he was not too hot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-8\">\u201cQ. He said he was not too hot? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\">\u201cQ. Yon were not too hot? A. No, I was hotter even than he was, and I was not too hot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-10\">\u201cQ. Yon had worked all dnring the hot snmmer of 1952? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-11\">\u201cQ. Yon have been in there on hotter days than this? A. Yes, sir, I am telling yon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-12\">\u201cQ. Before and since? A. That is right. It has been hotter than this day was. I have been in them holds when it was 108 in the shade.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-13\">\u201cQ. Yon never knew of anybody to have a heat stroke? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-14\">\u2018 \u2018 Q. Yon just knew to come ont of there if it got too hot? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-15\">The only other witness testifying on the point was Harland Perry (r. 80) who testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-16\">\u201cQ. Mr. Perry, Mr. Todd never complained that he was too hot, did he? A. He didn\u2019t say whether he was too hot or what. He jnst said his stomach was bothering him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-17\">\u201cQ. His stomach was bothering him? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-18\">\u201cQ. He didn\u2019t complain of heat down there? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-19\">\u201cThe Court: \u2014 He didn\u2019t know whether he was hot or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-20\">\u201cBy Mr. Harbison: \u2014 He didncomplain about the heat? A. He didn\u2019t say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>\u201cQ. All of you were sweating some down there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-4\">A. Yes, we were sweatirig some.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">While there is evidence to the effect that one who was not accnstomed to working in those holds when the heat is excessive, is likely to be affected by the excessive heat more so than men who have been accnstomed to it for an appreciable length of time, the proof is wholly lacking that the heat conditions were excessive on this day.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">It seems perfectly obvions then that the Company would not be responsible for the deceased becoming sick from some other canse than the heat where he was working. It is a fact too well known by everybody that a person may suddenly have a stomach up-set from something he has eaten or some temporary up-set or failure of a bodily function to operate that is not due to the external conditions at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">The petitioner relies upon answers given by the two doctors who testified to hypothetical questions put to them by counsel for petitioner. These questions were in .part predicated upon the theory of the excessive heat conditions in the hold and, therefore, in view of what we have said above, the answers given by the doctors become irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">Counsel for the defendants have dwelt forcibly on the proposition that the cause of death was wholly speculative. In view of what we have said above it is unnecessary to prolong this opinion by a discussion of that proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">It is our conclusion, therefore, that there is no evidence.to sustain the finding of the Trial Judge and, therefore, the judgment below is reversed and the petition is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
