Camper </em>v. <em>Pollard, </em>189 Tenn. 86, 222 S. W. (2d) 374. There this Court held that the statute does not provide for a hearing upon the question of whether an application for a permit shall be granted or refused. In that case it was the applicant for a permit who sought a hearing. It would seem to follow necessarily that if a person directly interested as an applicant for a permit is not entitled to a hearing that neither would one be so entitled whose interest is simply that of the citizen. The discretion vested in the Beer Committee is very broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\"><em> </em>Further, with reference to the complaint that the Beer Committee issued the permit in spite of the resolution of the County Court, it is said in the cited case, 189 Tenn, at page 91, 222 S. W. (2d) at page 376, \u201cThat committee serves at its will and pleasure. State ex rel. Thurman v. Scott, 184 Tenn. 76, 80, 195 S. W. (2d) 617. If the beer committee is not acting in accordance with the wishes of the county (its Quarterly Court), the discharge of that committee may be effected at once and a committee representing the wishes of this county within the law may be substituted.\u201d It seems obvious that the relief for petitioners, if any, would be in inducing the County Court to take such action as is indicated by the language above rather than through a writ of certiorari, as here attempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">The judgment of the lower Court is affirmed with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b264-9\">Burnett, Justice, not participating.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
