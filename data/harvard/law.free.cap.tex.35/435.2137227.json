D. Gillmore, Adm\u2019r, v. H. F. Dunson and another.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b447-11\">1. An affidavit for the authentication of a claim against a decedent\u2019s estate must contain the requisites prescribed by the statute; and if it fail to do so, the allowance of the claim by the administrator, or its approval by the probate judge, can give it no effect or validity.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b447-13\">2. An affidavit for the authentication of a claim against a decedent\u2019s estate averred that \u201c all legal payments and credits\u201d had been allowed, but omitted to mention \u201c offsets\u201d in the same connection. <em>Held, </em>that the affidavit is fatally defective by reason of the omission, and that the district court could acquire no jurisdiction of a suit based on the claim thus defectively authenticated, although the rejection of the claim by the administrator assigned a different reason and took no exception to the affidavit. (Paschal\u2019s Digest, Articles 1309 and 1310.) The case of Walters v. Prestige, 30 Texas, 66, cited and approved.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-15\">Appeal from Colorado. Tried below before the Hon. L. Lindsay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-16\">So far as the rulings made in this case are concerned, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>the facts are fully indicated in the head-notes. The appellant was the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of Wm. Harbert\u2019s estate, against which the claim was asserted. When presented to him for allowance, he rejected it on the ground of his belief that it had been settled with the former administrator of the estate. The court below held the authentication sufficient, ant the appellees, Dunson and wife, recovered judgment; from which defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b448-5\"><em>Harcourt &amp; Harcourt, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1nG\">We contend that the district court do not acquire jurisdiction of this cause, because the claim was not \u201cproperly authenticated.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-6\">It is contended by the opposing counsel that the word \u201c offsets \u201d is comprehended in the words \u201c credits and payments,\u201d as used in the affidavit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-7\">The legal definition of the word will not authorize this construction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-8\">Set-off is thus defined by Webster : 1. \u201c That which is set off against another thing; an offset.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-9\">\u201c Law\u2014A counter claim ; a cross debt or demand ; a distinct claim filed or set up by the defendant against the plaintiff\u2019s demand.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-10\">\u201cSet-off differs from reduction and recoupment, as the latter generally grow out of the same matter or contract with the plaintiff\u2019s claim, while the former grows out of distinct matter, and does not of itself deny the justice-of the plaintiff's demand.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-11\">The affidavit being defective, according <em>to </em>the ruling of Walters v. Prestige, 30 Texas, no endorsement by the administrator of allowance or rejection could authorize the suit to be brought, or confer jurisdiction on this, court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-12\">The counsel hav\u00e9 referred to the syllabus of the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>of Hansell v. Gregg, 7 Texas, 223, declaring that the administrator cannot at the trial set up another reason for rejecting the claim ; but it will be found that the \u00abcourt did not decide, or announce such a rule.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-4\">The case of Shelton v. Berry, 19 Texas, 154, is also referred to, and an examination will show that it has no sort of application to the present question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-5\">As this is a question of jurisdiction, \u201e it is always \u25a0favorably considered by the court; and if it appear from the face of the record that the claim was not \u201cproperly \u2022authenticated,\u201d the administrator was in no fault in rejecting it, and the plaintiff had no right to sue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-6\">And upon this point alone we ask the court to decide the question and reverse and dismiss the cause.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b449-7\">Darden, for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKv\">It is assigned as error that the court \u201cadmitted in evidence the claim sued on, without its being properly authenticated.\u201d The affidavit alleges that \u00a3 \u2018 all legal payments and credits known to affiant have been allowed,\u201d\u2014omitting the word \u201coffsets,\u201d which occurs in the statute. (Pasch., Art. 1309.) The authority relied on is Walters v. Prestige, 30 Texas, page 65. It will be observed that in that case only the word \u201ccredits\u201d is used; and on page 73 the court say, \u201cThe term credits, in its most comprehensive sense, as distinguished from \u2018debit,\u2019 might be held to embrace all that is necessary; but it has another \u25a0and more restricted meaning, which would narrow it ' down to a signification nearly synonymous with payments ; which clearly would not fulfill the requirements of the statute, as in this sense it does not include offsets.\u201d IBut the affidavit now before the court uses both words, \u201ccredits\u201d and \u201cpayments,\u201d\u2014so that, by fair construction, the word \u201ccredits\u201d ought to be taken in the larger sense, comprehending offsets.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Again, the rejection by the administrator is not general, but special. He says, \u2018 \u2018 The above claim is hereby rejected by me, believing that the same has been settled with the former administrator.\u201d He cannot, therefore, at the trial set up another reason for rejecting the claim. (See Hansell v. Gregg, 7 Texas, 223; Shelton v. Berry, 19 Texas, 154.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-4\">It should be remembered, also, that this is not merely a suit on a claim under the statute ; but is in the nature of a bill in equity to correct a mistake,\u2014the petition of plaintiff pointing out to defendant all the sources of information.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b450-5\">Ogden, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ae0\">The statute prescribes certain requisites for an affidavit, made to authenticate a claim for money against an estate of a deceased person, and declares, in effect, that if any claim be allowed by an administrator, or approved by the court, without an affidavit containing the necessary requisites, such an allowance or approval shad be of no force or effect. The statute requires that the affidavit shall state that the claim is just, and that all legal offsets, payments and credits have been allowed. The affidavit made to the justness of the claim sued on in this cause fails fully to comply with the statute in this respect. It neither uses the language of the statute, nor its equivalent. And in following the decision in Walters v. Prestige, 30 Texas, 66, we feel bound to decide that the district court had no-jurisdiction of the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The judgment is therefore reversed, and the cause* dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Reversed abb dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
