Article 724, Penal Code (Pas. Dig., Art. 2359), defines thus: \u201cThe offense of burglary is constituted by entering a house-by force, threats or fraud, at night, or, in like manner, by entering a house during the day, and remaining concealed therein until night, with the intent, in either case, of committing a felony.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-9\">The indictment charges that the defendants broke and entered the house \u201cwith the intent, the goods and chattels of the said Simon E. Clement then and there-being, then and there feloniously to steal, take and carry away ;\u201d and it is insisted that the words, \u201c steal, take and carry away,\u201d are not equivalent to the statutory definition of theft.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-10\">Article 760, Penal Code (Pas. Dig., 2398), says they are equivalent. \u201cThe words \u2018steal\u2019 or \u2018stolen,\u2019 when used in this code in reference to the acquisition of property, include property acquired by theft.\u201d If equivalent when used in the code, they are certainly so-when used in proceedings under the code.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b103-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Ogden, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYo\">The indictment in this case is too indefinite and uncertain to support a conviction. The defendants are charged with entering, with force and arms, by night, the store house of Simon E. Clement, with intent then and there, feloniously and burglariously, to steal, take and carry away the goods and chattels of the said Simon E. Clement. The intent charged is not sufficiently definite to constitute the crime of burglary ; neither the language of the statute-nor its equivalent is used. Had the indictment charged the defendants with entering the house, with intent of committing a felony, or of committing the crime of \u201ctheft from a house,\u201d or any other felony, charging it specifically, that might have been sufficient. But to charge that defendant did steal, take and carry away the goods and chattels of another, from a house, is not specifically charging a felony. The remaining portion of the indictment (whether from the carelessness of the clerk in making the transcript, or from an original defect in the indictment, we are unable to determine), is-absolutely unintelligible. The jury found the defendants guilty of burglary; and as the indictment is insufficient to warrant such a finding, the judgment is-reversed ; and because of the insufficiency of the indictment in other respects, we think the court erred in. overruling the motion to quash.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The case is therefore dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Reversed ahd dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
