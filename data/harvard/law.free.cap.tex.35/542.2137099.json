Williams v. J. O\u2019Daniels.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b554-4\">For a stipulated compensation the defendant agreed in April, I860, to furnish a driver for plaintiff\u2019s wagon and team, and to accompany and superintend the same while conveying plaintiff\u2019s cotton to market, and to sell and dispose of it for the plaintiff. The market then contemplated was Brownsville or Eagle Pass, but the evidence shows that defendant had full discretion as to the place of market. Having reached San Antonio, the defendant, on the thirtieth of April, 1865, \u2022delivered the cotton to forwarding merchants there, to be shipped to their house at Eagle Pass. The merchants were then in good credit and standing, but shortly afterwards failed, and the cotton having Leen sent on to Monterey, Mexico, was there seized by their creditors, and no proceeds ever reached the plaintiff. The plaintiff now sues \u2022the defendant as a common carrier, for the value of the cotton. <em>Held, </em>that the undertaking of the defendant was neither that of a common nor a private carrier; that he was merely the agent of the plaintiff, and the court below correctly instructed the jury that, \u201cif in the exercise of a sound discretion, defendant used such diligence and care as a prudent man would have used with his own cotton, then he would not be liable for its subsequent loss.\u201d</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b554-5\">Appeal from Fayette.

There was no pretense that O\u2019Daniels was expressly authorized to confide the cotton to any one.

(Angel on Carriers, \u00a7\u00a7 671 and 46 ; Parsons on Cont., 163 and 173; Story on Bailments, 489.) The testimony of appellant\u2019s witnesses shows most clearly that the undertaking of the appellee was quite different from the undertaking of a common carrier, and counsel for appellant virtually admit that he is not liable as such. Nor did the appellee undertake to haul the cotton for which he is sued, in the capacity of a private carrier alone. (Angel on Carriers, 1 and 46; Story on Bailments, \u00a7 175; 2 Story on Contracts, 158; Haynie v. Baylor, 18 Texas, 498.) A private carrier, though he undertakes the transportation of goods as an accommodation, has no discretionary power over the goods transported, but to carry them within a reasonable time, with ordinary care and diligence, and to deliver the same to the consignee at a specific place of destination. In the cause at bar the appellee is not chargeable as a common or private carrier, as he only contracted to furnish a driver to take charge of the appellant\u2019s wagon and team, which was to haul the cotton to market, and appellee was to accompany the same as an agent of appellant, to superintend the hauling, to direct to what place the same was to be transported for market, and to sell the cotton when it should arrive at its place of destination. There is some little conflict in the testimony as to the extent of the discretion conferred upon appellee; but there is no conflict as to the fact that he had a discretion as to the place of market, and as to his full power and authority to sell and dispose of the same. These facts constituted appellee the agent of appellant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>and he can be held responsible only as such. (Story on Agency, \u00a7\u00a7 126 and 134.) It is true that appellee might have been held responsible for any misconduct of the driver furnished by him, but as no complaint is made against him on that account, we deem it unnecessary to consider his undertaking with appellant in any other aspect than that of agent, with full power and large discretion:</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">With this view of the law of the case, we think the court did not err in the charges given to the \"jury, and especially in the latter part of the fifth charge, wherein the jury were instructed \u201cthat if, in the exercise of a sound discretion, defendant used such diligence and care as a prudent man would have used with his own cotton, then he would not be liable for its subsequent loss.\u201d We think the law was fairly presented to the jury, and from all the testimony in the cause we are of the opinion that the verdict and judgment were strictly in accordance with the evidence. The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Afeibmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
