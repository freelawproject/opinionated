Tried below before the Hon. -'Charles Soward.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-9\">The appellant having been found guilty, and his fine \u2022.assessed at one dollar, his counsel moved in arrest of judgment, on the ground that the act of 1866, creating the offense, \u201cis so indefinitely framed, and of such \u2022-doubtful construction, that the same is and should be inoperative.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b507-10\"><em>A.

The statute of 1866 (p. 60, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Gen. Laws), under which this indictment was found, contains three superfluous words, \u201cso as to,\u201d before the word \u201cdisturb.\u201d If they are discarded, the sense is not rendered more complete, for the law as it is is perfectly intelligible, but the grammatical construction becomes faultless; and the question is submitted to the court, shall the statute be declared void, or the three superfluous words disregarded; or, in another form, which is more valuable, the public peace or grammar?</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b508-6\">Walker, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6D\">A somewhat novel question is presented in this record. The appellant, with one other, was indicted at the February term, 1871, charged with \u201crudely displaying pistols,\u201d and was tried, found guilty, and fined.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">The indictment was founded on the act of October <em>20, </em>1866, which was intended to repeal and supercede Article 2012, Paschal\u2019s Digest. It is insisted that the law is void for uncertainty and for want of completeness.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Upon an examination of the law we do not so consider it. The law is unmistakably plain in its meaning, and in nowise subject to the hypercriticism passed upon it by the appellant\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
