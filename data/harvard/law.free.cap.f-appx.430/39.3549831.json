Mar. 31, 2010), <em>rev\u2019g </em>No. A098 278 920 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. C. July 16, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed only the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">As an initial matter, the BIA\u2019s application of <em>Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 308 (2d Cir.2007), and <em>Matter of J-S-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 520, 529 (Att\u2019y Gen.2008), did not violate Jiang\u2019s due process rights. <em>See Shou Wei Jin v. Holder, </em>572 F.3d 392, 397 (7th Cir. 2009); <em>Yu v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1328, 1334 (11th Cir.2009). Indeed, the BIA appropriately applied the law in effect at the time it entered its decision. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(h); <em>see also NLRB v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., </em>55 F.3d 74, 78 (2d Cir.1995) (\u201cAppellate courts ordinarily apply the law in effect at the time of the appellate decision\u201d). Moreover, Jiang had the opportunity to present his claim anew after the issuance of <em>Shi Liang Lin. See Burger v. Gonzales, </em>498 F.3d 131, 134 (2d Cir.2007) (finding that \u201cto establish a violation of due process, an alien must show \u2018that she was denied a full and fair opportunity to present her claims\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The BIA reasonably concluded that Jiang failed to demonstrate past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. Although Jiang claimed that he suffered past persecution, he did not allege that he was physically harmed or mistreated by family planning officials. <em>See Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 341 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that to constitute persecution, the harm must be sufficiently severe, rising above \u201cmere harassment\u201d). Furthermore, the BIA properly held that Jiang was not <em>per se </em>eligible for the relief he sought based on his wife\u2019s forced abortion. <em>See Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 308; <em>see also Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>508 F.3d 716, 723 (2d Cir.2007). Moreover, Jiang failed to present any evidence demonstrating that he suffered a substantial economic disadvantage based on the imposition of fines for his violation of the family planning policy. <em>See Guan Shan Liao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>293 F.3d 61, 69-70 (2d Cir.2002); <em>see also Matter of T-Z-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 163, 171-175 (B.I.A. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Jiang failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution because he had two children. <em>See Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 158-68 (2d Cir.2008); <em>see also Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004) (holding that absent past persecution, an alien can demonstrate eligibility for asylum based on a well founded fear of future persecution by demonstrating that he or she subjectively fears persecution and that this fear is objectively reasonable). In <em>Jian Hui Shao, </em>we reviewed the BIA\u2019s consideration of the same or similar evidence as that submitted by Jiang, including official documents from Fujian Province relating to the family planning regulations, State Department reports, and newspaper articles, and we found no error in the BIA\u2019s conclusion that such evidence was insufficient to establish an objectively reasonable fear of persecution. 546 F.3d at 169-72 (noting that \u201c[w]e do not ourselves attempt to resolve conflicts in record evidence, a task largely within the discretion of the agency\u201d). Moreover, the evidence Jiang submitted, including the translations of Chinese law and policies relating to family planning, did not establish that his claimed fear of forced sterilization was objectively reasonable because it merely referenced the family planning policy\u2019s mandatory sterilization requirement and did not indicate that steriliza<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>tions are performed by force. Additionally, as the BIA noted, the notice Jiang\u2019s wife received from the Birth Control Office did not state that either he or his wife would be forcibly sterilized. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that, absent solid support in the record for the petitioner\u2019s assertion that he would be subjected to persecution, his fear was \u201cspeculative at best\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Lastly, the BIA properly conducted <em>de novo </em>review in answering the question of whether Jiang met his burden of proof in establishing that he had a reasonable fear of sterilization if he returned to China. As the underlying facts in the record were not in dispute, the BIA had the authority to address \u201cquestions of law\u201d regarding Jiang\u2019s eligibility for relief. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i) and (ii), <em>see also Jian Hui Shao, </em>546 F.3d at 162 (concluding that the BIA did not erroneously conduct de novo review of the IJ\u2019s factual findings by making \u201ca legal determination that, while [petitioner\u2019s] credible testimony was sufficient to demonstrate a genuine subjective fear of future persecution, more was needed to demonstrate the objective reasonableness of that fear\u201d); <em>Kambolli v. Gonzales, </em>449 F.3d 454, 457 (2d Cir.2006) (evaluating de novo the agency\u2019s \u201clegal conclusion\u201d that a petitioner did not demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution based on \u201cfacts established in the record\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Accordingly, because the BIA\u2019s determination that Jiang failed to show past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution is supported by substantial evidence, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008), the BIA did not err in denying his asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2) and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
