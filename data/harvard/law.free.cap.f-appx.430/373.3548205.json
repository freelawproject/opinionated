OGLE, Plaintiff-Appellant, v. Rick HOCKER, Defendant-Appellee.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"Ary\">No. 09-2481.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b395-8\">United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b395-10\">May 27, 2011.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b395-26\">Before MERRITT, COOK, and WHITE, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b395-27\">COOK, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b395-28\">After the parties attended a ministry conference in Europe, some not-so-faith-abiding descriptions of their trip surfaced within their shared Christian community. Troy Ogle then sued his former friend, Rick Hocker, for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). The district court granted Hocker summary judgment, and Ogle now asks us to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>reverse that decision. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The parties\u2019 mutual affiliation with The Church of God (COG) fostered the relationship that drives this sordid suit. Ogle, a COG-licensed international evangelist, became friendly with Hocker, an ordained COG bishop, through several COG meetings and events. At the close of one of these events, a church camp, Ogle invited Hocker to accompany him on a ten-day ministry trip to Belgium. Hocker agreed \u2014 but his journey abroad ultimately lasted only one day. Both the tenor of their conversation on the trans-Atlantic flight and Ogle\u2019s actions upon entering them shared hotel room struck Hocker as homosexual overtures. Hocker caught the next flight home. He then reported Ogle\u2019s behavior to his presiding COG bishop; preached about the incident (without naming Ogle) in three sermons at his Virginia Beach church; and repeated the allegations to a number of individuals on multiple occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Ogle, aggrieved, filed this action, which is now on its third trip to the Sixth Circuit. In the decision underlying the instant appeal, the district court granted Hocker summary judgment on Ogle\u2019s defamation claim and his defamation-dependent IIED claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">In Michigan, a prima facie case of defamation consists of four elements: (l)a false and defamatory statement; (2)publication to a third party; (3) fault \u2014 at least negligence \u2014 in publishing the statement; and (4)\u201ceither actionability of the statement irrespective of special harm (defamation per se) or ... special harm caused by publication (defamation per quod).\u201d <em>Colista v. Thomas, </em>241 Mich.App. 529, 616 N.W.2d 249, 254 (2000). The district court, finding Ogle\u2019s proof on the last element insufficient, held that he failed to establish either (A) defamation per se or (B) special harm. <em>Ogle v. Hocker, </em>669 F.Supp.2d 795, 801-04 (E.D.Mich.2009). We address both holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">Ogle, a married man, contends that Hocker\u2019s recounting of events occurring during their trip to Belgium constitutes defamation per se because it implied that he (1) lacks chastity; and (2) committed a criminal offense \u2014 sodomy. We find that Ogle presented sufficient lack-of-chastity evidence for his per se claim to survive summary judgment, and so we need not decide whether Hocker\u2019s statements also imputed the commission of a criminal offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">Under the Michigan defamation statute, \u201c[wjords imputing a lack of chastity to any female or male are\u201d per se defamatory. Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 600.2911(1); <em>accord Burden v. Elias Bros. Big Boy Rests., </em>240 Mich.App. 723, 613 N.W.2d 378, 382 (2000) (per curiam). The district court held that Hocker\u2019s statements fall outside this per se category because he never accused Ogle of engaging in a sexual act: he accused Ogle only of being homosexual and making sexual advances, which, without the \u201cactual commission\u201d of a sexual act, \u201cdoes not impute a lack of chastity.\u201d <em>Ogle, </em>669 F.Supp.2d at 802. The Michigan Legislature has never defined \u201cchastity\u201d \u2014 but neither law nor logic supports the distinction drawn between sexual advances and sexual acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-13\">Michigan case law \u2014 albeit scant \u2014 disfavors the distinction. In <em>Linebaugh v. Sheraton Michigan Corp., </em>a female plaintiff sued a co-worker for libel after he circulated an intra-office cartoon that de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>picted the plaintiff and a male colleague \u201cin a sexually compromising position.\u201d 198 Mich.App. 335, 497 N.W.2d 585, 586 (1993). Citing this cartoon, the appellate court reversed summary judgment for the defendant because a \u201clack of chastity may be imputed by reference to acts <em>other than promiscuous sexual intercourse.\u201d Id. </em>at 587 (emphasis added). <em>Linebaugh </em>thus suggests that an accusation of sexual conduct falling short of an explicit sexual act may indeed impute a lack of chastity to an individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">In a different context, at least one other state court has held that an individual\u2019s reputation for \u201cchastity\u201d can be tarnished by specific conduct \u201cnot involving physical contact\u201d but nevertheless \u201cindicating a willingness to engage in ... a sexual act.\u201d <em>Shand v. State, </em>103 Md.App. 465, 653 A.2d 1000, 1009 (1995). And as for the supporters of the advances-versus-acts distinction (the district court and Hocker), neither points to any authority \u2014 within or without Michigan \u2014 supporting the view that an accusation of \u201csexual acts\u201d may impute a lack of chastity while an allegation of \u201csexual advances\u201d may not.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Logic also undermines Hocker\u2019s position. Even if there were a line between lack-of-chastity-imputing sexual acts and innocuous, chastity-preserving sexual advances, Hocker\u2019s statements about Ogle must fall on the \u201cimputing\u201d side of that line. According to Hocker, upon checking in at the Belgian hotel, Ogle gave him a sensual kiss, cradled him on the floor in a sexual position, and stood nude in the bathroom doorway while displaying his erect penis. The reporting of such sexually charged acts suffices to impute a lack of chastity to a married minister, and Hocker provides no basis on which to accept his contrary notion.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Because Hocker\u2019s statements impute a lack of chastity to Ogle, the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the defamation per se claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">In addition to creating per se liability for lack-of-chastity-imputing statements, the Michigan defamation statute allows a plaintiff to recover actual damages for special harm, <em>see </em>Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 600.2911(2)(a), (7), and exemplary and punitive damages if he satisfies the statutory requirements, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 600.2911(2)(b). According to the district court, Ogle failed to establish (1) economic damage, (2) damage to reputation and feelings, and (3) entitlement to exemplary and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">The district court granted Hocker summary judgment on Ogle\u2019s claim for economic damages because it found that (1) all of Ogle\u2019s economic damages arose from the suspension of his COG license (an injury for which Ogle admits he may not recover due to the church-autonomy doctrine), and (2) Ogle otherwise \u201cfailed to proffer a sufficiency of evidence which causally connects Hoeker\u2019s allegedly defamatory statements with the economic damages that he claims to have suffered.\u201d <em>Ogle, </em>669 F.Supp.2d at 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-13\">But the district court overlooked much of the damages evidence that Ogle offered, evidence that demonstrates economic damage independent of his license suspension. The record shows, for example, that Hocker told his story to people, including ministers, outside the COG; that Ogle attempted to minister at non-COG churches \u2014 such as an independent Pentecostal congregation \u2014 but these attempts \u201cgot shut down pretty much\u201d; and that an unspecified number of congregations rejected Ogle\u2019s ministerial services because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>of the rumors about what he \u201chad supposedly done.\u201d This evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to.Ogle, suggests that he lost at least some work not because of the COG suspension, but because of Hock-er\u2019s statements to individuals outside the COG.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Since Ogle offei\u2019ed evidence from which a jury could reasonably find that he suffered economic losses other than COG-related income, the district court erred in granting Hocker summary judgment on this damages claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">A private plaintiff, like Ogle, may recover for damage to reputation or feelings only if he proves actual malice. <em>Glazer v. Lamkin, </em>201 Mich.App. 432, 506 N.W.2d 570, 572-73 (1993) (citing Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 600.2911(2)(a)). Ogle has not.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">To demonstrate actual malice, a plaintiff \u201cmust prove that the defendant made the statement with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of the truth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 573. The district court, noting that ill will, spite, and hatred do not constitute actual malice, <em>see Grebner v. Runyon, </em>132 Mich.App. 327, 347 N.W.2d 741, 744 (1984), granted Hocker summary judgment because Ogle\u2019s evidence demonstrated nothing more than Hocker\u2019s anger and hostility toward Ogle. On appeal, Ogle challenges the district court\u2019s ruling by again pointing to Hocker\u2019s admissions that he felt \u201cangry, disturbed, ... and hostile,\u201d \u201crepulsed,\u201d \u201cticked off,\u201d and \u201cdeceived.\u201d This testimony, Ogle contends, \u201cleaves no doubt that [Hocker] was acting with extreme malice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Ogle\u2019s argument fails to address the actual-malice standard, focusing again on Hocker\u2019s emotions rather than on his knowledge or recklessness. Ogle does not argue \u2014 before either the district court or this court \u2014 that Hocker made his statements with knowledge that they were false or with reckless disregard for the truth. Thus, because Ogle\u2019s argument ignores the legal definition of actual malice, we conclude that the district court did not err in granting Hocker summary judgment on Ogle\u2019s claim for damages to reputation and feelings.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">Last, Ogle\u2019s complaint prayed for exemplary and punitive damages. <em>See </em>Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 600.2911(2)(b). Michigan law, however, limits eligibility for such damages to suits against media defendants. <em>See Brantley v. Zantop Int\u2019l Airlines, Inc., </em>617 F.Supp. 1032, 1035-36 (E.D.Mich.1985) (dismissing a plaintiffs punitive-damages claim in his libel suit against his former employer). The <em>Brantley </em>court aptly explained the statutory source of this media-defendant limitation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-12\">[Section 600.2911(2)(b) ] allows exemplary and punitive damages only when plaintiff has demanded a retraction from defendant, and then provides that \u201c[t]he retraction shall be published <em>in the same size type, in the same editions </em>and as far as practicable, in substantially the same position as the original libel\u201d (emphasis added). This language certainly appears to apply to a media, rather than to a corporate, defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 1035 (second alteration in original) (quoting Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 600.2911(2)(b)). And the court bolstered its interpretation by comparing the current statute to past, yet parallel, versions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-14\">The early versions of the Michigan libel statute reveal that the language of the current statute was taken from a particular context. That context was a suit by a plaintiff against a newspaper that had allegedly libeled him. The current statute retains enough of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>original wording to indicate that its exemplary and punitive damage provisions continue to apply only to media defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1036. We agree with the statutory analysis in <em>Brantley, </em>and \u2014 Hocker being no media defendant \u2014 affirm the grant of summary judgment here.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The district court dismissed Ogle\u2019s IIED claim solely because it found his defamation claim too weak to pass summary judgment. <em>See Ogle, </em>669 F.Supp.2d at 804. Since we disagree in part with the district court\u2019s conclusion on the fourth element of Ogle\u2019s defamation claim, we accordingly reinstate his IIED claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
