Horta contends: his sentence was substantively unreasonable in the light of mitigating circumstances, including his youth and lack of criminal history; the district court did not provide specific reasons for the sentence; and, because the court made only general reference to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sen-fencing factors, it cannot be determined whether it considered the mitigating factors. He also asserts he has provided a basis for rebutting the presumption of reasonableness attached to a within-Guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-22\">Horta is not challenging the procedural reasonableness of his sentence. Along that line, at sentencing, the district court, after hearing testimony about whether Horta was in actual or constructive possession of the firearm seized where the methamphetamine was manufactured and distributed, ruled Horta did not have sufficient knowledge of the presence of the firearm and applied the requested safety-valve provision, reducing the advisory sentencing range from 324-405 months to 262-327 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-23\">If, as here, a sentencing decision is procedurally sound, the substantive reasonableness of the imposed sentence is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). As noted above, a within-Guidelines sentence \u201cis presumptively reasonable\u201d. <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-24\">The record shows the district court, <em>inter alia: </em>considered the serious nature and ramifications of the drug conspiracy and the need to deter such conduct; listened to Government\u2019s evidence, defense counsel\u2019s mitigating arguments, and Horta\u2019s allocution; specifically referred to its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors; and implicitly considered Horta\u2019s mitigating arguments by sentencing him at the bottom of the Guidelines range. Horta\u2019s disagreement with the district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the mitigating circumstances is insufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>disturb the presumption of reasonableness afforded his within-Guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"Ahy\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b319-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
