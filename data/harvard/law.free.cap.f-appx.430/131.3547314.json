For the reasons expressed below, we affirm the judgment of the District Court and grant Urban Outfitters partial attorneys\u2019 fees for its prior appeal in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-19\">I. <em>Background,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-20\">Urban Outfitters, Inc., Urban Outfitters Wholesale, Inc., and Free People LLC (collectively, Urban Outfitters) filed an action against BCBG Max Azria Group, Inc., Max Rave, LLC, and Street Beat Sportswear, Inc. (collectively, BCBG) for trademark infringement and related claims under sections 32 and 43(a) of the Lanham Act. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1114, 1125(a). After granting preliminary injunctive relief, the District Court eventually granted Urban Outfitters a permanent injunction that limited BCBG\u2019s use of its TRUE PEOPLE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>mark to avoid confusion with Urban Outfitters\u2019 FREE PEOPLE mark. The District Court also dismissed BCBG\u2019s counterclaim, which alleged that Urban Outfitters had defrauded the Patent and Trademark Office, but denied Urban Outfitters\u2019 request for \u201cexceptional case\u201d attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">BCBG appealed the District Court\u2019s adverse rulings, and Urban Outfitters cross-appealed the District Court\u2019s denial of \u201cexceptional case\u201d attorneys\u2019 fees. We affirmed all of the District Court\u2019s actions except for one: We vacated the District Court\u2019s \u201cexceptional case\u201d ruling and remanded with instructions to consider \u201cexceptional case fees\u201d in light of certain, undiscussed instances of \u201cBCBG\u2019s chicanery.\u201d <em>Urban Outfitters, Inc. v. BCBG Max Azria Group, Inc., </em>318 Fed.Appx. 146 (3d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">On remand, based on record evidence of BCBG\u2019s intentional infringement and litigation misconduct, the District Court found the case to be exceptional and required BCBG to pay Urban Outfitters \u201c50% of the total attorney fees and expenses\u201d that Urban Outfitters had \u201cspent in the preparation and presentation of [its] case.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Now pending before the Court are BCBG\u2019s appeal from the District Court\u2019s judgment, and Urban Outfitters\u2019 petition for attorneys\u2019 fees related to its previous appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">II. Discussion<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">We generally review a district court\u2019s award of \u201cexceptional case\u201d attorneys\u2019 fees for an abuse of discretion, but we review under a plenary standard a district court\u2019s interpretation of \u201cthe scope and meaning of the term \u2018exceptional\u2019 \u201d as used in section 35(a) of the Lanham Act. <em>Securacomm Consulting, Inc. v. Securacom, Inc., </em>224 F.3d 273, 279 (3d Cir.2000); <em>see also Ferrero U.S.A., Inc. v. Ozak Trading, Inc., </em>952 F.2d 44, 48 (3d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">A. Appeal of \u201cExceptional Case\u201d Award of Attorneys\u2019 Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b155-13\">We find that the District Court, in its well-reasoned opinion on remand, did not abuse its discretion nor commit any error of law when it awarded Urban Outfitters \u201cexceptional case\u201d attorneys\u2019 fees under section 35(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117. Pursuant to section 35(a), a court may award attorneys\u2019 fees to the \u201cprevailing party\u201d in \u201cexceptional cases,\u201d such as where the infringement was intentional, <em>see Ferrero, </em>952 F.2d at 48, or where the losing litigant has committed some other culpable conduct, for instance, misconduct during the course of litigation, <em>see SecuraComm, </em>224 F.3d at 282. <em>See generally Green v. Fornario, </em>486 F.3d 100, 103-04 (3d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-14\">The record of BCBG\u2019s \u201cchicanery\u201d is well-established, as recognized by this Court, <em>Urban Outfitters, Inc. v. BCBG Max Azria Group, Inc., </em>318 Fed.Appx. 146 (3d Cir.2009), and the District Court, <em>Urban Outfitters, Inc. v. BCBG Max Azria Group, Inc., </em>No. CIV.A.06-4003, 2010 WL 742654, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19059 (E.D.Pa. Mar. 2, 2010); <em>Urban Outfitters, Inc. v. BCBG Max Azria Group, Inc., </em>No. CIV.A.06-4003, 2008 WL 282742, 2008 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Dist. LEXIS 7000 (E.D.Pa. Jan. 31, 2008). The District Court\u2019s opinion \u2014 the subject of this appeal \u2014 carefully analyzed each instance of litigation misconduct that this Court identified and also noted its previous finding of BCBG\u2019s intentional infringement. We will affirm the District Court\u2019s findings in all respects. Further, the District Court was well within its discretion in requiring BCBG to pay 50% of Urban Outfitters\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees under the \u201cexceptional case\u201d provision of the Lanham Act and later in sanctioning BCBG for filing a non-responsive brief that extended litigation unduly.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">BCBG\u2019s arguments that the District Court misconstrued the limits of this Court\u2019s remand and erred by failing to consider Urban Outfitters\u2019 alleged misconduct are unavailing. We remanded this case for the District Court to address an award of \u201cexceptional case\u201d attorneys\u2019 fees in light of misconduct that it had not explicitly addressed in ruling on that issue in the first instance. We explicitly left open whether an examination of that misconduct would support an award of \u201cexceptional case\u201d attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Urban Outfitters, Inc., </em>318 Fed.Appx. at 149 n. 3 (\u201cIn remanding for further consideration of \u2018exceptional case\u2019 fees, we do not suggest a particular outcome must result.\u201d). The District Court considered the specific instances this Court had noted, and found in fact that such misconduct qualified for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. The District Court, therefore, properly interpreted the scope of remand. We also reject BCBG\u2019s argument that the District Court was required to address whether instances of Urban Outfitters\u2019 purported misconduct precluded an award of \u201cexceptional case\u201d attorneys\u2019 fees to Urban Outfitters. BCBG\u2019s allegations of misconduct are not supported by the record and, despite extensive litigation on the question of attorneys\u2019 fees, were not presented in any detail to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">B. Petition for Attorneys\u2019 Fees on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">We will grant in part Urban Outfitters\u2019 petition for attorneys\u2019 fees from the first appeal on the same basis given by the District Court in finding that BCBG\u2019s conduct was \u201cexceptional\u201d for purposes of section 35(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117. <em>See Urban Outfitters, Inc., </em>2010 WL 742654, *1-4, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19059, *3-11. When it comes to awarding attorneys\u2019 fees on appeal under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117, we agree with the First Circuit that \u201c[t]he case law in this area is very sparse.\u201d <em>Tamko Roofing Prods., Inc. v. Ideal Roofing Co., Ltd., </em>294 F.3d 227, 230 (1st Cir.2002). In the dearth of precedent on this point, we also find instructive the several factors the First Circuit weighs in determining whether to grant attorneys\u2019 fees in such a case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">(1) whether the appeal was on issues different from those that caused the trial court to find an \u201cexceptional case\u201d; (2) the relative strengths or weaknesses of the appellate issues; and (3) the extent to which the appeal can be said to have prolonged, without adequate justification, a particularly bad \u201cexceptional case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">Based on the totality of these factors and in light of the instances of intentional infringement and litigation misconduct previously cited by this Court and the District Court, we conclude that BCBG is to pay Urban Outfitters 50% of Urban Outfitters\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees for its previous appeal. <em>See JCW Invs., Inc. v. Novelty, Inc., </em>509 F.3d 339, 342 (7th Cir.2007) (awarding \u201cexceptional case\u201d attorneys\u2019 fees on appeal for \u201cflagrant\u201d copyright infringement and \u201cwillful\u201d trademark in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>fringement); <em>Comm. for Idaho's High Desert v. Yost, </em>92 F.3d 814, 825 (9th Cir.1996) (awarding \u201cexceptional case\u201d attorneys\u2019 fees on appeal for intentional infringement).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">In responding to Urban Outfitters\u2019 petition for attorneys\u2019 fees, BCBG failed to raise any substantive ground in opposition to the petition. Instead, BCBG relied solely on procedural arguments that Urban Outfitters\u2019 petition was untimely. As we have already granted Urban Outfitters\u2019 motion to file a petition for attorneys\u2019 fees out of time and the parties have fully litigated the issue of \u201cexceptional case\u201d attorneys\u2019 fees both before this Court and the District Court, we find that additional briefing on whether to grant \u201cexceptional case\u201d attorneys\u2019 fees on appeal would only unnecessarily prolong this case. <em>See Urban Outfitters, Inc. v. BCBG Max Azria Group, Inc., </em>Order, Nos. 07-3882, 08-1472, 08-1655, 10-2922 and 10-3510 (3d Cir. Dec. 21, 2010) (Rendell, Weiss and Roth) (granting motion to file petition for attorneys\u2019 fees).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s award of \u201cexceptional case\u201d attorneys\u2019 fees and its subsequent sanction of $5,000 against BCBG. We further award Urban Outfitters 50% of the attorneys\u2019 fees resulting from its previous appeal (Nos.07-3882, 08-1472, OS-1655) in this case. To determine the amount of this award, we direct the parties to follow the procedure set forth in the instant Judgment. <em>See Vasquez v. Fleming, </em>617 F.2d 334, 336 (3d Cir.1980) (supporting this Court\u2019s authority to determine the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees on appeal).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-12\">. We assume familiarity with the facts, which we refer to only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b155-9\">. The District Court also sanctioned BCBG in the sum of $5,000 for asserting \"non-responsive and previously rejected arguments ... [that] extended this litigation unduly\u201d in briefing on the amount of attorneys' fees Urban Outfitters incurred during the litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b155-15\">. The District Court had subject matter jurisdiction under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1121 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1338(a), as Urban Outfitters claimed trademark infringement under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1114, 1125. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, this Court has jurisdiction to hear this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
