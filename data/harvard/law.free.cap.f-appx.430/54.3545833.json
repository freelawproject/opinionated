Morace denying Lin\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Jin Chun Lin, </em>No. A089 252 827 (B.I.A. July 19, 2010), <em>affg </em>No. A089 252 827 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 14, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-13\">For asylum applications, such as this one, governed by the REAL ID Act, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s \u201cdemeanor, candor, or responsiveness,\u201d and inconsistencies in his or her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Here, the agency found that Lin was not credible based on inconsistencies between his testimony and his asylum application, long pauses in his testimony, and unresponsive answers. The record supports these findings. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005) (noting this Court\u2019s deference\u2019s to an IJ\u2019s findings regarding an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor because the IJ has \u201cthe unique advantage ... of having heard directly from the applicant\u201d (internal citations and quotations omitted)). While Lin contends that these pauses and non-responsive answers were a result of a confusing line of questioning by the government attorney, the record indicates that the pauses and non-responsive answers continued throughout his testimony, not only as a response to the confusing questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-14\">Having found Lin not credible, the agency reasonably expected him to rehabilitate his testimony by providing corroboration of his wife\u2019s alleged abortion or medical records supporting his claim that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>beaten by family planning officials. <em>See Biao Yang v. Gonzales, </em>496 F.3d 268, 273 (2d Cir.2007) (finding that once an asylum applicant\u2019s testimony has been called into question, an IJ can expect corroboration). Lin asserts in his brief that documentation of his wife\u2019s abortion was not available because the abortion was involuntary, but counsel\u2019s unsupported assertions in a brief do not constitute evidence, <em>see INS v. Phinpathya, </em>464 U.S. 183, 188 n. 6, 104 S.Ct. 584, 78 L.Ed.2d 401 (1984), and Lin did not present this argument to either the IJ or the BIA on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Together, the problems the agency identified in Lin\u2019s testimony and his failure to provide sufficient corroboration provide substantial evidence for its adverse credibility determination. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Because Lin\u2019s claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief were all based on the same factual predicate, the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination forecloses all relief. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
