R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b619-9\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">This is a constitutional-tort claim brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The underlying facts are known to the parties and need not be repeated. Alan Bassani appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for defendants Randy Sutton, the Yakima County Sheriffs Department, and Yakima County. Bassani\u2019s complaint alleged that Sutton (as Yakima County\u2019s Animal Control Officer) violated principles of due process when he seized one of Bassani\u2019s two dogs. The district court held that Bassani\u2019s claims were barred by res judicata because Bassani had brought a previous lawsuit, in which he successfully petitioned for the release of one of these dogs. The district court also denied his motion to amend his complaint to include both dogs, based on undue delay and undue prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-13\">Bassani argues that the district court incorrectly relied on a prior decision of this court interpreting Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16(b) rather than Civil Rule 15(a). <em>See Coleman v. Quaker Oats Co., </em>232 F.3d 1271 (9th Cir.2000). But Bassani misreads our decision. In fact, <em>Coleman </em>addressed both Rule 16 <em>and </em>Rule 15, including the prejudice requirement under Rule 15. <em>See id. </em>at 1295. In any event, we hold that the district court\u2019s ultimate conclusions \u2014 that there would be undue delay and prejudice to the defendants if Bassani were allowed to amend his complaint two years into litigation and after the close of <em>discovery </em>\u2014 were not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-14\">To the contrary, our case law shows that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that allowing such an amendment after discovery had already concluded would have prejudiced the defendants and caused undue delay given the two years that had already elapsed. <em>See, e.g., AmerisourceBergen Corp. v. Dialysist West, Inc., </em>465 F.3d 946, 953 (9th Cir.2006); <em>Lockheed Martin Corp. v. Network Solutions, Inc., </em>194 F.3d 980, 986 (9th Cir.1999). And this was especially true where, as here, Bassani had known about the facts and legal theories giving rise to his amendments from his suit\u2019s inception. <em>See Acri v. Inti Ass\u2019n of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers, </em>781 F.2d 1393, 1398 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-15\">We therefore AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b619-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
