R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b654-6\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Touma Touma, a native and citizen of Syria, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying his application for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">In his opening brief, Touma fails to challenge the agency\u2019s dispositive determination that his asylum claim was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that any discrimination Touma may have experienced on account of his Christian religion did not rise to the level of past persecution. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1016 (9th Cir.2003) (record did not compel finding that Ukrainian Pentecostal Christian who was \u201cteased, bothered, discriminated against and harassed\u201d suffered from past persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">In addition, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Touma failed to 'establish a nexus between the persecution he fears from his creditors or the Syrian government and a statutorily protected ground. <em>See Ochoa v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 1166, 1172 (9th Cir.2005) (persecution as a result of a debt was not on account of a protected ground). Accordingly, Touma\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-13\">Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s finding that Touma failed to establish a clear pi\u2019obability that he would be persecuted on account of his Christian religion on return to Syria. <em>See Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 816-17 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cAn applicant\u2019s claim of persecution upon return is weakened, even undercut, when similarly-situated family members continue to live in the country without incident, ... or when the applicant has returned to the country without incident.\u201d) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-14\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of Touma\u2019s CAT claim because he failed to show it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if returned to Syria. <em>See Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1067-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b654-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
