Gutierrez argues that the district court improperly imposed three criminal history points, precluding him from eligibility for \u201csafety valve\u201d consideration, which would allow the district court to impose a sentence under the United States Sentencing Guidelines, notwithstanding the ten-year statutory minimum sentence for his offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f); U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5C1.2(a). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-24\">We \u201creview[ ] the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo, the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines to the facts of this case for abuse of discretion, and the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Kimbrew, </em>406 F.3d 1149, 1151 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-25\">Gutierrez argues that he was not \u201cunder a[ ] criminal justice sentence\u201d at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>he committed his federal offense and therefore the district court improperly applied two criminal history points under \u00a7 4Al.l(d) of the Guidelines.^ <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4Al.l(d). But the conditions imposed upon Gutierrez by the California court when it deferred the judgment on his state law possession charge constitute a \u201ccriminal justice sentence\u201d because they included a \u201ccustodial or supervisory component.\u201d <em>See United States v. Franco-Flores, </em>558 F.3d 978, 982 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 249, 175 L.Ed.2d 170 (2009) (\u201c[A] suspended sentence with a supervisory or custodial component can constitute a \u2018criminal justice sentence\u2019 under section 4Al.l(d).\u201d); U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4A1.1 cmt. n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Because the district court did not abuse its discretion in assessing two criminal history points under \u00a7 4Al.l(d), Gutierrez was ineligible for safety valve consideration. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(l) (defendant ineligible for safety valve if he has more than one criminal history point).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">We decline to reach Gutierrez\u2019s challenge to his California possession conviction \u2014 ultimately entered after Gutierrez failed to appear at a status conference as part of his deferred judgment \u2014 which Gutierrez collaterally attacks as obtained in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. <em>See City of Los Angeles v. County of Kern, </em>581 F.3d 841, 846 (9th Cir.2009) (\u201c[A] federal court should not decide federal constitutional questions where a dispositive nonconstitutional ground is available.\u201d). The alleged Sixth Amendment violation does not implicate the propriety of imposing two criminal history points because Gutierrez was \u201cunder a[] criminal justice sentence\u201d since the supervisory conditions imposed on him as a result of the deferred judgment occurred <em>before </em>Gutierrez\u2019s conviction for that offense was formally entered (i.e., <em>before </em>the alleged Sixth Amendment violation took place). <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4Al.l(d). Therefore, even assuming the district court erred in imposing one criminal history point for Gutierrez\u2019s California conviction pursuant to \u00a7 4Al.l(c) because that conviction was obtained in violation of his right to counsel, Gutierrez would remain ineligible for safety valve treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b661-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
