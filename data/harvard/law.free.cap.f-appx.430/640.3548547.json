We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">In his opening brief, Warankiran fails to challenge the agency\u2019s dispositive determination that his asylum claim was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that the threats Warankiran heard while at church in September 1985 did not rise to the level of past persecution. <em>See Nahrvani v. Gonzales, </em>399 F.3d 1148, 1153-54 (9th Cir.2005). Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s determination that the experiences of Warankiran\u2019s family members still living in Indonesia do not rise to the level of past persecution. <em>See Gu v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 1014, 1019-20 (9th Cir.2006); <em>Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1017 (9th Cir.2003) (no past persecution where petitioner was only pushed and threatened). Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Warankiran has not established a clear probability of persecution because, even under a disfavored group analysis, Warankiran has not established sufficient evidence of individualized risk. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1185 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d at 1066-67 (\u201c[a]n applicant for withholding of removal will need to adduce a considerably larger quantum of individualized-risk evidence\u201d). Finally, the record does not compel the conclusion that there is a pattern and practice of persecution against Christians in Indonesia. <em>See Lolong v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 1173, 1180-81 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc). Accordingly, we deny Warankiran\u2019s petition as to his withholding of removal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b663-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
