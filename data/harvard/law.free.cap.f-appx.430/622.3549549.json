R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b645-10\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">Erwin Herrera, a native and citizen of Honduras, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying his application for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Gonzalez-Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 995, 998 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that, even if Herrera established past persecution by the Gonzalez family on account of a protected ground, any presumption of a clear probability of future persecution was rebutted by evidence that he could reasonably relocate within Honduras. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(l)(i)(B); <em>Gonzalez-Hernandez, </em>336 F.3d at 998-99. Herrera\u2019s contention that the agency applied the wrong standard when determining it was reasonable for him to relocate is belied by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-17\">Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s determination that Herrera failed to establish his uncle\u2019s threats regarding Herrera\u2019s continued financial support of his grandmother were on account of a protected ground. <em>See Bolshakov v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1279, 1280-81 (9th Cir.1998) (criminal activity does not establish persecution on account of a protected ground); <em>see also Parussimova v. Mukasey, </em>555 F.3d 734, 740 (9th Cir.2009) (\u201c[t]he REAL ID Act requires that a protected ground represent \u2018one central reason\u2019 for an asylum applicant\u2019s persecution\u201d). Accordingly, Herrera\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-18\">Herrera has not raised any direct challenge to the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (stating that issues not supported by argument are deemed abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-19\">Finally, we deny Herrera\u2019s request for a remand because the BIA sufficiently articulated the reasons for its decision. <em>See Tekle v. Mukasey, </em>533 F.3d 1044, 1051 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-20\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b645-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
