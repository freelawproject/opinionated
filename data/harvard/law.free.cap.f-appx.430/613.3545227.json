Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the threats Isidro-Mejia received from gang members did not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2003). In addition, the BIA did not err in concluding that even if the threats constituted persecution, petitioner did not show that he was persecuted on account of a protected ground, such as membership in a social group. <em>See Ramos Barrios v. Holder, </em>581 F.3d 849, 855-56 (9th Cir.2009) (young Guatemalan men who resisted recruitment into gang did not constitute particular social group and refusal to join gang did not amount to \u201cpolitical opinion\u201d). Finally, contrary to Isidro-Mejia\u2019s contention, the BIA\u2019s opinion stated with sufficient particularity and clarity its reasons for dismissing his appeal. <em>See Castillo v. INS, </em>951 F.2d 1117, 1121 (9th Cir.1991). Because Isidro-Mejia failed to demonstrate that he was persecuted on account of a protected ground, we deny the petition seeking withholding of removal relief. <em>See Ramos-Barrios, </em>581 F.3d at 856.</p>\n<p id=\"AkB\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b636-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
