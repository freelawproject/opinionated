STRANCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Bobby Ray King appeals his sentence of thirty-seven months of imprisonment for converting government property. He challenges the district court\u2019s application of a two-level Sentencing Guidelines enhancement for violating a previously entered judicial order, as well as the reasonableness of his sentence. Because King has waived any challenge to the enhancement, and the district court\u2019s sentence was both procedurally and substantively reasonable, we <em>AFFIRM.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">On August 12, 2009, Defendant-Appellant Bobby Ray King pleaded guilty to one count of converting property of the United States Department of Agriculture (\u201cUSDA\u201d) in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 658. As set forth in the plea agreement, the conversion charge relates to real property in McCreary County, Kentucky, previously mortgaged to the USDA by King\u2019s father. After King\u2019s father passed away in 2006, the loan became delinquent and the Government filed a foreclosure action in federal district court against King and others as heirs to the property. On March 17, 2008, the court granted judgment against King and ordered the property sold at auction and King to vacate it within thirty days. King, however, dismantled the property and sold its components, resulting in the property\u2019s devaluation from $33,000 to $3,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">On December 3, 2009, the district court sentenced King on the conversion charge. The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) calculated a total offense level of 12 and a criminal history category of VI, resulting in a recommended Guidelines range of 30 to 37 months of imprisonment. King filed written objections to several aspects of the PSR, including the application of a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(8)(C) for violating the district court\u2019s previous foreclosure order. At sentencing, however, King expressly withdrew those objections. R51 at 3-4. After hearing arguments from both sides and considering the pertinent sentencing factors, the district court imposed a within-Guidelines sentence of 37 months of imprisonment, to be followed by 3 years of supervised release. R51 at 17-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-13\">On appeal, King challenges the application of the two-level enhancement for violating a prior judicial order and the procedural and substantive reasonableness \u2019 of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-14\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b538-15\">I. Applicability of Judicial-Order Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b538-16\">King first argues that the district court erred in applying a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(8). We agree with the Government that this argument has been waived and cannot be considered on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-17\">There is an important distinction between forfeiture and waiver. \u201cWhereas forfeiture is the failure to make the timely assertion of a right, waiver is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (internal quotation marks omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>ted). Although forfeited arguments may be reviewed on appeal for plain error, Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b), waived arguments generally are not renewable, <em>United States v. Aparco-Centeno, </em>280 F.3d 1084, 1088 (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">King initially objected to the judicial-order enhancement in his written response to the PSR. At sentencing, however, King expressly withdrew the objection and \u201cconcede[d]\u201d the applicability of the enhancement. R51 at 3-4. By withdrawing his previously raised objection, King waived any challenge to the district court\u2019s disposition of the issue. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Denkins, </em>367 F.3d 537, 543-44 (6th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>23 Fed.Appx. 254, 255 (6th Cir.2001). We are therefore unable to consider King\u2019s argument regarding the applicability of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(8).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">II. Procedural Reasonableness of Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">King next challenges the procedural reasonableness of his sentence on two grounds. Generally, this Court considers such challenges under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Barahona-Montenegro, </em>565 F.3d 980, 983 (6th Cir.2009). The Government, however, correctly argues, and King concedes, that the procedural reasonableness of King\u2019s sentence is reviewable only for plain error because King did not object when given an opportunity to do so at the conclusion of sentencing. <em>See United States v. Vonner, </em>516 F.3d 382, 385-86 (6th Cir.2008) (en banc); <em>United States v. Bostic, </em>371 F.3d 865, 872-73 (6th Cir.2004). To establish plain error, King must show that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-9\">(1) there is an error; (2) the error is clear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute; (3) the error affected the appellant\u2019s substantial rights, which in the ordinary case means it affected the outcome of the district court proceedings; and (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-10\"><em>United States v. Marcus, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2159, 2164, 176 L.Ed.2d 1012 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">A. Treating the Guidelines as Per Se Reasonable</p>\n<p id=\"b539-13\">King first argues that the district court proeedurally erred because it \u201cconsidered the Guidelines as the \u2018per se reasonable\u2019 sentence, and found that in order to overcome the Guidelines range, there needed to be compelling mitigation found in the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 12. In support, he points to the district court\u2019s statement, made after discussing the recommended Guidelines range, framing the sentencing issue as whether there is \u201canything about [the remaining \u00a7 3553(a) ] factors that suggest that the [Guidelines] recommendation I have in front of me is somehow not fair or just in your case.\u201d R51 at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-14\">District courts are prohibited from applying a presumption of reasonableness to the applicable Guidelines range in fashioning a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Nelson v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 350, 129 S.Ct. 890, 892, 172 L.Ed.2d 719 (2009) (per curiam); <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Although the district court might have used clearer language to avoid any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>possible inference that it was treating the Guidelines as presumptively reasonable, our review of the record convinces us that the district court did not commit plain error in applying and weighing the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">In sentencing King, the district court correctly recognized that the Guidelines range was the \u201cstarting point\u201d in imposing the appropriate sentence. R51 at 12; <em>see Gall, 552 </em>U.S. at 49, 128 S.Ct. 586 (noting that the applicable Guidelines range \u201cshould be the starting point and the initial benchmark\u201d in sentencing). Unlike those cases finding sentencing error on this issue, the district court never explicitly applied a presumption of reasonableness to the Guidelines range. <em>See Nelson, </em>129 S.Ct. at 891 (district court stated that \u201cthe Guidelines are considered presumptively reasonable\u201d); <em>United States v. McConer, </em>530 F.3d 484, 501 (6th Cir.2008) (district court stated that it \u201cstart[ed] with the presumption that the guideline sentence is reasonable\u201d); <em>United States v. Wilms, </em>495 F.3d 277, 281 (6th Cir.2007) (district court required parties to \u201covercome the presumption of reasonableness with respect to the sentencing guidelines in this case\u201d). Rather, the district court simply stated that it was required to consider whether any of the other section 3553(a) factors indicated that the Guidelines range was \u201cnot fair or just\u201d in this particular case. We recently affirmed a district court\u2019s use of even stronger language in <em>United States v. Pizzino, </em>419 Fed.Appx. 579 (6th Cir. 2011), where the district court stated that it was \u201cvery reticent\u201d to deviate from the Guidelines but would do so when \u201cpersuaded that those ranges are dramatically unfair and not supported by \u00a7 3553 and the factors in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Furthermore, in King\u2019s ease, the district court imposed sentence only after hearing arguments from both sides as to the appropriate sentence, and after expressly considering the pertinent sentencing factors to impose an individualized sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes of [\u00a7 ] 3553(a).\u201d R51 at 17. In fact, the district court actually considered sentencing King above the Guidelines range, but ultimately decided not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Applying plain-error review and reviewing the record as a whole, we do not believe that King has demonstrated a clear or obvious procedural error in the district court\u2019s application and consideration of the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">B. Failure to Address Mitigating Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">King also argues that the district court committed procedural error by failing to address three mitigating factors raised by King in his sentencing memorandum and at the sentencing hearing: (1) the need for a shorter period of incarceration so King could provide timely restitution; (2) the costs of incarceration; and (3) the fact that King has a family and was expecting an additional child. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 15-16. The district court\u2019s failure to address these particular arguments while announcing King\u2019s sentence does not amount to plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">In sentencing a defendant, a district court is required to \u201cset forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that [it] has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). \u201cThe appropriateness of brevity or length, conciseness or detail, when to write, what to say, depends upon circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Vonner, </em>we explained that, although the district court is required to \u201cgive the reasons for its sentence,\u201d it is not required to \u201cgive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>the reasons for rejecting any and all arguments by the parties for alternative sentences,\u201d particularly those that are \u201cconceptually straightforward.\u201d 516 F.3d at 387-88 (internal quotation marks omitted). In those cases where a district court imposes a within-Guidelines sentence and this Court is reviewing for plain error, we need only determine whether \u201c \u2018[t]he record makes clear that the sentencing judge listened to each argument,\u2019 \u2018considered the supporting evidence,\u2019 was \u2018fully aware\u2019 of the defendant\u2019s circumstances and took \u2018them into account\u2019 in sentencing him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387 (quoting <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 358, 127 S.Ct. 2456).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">King has not shown that the district court plainly erred under <em>Rita </em>and <em>Vonner. </em>King raised a handful of mitigating factors in his sentencing memorandum and at the sentencing hearing. The district court addressed several of them in announcing King\u2019s sentence, but did not expressly address the three cited by King on appeal. Nonetheless, \u201c[njothing in the record, or the context of the hearing, suggests that the court did not listen to, consider and understand every argument [King] made\u201d. <em>Vonner, </em>516 F.3d at 388 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). King\u2019s leniency arguments were conceptually straightforward. The district court is intimately familiar with the costs of incarceration, and specifically demonstrated its awareness of the need for restitution in King\u2019s case, including King\u2019s limited ability to pay while incarcerated. R51 at 16, 20-22. The court also reviewed and considered letters from King and others addressing his family circumstances. R51 at 11-12. Because the record indicates that the district court understood all of King\u2019s arguments for leniency, we cannot say that the district court committed plain error on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">III. Substantive Reasonableness of Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">King also challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. \u201cIn selecting a sentence, the [district] court must consider the factors set forth in section 3553(a) and arrive at a sentence \u2018sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with\u2019 those factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Gunter, </em>620 F.3d 642, 647 (6th Cir.2010) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). Substantive errors may occur \u201cwhere the district court selects the sentence arbitrarily, bases the sentence on impermissible factors, fails to consider pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors or gives an unreasonable amount of weight to any pertinent factor.\u201d <em>United States v. Moon, </em>513 F.3d 527, 543 (6th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). \u201cThe essence of a substantive-reasonableness claim is whether the length of the sentence is \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Tristan-Madrigal, </em>601 F.3d 629, 632-33 (6th Cir.2010) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). A rebuttable presumption of substantive reasonableness is afforded a properly calculated, within-Guidelines sentence. <em>United States v. Polihonki, </em>543 F.3d 318, 322 (6th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">King contends that \u201ca review of [the section 3553 factors] indicate[s] that a sentence[ ] of lower than 37 months was reasonable in this case.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 18. That may be true, but that is not the question before us. \u201c[W]e cannot reverse a sentence simply because we determine that a different sentence would be appropriate.\u201d <em>United States v. Higgins, </em>557 F.3d 381, 398 (6th Cir.2009). The issue is whether \u201ca different sentence was <em>required.\u201d United States v. Brown, </em>579 F.3d 672, 687 (6th Cir.2009). Our review of the record leads us to conclude that King cannot overcome the presumption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>reasonableness that attaches to the district court\u2019s within-Guidelines sentence. As the district court pointed out, King has a \u201cvery extensive criminal history,\u201d R51 at 12, demonstrating \u201ca lot of disrespect for the law,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 14. And while King\u2019s offense was not violent and involved only economic harm, it was nevertheless \u201ca veiy serious crime,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 13, involving \u201ca conscious pattern of criminal activity,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 15, with \u201cthe taxpayer ... footing the bill,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 13. In light of these factors, we do not believe the district court\u2019s within-Guidelines 37-month sentence was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">For the aforementioned reasons, we <em>AFFIRM </em>the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-8\">. Even assuming we could consider King\u2019s argument, we would not be persuaded. King argues that the enhancement for violating the district court\u2019s foreclosure order was impermissible double counting because the court\u2019s order was the basis of his conviction. The basis for King\u2019s conviction, however, was conversion of government property, not violation of the court's foreclosure order. Consequently, there was no double counting.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
