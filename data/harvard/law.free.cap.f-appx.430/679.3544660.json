The case is, therefore, submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-23\">Eric Wayne Dotson, a Georgia state prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals the denial of his \u201cMotion for Order Directing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>the U.S. Attorney General to Immediately Obtain Custody of Defendant.\u201d Construing Dotson\u2019s motion as a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, we reverse and remand to the district court with instructions to vacate its denial of relief and to dismiss the motion without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">This case requires consideration of the interaction of three separate sentences imposed against Dotson for a series of armed jewelry store robberies that occurred in several states from 1997 to 1998. Dotson outlines the following history of his incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">The state of Kentucky imposed the first of the three sentences at issue. Dotson asserts that he entered Kentucky state custody on June 4, 1998. ROA, Vol. 1 at 29. Dotson was convicted of robbery and sentenced to life imprisonment in the state of Kentucky on July 12, 1998. ROA, Vol. 2 at 15; <em>see also </em>ROA, Vol. 1 at 29. According to Dotson, this life sentence was subsequently reduced to thirty years\u2019 imprisonment. ROA, Vol. 1 at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">Then, on November 4, 1998, a federal grand jury in the Western District of Oklahoma returned an indictment charging Dotson with one count of interference with commerce by robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951, one count of using a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1), and one count of knowingly transporting at least $5,000 worth of stolen property in interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314. <em>Id. </em>at 13-15. Pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum, Dotson was transferred from Kentucky state custody to federal custody in the Western District of Oklahoma. ROA, Vol. 2 at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">After a jury trial in the Western District of Oklahoma, Dotson was convicted on all counts. ROA, Vol. 1 at 16. On December 10, 1999, the district court sentenced Dotson to a total of 322 months\u2019 imprisonment \u2014 142 months for robbery, 60 months for using a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence, and 120 months for knowingly transporting at least $5,000 worth of stolen goods in interstate commerce, \"with each term to be served consecutively.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 16-17. The judgment imposing this sentence specified that \u201call terms of imprisonment [were] to be served after any other sentence that he [wa]s presently serving.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17. After the district court imposed his federal sentence, Dotson was returned to Kentucky state custody to continue serving his Kentucky state sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 29. According to Dotson, \u201c[t]he U.S. Marshal\u2019s Sendee [then] lodged a detainer for the [federal] sentence ... with the state of Kentucky.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">Dotson was subsequently transferred from Kentucky state custody to Georgia state custody pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum. <em>Id. </em>In the state of Georgia, Dotson was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to twenty years\u2019 incarceration on June 16, 2000. <em>Id. </em>He was then returned to Kentucky state custody to continue serving his Kentucky state sentence. <em>Id. </em>Dotson asserts that, at that point, the state of \u201cGeorgia filed a detainer with the State of Kentucky.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>On September 2, 2004, after the state of Kentucky granted him parole from his Kentucky state sentence, Dotson was transferred to Georgia state custody to serve his Georgia state sentence. <em>Id. </em>Federal authorities filed a detainer with the state of Georgia in 2009. <em>Id. </em>at 31. Dotson unsuccessfully pursued several actions in Georgia state court asserting that he was improperly placed in Georgia state custody prior to his service of his federal sentence. Aple. Br. at 37-38 (Ex. 2). Dotson remains in Georgia state custody. Aplt. Br. at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">On November 10, 2010, Dotson filed his \u201cMotion for Order Directing the U.S. Attorney General to Immediately Obtain Custody of the Defendant\u201d in the Western District of Oklahoma. ROA, Vol. 1 at 29-32. In the motion, Dotson argued that he was improperly transferred to Georgia state custody after he was granted parole from his Kentucky state sentence and that, instead, he should have been placed in federal custody. In support, Dotson asserted that, because the federal detainer was filed with the state of Kentucky prior to the Georgia state detainer, he should have been placed in federal custody prior to Georgia state custody. <em>Id. </em>at 30. Further, he contended that his federal and his Georgia state sentences were to run concurrently. He explained that his federal sentence was to commence \u201cafter any other sentence that he [wa]s currently serving.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17. He reasoned that, because his Georgia state sentence had not been imposed at the time of his federal sentencing, <em>id. </em>at 30, the federal sentence necessarily was to run concurrent to his Georgia state sentence. He also noted that his Georgia state sentence was ordered to run \u201cconcurrent to both the Kentucky and federal sentences.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Thus, Dotson argued that his placement in Georgia state custody deprived him of his right to serve his federal and Georgia state sentences concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">On this basis, Dotson requested that the district court order federal authorities to immediately place him in federal custody and to award him credit against his federal sentence for the six years he erroneously spent in Georgia state custody. <em>Id. </em>at 32. Without analyzing its jurisdiction, the district court summarily denied Dotson\u2019s motion on December 10, 2010. <em>Id. </em>at 34. The district court reasoned that \u201c[Dotson] has not articulated sufficient cause for this Court to provide the extraordinary relief requested.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Dotson\u2019s notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s decision was filed on January 4, 2011. <em>Id. </em>at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">Because Dotson is proceeding pro se, we construe his pleadings liberally. <em>See Ledbetter v. City of Topeka, </em>318 F.3d 1183, 1187 (10th Cir.2003). There are two ways in which we could construe Dotson\u2019s \u201cMotion for Order Directing the U.S. Attorney General to Immediately Obtain Custody of Defendant\u201d: (1) as an application for a writ of mandamus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361; or (2) as a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 challenging the execution of his federal sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Dotson failed to establish the requisite conditions for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361. However, when construing Dotson\u2019s motion as a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, we conclude that the district court should have dismissed the motion without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">\n<em>A. Petition for writ of mandamus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">We first construe Dotson\u2019s motion as a request for a writ of mandamus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361, \u201c[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any action in the nature of mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.\u201d To be eligible for this relief, a petitioner must establish \u201c(1) that he has a clear right to relief, (2) that the respondent\u2019s duty to perform the act in question is plainly defined and peremptory, and (3) that he has no other adequate remedy.\u201d <em>Rios v. Ziglar, </em>398 F.3d 1201, 1206 (10th Cir.2005). We review de novo whether the conditions for issuing a writ of mandamus are satisfied. <em>Marquez-Ramos v. Reno, </em>69 F.3d 477, 479 (10th Cir.1995). We conclude that Dotson did not establish the requisite conditions for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Dotson\u2019s argument regarding the order in which the federal and Georgia state detainers were filed with the state of Kentucky does not evidence a clear right to relief. \u201c[T]he determination of custody and service of sentence between [two different sovereigns] is a matter of comity to be resolved by the executive branches of each sovereign.\u201d <em>Hernandez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>689 F.2d 915, 917 (10th Cir.1982). Federal and state authorities have broad discretion to determine the order in which a prisoner may serve his sentences. <em>See Hall v. Looney, </em>256 F.2d 59, 60 (10th Cir.1958) (per curiam). Detainers are filed to assure that a prisoner is not released from confinement until the jurisdiction asserting a right to custody has had an opportunity to act. We could locate no authority for Dotson\u2019s proposition that the sequence in which detainers are filed dictates the order sentences are to be served. Thus, Dotson\u2019s assertion that his federal detainer was filed prior to his Georgia state detainer does not establish the requisite conditions for relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">With regard to his argument that the federal and Georgia state sentences were to run concurrently, we conclude that Dotson had another adequate remedy available to him to pursue relief. As the government argues, Dotson could have asserted this argument in a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. This argument could be characterized as an attack on the execution of his federal sentence. <em>See Bradshaw v. Story, </em>86 F.3d 164, 166 (10th Cir.1996) (\u201cA petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 attacks the execution of a sentence .... \u201d); <em>see also United States v. Eccleston, </em>521 F.3d 1249 (10th Cir.2008) (considering a state prisoner\u2019s argument that he was \u201centitled to serve his sentence in the custody of the [Bureau of Prisons] and that his federal and state sentences must be served concurrently\u201d in a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241). Further, Dotson satisfies the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement for habeas purposes because \u201ca prisoner may challenge a sentence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>was imposed consecutively to his current sentence but which he has not yet begun to serve.\u201d <em>United States v. Miller, </em>594 F.3d 1240, 1242 (10th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). Because Dotson could have asserted this argument in a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, he cannot establish the requisite conditions for relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">\n<em>B. Habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 22U1</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">We alternatively construe Dotson\u2019s motion asserting that his federal and Georgia state sentences should run concurrently as a challenge to the execution of his federal sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, before we reach the merits, we note that Dotson filed his motion in the wrong federal district. \u201cA petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 ... must be filed in the district where the prisoner is <em>confined.\u201d Bradshaw, </em>86 F.3d at 166 (emphasis added). Dotson is currently incarcerated in the state of Georgia. Thus, the disti\u2019ict court in the Western District of Oklahoma lacked jurisdiction to consider this argument in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The \u201cjurisdictional defects that arise when a suit is filed in the wrong federal district may be cured by transfer under the federal transfer statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631, which requires a court to transfer such an action if the transfer is in the interest of justice.\u201d <em>Haugh v. Booker, </em>210 F.3d 1147, 1150 (10th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cNonetheless, ... a court is authorized [first] to consider the consequences of a transfer by taking a peek at the merits to avoid raising false hopes and wasting judicial resources that would result from transferring a case which is clearly doomed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">Based on our review of Dotson\u2019s motion and of the record, we conclude that a transfer is not in the interest of justice. \u201cThe exhaustion of available administrative remedies is a prerequisite for [28 U.S.C.]\u00a7 2241 habeas relief....\u201d <em>Garza v. Davis, </em>596 F.3d 1198, 1203 (10th Cir.2010). At no point does Dotson assert, and the record provides no evidence, that he pursued the available administrative relief within the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) prior to filing his motion in the district court. According to BOP Program Statement 5160.05 \u00a7 8, a BOP Regional Director may \u201cdesignate a state institution for concurrent service of a federal sentence\u201d when \u201cconsistent with the intent of the federal sentencing court or the goals of the criminal justice system.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A prisoner may request that BOP designate his state prison facility as the place of his federal confinement regardless of whether he is in state or federal custody. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 9(b)(4)(b) (\u201cThis type of request will be considered regardless of whether the inmate is physically located in either a federal or state institution.\u201d); <em>see also Eccleston, </em>521 F.3d at 1252 (discussing the BOP administrative relief that a state inmate pursued with regard to his undischarged federal sentence). Because Dotson has not pursued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>available administrative remedies, habeas relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 cannot be granted. Thus, we conclude that a transfer of his motion is not in the interest of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Construing Dotson\u2019s motion as a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, we reverse and remand to the district court with instructions to vacate its denial of the relief requested and to dismiss the motion without prejudice.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b702-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b703-9\">. Dotson directly appealed his convictions and sentence, and this court affirmed. <em>United States v. Dotson, </em>242 F.3d 391 (10th Cir.2000) (unpublished). Dotson then filed a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which the district court denied. <em>United States v. Dotson, </em>28 Fed.Appx. 801, 802 (10th Cir.2001) (unpublished). This court declined to grant a certificate of appealability with respect to the district court\u2019s denial of this motion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b704-5\">. Dotson noted, \"[t]he transcript of Georgia sentencing says the sentence is to be concurrent to both the Kentucky and federal sentences, but the Georgia court's final disposition is silent on the matter.\u201d ROA, Vol. 1 at 30. Further, the government provided documentation suggesting that the Georgia state sentence was to run consecutive to his federal sentence. Aple. Br. at 64. Thus, it is unclear whether the Georgia state court intended Dotson\u2019s Georgia state sentence to run concurrent to his federal sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b706-8\">. We note that, to the extent his motion is construed as a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 challenging the execution of his federal sentence, Dotson is not required to obtain a certificate of appealability to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of relief. <em>See Miller, </em>594 F.3d at 1241 (explaining that a state inmate challenging the execution of his federal sentence is not required to obtain a certificate of appealability).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b706-13\">. We note this BOP Program Statement only to suggest an avenue for exhaustion. We are not ruling on the merits of Dotson\u2019s contention that his <em>federal and </em>Georgia state sentences are to run concurrently.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
