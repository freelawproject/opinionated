Stafford, Jr., Senior United States District Judge for the Northern District of Florida, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b467-19\">SUTTON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b467-20\">A federal jury convicted Michael John Modena for unlawfully possessing a firearm. Each of the challenges to his conviction and sentence lack merit, and accordingly we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-22\">In 2008, Michigan State Police officers investigated Modena for filing fraudulent statements with the Michigan Secretary of State. <em>See </em>Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 440.9501(6). In accordance with a state search warrant, officers searched Modena\u2019s residence and discovered a nine-millimeter pistol, a bolt-action rifle and ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-23\">A federal grand jury indicted Modena on one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm and one count of being a domestic-violence misdemeanant in possession of a firearm. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), (9). Modena pleaded not guilty, and a jury found him guilty of both counts. The district court granted the government\u2019s motion to vacate the \u00a7 922(g)(9) conviction, calculated the guidelines range at 41 to 51 months and imposed a 72-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><em>Subject-Matter Jurisdiction. </em>At his arraignment and initial pretrial conference, Modena challenged the subject-matter jurisdiction of the district court, arguing that the Michigan county that issued the warrant was not \u201cconstitutionally chartered,\u201d R.216 at 9, depriving the court of jurisdiction over his case. Modena does not press the merits of this jurisdictional argument on appeal but instead claims that the trial court erred by failing to <em>consider </em>it. That is not true: The magistrate judge directly rejected the argument, noting that he \u201cd[id]n\u2019t see how any defect in the county\u2019s structure ... has any effect on\u201d the court\u2019s jurisdiction. R.216 at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\"><em>Prosecutorial Misconduct. </em>Several courts have held, and the government agrees, <em>see </em>R.155 at 1-2, that the subdivisions of \u00a7 922(g) do not support separate sentences for a single criminal act. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Richardson, </em>439 F.3d 421, 422 (8th Cir.2006) (en banc) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Munoz-Romo, </em>989 F.2d 757, 759-60 (5th Cir.1993); <em>cf. United States v. Throneburg, </em>921 F.2d 654, 657 (6th Cir.1990) (separate counts under \u00a7 922(g) for possessing ammunition and a firearm merge for sentencing). A district court thus cannot impose multiple punishments on a defendant who commits one act of possession yet is both a felon and a domestic-violence misdemeanant.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Modena accuses the government of prosecutorial misconduct for charging him with one count of \u00a7 922(g)(1) and one count of \u00a7 922(g)(9), knowing that Modena could not be sentenced on both counts. Yet the Supreme Court has approved this approach: \u201cthe Government may seek a multiple-count indictment\u201d for duplicitous counts even though \u201cthe accused may not suffer two convictions or sentences on that indictment.\u201d <em>Ball v. United States, </em>470 U.S. 856, 865, 105 S.Ct. 1668, 84 L.Ed.2d 740 (1985). That is what happened here, and Modena cites no authority to suggest the constitutional analysis changes when the prosecutor knows ahead of time that this may happen.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\"><em>Ineffective Assistance. </em>Modena initially chose to represent himself before the district court, but on the day of trial requested that his standby counsel, Richard Zamb\u00f3n, represent him. The court granted Modena\u2019s request, and Zamb\u00f3n agreed to the appointment. In Zambon\u2019s first act as defense counsel, he stipulated to Modena\u2019s prior felony and domestic-violence misdemeanor convictions. Modena claims Zamb\u00f3n provided ineffective assistance when he stipulated to the convictions. We \u201ctypically will not review a claim of ineffective assistance on direct appeal except in rare cases where the error is apparent from the existing record.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez-Medina, </em>461 F.3d 724, 737 (6th Cir.2006). Modena offers no good reason for departing from that practice here. His recourse is to file a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\"><em>Hybrid Representation. </em>Modena complains that the trial court violated his right to hybrid representation by prohibiting him from splitting trial responsibilities with Zamb\u00f3n. Yet the Constitution provides no such right. <em>See McKaskle v. Wiggins, </em>465 U.S. 168, 183, 104 S.Ct. 944, 79 L.Ed.2d 122 (1984) <em>(\u201cFaretta </em>[v. <em>California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975) ] does not require a trial judge to permit \u2018hybrid\u2019 representation.\u201d); <em>United States v. Treff </em>924 F.2d 975, 979 n. 6 (10th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\"><em>Requested Forms. </em>Before trial, Modena requested from the court 79 subpoena forms, 12 subpoena duces tecum forms, 5 blank arrest warrants, 5 deposition forms and several IRS tax forms. The district court denied his request and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>directed him to seek help from his standby counsel to obtain any necessary forms. Modena argues this decision violated his First Amendment right to access the courts and his Sixth Amendment right to present a defense. \u201cIn order to state a claim for interference with access to the courts, however, [an individual] must show actual injury,\u201d <em>Harbin-Bey v. Rutter, </em>420 F.3d 571, 578 (6th Cir.2005), and Modena has identified no argument he was unable to raise or any evidence he could not introduce due to the district court\u2019s order. As for the Sixth Amendment, the right to present a defense does not include the right to unlimited copies of whatever forms a defendant wants. No error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\"><em>Sentencing. </em>Modena challenges the procedural reasonableness of his sentence on two grounds: (1) the district court gave no \u201crationale\u201d or \u201cspecific findings of fact\u201d supporting its enhancements for possessing five firearms and for obstructing justice; and (2) the district court\u2019s twenty-one-month upward variance lacked support in the record. Both arguments come to naught.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Modena challenged his two-level enhancement for possessing five firearms on the ground that the \u201cgrand jury indictment only listed two firearms.\u201d R.206 at 19. The district court correctly noted that \u201c[f]or the purposes of sentencing ... the three additional firearms are an entirely separate matter.\u201d R.206 at 19. \u201c[T]he contemporaneous, or nearly contemporaneous, possession of uncharged firearms is relevant conduct in the context of a felon-in-possession prosecution.\u201d <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>516 F.3d 479, 483 (6th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3. Modena\u2019s presentence report shows that Modena possessed five firearms. In addition to the two guns that provide the basis for his conviction, Michigan State Police officers discovered three rifles at Modena\u2019s parents\u2019 residence. Modena\u2019s brother and father separately told officers that the rifles belonged to Modena, and officers found several of his belongings nearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">The same goes for Modena\u2019s obstruction-of-justice enhancement, which he opposed on the grounds that the police issued \u201cno speeding tickets\u201d to him and that the police reports did not corroborate that he was driving recklessly. R.206 at 19. The district court found that \u201cyour fleeing from law enforcement ... is well verified by the records in this case.\u201d R.206 at 22. When officers approached Modena, he drove off, \u201calmost striking the officers\u2019 unmarked vehicle.\u201d PSR \u00b6 22. In doing so, Modena \u201crecklessly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person in the course of fleeing from a law enforcement officer,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2, properly earning the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">The record also supports the district court\u2019s upward variance. Modena challenges the district court\u2019s conclusion that his offense was more serious than the typical felon-in-possession case. In explaining its sentence, the district court noted that Modena \u201chas over and over again expressed anti[-]government sentiments, including significantly misguided views about the criminal justice system and the individuals who operate within it.\u201d R.206 at 42. This conclusion finds support in the presentence report: Modena filed false UCC claims against two state-court judges, had \u201cmilitia ties,\u201d \u201cmade threatening statements referencing] a shootout with police and a possible barricade situation,\u201d fled from police and \u201cmade a pointing gesture\u201d toward a police officer \u201cwith his thumb and finger implying they were a gun.\u201d PSR \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, 21-23. When he fled from police, he \u201cattempt[ed] to return to the home where weapons were stored,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>which \u201cmight well have led to a serious, dangerous, perhaps even fatal confrontation.\u201d R.206 at 43. The district court reasonably considered these facts in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Modena also complains about the district court\u2019s statement that \u201cI\u2019m not confident that there\u2019s anything that the criminal justice system has to offer which would provide him with assistance in ... the rehabilitation sense.\u201d R.206 at 45-46. Modena believes that the district court improperly used this as a basis for a higher sentence, but nothing indicates the district court increased his sentence on this ground. <em>Cf. Tapia v. United States, </em>564 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2382, 180 L.Ed.2d 357 (2011). The district court made the statement while reviewing several of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u2014 in particular \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed ... to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D). Read in context, the court\u2019s statement shows it found the factor irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Also unavailing is Modena\u2019s substantive-reasonableness argument \u2014 that he committed no violence and that his age and family ties decrease his likelihood of recidivism. Yet only an abuse of discretion will allow us to \u201csubstitut[e] our judgment for that of the district court,\u201d <em>United States v. Hairston, </em>502 F.3d 378, 386 (6th Cir.2007), and nothing of the sort happened here in view of Modena\u2019s history of antagonism toward government officials, his efforts to evade capture and his attempt while fleeing police to return to the house where he had stored three rifles.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\"><em>Pro Se Arguments. </em>On top of the six issues raised by counsel, Modena submitted a <em>pro se </em>brief claiming that (1) a different person committed the offenses underlying his \u00a7 922(g) conviction; (2) the AUSA committed prosecutorial misconduct; (3) the attorneys below were in contempt of court; and (4) the district court deprived him of his speedy trial rights. We generally will not consider a defendant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>claims when he is represented by counsel, <em>see United States v. Williams, </em>641 F.3d 758, 770 (6th Cir.2011), and Modena\u2019s arguments at any rate change nothing. Three of them echo arguments raised by counsel, and Modena\u2019s speedy trial claim lacks any reference to relevant case law or to the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
