He was sentenced to 60 months imprisonment, the mandatory minimum sentence. He contends that the district court erred when it denied him safety-valve relief under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). Specifically, he argues that the court erred when it found that his sentencing testimony was untruthful and that it erred when it permitted hearsay testimony during sentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-15\">In early October 2009, a confidential informant set up a drug deal to purchase a kilogram of cocaine. Eventually it was determined that the Cl would meet with Eric Williams in a Lowe\u2019s parking lot to make the exchange.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On October 8, 2009, the Cl and Williams met in the Lowe\u2019s parking lot. Williams entered the Cl\u2019s car and the Cl \u201cflashed a roll of cash.\u201d Williams told the Cl that he would be able to deliver the cocaine within an hour. Williams then left the Cl\u2019s car and called Micklewhite, who possessed the cocaine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>It was decided that Micklewhite and Dennis Pierre, who had a loaded handgun containing 14 rounds of ammunition, would bring the cocaine to a mall parking lot where the transaction would be consummated.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Micklewhite and Pierre drove to the mall and pulled up next to Williams\u2019 car. Williams got out of his car, retrieved a black bag containing the cocaine from Micklewhite\u2019s car, and got back into his own car. Williams then drove his car to the other side of the mall parking lot where the Cl was waiting. Micklewhite drove his car to the same area of the parking lot and parked near Williams\u2019 car. While Williams got into the Cl\u2019s vehicle with the cocaine, Micklewhite and Pierre stayed in their car. The police then arrested them.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Micklewhite was charged with possessing with the intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine and conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine. He pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge, and the possession charge was dropped. Micklewhite\u2019s guidelines range was 46 to 57 months imprisonment. However, the mandatory minimum sentence for his crime was 60 months imprisonment. Micklewhite argued that he was entitled to safety-valve relief, which under certain circumstances permits the court to sentence a defendant below the mandatory minimum. The government argued that Micklewhite was not entitled to that relief because he had not truthfully provided the government with all the information concerning the offense. Specifically, the government argued that Micklewhite did not fully divulge his involvement in the transaction. His lack of candor included his claim that he was not acting as surveillance for Williams while Williams was finalizing the sale with the Cl and that he was not compensated for his involvement in the drug deal.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">At the sentence hearing the court heard testimony on whether the requirements for safety-valve relief had been met. First, Micklewhite testified about the events of October 8, 2010. He said that day Williams had called him and asked, \u201cCan you do me a favor? Can you take this thing from me until I call you when I\u2019m ready?\u201d Even though Micklewhite was unemployed and suspected that this was a drug deal, he claimed that he agreed to do this \u201cfavor\u201d for free. Later that day Williams called him and said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m ready. I brung [sic] the stuff to the Bro-ward mall.\u201d According to Micklewhite, this was convenient because he was already planning to go to the mall to buy some shoes. Micklewhite then met Williams at a gas station to get the cocaine from Williams, and he went to Pierre\u2019s house to wait for Williams\u2019 call.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">According to Micklewhite, shortly thereafter Williams called him to tell him to come to the mall with the cocaine. Micklewhite said that he told Williams that he did not want to be part of the deal, so they should meet on the \u201ceast side\u201d of the mall. Micklewhite drove to that part of the mall and gave Williams the cocaine. Williams then drove to another corner of the mall to meet with the Cl. Even though Micklewhite said that he wanted stay away from the drug deal, he claims that he coincidentally drove to that same corner of the mall where the drug deal was taking place because that area was closer to the shoe store he wanted to visit. And although Micklewhite stated in his plea agreement that he \u201cdrove to the same area ... [and] parked in close proximity\u201d to Williams\u2019 and the drug deal, Micklewhite testified at the sentence hearing that he did not even see Williams, Williams\u2019 car, or where the drug deal was occurring. Then, instead of get<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>ting out of the car and going to the shoe store, Micklewhite claimed that he and Pierre \u2014 who was carrying a loaded gun\u2014 coincidentally decided to stay in their car for a while next to where the drug deal was taking place. According to Micklewhite they were not acting as \u201csurveillance,\u201d but instead he wanted to smoke a cigarette before going into the shoe store.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">John Loges, a police officer, testified next. Although he was not personally at the crime scene, he spoke with the officers who were there and read their reports. He testified that at first Micklewhite parked his car next to Williams\u2019 car in the northeast corner of the mall parking lot. After Williams\u2019 retrieved a black bag from Micklewhite\u2019s car, Williams drove to a different part of the parking lot and far away from the entrance of the mall, which was where the Cl was waiting. Micklewhite immediately followed Williams\u2019 car to the other part of the parking lot and parked about 30 yards away. Officer Loges explained that even though there were plenty of parking spots closer to the entrance of the mall, Micklewhite parked near Williams\u2019 car, which was several hundred yards from the entrance.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">The district court did not think that Micklewhite\u2019s testimony made sense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-6\">He\u2019s going to the mall to buy sneakers. Why don\u2019t you smoke your cigarette right there and go into the mall? No, he drives the car, just so happens, to another parking area, just so happens to be right by where this deal is going down, and that\u2019s where he decides to sit and smoke his cigarette and go into the mall. If you want to smoke your cigarette and go into the mall, you stay where you are after you deliver a package, you smoke your cigarette and go into the mall. You don\u2019t drive to the same area where the drug deal is going down and then smoke your cigarette and then go into the mall. You see, it just doesn\u2019t fit, doesn\u2019t make sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">Micklewhite\u2019s attorney responded by arguing that Micklewhite\u2019s testimony was so unbelievable that it must be believed: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense. I agree with you it doesn\u2019t make sense ...., which frankly is why it has to be truthful, because it doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">The court disagreed. Focusing on Micklewhite\u2019s own testimony, the court denied Micklewhite\u2019s request for safety valve-relief. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-10\">I don\u2019t believe his testimony about the surveillance. It doesn\u2019t make any sense. He lied about it. He lied about not following the car, he lied about how long \u2014 you know, why he parked there. That\u2019s just not truthful. Why, I don\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t make sense. But I think the reason ... [hje\u2019s not admitting to things about this limited case and the limited facts in this case that would get him Safety Valve is because it leads to admissions about other activities that he wants to somehow protect himself from or not admit to.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-11\">Micklewhite appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-13\">\u201cThe question of whether the information [a defendant] supplied to the government [at] his sentencing was truthful and complete [ ] is a factual finding for the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Brownlee, </em>204 F.3d 1302, 1305 (11th Cir.2000). We review factual findings regarding safety-valve relief for clear error. <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>106 F.3d 1553, 1557 (11th Cir.1997). We will not find clear error unless the record leaves us \u201cwith the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>335 F.3d 1314, 1319 (11th Cir.2003) (citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>The safety-valve provision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a) enables sentencing without regard to the statutory minimum for certain offenses if five criteria are met. <em>See United States v. Milkintas, </em>470 F.3d 1339, 1344-45 (11th Cir.2006). The only issue here is whether Micklewhite met the fifth criterion, which required him to have \u201ctruthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence [he] ha[d] concerning the offense.... \u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a)(5). The burden is on the defendant to show that he meets all the criteria. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>375 F.3d 1300, 1302 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Based on Micklewhite\u2019s own nonsensical and incredible testimony, the district court found that he did not meet his burden of proving that he truthfully provided the government with all information related to his participation in the drug deal. Micklewhite responded by arguing that he had met his burden because \u201cfrankly ... it has to be truthful, because it doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d That argument, like the testimony it describes, does not make any sense. The district court did not clearly err.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">Micklewhite did not object to the district court\u2019s decision to permit Loges\u2019 hearsay testimony at the sentence hearing. If a defendant did \u201cnot raise [an] argument before the district court, we review it only for plain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Dudley, </em>463 F.3d 1221, 1227 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cUnder plain error review, there must be (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) affects substantial rights. When these three factors are met, [this Court] may exercise discretion and correct the error if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">The district court did not err, much less plainly err, by admitting Loges\u2019 testimony. \u201cA court may consider any information (including hearsay), regardless of its admissibility at trial, [at sentencing] provided that the information is sufficiently reliable.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>183 F.3d 1291, 1301 (11th Cir.1999). The testimony of a police officer that is based on police reports and discussions with other officers who were at the event is sufficiently reliable. And even if the district court erred by admitting Loges testimony, that error did not affect Micklewhite\u2019s substantial rights because the court did not rely on that testimony when it denied Micklewhite\u2019s safety-valve relief. Instead, the court denied that relief based on Micklewhite\u2019s inconsistent and nonsensical testimony. The district court did not plainly err.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b824-8\">. Micklewhite also argues that the district court violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment by permitting that hearsay testimony to be introduced at sentencing. He conceded, however, that \"any panel of this Court is bound to reject [his] Confrontation Clause argument.\u201d See <em>United States v. Cantellano, </em>430 F.3d 1142, 1146 (11th Cir.2005) (\"The right to confrontation is not a sentencing right.\u201d). We agree, and thus reject that argument. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b824-16\">. Two other people, Pedro Quintero and Wilbert Benoit, were also involved in the transaction, but they are not discussed further in this opinion because they are not relevant to any of the issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b824-17\">. It is not clear when Micklewhite came into possession of the cocaine. It is undisputed, however, that Micklewhite had the cocaine and brought it to Williams.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
