United States, </em>506 U.S. 534, 539, 113 S.Ct. 933, 122 L.Ed.2d 317 (1993). Long\u2019s testimony was not \u201cessential exculpatory evidence.\u201d Nor was Kyzar convicted on the basis of \u201crub off\u2019 evidence; most of the evidence was common to both defendants, and even if it were proper to consider the post-trial juror interview, the interview does not show the jury was unable to consider the evidence against each defendant separately. In fact, the jury acquitted Kyzar on two counts. Neither the state\u2019s requirement that Kyzar share peremptory challenges with Long, nor the empaneling of a death-qualified jury, violated any clearly established right to a fair trial. <em>See Stilson v. United States, </em>250 U.S. 583, 585-86, 40 S.Ct. 28, 63 L.Ed. 1154 (1919); <em>see also Buchanan v. Kentucky, </em>483 U.S. 402, 420, 107 S.Ct. 2906, 97 L.Ed.2d 336 (1987). Finally, the trial court\u2019s admission of autopsy photographs was not unreasonable because they were relevant to establish Kyzar\u2019s role in the conspiracy and its objective. Thus, clearly established rights were not offended by the state court\u2019s determination, singly, or overall.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">The trial transcript was lodged in this court, and we prefer in this case for the district court in the first instance to review portions relevant to Kyzar\u2019s insufficiency of the evidence claim. For this limited purpose, we vacate the judgment and remand. The panel will retain jurisdiction over an appeal, if any, from the order on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b653-13\">Because Kyzar has not made a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d on the remaining issues, we decline to grant a certificate of appealability. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-14\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART. The parties shall bear their own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b653-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
