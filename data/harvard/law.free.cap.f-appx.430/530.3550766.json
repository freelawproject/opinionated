He was found to have violated a policy of the Indiana Department of Corrections prohibiting inmates from \u201cgiving to or accepting from any person anything of value without proper authorization.\u201d Ind. Dep\u2019t of Corr., No. 02-04-101 app. I, Manual of Policies and Procedures (2004). At first the Department sanctioned Herbst with a loss of good-time credit and a written reprimand, but it suspended the good-time sanction after an internal appeal, and because the suspended sanction expired after six months, the Department never imposed the sanction. After exhausting his administrative remedies, Herbst petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, arguing that the disciplinary deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>mination was supported by insufficient evidence to comport with due process. He contends that the disciplinary determination inevitably lengthened his period of confinement by disqualifying him from receiving a good-time credit for completing his associate\u2019s degree. He cites the Department\u2019s manual and a corresponding Indiana statutory provision, under which he contends that the prison \u201cmay\u201d grant to inmates one year of good-time credit for receiving the degree if they have \u201cone (1) year clear of two (2) or more Class B conduct reports at the time of program completion.\u201d Ind. Dep\u2019t of Corr., No. 01-04-101, Manual of Policies and Procedures (2009); Ind.Code \u00a7 35-50-6-3.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The district court denied Herbst\u2019s petition after concluding that the disciplinary violation could not have prolonged his confinement, citing two other class B offenses that disqualified him from the education-based credit. Alternatively, the court concluded that the disciplinary determination rested on sufficient evidence to comply with the demands of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">We requested supplemental memoranda concerning whether Herbst\u2019s case is now moot. Our initial review showed that he was released from prison in September 2010, and the original record did not mention if Herbst continued to suffer collateral consequences from his disciplinary conviction. <em>See Cochran v. Buss, </em>381 F.3d 637, 641 (7th Cir.2004); <em>White v. Ind. Parole Bd., </em>266 F.3d 759, 762-63 (7th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Herbst\u2019s petition is moot. Article III of the federal constitution limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts to hearing cases or controversies that remain \u201clive\u201d throughout the lawsuit. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998); <em>Liner v. Jafco, Inc., </em>375 U.S. 301, 306 n. 3, 84 S.Ct. 391, 11 L.Ed.2d 347 (1964). Herbst\u2019s parole supervisor explains in an affidavit that his office \u201cdischarged [Herbst] from parole on October 12, 2010, and that Mr. Herbst is no longer under the supervision of this office.\u201d Herbst does not dispute that he is no longer in custody. He contends, nonetheless, that his case remains live because the disciplinary conviction disqualified him from receiving good-time credits for obtaining his associates degree, and those credits might have ended his incarceration a year earlier. But he concedes that the prison manual and state statute provide only that he \u201cmay\u201d receive credits for obtaining his degree. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. 2 (citing Ind.Code \u00a7 35-50-6-3.3 and Ind. Dep\u2019t of Corr., No. 01-04-101, Manual of Policies and Procedures (2009)); Appellant\u2019s Suppl. Mem. 1-2. The mere possibility that his sentence \u201cmay\u201d have been shortened had Herbst been eligible to receive discretionary credits does not revive his case because only decisions that \u201cinevitably affect the duration of his sentence,\u201d <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 487, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995); <em>Higgason v. Farley, </em>83 F.3d 807, 809 (7th Cir.1996), are actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">Because Herbst cites no other reason that the controversy over his disciplinary conviction remains \u201clive\u201d despite his expired sentence, the judgment of the district court is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED with instructions to dismiss it as moot. <em>See, e.g., Department of the Treasury v. Galioto, </em>477 U.S. 556, 106 S.Ct. 2683, 91 L.Ed.2d 459 (1986); <em>United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., </em>340 U.S. 36, 71 S.Ct. 104, 95 L.Ed. 36 (1950).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
