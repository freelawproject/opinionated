In the first appeal, this Court vacated an order denying Miller\u2019s request to amend his complaint to include additional defendants and reversed the dismissal of Miller\u2019s claim about a \u201cno talking\u201d rule, but we affirmed the dismissal of Miller\u2019s claim about retaliation and \u201cthe remainder of Miller\u2019s complaint.\u201d <em>Miller v. Conway, </em>331 Fed.Appx. 664 (11th Cir.2009). On remand, the district court allowed Miller to amend his complaint to add claims against District Attorney Daniel Porter and Deputy Captain Alan Craig, but the district court dismissed those claims for failure to state a claim. The district court also granted summary judgment against Miller\u2019s claim that Deputy Sheriff R.L. Conway and FNU Fergurson had been liable as supervisors for the \u201cno talking\u201d rule imposed by a third officer. To determine the status of his claim of retaliation against Deputy Sheriff J. Land, Miller filed a motion for clarification. The district court explained that it had \u201cdismissed [Miller\u2019s] retaliation claim against Land\u201d and, because \u201cthe Eleventh Circuit [had] affirmed the dismissal of [the] complaint on all claims except the no-talking rule claim,\u201d Miller\u2019s \u201cretaliation claim against Land was, and remains, dismissed.\u201d Miller now appeals the dismissal of his claims against Land and Craig. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-21\">We read Miller\u2019s brief to challenge two rulings of the district court, but both of his arguments fail. First, Miller erroneously argues that the district court misinterpreted our previous decision. This Court af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>firmed the dismissal of Miller\u2019s claims about retaliation by Land, <em>Miller, </em>331 Fed.Appx. at 665, and under the law of the case doctrine, Miller is barred from relitigating our holding unless \u201c \u2018(1) a subsequent trial ... produce[d] substantially different evidence, (2) controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of law applicable to [his claim], or (3) the prior decision was clearly erroneous and would work manifest injustice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Joshi v. Fla. State Univ. Health Ctr., </em>763 F.2d 1227, 1231 (11th Cir.1985) (quoting <em>Wheeler v. City of Pleasant Grove, </em>746 F.2d 1437, 1440 (11th Cir.1984)). Miller does not argue that any of these exceptions apply. Second, Miller challenges the dismissal of his claim that Craig offered and then failed to advise Miller about the investigation of Land\u2019s alleged retaliation, but Miller failed to \u201callege a specific federal right violated by\u201d Craig. <em>Doe v. Sch. Bd. of Broward Cnty., Fla., </em>604 F.3d 1248, 1265 (11th Cir.2010). Miller also argues, for the first time on appeal, that Craig is subject to supervisory liability for deliberately disregarding Land\u2019s alleged retaliation, but we will not consider a theory of liability never presented to the district court. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Siv. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">The dismissal of Miller\u2019s complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
