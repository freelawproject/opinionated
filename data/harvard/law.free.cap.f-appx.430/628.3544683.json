The district court properly dismissed Meyers\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claims against defendants Brooms, Allianee Title Reverse Mortgage and Brooms\u2019 attorneys because they did not act under color of state law. See Price <em>v. State of Hawaii, </em>939 F.2d 702, 707-08 (9th Cir.1991) (private parties do not generally act under color of state law for \u00a7 1983 purposes); <em>Polk County v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 318 n. 7, 102 S.Ct. 445, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981) (noting that a private attorney, even one appointed by the court, does not act under the color of state law for purposes of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 when performing the traditional role of an attorney).</p>\n<p id=\"AMM\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b650-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
