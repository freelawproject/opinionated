He received a sentence of 46 months in prison, to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release. On appeal, Caldera challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that his prior drug conviction was \u201cdouble-counted,\u201d as it was used in both his criminal history and as a specific offense characteristic. He maintains that because the applicable Guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, was not empirically based, it does not warrant a presumption of reasonableness. Caldera maintains that his sentence was too harsh given the minor nature of an illegal reentry offense, his benign motives for returning to the United States, and his plans for his family to join him in Mexico that should preclude future illegal entries.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-22\">We have rejected Caldera\u2019s challenges to the lack of empirical data supporting \u00a7 2L1.2 and the double counting of his criminal history. <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009). Additionally, the \u201cinternational trespass\u201d argument raised by Caldera does not justify disturbing an otherwise presumptively reasonable sentence. <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-24\">Caldera\u2019s disagreement with the guidelines sentence imposed does not suffice to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir.2008). The district court considered the factors argued by Caldera and found that they did not outweigh other sentencing considerations, which does not constitute \u201ca clear error of judgment\u201d in the court\u2019s weighing of the various sentencing factors. <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1930, 176 L.Ed.2d 397 (2010). Consequently, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b377-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
