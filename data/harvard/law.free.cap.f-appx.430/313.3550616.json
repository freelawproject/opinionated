The jury found that Maynor had been fired in retaliation for activity protected by the FLSA. Following the verdict, the district court granted Dow\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law on the retaliation claim, finding that there was insufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to have found that Maynor had been fired because of his engagement in protected activity. Maynor appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-21\">We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment as a matter of law, finding that Maynor failed to present a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find retaliation, for the reasons essentially as stated in the district court\u2019s thorough and well-considered July 19, 2010, Memorandum Opinion. While Maynor\u2019s oral complaint constituted protected activity under the FLSA,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the district court\u2019s judgment as a matter of law was proper because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>\u201cfacts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly\u201d in favor of Dow\u2019s explanation of the reasons for Maynor\u2019s termination that \u201creasonable men could not arrive at a contrary verdict.\u201d <em>Boeing Co. v.
