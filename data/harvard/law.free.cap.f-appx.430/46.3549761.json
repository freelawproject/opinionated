Oct. 29, 2010). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that such motions are \u201cdisfavored.\u201d <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 322-23, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992)). There is no dispute that Lin\u2019s April 2010 motion to reopen was untimely because her administrative order of removal became final in 2007. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Although Lin contends that the time and number limitations do not apply to her motion to reopen as it is \u201cbased on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality,\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(e)(3)(ii), her arguments are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Lin asserts that she presented evidence both that she had converted to Christianity and that conditions for Christians in China have recently worsened. However, as the BIA found, Lin\u2019s alleged conversion to Christianity was a change in her personal circumstances, not a change in country conditions. <em>See Yuen Jin v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 143, 155 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Moreover, there is no indication that the BIA ignored any material evidence Lin submitted. <em>See Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 169 (2d Cir.2008); <em>see also Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 337 n. 17 (2d Cir.2006). The record supports the BIA\u2019s determination that, although China has engaged in discrimination and abuse against Christians, Lin failed to establish that conditions in China had changed fundamentally since her merits hearing, as required to warrant reopening. <em>See Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 167 (2d Cir.2007); <em>Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 342. Therefore, we find no abuse of discretion in the BIA\u2019s denial of Lin\u2019s motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot and the temporary stay is VACATED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
