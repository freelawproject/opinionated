We have jurisdiction to review this matter pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that the Tax Court abused its discretion when it denied the Government permission to intervene pursuant to Rule 24(b)(2). We will remand to the Tax Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-15\">On April 1, 2010, Appleton filed a timely Tax Court Petition to challenge as void the tax assessments leveled against him by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) because, inter alia, the assessments were imposed after the expiration of the statute of limitations, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501(a). Under Section 932 of the Internal Revenue Code, Virgin Islands residents, like Appleton, are required to pay income tax dmectly to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (\u201cBIR\u201d), not the IRS, pursuant to the \u201cmirror code\u201d, where the term \u201cVirgin Islands\u201d is substituted for the \u201cUnited States\u201d in the Internal Revenue Code. Yet, the IRS retains audit and assessment powers. Congress also enacted a specific provision directing that if a taxpayer\u2019s income is \u201cderived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>from sources within the Virgin Islands or income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the Virgin Islands,\u201d the taxpayer is entitled to certain tax credits pursuant to the Virgin Islands Economic Development Program (\u201cEDP\u201d), which is authorized by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 934.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Appleton took advantage of the credits available through the EDP when calculating his income tax payable to the BIR for the tax years 2002-2004. On November 25, 2009, the IRS delivered a notice of deficiency to Appleton in relation to these tax years, despite the existence of \u00a7 6501(a), the three-year statute of limitations on assessments. The IRS has taken the position, pursuant to a \u201cChief Counsel Advice\u201d memorandum, that the \u201cstatute of limitations on assessment in section 6501(a) does not begin to run until a return is filed with the IRS,\u201d not the BIR. It is this position by the IRS, and the resulting assessments on Virgin Islands taxpayers, that caused the Government to file a motion, dated June 18, 2010, seeking to intervene for the purposes of the statute of limitations issue, either as of right pursuant to Rule 24(a)(2), or in the alternative, permissively, pursuant to Rule 24(b)(2). The Government argued that a ruling in favor of the IRS on the statute of limitations issue would have a chilling effect on the EDP, as it leaves open to question and subject to audit the tax returns of those taking advantage of the program for an extended period of time. On November 1, 2010, the Tax Court denied the Government\u2019s motion by memorandum opinion and order. The Tax Court reasoned that the Government\u2019s interest was insufficient to warrant intervention of right, and, because the statute of limitations issue is a cornerstone of Appleton\u2019s defense, permitting the Government to intervene would be redundant and would risk delay. As alternative relief, the Tax Court did grant the Government the right to file an amicus brief. Despite this, on November 23, 2010, the Government appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">We need not rule on the issue of intervention of right because we conclude that, at the very least, the Government should have been permitted to intervene under Rule 24(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Under Rule 1(b) of the United States Tax Court Rules of Practice and Procedure, in the absence of express rule, the Tax Court \u201cmay proscribe the procedure, giving particular weight to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to the extent that they are suitably adaptable to govern the matter at hand.\u201d We can discern no reason why permissive intervention pursuant to Rule 24(b)(2) should not be available to parties in the Tax Court. <em>Sampson v. Commissioner, </em>710 F.2d 262, 264 (6th Cir.1983); <em>Estate of Dixon v. Commissioner, </em>666 F.2d 386, 388 (9th Cir.1982). Rule 24(b)(2) requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">On timely motion, the court may permit a federal or state governmental officer or agency to intervene if a party\u2019s claim or defense is based on:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-10\">(A) a statute or executive order administered by the officer or agency; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-11\">(B) any regulation, order, requirement, or agreement issued or made under the statute or executive order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">Additionally, the Tax Court is directed by Rule 24(b)(3) that, when \u201cexercising its discretion, the court must consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the original parties\u2019 rights.\u201d Thus, permissive intervention under Rule 24 requires (1) the motion to be timely, (2) the potential intervener be a \u201cfederal or state governmental officer or agency\u201d, (3) the issue must be based on a statute, executive order, or regulation which is administered by the entity, and (4) the intervention may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>cause undue delay or prejudice to the original parties\u2019 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The first and second requirements are easily satisfied here. The third requirement also appears to be satisfied, as Appleton\u2019s tax assessments are based on an income calculation which takes into account credits created pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 934, under the Government\u2019s EDP. It is, thus, the last requirement that is at issue, namely the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion that the Government\u2019s request should be denied due to what in its view would amount to a redundancy of the issues and a resulting delay in the resolution of the underlying matter. Specifically, the Tax Court noted in its opinion that the \u201cmovant has neither demonstrated that its participation as a party is necessary to advocate for an unaddressed issue nor shown that its intervention will not delay the resolution of this matter.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This, however, is not the appropriate standard to consider when deciding to allow a party to permissively intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">While any intervention could potentially cause delay, Rule 24(b) requires the court to consider whether this intervention will cause \u201cundue delay,\u201d or \u201cprejudice the adjudication of the original parties rights.\u201d The redundancy noted by the Tax Court due to identity of interest should only be a bar to intervention when it has the adverse effect of \u201cundue delay\u201d or \u201cprejudice.\u201d <em>See Hoots v. Commonwealth of Pa., </em>672 F.2d 1133, 1136 (3d Cir.1982)(\u201c[W]here ... the interests of the applicant in every manner match those of an existing party and the party\u2019s representation is deemed adequate, [a court] is well within its discretion in deciding that the applicant\u2019s contributions to the proceedings would be superfluous and that any resulting delay would be \u201cundue.\u201d \u201d). That is not the case here. There is no support for the notion that any delay here would be \u201cundue,\u201d or that the Government\u2019s arguments would prejudice either Appleton or the IRS. While the issue that concerns both the Government and Appleton is the same, namely, the statute of limitations, the Government\u2019s interest in the proceedings is certainly different from Appleton\u2019s interest in dealing with this one-time tax adjustment. The fact that the Government\u2019s interest is somewhat different detracts from the argument that the proceedings will be \u201credundant.\u201d To the contrary, they will be complementary and the Government\u2019s interest will bolster Appleton\u2019s argument. As to the \u201cdelay,\u201d any introduction of an intervener in a case will necessitate its being permitted to actively participate, which will inevitably cause some \u201cdelay.\u201d \u201cUndue\u201d means not normal or appropriate. <em>Webster\u2019s II New Riverside University Dictionary </em>1259 (1988). Here, there may be additional discovery needed due to the Government\u2019s being in the case, but it would seem to be highly appropriate that time be allowed in order to consider the evidence it brings forth regarding this issue of importance not only to Appleton, but to others, including the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">While we do not decide the \u201cright\u201d of the Government to intervene, we cannot ignore its interest. The Government\u2019s interest is based on its desire to protect the Virgin Islands tax structure, or more accurately, the EDP. This interest was granted by Congress to give the Virgin Islands a mechanism to improve its economy. The Government urges that its interest, and the potential harm from the IRS\u2019s audits, is great, citing statistics that the EDP amounted to 20% of the Virgin Islands budget and 8% of its employment prior to the commencement of the delayed audits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>and assessments. Moreover, the Appleton case could set a precedent as to future statute of limitation challenges if the IRS is successful in the Tax Court on the issue. Rule 24(b)(2) specifically provides for governments to protect their interests in matters in litigation; here, that interest is very real and is different from Appleton\u2019s, and any delay caused by their participation in the case will inure to Appleton\u2019s benefit, not prejudice. Moreover, the IRS has not asserted that its ability to adjudicate its rights would be prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Accordingly, it is clear to us that the Tax Court abused its discretion by not considering whether the Government\u2019s intervention would cause \u201cundue delay\u201d or \u201cprejudice.\u201d Additionally, as Congress thought it important enough to afford the Government this mechanism to improve its economy, and the Rule permits it to protect its interest through intervention, we will direct the Tax Court to allow the Government of the Virgin Islands to intervene in Appleton\u2019s proceedings pursuant to Rule 24(b)(2). Therefore, we will remand this matter to the Tax Court, and require that the Government of the Virgin Islands be permitted to intervene pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 24(b)(2).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b158-9\">. Venue is appropriate in this Court under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482(b)(1)(A), as Arthur Appleton, the Petitioner in the underlying Tax Court proceedings, is a legal resident of the Virgin Islands.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b160-6\">. The IRS\u2019 fear that this litigation will be delayed lies in stark contrast to its own desire to delay the commencement of proceedings by doing away with the statute of limitations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b161-6\">AMBRO, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AWB\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">I agree with my colleagues\u2019 conclusion that the Tax Court has the discretion to allow permissive intervention pursuant to Rule 24(b)(2), but disagree that the Tax Court abused its discretion in denying permissive intervention here.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">As the majority points out, permissive intervention under Rule 24 requires (1) a timely motion to intervene by (2) a federal or state governmental officer or agency (3) raising an issue that is based on a statute, executive order, or regulation that is administered by the entity; in addition, (4) intervention must not cause undue delay or prejudice to the initial parties\u2019 rights. I agree that the first two requirements are easily satisfied here. Contrary to my colleagues\u2019 view, the third requirement was contested by the Internal Revenue Service.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, I shall assume (as did the Tax Court) that the V.I. Government meets the third requirement, as my disagreement is with the majority\u2019s analysis of the fourth.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">Although it did not use the precise phrases \u201cundue delay\u201d and \u201cprejudice,\u201d the Tax Court concluded that the V.I. Government\u2019s intervention would result in just that. Thus, a careful reading of the Tax Court\u2019s opinion refutes the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[t]here is no support for the notion that any delay here would be \u2018undue,\u2019 or that the [V.I.] Government\u2019s arguments ... would prejudice ... the IRS.\u201d As the Tax Court reasoned,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-12\">[Appleton] has raised the period of limitations issue, and we presume the mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>ter will be fully vetted during the normal course of these proceedings. For [the V.I. Government] to participate in this case as a party solely to make an argument that [Appleton] has already identified as a matter central to his case would introduce a redundancy into the proceedings.... Were we to grant the motion to intervene, [the V.I. Government] would become a party to the proceeding in this Court and have the right to introduce documentary evidence, call its own witnesses, and cross-examine witnesses of the other parties. Such participation, as a practical matter, could result in trial complications as well as delay the resolution of this issue in which [the V.I. Government] asserts an interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">A20-21. Because the Court found that the V.I. Government\u2019s interests would be well represented by Appleton, who has counsel and \u201chas made the expiration of the section 6501(a) period of limitations a cornerstone of his case,\u201d it concluded that the redundancy, complications, and delay arising from the V.I. Government\u2019s intervention would be undue, and would prejudice the IRS. <em>Id. </em>at 19. When viewed together with the fact that the Tax Court permitted the V.I. Government to file an <em>amicus curiae </em>brief, I do not believe this was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">My colleagues characterize the V.I. Government\u2019s interest in this case as a desire to protect legitimate, congressionally sanctioned use of its Economic Development Program (\u201cEDP\u201d). I am skeptical. They cite the V.I. Government\u2019s statistics that the EDP accounted for 20% of its budget and 8% of employment in the V.I. prior to the IRS\u2019 delayed audits and assessments. But they fail to mention that the IRS only began audits after it discovered widespread abuse of the EDP. Thus, we cannot attribute a decline in participation to a fear of endless audits, as opposed to the IRS\u2019 investigation of possible fraudulent use of the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">My colleagues also fail to mention that in 2006 the IRS promulgated a regulation that \u201cfixes\u201d the statute of limitations problem of which the V.I. Government complains. Under Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.932-1(c)(2)(h), the IRS allowed the filing of territorial income tax returns to trigger the start of the limitations period under \u00a7 6501.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the issue about which the V.I. Government expresses ongoing alarm no longer exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">It is true, as the majority states, that \u201cRule 24(b)(2) specifically provides for governments to protect their interests in matters in litigation.... \u201d However, by allowing the V.I. Government to submit an <em>amicus cwiae </em>brief, I believe the Tax Court provided it sufficient opportunity to do so. In sum, because I disagree that the Tax Court failed to consider, or erred by concluding, that the Government\u2019s intervention would cause undue delay, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b161-8\">. The majority states that Appleton\u2019s tax assessments incorporate credits pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 934, which falls under the Virgin Islands' Economic Development Program, and thus is administered by the V.I. Government. The IRS argues that this is irrelevant and incorrect. It is irrelevant because the statute of limitations question does not implicate \u00a7 934, which states that the V.I. Government may only reduce tax liability if it is attributable to income connected with a V.I. trade or business. It is incorrect because \u00a7 934 is not in the \"mirror code\u201d (the version of the Internal Revenue Code that applies to V.I. residents, in which the term \"Virgin Islands\u201d is substituted for \"United States\u201d), and subsection 934(b) says that the Secretary of the United States Treasury shall promulgate regulations to define whether income is derived from sources in the V.I. or connected with a V.I. trade or business. As the IRS notes, \u201d[w]hile I.R.C. \u00a7 934 may provide the [V.I.] with guidance as to its tax structure, the Commissioner \u2014 not the [V.I. Government]\u2014 administers the provisions of that provision.\" IRS Br. 64.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b162-6\">. This regulation treats territorial returns as federal returns for statute of limitations purposes, provided that the United States Government and the V.I. Government have entered into an agreement allowing for the routine exchange of income tax information, which they have. <em>See </em>I.R.S. Notice 2007-31, 2001-1 C.B. 971. I cannot help but wonder if, prior to the IRS\u2019 audits, the V.I. Government declined to share territorial returns with the IRS. If that were the case, the V.I. Government\u2019s position would mean that the IRS was prevented practically from auditing Virgin Islands taxpayers before expiration of the limitations period. Surely we can all agree that the IRS has the right, and indeed the obligation, to investigate illegitimate use of tax incentives.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
