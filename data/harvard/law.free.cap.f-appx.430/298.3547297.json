The district court granted summary judgment because the Mississippi Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission has already ruled on Miller\u2019s claim for compensation, which is thus barred under the doctrine of res judicata. In its thorough Memorandum Opinion dated December 16, 2010, 2010 WL 5232422, the court held that Miller has not presented evidence that OneBeacon acted in bad faith or that she is entitled to punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-21\">We have reviewed the briefs and pertinent portions of the record and have consulted the applicable law. The summary judgment is AFFIRMED, essentially for the reasons stated by the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b320-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
