He asserts that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing during sentencing to re-urge his written objection to the presentence report\u2019s recommendation that Pinon be denied a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel generally \u201ccannot be resolved on direct appeal when [they have] not been raised before the district court since no opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006). Because the record before us is not sufficiently developed, we decline to address the issue on direct appeal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">Additionally, Pinon asserts that the district court erred under Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure by failing to rule on his written objection. We find no plain error, as the court adopted the presentence report. <em>See United States v. Carreon, </em>11 F.3d 1225, 1231 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b321-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
