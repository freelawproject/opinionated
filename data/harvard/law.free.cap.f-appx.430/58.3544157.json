Schoppert, which denied Huang\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Yi Mei Huang, </em>No. A088 527 724 (B.I.A. Apr. 28, 2010), <em>affg </em>No. A088 527 724 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 13, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-13\">Under the circumstances of this case, we review both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions \u201cfor the sake of completeness.\u201d <em>Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); see <em>also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). For asylum applications, such as Huang\u2019s, governed by the REAL ID Act, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of her account, or inconsistencies in her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-14\">Contrary to Huang\u2019s position, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. The IJ reasonably relied on a number of bases in finding Huang not credible, including Huang\u2019s demeanor. The Court grants \u201cparticular deference\u201d in applying the substantial evidence standard to credibility findings based on demeanor. <em>Dong Gao v. B.I.A., </em>482 F.3d 122, 126-27 (2d Cir.2007). Such deference is appropriate given that the IJ\u2019s ability to observe the witness places him in the best position to evaluate credibility. <em>See Jin Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Jus</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number><em>tice, </em>426 F.3d 104, 113 (2d Cir.2005). Here, the IJ noted that \u201cit was [his] impression particularly when testifying on direct examination that [Huang] was testifying not about real life, lived experiences, but from a script.\u201d He further observed, \u201con cross-examination, [Huang] frequently asked that questions be repeated and her demeanor suggested to me that she was seeking to buy time to formulate an answer to the questions.\u201d We defer to the IJ\u2019s findings here. <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The IJ also reasonably based his decision on implausibilities in Huang\u2019s testimony. In making a finding that an applicant\u2019s claim is implausible, an IJ is not required to \u201cexplain in precise detail what made each identified act implausible.\u201d <em>Wensheng Yan v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 63, 67 (2d Cir.2007) (per curiam). Rather, if \u201cthe reasons for [the IJ\u2019s] incredulity are evident,\u201d the implausibility finding is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>While \u201cbald\u201d speculation is an impermissible basis for an adverse credibility finding, \u201c[t]he speculation that inheres in inference is not \u2018bald\u2019 if the inference is made available to the factfinder by record facts, or even a single fact, viewed in the light of common sense and ordinary experience.\u201d <em>Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 168-69 (2d Cir. 2007). Here, the IJ reasonably found it implausible, given her alleged devout Christian beliefs and participation in church activities, that Huang did not baptize her baby who was born in the United States and did not have a Christian wedding ceremony. Huang\u2019s explanations for these seeming implausibilities were not so compelling that a reasonable fact-finder must credit them. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005). Thus, as the IJ\u2019s finding is based on Huang\u2019s own contradictory testimony, and is therefore \u201ctethered to record evidence,\u201d <em>Wensheng Yan, </em>509 F.3d at 67, the finding is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The agency also relied on an inconsistency in reaching its adverse credibility determination. As the IJ noted, Huang testified that she worked at a plant in China from September 2004 to January 2006, when she was fired after being detained for her participation in underground church activities. However, Huang had submitted a household registration booklet from 2005 that indicated that she was a student at that time. The IJ reasonably found that this inconsistency undermined Huang\u2019s credibility. Huang offered explanations; however, \u201ca petitioner must do more than offer a plausible explanation for his inconsistent statements to secure relief; he must demonstrate that a reasonable fact finder would be <em>compelled </em>to credit his testimony.\u201d <em>Majidi, </em>430 F.3d at 80 (emphasis in original) (internal citations omitted). Therefore, the agency was not required to credit Huang\u2019s explanation for this discrepancy. <em>See id. </em>at 80-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Finally, Huang claims that the IJ erred in discounting her unauthenticated documents from China. However, this claim is unavailing, as the weight afforded to the applicant\u2019s evidence in immigration proceedings lies largely within the discretion of the IJ. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 342 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Because Huang\u2019s claims were all based on the same factual predicate, the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was a proper basis for the denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>tion is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
