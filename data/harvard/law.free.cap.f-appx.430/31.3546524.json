POOLER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b54-10\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">Appellant Anthony Pip\u00f3la, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals from the district court\u2019s final order denying his petition for a writ of <em>audita querela </em>under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a), and moves for appointment of counsel and leave to proceed in forma pauperis. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-12\">As an initial matter, and for the reasons discussed below, we deny Pipola\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel and leave to proceed in forma pauperis because Pipola\u2019s petition fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of a writ of <em>audita querela. United States v. Richter, </em>510 F.3d 103, 104 (2d Cir.2007) (per curiam). \u201cThe All Writs Act is a residual source of authority to issue writs that are not otherwise covered by statute.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania Bureau of Correction v. U.S. Marshals Serv., </em>474 U.S. 34, 43, 106 S.Ct. 355, 88 L.Ed.2d 189 (1985). As a result, \u201c[wjhere a statute specifically addresses the particular issue at hand, it is that authority, and not the All Writs Act, that is controlling.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-15\">Here, the writ of <em>audita querela </em>is not an available remedy, because, as a federal prisoner challenging the legality of his conviction, the relief Pip\u00f3la seeks is covered by statute: 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a). <em>See also Cephas v. Nash, </em>328 F.3d 98, 103 (2d Cm. 2003) (\u201c[Fjederal prisoners challenging the legality of their convictions or sentences must proceed by way of motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255....\u201d). This conclusion is not undermined by the fact that any Section 2255 motion filed by Pip\u00f3la must satisfy the threshold requirements applicable to successive Section 2255 motions, as he has already filed a Section 2255 motion challenging the conviction at issue that was denied on the merits. <em>See Quezada v. Smith, </em>624 F.3d 514, 517 (2d Cir.2010) (defining when a Section 2255 motion is \u201csecond or successive\u201d under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996); <em>Sines v. Wilner, </em>609 F.3d 1070, 1073 (10th Cir.2010) (\u201c[T]he remedy under \u00a7 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective merely because the statute greatly restricts second or successive motions.\u201d); <em>United States v. Valdez-Pacheco, </em>237 F.3d 1077, 1080 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cA prisoner may not circumvent valid congressional limitations on collateral attacks by asserting that those very limitations create a gap in the postconviction remedies that must be filled by the common law writs.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-16\">Accordingly, Pip\u00f3la must present his claims in an application for leave to file a successive Section 2255 motion. Even if we construe Pipola\u2019s notice of appeal and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>appellate brief as such an application, we cannot consider it unless the application \u201cis based on newly discovered evidence or a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Fabian, </em>555 F.3d 66, 68 (2d Cir. 2009); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h). Because Pip\u00f3la has not made such a showing in this appeal, we may not grant Pip\u00f3la leave to file a successive Section 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">We have considered all of Pipola\u2019s arguments on appeal and have found them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
