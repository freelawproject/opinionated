Carretero challenges the district court\u2019s decision to depart upward pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. He argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing objectives of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">Because Carretero did not object to his sentence in the district court, review is for plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). To demonstrate plain error, Carretero must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error but only if it \u201c \u2018seriously affeet[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">Carretero has failed to demonstrate that his 70-month sentence is substantively unreasonable. The district court\u2019s stated reasons for its decision to impose a departure advances \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s objectives of promoting respect for the law and providing deterrence and are justified by the facts of the case. <em>See United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347-48 (5th Cir.2006). Further, Carretero\u2019s 70-month sentence represents a 19-month upward departure from the top of his advisory guidelines range and is within the statutory maximum. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1326. We have affirmed far more substantial departures than the one imposed in this case. <em>See e.g., United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 491-93 &amp; n. 40 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Saldana, </em>427 F.3d 298, 312 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-17\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b323-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
