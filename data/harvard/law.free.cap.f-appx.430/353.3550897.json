Herrera argues that the district court erred by imposing a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 based on the finding that he was an organizer or leader of the offense and by denying him a two-level \u201cminor role\u201d decrease under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. He contends that he himself received orders from another of his co-conspirators, Guillermo Lopez-Nunez.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">Section 3Bl.l(c) authorizes a two-level increase in a defendant\u2019s offense level \u201c[i]f the defendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in any criminal activity.\u201d We review the district court\u2019s determination that Herrera was an organizer or leader of the offense for clear error. <em>See United States v. Cabrera, </em>288 F.3d 163, 173 (5th Cir.2002) (per curiam). There may be more than one leader or organizer in a criminal organization or conspiracy. <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>274 F.3d 230, 247 (5th Cir.2001). Thus, even if Lopez-Nunez was a leader, this does not preclude a finding that Herrera also was a leader or organizer of the criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-16\">The facts contained in the presentence investigation report (PSR), which are uncontested by Herrera, reflect that Herrera was involved in deciding how and by whom undocumented aliens would be transported, he was involved in obtaining the payments for the alien smuggling, and he recruited others to help him do so. The PSR also reflects that Herrera directed others to transport, harbor, and feed undocumented aliens. The PSR supports a finding that Herrera directed at least one other person in the conspiracy. Such a finding is sufficient to support the enhancement. <em>United States v. Curtis, </em>635 F.3d 704, 720 (5th Cir.2011). Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in applying the organizer or leader enhancement. <em>See Cabrera, </em>288 F.3d at 174-75. Nor did the district court clearly err in finding that Herrera did not play a minor role in the offenses for purposes of a downward adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203-04 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b376-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
