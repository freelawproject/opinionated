Jack Minicone, Jr., a federal prisoner serving a term of incarceration imposed by United States District Court for the Northern District of New York, argues in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition that sentencing counsel was ineffective for failing to argue for a lower sentence based on an amendment to the United States Sentencing Guidelines \u2014 and, further1, because the same counsel represented Minicone in his first 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 action in the Northern District of New York,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that he should be allowed to file in this Circuit via \u00a7 2241, as counsel could not have been expected to raise an ineffectiveness claim against himself. Minicone avers that \u00a7 2255 is thus \u201cinadequate and ineffective,\u201d <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e), and that its application to his situation would render AEDPA an unconstitutional suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. The District Court denied the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-17\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. In reviewing the denial of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition, we \u201cexercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its findings of fact.\u201d See <em>O\u2019Donald v. Johns, </em>402 F.3d 172, 173 n. 1 (3d Cir.2005); see <em>also United States v. Friedland, </em>83 F.3d 1531, 1542 (3d Cir.1996) (\u201cOur review of the district coux't\u2019s order denying ... relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 is plenary.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-18\">As a basic matter, Minicone is not correct in his assertions of either \u00a7 2255\u2019s ineffectiveness or its as-applied unconstitutionality. There is no constitutional right to counsel in collatex-al proceedings. See <em>Pennsylvania v. Finley, </em>481 U.S. 551, 555, 107 S.Ct. 1990, 95 L.Ed.2d 539 (1987); <em>Virgin Islands v. Warner, </em>48 F.3d 688, 692 (3d Cir.1995). Thus, errors by counsel in collateral proceedings \u2014 and, by extension, \u201cconflicts of interest\u201d of this sort \u2014 do not implicate the Sixth Amendment. If Mini-cone believed counsel to be ineffective at the time of his fh\u2019st collateral attack, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>had the options of retaining alternative counsel or proceeding <em>pro se. </em>His decision to proceed with original counsel, and the consequences deriving therefrom, do not implicate a constitutional failure in the implementation of AEDPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Moreover, it is well settled that \u201c[m]otions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 are the presumptive means by which federal prisoners can challenge their convictions or sentences that are allegedly in violation of the Constitution.\u201d <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir. 2002). The 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) \u201csafety valve\u201d exception applies only if \u201cremedy by [\u00a7 2255] motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of ... detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). Inadequacy is not presumed simply because procedural requirements present an impediment to filing, as is the case here. <em>See Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538-39 (3d Cir.2002).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rather, proper use of the \u00a7 2255(e) as a method for invoking \u00a7 2241 is limited to rare circumstances, such as when a petitioner \u201chad no earlier opportunity to challenge his conviction for a crime that an intervening change in substantive law [negated].\u201d <em>See In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Here, Minicone had a full and fair opportunity to raise ineffectiveness claims in his first 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, and was on notice via the plain language of the statute that successive attempts to attack his conviction or sentence would be subject to the heightened AEDPA bar. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h). And since he is not prevented from pursuing a \u00a7 2255 motion, \u201chabeas corpus relief is unavailable.\u201d <em>Application of Galante, </em>437 F.2d 1164, 1165 (3d Cir.1971) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">As no substantial issue is before us, we will invoke our authority under Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6 to summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court. <em>See United States v. Rhines, </em>640 F.3d 69, 71 (3d Cir.2011). Appellee\u2019s motion for summary action, to the extent that it requests independent relief, is denied as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-15\">. <em>Minicone v. United States, </em>No. 5:97-cv-00519 (N.D.N.Y.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b108-6\">. Indeed, Minicone has filed multiple \u00a7 2255 motions, as well as motions for resentencing under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). <em>See generally Minicone v. United States, </em>353 F.Supp.2d 316, 319 (N.D.N.Y.2005); <em>Minicone v. United States, </em>No. 01-CV-1969, 2002 WL 418031, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4012 (N.D.N.Y.
