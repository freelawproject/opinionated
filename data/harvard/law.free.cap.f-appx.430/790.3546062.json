The district court concluded Watson failed to show KFS\u2019s non-discriminatory reason for firing him was pretext for racial discrimination or retaliation. We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Watson argues KFS\u2019s articulated reason was based on \u201ctimeline fraud,\u201d in that KFS supported its motion with undated and intentionally misdated documents. The inquiry into pretext requires this Court to determine whether, \u201cin view of all the evidence, ... the plaintiff has cast sufficient doubt on the defendant\u2019s proffered nondiscriminatory reasons to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the employer\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons were not what actually motivated its conduct.\u201d <em>Combs v. Plantation Patterns, </em>106 F.3d 1519, 1538 (11th Cir.1997) (quotation omitted). The plaintiff must meet the employer\u2019s reason \u201chead on and rebut it.\u201d <em>Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1088 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">\u201cA reason is not pretext for discrimination \u2018unless it is shown <em>both </em>that the reason was false, <em>and </em>that discrimination was the real reason.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brooks v. Cnty. Com\u2019n of Jefferson Cnty., Ala., </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1163 (11th Cir.2006) (citing <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 515, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993)). An employee may do that \u201ceither directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Ala. State Tenure Comm\u2019n, </em>405 F.3d 1276, 1289 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-11\">Title VII also prohibits employers from retaliating against an employee who complains about a Title VII violation. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). If a plaintiff establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation and the employer proffers a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action, the plaintiff must then demonstrate that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is a pretext for retaliation. <em>Holifield v. Reno, </em>115 F.3d 1555, 1566 (11th Cir.1997) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-12\">The district court did not err when granting summary judgment because Watson was unable to show KFS\u2019s articulated reason for firing him \u2014 that he threatened violence in the workplace, which was a ground for immediate termination under KFS\u2019s policies \u2014 was pretext for race discrimination or retaliation. There was ample evidence to show Watson was involved in an altercation with a co-worker, and KFS\u2019s investigation confirmed at least one witness heard Watson physically threaten the co-worker. Thus, KFS had a good faith belief Watson violated company policy, and he presented no evidence to rebut KFS\u2019s articulated reasons for firing him. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b813-8\">.
