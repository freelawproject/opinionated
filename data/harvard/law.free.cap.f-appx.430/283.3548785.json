Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). Head has served the sentence of imprisonment imposed upon revocation, and the district court imposed no further term of supervised release. Therefore, Head has no \u201cconcrete and continuing injury,\u201d and there is no case or controversy over which this court may exercise jurisdiction under Article III, \u00a7 2, of the Constitution. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 14, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-23\">The appeal is DISMISSED as MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b305-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
