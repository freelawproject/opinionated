We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for an abuse of discretion, <em>Ferdik v.

Marin Park, Inc., </em>356 F.3d 1058, 1065 (9th Cir.2004) (plaintiffs failure to amend complaint or notify court of intent to stand on unamended complaint justifies dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-19\">Winters\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Winters\u2019s emergency motion, filed on July 8, 2010, is construed as a motion to supplement the opening brief and to supplement the record on appeal, and is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b648-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
