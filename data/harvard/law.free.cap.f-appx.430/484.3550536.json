Stafford, Jr., Senior United States District Judge for the Northern District of Florida, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b506-19\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b506-20\">The petitioner-appellant, Clayton Crowe, appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment denying his petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-21\">Crowe is currently serving a sixty-year sentence in federal prison. Because he suffers from heart and kidney ailments, Crowe asked the Director of the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) to file a motion in federal court seeking a compassionate release as permitted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(l)(A)(i). The BOP denied his request. After pursuing administrative remedies without success, Crowe filed a petition \u2014 styled as a \u00a7 2241 petition \u2014 in the district court, seeking an order requiring the BOP to file a motion for compassionate release with the sentencing court in North Carolina. The district court correctly determined that \u00a7 2241 does not provide subject matter jurisdiction over Crowe\u2019s petition. The district court also correctly determined that, even if viewed as a request for review of agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701-706, Crowe\u2019s petition lacks merit because federal courts have no authority to review or countermand the BOP\u2019s decision <em>not </em>to seek a compassionate release for an inmate. Crowe filed a timely appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-23\">The BOP has the authority to seek a modification of a prisoner\u2019s sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A)\u00ae, which provides that a federal court \u201cmay not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except that ... in any case ... the court, <em>upon motion of the Director of the [BOP], </em>may reduce the term of imprisonment ... if it finds that ... extraordinary and compelling reasons war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>rant such a reduction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The statute places no limits on the BOP\u2019s authority to seek or not seek a sentence reduction on behalf of a prisoner, nor does it define \u2014 or place any limits on \u2014 what \u201cextraordinary and compelling reasons\u201d might warrant such a reduction. The BOP, in other words, has broad discretion in its decision to move the court for a sentence modification under \u00a7 3582(c)(l)(A)(i).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Based on this broad grant of discretion, a number of courts have determined that the BOP\u2019s decision regarding whether or not to file a motion for compassionate release is judicially unreviewable. <em>See Fernandez v. United States, </em>941 F.2d 1488, 1493 (11th Cir.1991) (holding that the BOP\u2019s decision whether to seek a compassionate release under the predecessor to \u00a7 3582(c)(l)(A)(i) was unreviewable); <em>Simmons v. Christensen, </em>894 F.2d 1041, 1043 (9th Cir.1990) (same); <em>Turner v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>810 F.2d 612, 615 (7th Cir.1987) (same); <em>Crawford v. Woodring, </em>No. CV 08-362-GW, 2009 WL 6575082, at *6 (C.D.Cal. Dec. 11, 2009) (dismissing as unreviewable prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 2241 request for an order directing the BOP to move for early release under \u00a7 3582(c)(l)(A)(i)); <em>Gutierrez v. Anderson, </em>No. 06-1714, 2006 WL 3086892, at *4 (D.Minn. Oct. 30, 2006) (same); <em>see also Engle v. United States, </em>26 Fed.Appx. 394, 397 (6th Cir.2001) (holding that the district courts lack \u201cjurisdiction to <em>sua sponte </em>grant compassionate release\u201d and that \u201c[a] district court may not modify a defendant\u2019s federal sentence based on the defendant\u2019s ill health, except upon a motion from the Director of the Bureau of Prisons\u201d). Consistent with these decisions, we hold that a federal court lacks authority to review a decision by the BOP to not seek a compassionate release for an inmate under \u00a7 3582(c)(l)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">The judgment of the district court denying Crowe\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-6\">. Crowe argues, on various grounds, that the breadth of discretion granted to the BOP by \u00a7 3582(c)(l)(A)(i) is unconstitutional. Crowe\u2019s arguments in this regard are frivolous and we decline to address them.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
