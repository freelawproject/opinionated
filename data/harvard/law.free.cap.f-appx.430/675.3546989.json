He was sentenced to 96 months imprisonment. Finding no issues warranting an appeal, his counsel submitted an Anders<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brief and motion for leave to withdraw as counsel. Counsel provided Cortes-Regalado with copies of both documents and the Clerk of this Court informed Cortes-Regalado he could respond within thirty days, raising any arguments neglected by counsel. <em>See </em>10th Cir. R. 46.4(B)(2). He did not file a response. Because we agree with counsel that there are no meritorious issues, we grant the motion to withdraw and dismiss the appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">On December 12, 2009, Cortes-Regalado was arrested for his part in the smuggling of 1.1 kilograms of methamphetamine from Colorado to Utah. He was indicted for one count of possession of methamphetamine with the intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On June 23, 2010, Cortes-Regalado pled guilty to the charge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The presentence investigation report (PSR) determined the base offense level was 36 under the applicable 2009 edition of the Sentencing Guidelines Manual for possession with the intent to distribute 1.1 kilograms of methamphetamine. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(2). Because Cortes-Regalado was safety-valve eligible under USSG \u00a7 5C1.2, the base offense level was reduced by two levels. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(ll). After a three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, the total offense level was 31. With a Criminal History Category of I, the advisory guideline range was 108 to 135 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">At the sentencing hearing, the court agreed Cortes-Regalado was entitled to the safety valve adjustment permitting him to \u201cescape[] the 10-year minimum mandatory\u201d sentence. (R. Vol. II at 24.). Defense counsel argued Cortes-Regalado was also entitled to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-11\">an additional two-point adjustment [for] minor role ... [because he only was] asked ... to come to Colorado ... to help drive a truck back to Utah, that he assisted in driving the truck from Colorado to Utah, but that he didn\u2019t have anything to do with setting up the transaction that led to the need for the truck to be transported, and that he was not present at the scene of the actual transaction .... I think that all the evidence is that he didn\u2019t set up the actual drug transaction that is the subject of this prosecution. He wasn\u2019t present for it. He didn\u2019t transport the drugs to it. He was back at the house having delivered a red truck to the house and having helped to unload the drugs out of the red truck into a garage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number><em>(Id. </em>at 25.) In sura, counsel characterized Cortes-Regalado as \u201ceffectively operating as[a] mule[ ] for drugs going one way and money going the other and that none of it really belong[ed] to [him], and [he was just one of the] cogs in a wheel.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">The government, on the other hand, viewed the situation as \u201ca fairly typical pipeline drug trafficking case involving a confidential informant and a few individuals who all had different roles in the process\u201d that were \u201cimportant.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 28-29.) It also pointed out that although Cortes-Regalado was \u201cmaybe not the biggest drug dealer in the history of the world ... he\u2019s still part of a drug deal that\u2019s involving thousands of dollars and multiple pounds of methamphetamine, and he\u2019s crossing statelines.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 30.) The court agreed with the government, stating \u201c[t]he cases I\u2019ve read and the guidelines I think suggest that this is not a minor role.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 34.) Nonetheless, the court concluded it would \u201ccut [Cortes-Regalado] a slight break on the [\u00a7 ] 3553 [factors] in terms of deterrence and protection and so on and what\u2019s adequate and sentence him to 96 months.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Under <em>Anders, </em>\u201cif counsel finds his [client\u2019s] case to be wholly frivolous, after a conscientious examination of it, he should so advise the court and request permission to withdraw.\u201d 386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. With his motion to withdraw, counsel must submit \u201ca brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant must have the opportunity to review counsel\u2019s brief and \u201craise any points that he chooses\u201d to the court. <em>Id. </em>The court must then conduct a full examination of the record to determine \u201cwhether the case is wholly frivolous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the court concludes the case is frivolous, it may grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and dismiss the appeal. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Calderon, </em>428 F.3d 928, 930 (10th Cir.2005) (discussing <em>Anders </em>procedure).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">After fully examining the record, we see two potential issues which might arguably support an appeal: (1) whether CortesRegalado was entitled to a minor role reduction in his sentence; and (2) whether his sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">\u201cWe review for clear error the district court\u2019s refusal to award a defendant minor or minimal participant status.\u201d <em>United States v. Bowen, </em>437 F.3d 1009, 1018 (10th Cir.2006). Under the guidelines, a defendant is entitled to a two-level downward adjustment if he \u201cwas a minor participant in any criminal activity.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3B1.2(b) (2009 edition). The guideline is intended to provide \u201ca range of adjustments for a defendant who plays a part in committing the offense that makes him substantially less culpable than the average participant.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3B1.2 comment. (n.3(A)). The defendant\u2019s culpability \u201cinvolves a determination that is heavily dependent upon the facts of the particular case.... [As a result,] the court, in weighing the totality of the circumstances, is not required to find, based solely on the defendant\u2019s bare assertion, that such a role ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>justment is warranted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2 comment. (n.3(C)).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The court did not err in denying Cortes-Regalado a \u201cminor role\u201d status. Cortes-Regalado submitted a \u201cStatement by Defendant in Advance of Plea of Guilty\u201d wherein he admitted \u201c[o]n or about November 15, 2009 ..., I knowingly aided and abetted others in possessing 1.3 kilograms [1.1 kilograms actual] of total methamphetamine ... with the intent to distribute it.\u201d (R. Vol. I at 14.) His admissions were confirmed at the plea hearing. [R. Vol. II at 16-17] While at sentencing defense counsel argued CortesRegalado was \u201ceffectively operating as [a] mule[ ],\u201d the government pointed out he had \u201cnearly $2000 on his person\u201d when he was arrested. (R. Vol. II at 26, 29.) The government maintained his role was \u201cimportant:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-6\">[I] t is clear that [Cortes-Regalado] did meet with [a co-defendant] at some point in Colorado, and he took the affirmative step to get into a truck with a hidden compartment to drive that truck across statelines with a couple pounds, multiple pounds of methamphetamine in it. They then went to a house and found a person to stay with in the Ogden area, and then they went to meet with this informant. And for a couple hours, Mr. CortesRegalado was meeting with the other two individuals and this informant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-7\"><em>(Id.) </em>We agree this activity did not warrant a minor role reduction as Cortes-Regalado\u2019s conduct was not substantially less culpable than the average participant.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">Turning to the reasonableness of Cortes-Regalado\u2019s sentence, we review sentences for procedural and substantive reasonableness, giving deference to the district court under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Cortes-Regalado\u2019s sentence is reasonable in both procedure and substance. The district court correctly calculated the advisory guideline range as 108 to 135 months. It then considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and concluded a sentence <em>below </em>the advisory guideline range was appropriate. The district court\u2019s sentence was within \u201cthe bounds of permissible choice, given the facts and the applicable law\u201d and therefore a proper exercise of its discretion. <em>United States v. McComb, </em>519 F.3d 1049, 1053 (10th Cir.2007) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">After a careful review of the record and relevant law, we agree with counsel \u2014 there are no arguably meritorious claims. We GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b698-7\"> The parties have waived oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir.

Our jurisdiction derives from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), which permits appeals from a sentence: (1) \"imposed in violation of law\u201d; (2) \"imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines\u201d; (3) \"greater than the sentence specified in the applicable guideline range\u201d; or (4) \"imposed for an offense for which there is no sentencing guideline and is plainly unreasonable\u201d and from 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, which permits \"appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-17\">In his <em>Anders </em>brief, Cortes-Regalado\u2019s counsel candidly suggests (as he is required to do) we lack \"jurisdiction to consider the appeal because Cortes-Regalado, in pleading guilty, agreed to a specific sentencing range, and the sentence was not imposed in violation of law or as a result of an incorrect application of the guidelines, or was greater than the sentence set forth in the agreement.\u201d <em>(Anders </em>Br. at 4-5.) He relies on <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number><em>Silva, </em>which explains that under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C), the parties may, in structuring a guilty plea, \u201cagree that a specific sentence or sentencing range is the appropriate disposition of the case, ... (such a recommendation or request binds the court once the court accepts the plea agreement.).\u201d 413 F.3d 1283, 1284 (10th Cir.2005) (quotations omitted). <em>Silva </em>goes on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-8\">Where a defendant agrees to and receives a specific sentence, that defendant may only appeal the sentence if it was (1) imposed in violation of law, (2) imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the guidelines, or (3) is greater than the sentence set forth in the plea agreement. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and (c); <em>United States v.

Otherwise, we do not have jurisdiction over the appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AH-U\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-9\">Here, other than what was informally agreed upon between the government and Cortes-Regalado in his \"Statement by Defendant in Advance of Guilty Plea,\u201d our review of the record indicates there was no formal plea agreement as contemplated by Rule 11(c)(1)(C). Furthermore, there was no specific sentence or sentencing range agreed upon by the parties. Accordingly, <em>Silva </em>is inapplicable.

Defense counsel considers the reduction from the applicable 108 to 135 month guideline range to be a departure, but we construe it as a variance.
