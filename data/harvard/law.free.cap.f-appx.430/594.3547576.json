Oden, a California state prisoner, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition challenging his jury conviction of first degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Oden contends he was charged with a gun <em>use </em>enhancement, the penalty for which is ten years, but was convicted of and sentenced for a gun <em>discharge </em>enhancement carrying a twenty-five-years-to-life penalty for which he did not receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>notice. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">The Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant the right to be informed of the nature and cause of the charges made against him so as to permit adequate preparation of a defense. <em>See In re Oliver, </em>333 U.S. 257, 273, 68 S.Ct. 499, 92 L.Ed. 682 (1948); <em>Cole v. Arkansas, </em>333 U.S. 196, 201, 68 S.Ct. 514, 92 L.Ed. 644 (1948). In this case, the amended information\u2019s recitation of the overt acts with respect to Count II as well as the jury instructions from the first trial gave Oden sufficient notice of the greater \u201cgun discharge\u201d enhancement pursuant to California Penal Code \u00a7 12022.53(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Nothing in <em>Cole, </em>333 U.S. 196, 68 S.Ct. 514, or <em>De Jonge v. Oregon, </em>299 U.S. 353, 57 S.Ct. 255, 81 L.Ed. 278 (1937), the Supreme Court cases relied upon by Oden, clearly limits the constitutionally-required notice to the four corners of the charging document. The California Court of Appeal\u2019s decision, therefore, was not \u201ccontrary to\u201d or \u201can unreasonable application of\u2019 clearly established Federal law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>see also Carey v. Musladin, </em>549 U.S. 70, 77, 127 S.Ct. 649, 166 L.Ed.2d 482 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b617-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
