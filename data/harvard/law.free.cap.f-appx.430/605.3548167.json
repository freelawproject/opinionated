We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Zehatye v. Gon</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number><em>zales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir. 2006), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">In his opening brief, Houhannesyan fails to raise any substantive challenge to either the agency\u2019s dispositive determination that his asylum claim was time-barred, or to the agency\u2019s denial of his CAT claim. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (issues not supported by argument are deemed abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that the beating Houhannesyan suffered by unidentified assailants did not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2003) (isolated incident of physical violence did not compel a finding of past persecution). Further, substantial evidence supports the agency finding that Houhannesyan failed to establish his fear of future harm was objectively reasonable. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1018 (9th Cir.2003) (possibility of future persecution too speculative). Accordingly, Houhannesyan\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b628-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
