He argues that the district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> erred in applying an eight-level enhancement for committing a sex offense against a minor while unregistered.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-20\">Bevins was convicted of sexual abuse in a 1999 Iowa state-court proceeding. From January 2010 through March 2010, he knowingly failed to register and update his registration as required by the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 16901-16991. On May 17, 2010, Bevins pleaded guilty to failing to register as a sex offender during that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-21\">A defendant\u2019s offense level must be increased by eight levels if the defendant, while in an unregistered status, committed a sex offense against a minor. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 2A3.5(b)(l)(C). At the sentencing hearing on the failure-to-register charge, the district court heard testimony regarding whether Bevins had committed a sex offense against a minor while unregistered. J., an eleven-year-old boy, testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Bevins had assaulted him when he was ten years old. J. testified that while he was in the bathtub one day, his mother entered the bathroom and asked if Bevins could use the toilet. J. agreed, and Bevins entered the bathroom. According to J., Bevins pulled the shower curtain back, grabbed J.\u2019s penis, and threatened to kill him and his mother if J. reported the incident to anyone. J.\u2019s mother and Bevins testified that Bevins had entered the bathroom while J. was taking a bath, but Bevins denied touching or threatening J. The district court found J.\u2019s testimony credible and applied the eight-level enhancement called for by \u00a7 2A3.5(b)(l)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Bevins argues that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that he committed a sex offense against J. Moreover, he contends that the district court clearly erred in crediting J.\u2019s testimony that Bevins grabbed J.\u2019s penis. We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and its credibility determinations are \u201cvirtually unreviewable on appeal.\u201d <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>512 F.3d 1004, 1005-06 (8th Cir.2008). J.\u2019s testimony established that Bevins had committed a sex offense, in violation of- Iowa Code \u00a7 709.3 or \u00a7 709.8, or both. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.5(b)(1)(A) &amp; app. n. 1 (defining \u201csex offense\u201d by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16911(5)); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16911(5)(A)(i)-(ii) (defining \u201csex offense\u201d as \u201c(i) a criminal offense that has an element involving a sexual act or sexual contact with another\u201d and \u201c(ii) a criminal offense that is a specified offense against a minor\u201d); Iowa Code \u00a7\u00a7 709.1, 709.3, 709.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Bevins has failed to convince us that the district court\u2019s finding that he had committed a sex offense was \u201cinternally inconsistent or. based on testimony that is incoherent, implausible, or contradicted by objective evidence in the case,\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>254 F.3d 692, 695 (8th Cir.2001). Although the district court found that J.\u2019s testimony regarding whether Bevins lived with J. and his mother not credible, it explained that \u201cyou can understand J., who has been bounced around from house to house and really doesn\u2019t have a house to call his own, would be concerned about getting his mom in trouble and not being able to live with his mom.\u201d Sentencing Tr. 160:13-17. The district court\u2019s finding that some of J.\u2019s testimony was credible, while other parts of it were not, was not internally inconsistent. <em>See United States v. Boyce, </em>564 F.3d 911, 916 (8th Cir.2009). J.\u2019s testimony about what occurred in the bathroom was also not incoherent, implausible, or contradicted by objective evidence. Thus, the district court did not clearly err in crediting J.\u2019s testimony or in finding that it was sufficient to support increasing Bevins\u2019s offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.5(b)(l)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b573-13\">.

Because Bevins failed to present any meaningful argument in support of two additional claims raised in his opening brief, he has waived appellate review of those claims. <em>See Chay-Velasquez v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 751, 756 (8th Cir.2004) (\"Since there was no meaningful argument on this claim in his opening brief, it is waived.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
