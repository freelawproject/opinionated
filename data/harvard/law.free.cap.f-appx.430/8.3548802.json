R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-18\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under [Fed.R.Civ.P.] 12(b)(6).\u201d <em>Harris v. Mills, </em>572 F.3d 66, 71 (2d Cir.2009). We consider the legal sufficiency of the complaint, taking its factual allegations to be true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b30-19\">Having conducted a <em>de novo </em>review of the record in light of these principles, we affirm the judgment below for substantially the same reasons stated by the District Court in its decision, which is as well-reasoned as it is brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-20\">We have considered all of Gutierrez\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
