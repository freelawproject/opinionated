We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and exercise a plenary standard of review. <em>State Auto Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Pro Design, P.C., </em>566 F.3d 86, 89 (3d Cir.2009). Because this appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-15\">The underlying factual allegations in this case are relatively straightforward. Assadourian is an entertainment promoter. He sought to sign defendant Amro Diab, a popular Egyptian singer, to perform in the United States and Canada, and to this end, negotiated with Diab\u2019s then-agent, Ashraf Fouad (who is now deceased), throughout 2004 and 2005. Assadourian claims that he and Fouad reached an oral agreement in April 2005; however, in September 2005, Diab signed a written contract with a rival promoter, defendant Youssef Harb, and ultimately performed in North America under that contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-16\">Assadourian filed a pro se complaint in which he alleged that Harb had tortiously interfered with his prospective contract with Diab and engaged in unlawful business practices, and that Harb and Diab had engaged in an unlawful conspiracy. Assadourian then amended his complaint twice, retained counsel, and amended the complaint a third time. In the third amended complaint, he added claims alleging breach of contract and tortious interference with an existing contract. On January 3, 2008, Assadourian sought permission to file a fourth amended complaint; the District Court denied his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-17\">Throughout this period, Assadourian was attempting, over Diab\u2019s objection, to take Diab\u2019s deposition. Ultimately, the parties agreed that the deposition would go forward in Egypt. However, the day before the deposition was scheduled to be held, Assadourian canceled it. Three months later \u2014 and well after the close of discovery \u2014 Assadourian moved to reopen the discovery period so that he could re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>schedule the deposition. The magistrate judge denied the motion, concluding that Assadourian had failed to show good cause for his untimely request.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Subsequently, in separate orders, the District Court granted summary judgment to the defendants on Assadourian\u2019s claims of breach of contract and tortious interference with a contract, and then his claims of tortious interference with a prospective economic relationship and conspiracy. Assadourian filed a timely appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">As an initial matter, Assadourian challenges two of the District Court\u2019s procedural rulings. First, he argues that the District Court erred in ordering that the deposition of Diab proceed in Egypt rather than the United States. However, a review of the proceedings reveals that this arrangement was actually Assadourian\u2019s idea. For instance, in a November 15, 2007 motion, Assadourian stated, \u201cPlaintiff stands ready to take Mr. Diab\u2019s deposition in any part of the world that would be more convenient to Mr. Diab, including Europe or the Middle East.\u201d In a December 20, 2007 hearing, the magistrate judge ordered that the deposition proceed in Egypt; Diab\u2019s counsel objected, because he believed that the deposition represented nothing more than an attempt to harass a famous performer, but Assadourian\u2019s counsel appeared to be fully satisfied by the ruling \u2014 Assadourian neither objected before the magistrate judge nor appealed the decision to the District Court. Assadourian cannot now challenge an order that he not only did not appeal to the District Court, but actually proposed. <em>See, e.g., Cont\u2019l Cas. Co. v. Dominick D'Andrea, Inc., </em>150 F.3d 245, 252 (3d Cir.1998).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">Assadourian\u2019s second procedural challenge concerns the District Court\u2019s order that denied his motion to file a fourth amended complaint. We conclude that, regardless of whether we apply Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), which provides that leave to amend should be granted \u201cwhen justice so requires,\u201d or Rule 16(b), which requires a party to show \u201cgood cause\u201d before a court will modify a scheduling order (Assadourian filed his motion to amend almost six months past the deadline set by the Court\u2019s scheduling order), the District Court acted within its discretion in denying Assad'ourian\u2019s motion. <em>See E. Minerals &amp; Chems. Co. v. Mahan, </em>225 F.3d 330, 340 (3d Cir.2000). At the outset, it bears emphasizing that this represented Assadourian\u2019s effort to amend his complaint for a <em>fourth </em>time. Moreover, the proposed amendment \u2014 which would have added a claim under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act \u2014 was based on documents that Assadourian possessed even before he amended his complaint the third time; it was thus proper for the District Court to conclude that Assadourian had not acted diligently and that it would unfairly prejudice the defendants to inject a new theory into the case at such a late date. <em>See, e.g., Race Tires Am., Inc. v. Hoosier Racing Tire Corp., </em>614 F.3d 57, 84 (3d Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">We will likewise affirm the District Court\u2019s orders on the merits. First, we agree with the District Court that the defendants were entitled to summary judgment on Assadourian\u2019s breach-of-contract claim. While New Jei-sey recognizes the validity of oral contracts, <em>see, e.g., McBarron v. Kipling </em>Woods <em>L.L.C., </em>365 N.J.Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>per. 114, 838 A.2d 490, 491 (N.J.Super.Ct.App.Div.2004), any contract \u201cmust be sufficiently definite that the performance to be rendered by each party can be ascertained with reasonable certainty,\u201d <em>Weichert Co. Realtors v. Ryan, </em>128 N.J. 427, 608 A.2d 280, 284 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, by Assadourian\u2019s own testimony, the parties had agreed to little more than the amount that Diab demanded to be paid per show; they had not agreed to the manner or time of payment, the venues in which the shows would be held, or even the cities that would be included on the tour. Thus, while Diab\u2019s compensation was allegedly fixed, \u201c[a]ll of the other terms normal to an obligation of this magnitude were missing.\u201d <em>Malaker Corp. Stockholders Protective Comm. v. First Jersey Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>163 N.J.Super. 463, 395 A.2d 222, 228 (N.J.Super.Ct.App.Div.1978). The District Court was therefore correct to hold that the parties had not entered into an enforceable contract. <em>See Baer v. Chase, </em>392 F.3d 609, 621 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">In light of this holding, Assadourian\u2019s claim that Harb tortiously interfered with Assadourian and Diab\u2019s existing contractual relationship must also fail. <em>See Dello Russo v. Nagel, </em>358 N.J.Super. 254, 817 A.2d 426, 434 (N.J.Super.Ct.App.Div.2003) (explaining that \u201c[t]o establish a claim for tortious interference with contractual relations, a plaintiff must prove ... actual interference with a contract\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Assadourian\u2019s claim of tortious interference with a prospective contractual relationship fares no better. To establish this claim, Assadourian must show, among other things, that he had a reasonable expectation of economic benefit, that Harb had knowledge of that expectancy, and that Harb wrongfully and intentionally interfered with that expectancy. <em>See Lightning Lube v. Witco Corp., </em>4 F.3d 1153, 1167 (3d Cir.1993). We agree with the District Court that Assadourian has failed to make the required showing. Assadourian has claimed that Harb violated United States and New Jersey tax laws in 2000 or 2001. However, he has presented no evidence to link that alleged misconduct to the contract that Harb and Diab executed in 2005. The only evidence concerning that transaction shows that Harb traveled to Egypt to meet with Diab on numerous occasions \u2014 something that Assadourian never did \u2014 and eventually persuaded Diab to accept his offer. On this record, the District Court was correct to grant judgment to the defendants. <em>See, e.g., Printing Mart-Morristown v. Sharp Elecs. Corp., </em>116 N.J. 739, 563 A.2d 31, 41 (1989) (explaining that \u201cwhen a plaintiffs loss of business is a mere incident of competition, it is <em>damnum absque injuria\u201d </em>(internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">Finally, Assadourian claimed that Harb and Diab engaged in a civil conspiracy. However, his failure to show that the defendants committed an underlying tort is fatal to his conspiracy claim. <em>See Tynan v. GMC, </em>248 N.J.Super. 654, 591 A.2d 1024, 1032 (N.J.Super.Ct.App.Div.1991), <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>127 N.J. 269, 604 A.2d 99 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">Accordingly, we conclude that there is no substantial question presented by this appeal, and will thus summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s orders granting summary judgment to all defendants. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-7\">. Nor did Assadourian appeal to the District Court the magistrate judge\u2019s later order denying his motion to reopen the discovery period. We therefore conclude that he has likewise waived any objection to that order. <em>See GMC v. New A.C. Chevrolet, </em>263 F.3d 296, 336 n. 25 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
