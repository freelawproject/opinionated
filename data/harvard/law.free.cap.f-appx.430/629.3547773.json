Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, <em>Cortez-Pineda v. Holder, </em>610 F.3d 1118, 1121 (9th Cir.2010), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination that Singh\u2019s asylum application was untimely because that finding is based on disputed facts. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>cf. Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 650 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam). Accordingly, we dismiss the petition as to Singh\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination because Singh\u2019s testimony was materially inconsistent with his asylum application regarding the circumstances of his alleged June 1999 arrest, <em>see Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001), and his explanation does not compel a contrary conclusion, <em>see Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1245 (9th Cir.2000). In the absence of credible testimony, Singh\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Because Singh\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same evidence the IJ found not credible, and he points to no other evidence showing it is more likely than not he would be tortured if he returns to India, Singh\u2019s CAT claim also fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1156 \u2014 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Finally, in light of our conclusion that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, we reject Singh\u2019s contention that the IJ violated due process by failing to conclude, based on his evidence, that his asylum application was timely filed. <em>See Lata, </em>204 F.3d at 1246 (requiring error and prejudice to prevail on due process claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b651-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
