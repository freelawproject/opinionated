Thompson appeals from his sentence and argues that it was procedurally and substantively unreasonable. Because we conclude that Thompson\u2019s sentence was both procedurally and substantively reasonable, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">We review a sentence for procedural and substantive reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Wetherald, </em>636 F.3d 1315, 1320 (11th Cir.2011). We first look to whether the district court committed any significant procedural error. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). We then examine the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">Thompson argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to ask him and his counsel whether they had read and discussed the presentence investigation report (PSI). But because Thompson did not object to the district court\u2019s failure to directly ask whether he and his counsel had read and discussed the PSI, we review this issue for plain error. <em>United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000). To prevail, Thompson must establish (1) that there was error; (2) that it was plain; and (3) that it affected his substantial rights. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b829-10\">At sentencing, the district court is required to \u201cverify that the defendant and the defendant\u2019s attorney have read and discussed the presentence report and any addendum to the report.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(l)(A). Although the district court did not explicitly ask Thompson or his counsel whether they had read and discussed the PSI, Thompson\u2019s counsel discussed her objections to the PSI with the district judge and Thompson wrote the judge a letter in which he referred to the PSI. Under our caselaw interpreting an earlier version of Rule 32, that probably would have been enough to satisfy compliance with the rule. <em>See United States v. Aleman, </em>832 F.2d 142, 144 (11th Cir.1987). Since <em>Aleman </em>was decided, however, Rule 32 has changed. But we need not decide whether the district court complied with the new rule because Thompson has failed to demonstrate any prejudice from the alleged error.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-11\">Thompson claims that he was prejudiced because unobjected-to statements in the PSI are admissions for sentencing purposes. But, tellingly, Thompson did object to statements in the PSI, and his objections were considered by the district court. He has not identified any other objections he would have made, much less how those unmade objections would have affected his sentence, had the district court asked him whether he and his counsel had read and discussed the PSI. Accordingly, we conclude that Thompson failed to establish prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-12\">Thompson next argues that the district court committed procedural error by not adequately explaining its sentencing rationale. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e); <em>see also Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The Supreme Court has said that when the judge decides to apply the guidelines in a particular case, a lengthy explanation is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>not always required. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The Court went on to say that \u201cCircumstances may well make clear that the judge rests his decision upon the Commission\u2019s own reasoning that the Guidelines sentence is a proper sentence....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357, 127 S.Ct. 2456. This is such a case. Here the district court considered the guidelines and imposed a sentence at the bottom end of the range. The judge said he thought that the sentence was appropriate and that it complied with the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Under our caselaw this explanation was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">Next Thompson argues that it is unclear whether the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors before imposing sentence. But the district court\u2019s statement that the sentence \u201ccomplied with the factors that are to be considered as set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d shows that it did. It is also clear that the district court treated the guidelines as advisory. Throughout the sentencing hearing the district court referred to the sentencing guidelines as \u201cadvisory\u201d and specifically mentioned that it was not \u201cbound to apply the sentencing guidelines.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that Thompson\u2019s sentence is proeedurally reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">We now turn to Thompson\u2019s arguments about the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. Whether a sentence is substantively reasonable is essentially a question whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1179. Although we do not presume that a sentence, like this one, that is within the properly calculated guidelines range is reasonable, we ordinarily expect that is the case. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). But even if a sentence is within the guidelines, it must also, considering the totality of the circumstances, achieve the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191. The party challenging a sentence bears the burden of establishing its unreasonableness. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">Thompson contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it fails to account for the circumstances of the offense, his employment history, and the possibility that he will not receive credit for time served in state custody before his case was federalized. Thompson\u2019s argument boils down to a contention that the judge did not adequately consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191-92 (noting that a sentence can be substantively unreasonable if the district court fails to consider the \u201cpertinent 3553(a) factors\u201d). When Thompson presented his mitigating evidence, the judge considered his arguments, but rejected them because he felt Thompson\u2019s conduct sounded like \u201csomething out of a Western\u201d and noted that Thompson could have made a different decision. Even though the district judge did not explicitly mention Thompson\u2019s employment history, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>he did say that the sentence complied with the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which necessarily include Thompson\u2019s \u201chistory and characteristics.\u201d <em>See United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 833 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201c[Although the district court\u2019s sentencing order made no mention of evidence that arguably mitigated in Amedeo\u2019s favor under \u00a7 3553(a), we cannot say that the court\u2019s failure to discuss this \u2018mitigating\u2019 evidence means that the court erroneously \u2018ignored\u2019 or failed to consider this evidence in determining Amedeo\u2019s sentence.\u201d). Thus we conclude that the district court adequately considered the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">As for Thompson\u2019s remaining argument, the district court explained that it would not vary downward based on Thompson\u2019s time in state custody because it believed that only the Bureau of Prisons had the authority to calculate credit for time served, and it would be inappropriate for the court to vary downward to ensure Thompson received such credit. The district court also thought it seemed likely that Thompson would be credited for the time he spent in state custody. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. at 357, 127 S.Ct. 2456. We conclude that the district court was within its discretion when it refused to vary downward to ensure Thompson would receive credit for time served. Accordingly, we also conclude that Thompson\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b830-6\">.
