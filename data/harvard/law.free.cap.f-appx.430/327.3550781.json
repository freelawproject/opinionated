He argues that the district court reversibly erred by failing to consider the imprisonment range set forth in the policy statement of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4 and by failing to articulate adequate reasons for deviating from that range.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-25\">Cat\u00f3n did not raise in the district court the arguments that he presents to this court. This court\u2019s review is therefore limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009). Cat\u00f3n must show that there is an error that is clear or obvious and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>the error affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If these factors are established, the court has discretion to correct the forfeited error, but only if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The record, which includes the probation officer\u2019s dispositional report, indicates that the district court implicitly considered the sentencing range set forth in the policy statements of the Guidelines. To the extent that Cat\u00f3n is contending that the district court erred by failing to consider the correct guidelines range, his argument fails to establish plain error as he fails to argue, and the record does not suggest, that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence had it more explicitly considered the correct guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>602 F.3d 643, 650-51 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 365 (5th Cir.2009). Also, the district court\u2019s comments throughout the revocation hearings and prior to the pronouncement of sentence reflect extensive consideration of the nature and circumstances of Caton\u2019s violations of the conditions of his supervised release, as well as significant consideration of Caton\u2019s personal history and characteristics. Therefore, the record reflects implicit consideration of the' factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)(1). The district court thus provided adequate reasons for the sentence imposed. <em>See Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 262-65. Further, Cat\u00f3n does not assert that a more thorough explanation by the district court would have changed his sentence. He has therefore failed to show that any error regarding the adequacy of the district court\u2019s reasons affected his substantial rights. <em>See id. </em>at 264-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b350-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
