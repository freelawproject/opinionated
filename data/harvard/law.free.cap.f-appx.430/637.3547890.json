We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, <em>Toguchi v. Chung, </em>391 F.3d 1051, 1056 (9th Cir.2004), and for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s decision not to continue summary judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f), <em>United States v. Kitsap Physicians Serv., </em>314 F.3d 995, 1000 (9th Cir.2002). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-21\">The district court properly granted summary judgment as to Sims\u2019s due process claim because Sims failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the classification error resulted in any deprivations or changes in the conditions of confinement constituting an \u201catypical and significant hardship ... in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life\u201d that would give rise to a protected liberty interest. <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-22\">The district court properly granted summary judgment as to Sim\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim because Sims failed to show that he suffered any injury other than the allegedly erroneous classification itself, which resulted in his assignment to a higher security facility and restrictions on overnight family visitations. <em>See Meachum v. Fano, </em>427 U.S. 215, 224, 96 S.Ct. 2532, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976) (no constitutional right to be housed \u201cin any particular prison\u201d); <em>Gerber v. Hickman, </em>291 F.3d 617, 621 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc) (\u201c[I]t is well-settled that prisoners have no constitutional right while incarcerated to contact visits or conjugal visits.\u201d); <em>Hoptowit v. Ray, </em>682 F.2d 1237, 1256 (9th Cir.1982) <em>abrogated on other grounds by Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995) (\u201c[Mjisclassification does not itself inflict pain within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>The district court did not abuse its discretion by not continuing defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion until Sims received a complete copy of his deposition transcript because Sims failed to show how an entire copy of the transcript was necessary to defeat summary judgment. <em>See California v. Campbell, </em>138 F.3d 772, 779 (9th Cir.1998) (under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f), a party seeking a continuance must submit an affidavit explaining, among other things, how the sought-after facts are essential to resist the summary judgment motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Sim\u2019s remaining contentions, including that he was denied the opportunity to file an opposition to defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b659-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
