Banks appeals from an order of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, which denied his \u201cMotion to Modify Special Assessment and Restitution for Changed Circumstances\u201d for lack of jurisdiction. For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-14\">In October 2004, a federal jury found Banks guilty of mail fraud, criminal copyright infringement, uttering and possessing counterfeit or forged securities, and witness tampering. These chai'ges stemmed from Banks\u2019 sales of illegally copied (\u201cpirated\u201d) versions of copyrighted Microsoft software products through an Internet marketplace website, Amazon.com. The District Court subsequently sentenced Banks to sixty months of imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release. The Court also imposed restitution in the sum of $70,708.59, and a special assessment of $700.00, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3013. This Court affirmed the judgment and sentence, <em>United States v. Vampire Nation, </em>451 F.3d 189 (3d Cir.2006), and the United States Supreme Court denied Banks\u2019 petition for certiorari, <em>Banks v. United States, </em>549 U.S. 970, 127 S.Ct. 424, 166 L.Ed.2d 300 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-16\">On December 15, 2009, Banks filed a motion asking the District Court to modify his financial obligations pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(d). Banks claimed that he was no longer able to pay the special assessment or restitution because he does not earn sufficient income in prison, and asked the Court to \u201cset a payment schedule of $0.00 per month.\u201d (Supplemental Appendix \u201cSA\u201d at 1.) The government opposed the motion on the grounds that: (1) the District Court lacked authority under section 3572(d) to modify the special assessment or restitution; and (2) even if it did have authority to do so, modification was not warranted under the \u201ceconomic hardship\u201d provision of \u00a7 3572(d). The District Court denied the motion, agreeing with the government that it lacked authority to modify the special assessment or restitution order imposed as a part of the judgment in his case. The Court further noted that even if it had jurisdiction to modify the assessment, it would deny the motion because Banks\u2019 alleged change in economic circumstances was self-induced. Banks filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">We have jurisdiction to review the District Court\u2019s order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We may affirm the District Court on grounds other than those relied on by the District Court. <em>Kabakjian v. United States, </em>267 F.3d 208, 213 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Banks argues that the District Court erred in determining that it lacked jurisdiction to modify the order of restitution or special assessment imposed in his case. Indeed, a court has jurisdiction to modify a payment schedule if there has been \u201cany material change in the defendant\u2019s economic circumstances that might affect the defendant\u2019s ability to pay restitution.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(k); <em>United States v. Jaffe, </em>417 F.3d 259, 267 (2d Cir.2005) (district court retains jurisdiction to amend or adjust restitution order if there is any material change in defendant\u2019s economic circumstances).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Here, although the District Court may have erred by failing to recognize that it potentially had jurisdiction to entertain Banks\u2019 motion, any error is without consequence, as Banks failed to show that there had been a \u201cmaterial change\u201d in his \u201ceconomic circumstances.\u201d As the District Court noted, at the time that Banks filed his motion in December 2009, he held a prison job. (SA at 41.) At that time, Banks had not received income since September 2009, however, because he had not been reporting to work. <em>(Id.) </em>Because Banks has not provided any records contradicting the information provided by the Bureau of Prisons, we agree with the District Court that any change in Banks\u2019 economic circumstances was self-induced and hardly constitutes a material change in economic circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">To the extent that Banks also attempted to challenge in the District Court the overall validity of the District Court\u2019s restitution order, the limited jurisdiction conferred by section 3664(k) does not encompass an attack on the overall validity of a restitution order. <em>Cf. Matheny v. Morrison, </em>307 F.3d 709, 711 (8th Cir.2002) (a motion to suspend the payment of a fine is not the \u201cproper vehicle\u201d for bringing such a claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b203-8\">. We do not have jurisdiction, however, to review the District Court\u2019s Order denying Banks\u2019 motion for reconsideration, which he filed in the District Court contemporaneously with his notice of appeal, because Banks did not file a notice of appeal from that Order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b203-9\">. Banks, cited 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(d)(3) as authority for allowing the court to adjust the payment schedule. While, as Appellee points out, that provision refers to a \"fine,\u201d and Banks was seeking modification of an order of restitution, \"the [Mandatory Victims Restitution Act] provides that 'all provisions of [\u00a7 3664(m)(l)(A) ] are available to the United States for the enforcement of an order of restitution,\u2019 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613(f), and \u00a7 3664(m)(l)(A) provides that an order of restitution may be enforced in the same manner as a fine.\u201d <em>United States v. Hyde, </em>497 F.3d 103, 108 n. 9 (1st Cir.2007). However, as section 3664(k) refers specifically to modification of a restitution order, the District Court could have construed Banks' motion as seeking relief pursuant to that section.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
