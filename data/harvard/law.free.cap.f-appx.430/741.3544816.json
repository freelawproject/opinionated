GORSUCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b763-19\">In 2007, a jury convicted Juan Antonio Vazquez of possession with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of a mixture of substances containing methamphetamine. This court subsequently affirmed the conviction and resulting sentence. <em>United States v. Vazquez, </em>555 F.3d 923 (10th Cir.2009). Mr. Vazquez then filed a motion in the district court seeking relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court denied the petition and Mr. Vazquez now seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to contest that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-24\">We may grant a COA only if Mr. Vazquez makes a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Under this standard, an applicant must show \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal quotation omitted). Because Mr. Vazquez proceeds in this court <em>pro se, </em>we review his pleadings with special solicitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-25\">Even so, we cannot grant a COA in this case. Reviewing the complete record, we conclude that no reasonable jurist would debate the district court\u2019s disposition of Mr. Vazquez\u2019s claims, and for substantially the same reasons given by the district court. Accordingly, Mr. Vazquez\u2019s application for a COA is denied and this appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b763-20\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
