Between them, they raise four issues on appeal challenging their convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-13\">I. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b842-14\">Toussaint argues that the district court erred in denying his Rule 29 motion for a judgment of acquittal because there was insufficient evidence presented at trial to support a finding that he had participated in the smuggling conspiracy and the underlying related crimes, as opposed to just being a mere passenger on the boat. Specifically, Toussaint argues that the only evidence against him was the bare testimony of Devon Rolle, a co-conspirator who testified on behalf of the government at trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-15\">We find that a reasonable fact-finder could have determined that the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>proved Toussaint\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. As an initial matter, the testimony of an accomplice, if accepted by the jury, can constitute, without more, sufficient evidence to support a conviction. <em>United States v. LeQuire, </em>943 F.2d 1554, 1562 (11th Cir.1991). Here, the jury was free to credit Rolle\u2019s testimony that he conspired with Toussaint and Levarity to smuggle four aliens into the United States. Moreover, the government presented evidence to corroborate Rolle\u2019s testimony that Toussaint was a participant in the conspiracy and not merely a passenger on the boat, including that (1) Toussaint, like Levarity and Rolle and unlike the aliens on the boat, had no identity documents or possessions with him, indicating that he would not remain in the United States; (2) Toussaint sat at the front of the boat with Levarity and Rolle to act as a look-out and was not laying on the floor with the aliens being smuggled; (3) Toussaint was a lifelong friend of co-conspirator Rolle and fellow Bahamian; (4) Toussaint had a valid visa and could have entered the United States legally, which he had done a number of times before. On this record, we find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s denial of Toussaint\u2019s Rule 29 motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">II. Evidentiary Rulings</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Both Toussaint and Levarity argue that they were deprived of a fair .trial because of erroneous evidentiary rulings by the district court. We address each defendant\u2019s argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">A. <em>Reference to the death of one of the aliens on the boat</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">Toussaint argues that the court erred in admitting evidence that one of the aliens on the boat, Michael Lynch, drowned.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Toussaint argues that this evidence was irrelevant to the case against him and highly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">At the joint trial, Toussaint\u2019s codefendant, Levarity, asserted as a defense that Lynch had piloted the boat and that all others on board, including Levarity and Toussaint, were merely passengers. The evidence of Lynch\u2019s death, combined with Rolle\u2019s testimony that the three co-conspirators had agreed to blame Lynch because \u201ca dead man can\u2019t talk,\u201d was relevant as a rebuttal against Levarity\u2019s defense. Moreover, as to prejudice, the record reflects that the government presented the fact of Lynch\u2019s death in minimal detail, merely introducing the fact that Lynch had drowned and that the defendants were aware of this fact at the time of their arrests. The government included no additional details that would likely inflame the jury. Accordingly, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-13\">B. <em>Cross-examination of co-conspirator Rolle</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-14\">Levarity argues that the district court erred in refusing to admit into evidence the contents of the \u201cfactual proffer\u201d that was executed and adopted by Rolle pursuant to his guilty plea allocution. Levarity argues that the proffer was necessary to impeach Rolle\u2019s testimony, and it was not hearsay because it was a prior statement that was inconsistent with Rolle\u2019s testimony at trial. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801(c) and (d)(1)(A). He further asserts that the exclusion of this evidence violated his Sixth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>Amendment confrontation rights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">We find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the proffer as hearsay because it was not inconsistent with Rolle\u2019s testimony at trial. Levarity argues that the description in the proffer of Lynch\u2019s death was inconsistent with Rolle\u2019s trial testimony on that subject. However, Rolle never testified at trial about the circumstances surrounding Lynch\u2019s death and, thus, there was no inconsistency. Levarity also argues that the factual proffer was relevant to the question of who was driving the boat, because Rolle stated upon his arrest that Lynch was the driver, but later testified in the factual proffer and at trial that Levarity di'ove the boat. While Rolle\u2019s earlier statement that Lynch drove the boat may have been inconsistent with later statements, the factual proffer was consistent with Rolle\u2019s testimony at trial on this issue, and thus could not be used for impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">Because the proffer was not a prior inconsistent statement, the district court\u2019s refusal to admit the proffer was not an abuse of discretion, nor did it violate Levarity\u2019s Sixth Amendment confrontation rights. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801(c) and (d)(1)(A); <em>Gan, </em>572 F.3d at 1361.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">III. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">Finally, Levarity and Toussaint argue that the distx\u2019ict court erred in applying a ten-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(7)(D) to their sentences based on the death of Lynch.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">The provision of the Sentencing Guidelines applicable to smuggling operations instructs: \u201c[i]f any person died or sustained bodily injury, increase the offense level according to the seriousness of the injury: ... (D) [If][d]eath add 10 levels.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(7). This Court has held that \u201cto apply the \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(7) enhancement it must be reasonably foreseeable to a defendant that his actions or the actions of any other member of the smuggling operation could create the sort of dangerous circumstances that would be likely to result in serious injury or death.\u201d <em>United States v. Zaldivar, </em>615 F.3d 1346, 1350 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">The record reflects that Toussaint, Levarity and Rolle, who wex\u2019e crewing the boat, attempted to evade law enforcement and land their passengers even after they knew they had been detected by a Customs and Border Patrol aircraft. Once detected, the crew membex\u2019s increased the speed of the boat, nearly colliding with another boat, and slammed headlong into the pier at the nearest point of disembax'kation. The crew then directed its passengers to jump off the boat and run. Lynch drowned while fleeing from the police after the boat reached land. On this record, where the defendants attempted to evade law enforcement and told their passengers to get off the boat and run from the police, it was reasonable foreseeable that the operation would result in serious injury or death. <em>See Zaldivar, </em>615 F.3d at 1350 (affirming application of the enhancement whex'e a passenger was injured when the defendants attempted to evade detection by the Coast Guard by fleeing in an ovex*<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>crowded boat at a high rate of speed in the middle of the night). Accordingly, the district court did not err in applying a ten-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(7)(D) to the defendants\u2019 sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the defendants\u2019 convictions and sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b842-8\">. Levarity was also convicted of the additional charge of reentry after deportation in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b842-9\">.
