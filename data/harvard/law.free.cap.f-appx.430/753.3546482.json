Former inmate John C. Bradford was stabbed to death by another inmate at CSP on July 5, 2006, and approximately one week later, former inmate Troy C. Crumbley was brutally attacked by another inmate at CSP. Based on these tragic events, Crumbley and the executor of Bradford\u2019s estate, Peter A. Bugge, brought this suit against several former and current CSP employees: Former Warden Kevin Roberts, Warden Danny Thompson, Deputy Warden Christine Cross, Deputy Warden Jeff Jefferson, Lieutenant Christopher Wesley, Lieutenant Eula Battle, Sergeant Anthony Cox, Sergeant Eddie Smith, Officer Dewayne Booker, Officer Derrick McDaniels, Officer William McGinnis, and Officer Horace Gilbert. The district court dismissed Crumbley\u2019s claims for failing to exhaust his administrative remedies, and granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on Bugge\u2019s claims. Crumbley and Bugge appeal those decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-12\">I. Crumbley<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-13\">Under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d), \u201c[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 ... by a prisoner ... until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). This exhaustion requirement \u201capplies to all inmate suits about prison life, whether they involve general circumstances or particular episodes, and whether they allege excessive force or some other wrong.\u201d <em>Porter v. Nussle, </em>534 U.S. 516, 532, 122 S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002). The PLRA merely requires \u201c[cjompliance with prison grievance procedures ... to \u2018properly exhaust\u2019 \u201d them. <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 218, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007) \u201cAn inmate incarcerated in a state prison, thus, must first comply with the grievance procedures established by the state department of corrections before filing a federal lawsuit under section 1983.\u201d <em>Miller v. Tanner, </em>196 F.3d 1190, 1193 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-14\">According to the evidence in record, the GDC administrative grievance procedures consist of an informal grievance, a formal grievance, and an appeal. The inmate must file an informal grievance form no later than ten days from the date the inmate knew or should have known of the facts giving rise to the grievance, but prison officials can waive that timeliness requirement for good cause shown. Inmates are only given a formal grievance form after they have fulfilled their obligation to first utilize the informal grievance process, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>and have five days from receipt of the resolution of the informal grievance to file the formal grievance. The last step in the grievance process is an appeal, but a grievance rejected as out-of-time may not be appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Crumbley argues that he exhausted all of his available administrative remedies, and thus the district court improperly dismissed his claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). We agree. It is uncontested that prison officials at Washington State Prison (\u201cWSP\u201d), where Crumbley had been relocated, accepted an untimely informal grievance on November 1, 2006, for good cause shown. Having met the good cause standard prior to filing his federal lawsuit, Crumbley effectively exhausted his administrative remedies as to this step in the grievance procedures. <em>See Johnson v. Meadows, </em>418 F.3d 1152, 1159 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cPrisoners must timely meet the deadlines <em>or the good cause standard </em>of Georgia\u2019s administrative grievance procedures before filing a federal claim.\u201d) (emphasis added). That Crumbley complied with this initial step is further shown by the fact that WSP officials gave him a formal grievance form, which is only issued to those inmates who successfully complete the informal grievance step.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Once Crumbley\u2019s informal grievance was accepted for filing, Crumbley filed a formal grievance the next day. However, officials at CSP denied the formal grievance as out-of-time, and informed Crumbley that he could not appeal. We disagree with this conclusion, because Crumbley filed his formal grievance form within the five-day period required by the grievance procedures. As Crumbley was not allowed to appeal the denial of his formal grievance, he was not required to file an appeal in order to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See Miller v. Tanner, </em>196 F.3d 1190, 1194 (11th Cir.1999) (holding that an inmate is not required, in order to exhaust administrative remedies, to appeal an institution-level denial when he is unambiguously told that he may not appeal). Thus, because Crumbley complied with the grievance procedures applicable to him, he properly exhausted his administrative remedies. Accordingly, the district court erred in dismissing his claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">II. Bugge<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">We begin our analysis of Bugge\u2019s claims by reviewing the circumstances of Bradford\u2019s murder. Before lunch on July 5, 2006, Bradford, a fifty-two-year-old white male, and his cell-mate, Stephen Johnson, went to the prison store to buy some goods and then brought them back to their cell. During lunchtime, Bradford remained in the cell out of fear that the goods would be stolen if he left for lunch. While Bradford was waiting in the cell, inmate Charles Fanning gained entry to the cell, intending to steal some of the goods that Bradford and Johnson had bought. Bradford and Fanning, who is black and is a member of a gang called the Black Gangsta Disciples, then argued with each other, using racial epithets and threatening each other. After the argument, Bradford told an unidentified prison official that there would be \u201ctrouble\u201d if he and Fanning were not kept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>away from each other. Johnson then suggested several times to Bradford that they enter protective custody, but Bradford rejected the idea and never made a request for protective custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Later that day, Bradford left the cell to retrieve his mail. When he was returning to his cell, Fanning hit him on the head and knocked him to the floor. Johnson tried to pull Bradford into the cell and shut the door, but Fanning and another inmate forced the door open, dragged Bradford underneath the lockers, and stabbed him in the chest with a shank. Fanning and his accomplice then stole the store-bought goods from Bradford and Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Johnson attempted to get help for his cell-mate, but Fanning and other inmates blocked him. Prison officials eventually learned of Bradford\u2019s condition during a prison. inspection. Bradford was pronounced dead soon thereafter at Calhoun Memorial Hospital. Following these tragic events, Bugge exhausted the GDC administrative procedures and filed this \u00a7 1983 suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Section 1983 provides a cause of action for anyone subjected \u201cto the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws\u201d by a person acting under color of state law. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The Eighth Amendment imposes a duty on prison officials to provide \u201chumane conditions of confinement,\u201d and to \u201ctake reasonable measures to guarantee the safety of the inmates.\u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 832, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). In particular, prison officials have a duty \u201cto protect prisoners from violence at the hands of other prisoners.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 833, 114 S.Ct. 1970. \u201cA prison official\u2019s \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 to a substantial risk of serious harm to an inmate violates the Eighth Amendment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 828, 114 S.Ct. 1970, and thus gives rise to a \u00a7 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">To survive summary judgment on such a \u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff must \u201cproduce sufficient evidence of (1) a substantial risk of serious harm; (2) the defendants\u2019 deliberate indifference to that risk; and (3) causation.\u201d <em>Hale v. Tallapoosa Cnty., </em>50 F.3d 1579, 1582 (11th Cir.1995). The first element is an objective standard. <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 8-9, 112 S.Ct. 995,117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992). \u201c[Ojnly those deprivations denying the minimal civilized measure of life\u2019s necessities are sufficiently grave to form the basis of an Eighth Amendment violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9, 112 S.Ct. 995 (quotation marks omitted). As we have explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-10\">... an excessive risk of inmate-on-inmate violence at a jail creates a substantial risk of serious harm; occasional, isolated attacks by one prisoner on another may not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, but confinement in a prison where violence and terror reign is actionable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-11\"><em>Purcell v. Toombs Cnty., </em>400 F.3d 1313, 1320 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-12\">The second element, \u201cdeliberate indifference,\u201d is a subjective standard having three components: \u201c(1) subjective knowledge of a risk of serious harm; (2) disregard of that risk; (3) by conduct that is more than mere negligence.\u201d <em>McElligott v. Foley, </em>182 F.3d 1248, 1254 (11th Cir.1999). Regarding this element, the Supreme Court in <em>Farmer </em>held,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6t\">a prison official cannot be found liable under the Eighth Amendment for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement unless the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">511 U.S. at 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970. Following <em>Fanner, </em>we have stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADL\">[a] prison official cannot avoid liability under the Eighth Amendment \u201cby showing that ... he did not know the complainant was especially likely to be assaulted by the <em>specific prisoner </em>who eventually committed the assault.\u201d [Farmer, 511 U.S.] at 843, 114 S.Ct. 1970. This is because \u201c[t]he question under the Eighth Amendment is whether prison officials, acting with deliberate indifference, exposed a prisoner to a sufficiently substantial \u2018risk of serious damage to his future health.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Helling v. McKinney, </em>509 U.S. 25, 35, 113 S.Ct. 2475, 125 L.Ed.2d 22 (1993)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Any\"><em>Rodriguez v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>508 F.3d 611, 617 (11th Cir.2007). Thus, it does not matter \u201cwhether a prisoner faces an excessive risk of attack for reasons personal to him or because all prisoners in his situation face such a risk.\u201d <em>Fanner, </em>511 U.S. at 843,114 S.Ct. 1970.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-5\">If, for example, prison officials were aware that inmate rape was so common and uncontrolled that some potential victims dared not sleep but instead ... would leave their beds and spend the night clinging to the bars nearest the guards\u2019 station, it would obviously be irrelevant to liability that the officials could not guess beforehand precisely who would attack whom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-6\"><em>Id. </em>(quotations, alterations, and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">A defendant, however, may escape liability if he did not have subjective knowledge of the risk to begin with. <em>Id. </em>at 844, 114 S.Ct. 1970. This subjective knowledge must be specific, as we have held that \u201cimputed or collective knowledge cannot serve as the basis for a claim of deliberate indifference.\u201d <em>Burnette v. Taylor, </em>533 F.3d 1325, 1331 (11th Cir.2008). This question of \u201c[wjhether a prison official had the requisite knowledge of a substantial risk is a question of fact,\u201d and such knowledge may be inferred based on the obviousness of the risk. <em>Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 842, 844-5, 114 S.Ct. 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">Bugge ai'gues that the district court improperly granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants because the evidence showed that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk of serious harm posed to Bradford at CSP. He identifies two such risks: (1) the individualized risk of harm Bradford faced from Fanning, the inmate who killed him; and (2) the risk of harm Bradford faced at CSP due to the allegedly dangerous prison conditions. We address each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">A. Individualized Risk Based on Specific Threats</p>\n<p id=\"b780-11\">Bugge first contends that the unidentified prison official who was warned about the need to separate Fanning and Bradford was deliberately indifferent by failing to place Bradford in protective custody in response to the warning, which resulted in Bradford\u2019s death at the hands of Fanning. The district court granted the defendants summary judgment on this claim for two reasons: first, Bradford\u2019s warning to the prison official was too vague to provide the official with actual knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm to Bradford, and thus Bugge failed to satisfy the deliberate indifference element of the claim; and second, Bugge failed to satisfy the causation prong because he could not identify the prison official to whom Bradford gave the warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-12\">We agree with the district court that this claim fails on the deliberate indifference prong. Regardless of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>Bradford\u2019s warning to an unidentified prison official was detailed enough to provide the official with adequate knowledge of a specific, substantial risk of serious harm to Bradford from Fanning, Bugge has not provided any evidence showing that any one of the defendants received the warning. Thus, Bugge cannot prove that any one of the defendants actually possessed the requisite knowledge to be held liable. <em>Burnette, </em>533 F.3d at 1331 (\u201c[I]mputed or collective knowledge cannot serve as the basis for a claim of deliberate indifference .... Each individual [defendant must be judged separately and on the basis of what that person knows.\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court properly granted the defendants summary judgment on Bugge\u2019s claims that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk of serious harm posed to Bradford arising from his individual situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">B. Environmental Risk Based on Dangerous Prison Conditions</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Next, Bugge argues that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk of harm posed to Bradford due to dangerous prison conditions at CSP, and that the defendants\u2019 deliberate indifference to those conditions caused the attack that resulted in Bradford\u2019s death. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants because it concluded that Bugge failed to satisfy the objective component of the claim, finding that there was insufficient summary judgment evidence to demonstrate that the prison conditions at CSP posed an objectively substantial risk of serious harm.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although we think it is a close call, we must disagree with the district court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">According to Bugge\u2019s evidence, numerous racially charged robberies occurred at CSP, particularly of store-bought goods; there were \u201chundreds\u201d of weapons in the prison, and almost every inmate in Bradford\u2019s dormitory owned or had access to a shank; prison officials refused to discipline inmates for possessing weapons; and gangs, which operated in every dormitory, were extremely violent, stealing, robbing, and committing acts of violence against white inmates in particular. There is also evidence that officials encouraged inmates to obtain weapons for protection, due to the dangerous conditions at CSP. Notably, the defendants did not provide any evidence refuting that these conditions existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">Our decisions clearly establish that this evidence, at the very least, is sufficient to create a jury question on whether a substantial risk of serious harm existed at CSP. <em>See, e.g., Marsh v. Butler County, Ala., </em>268 F.3d 1014, 1033 (11th Cir.2001); <em>Hale, </em>50 F.3d at 1583; <em>Williams v. Edwards, </em>547 F.2d 1206 (5th Cir.1977).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number><em>Hale, </em>for example, the plaintiff \u201cproduced evidence that inmate-on-inmate violence occurred regularly.\u201d 50 F.3d at 1583. Here, Bugge has produced evidence that inmate-on-inmate robberies of the type that resulted in Bradford\u2019s death happened regularly at CSP. Further, in <em>Marsh </em>and <em>Williams, </em>the plaintiffs presented evidence that there was widespread possession of weapons by inmates and that weapons were not confiscated from prisoners. <em>Marsh, </em>268 F.3d at 1033; <em>Williams, </em>547 F.2d at 1211. Bugge presented the same evidence here. Finally, Bugge presented evidence that powerful gangs committed racially charged violent acts against white prisoners like Bradford.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This dangerous mixture of regular robberies, widespread weapons possession by inmates, and unchecked racially charged gang violence erupted in a predictable way that lead to Bradford\u2019s death. Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to Bugge, genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether a substantial risk of serious harm existed at CSP.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The district court, therefore, erred in ruling that the defendants were entitled to summary judgment on the ground that no substantial risk of serious harm existed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">However, all the defendants except for Warden Roberts are nonetheless entitled to summary judgment on these claims, because Bugge presented no evidence that any of the defendants, except for Warden Roberts, had any responsibility for the conditions at CSP, or could have taken reasonable steps to the lessen the substantial risk of serious harm that existed there. In fact, Bugge failed to present any evidence of the other defendants\u2019 roles at CSP. Bugge\u2019s claims against these defendants, therefore, fail on the causation prong: there is no evidence connecting them to the relevant prison conditions or Bradford\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-11\">Regarding Bugge\u2019s claims against Warden Roberts, though, there is \u25a0 evidence that he was aware of the dangerous conditions at CSP, and as Warden, he clearly had the power to take reasonable steps to address them.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Bugge presented evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>that several inmates wrote to Roberts to inform him of the dangerous prison conditions. Moreover, the evidence shows that Roberts failed to discipline inmates for possessing weapons or engaging in gang violence. Finally, the pervasive and widespread nature of the conditions that the evidence shows existed suggest that Roberts \u201chad been exposed to information concerning the risk and thus must have known about it,\u201d which \u201ccould be sufficient to permit a trier of fact to find that [Roberts] had actual knowledge of the risk.\u201d <em>Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 842-3, 114 S.Ct. 1970. Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to Bugge, genuine issues of material fact exist as to the remaining elements of Bugge\u2019s claim against Roberts \u2014 deliberate indifference and causation \u2014 and thus the district court erred in granting Roberts summary judgment on that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Accordingly, we vacate the dismissal of Crumbley\u2019s claims; affirm summary judgment in favor of all the defendants except for Warden Roberts on Bugge\u2019s claims; vacate summary judgment in favor of Warden Roberts on Bugge\u2019s claim; and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b777-10\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal of a lawsuit for failure to exhaust available administrative remedies under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e. <em>Brown v. Sikes, 212 </em>F.3d 1205, 1207 (11th Cir.2000). The district court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. <em>Bryant v.

We review a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>\"examining the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Schwarz v. City of Treasure Island, </em>544 F.3d 1201, 1211 (11th Cir.2008). \"Summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Jean-Baptiste v.

Moreover, the unidentified official\u2019s failure to place Bradford in protective custody did not cause Bradford\u2019s death. This is because Bradford\u2019s cell-mate, Stephen Johnson, repeatedly urged Bradford to request protective custody following his confrontation with the other inmate, but Bradford declined. Thus, the prison official cannot be faulted for failing to urge Bradford to accept protective custody, because the evidence shows that Bradford would have rejected such a suggestion prior to his fatal attack.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b781-13\">. Although the district court\u2019s analysis of this claim appears in several different sections of the opinion addressing different elements of the claim, it all centers on the objective component of the claim: whether the summary judgment evidence demonstrated that the prison conditions posed a substantial risk of serious harm to Bradford.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b781-14\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981), this court adopted all decisions of the Fifth Circuit handed down prior to close of business on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>September 30, 1981 as binding precedent in this circuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b782-5\">. The defendants argue that this evidence of gang violence should be discounted on the ground that some of it suggests that the violence was more prevalent in a different dormitory than the one that housed Bradford. The fact remains, however, that the gang violence was widespread at the prison, and the defendants cite no authority for the proposition that the conditions at a prison should be analyzed on a dormitory-by-dormitory basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b782-6\">. That no identical stabbing death had occurred at CSP immediately prior to this one is of no consequence, as the Supreme Court has instructed that \"an Eighth Amendment violation can arise from unsafe conditions of confinement even if no assault or similar physical injury has yet occurred.\u201d <em>Marsh, </em>268 F.3d at 1034 (citing <em>Helling v. McKinney, </em>509 U.S. 25, 33, 113 S.Ct. 2475, 125 L.Ed.2d 22 (1993)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b782-7\">. The defendants also raised a qualified-immunity defense when moving for summaiy judgment. For Bugge to overcome that defense at summary judgment, the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to Bugge, must \"make out a violation of a constitutional right,\u201d and \"the right at issue [must have been] 'clearly established' at the time of defendant\u2019s alleged misconduct.\u201d <em>Pearson v. Callahan, </em>555 U.S. 223, 129 S.Ct. 808, 816, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009). The district court, in granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment, effectively ruled, without saying so, that Bugge failed to satisfy the first prong, <em>i.e., </em>he failed to show that Bradford\u2019s constitutional rights were violated. As our discussion above indicates, we disagree with this conclusion, and additionally find that, based on <em>Marsh, Hale, </em>and <em>Williams, </em>the constitutional right at issue was clearly established at the time of the defendants\u2019 alleged misconduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b782-13\">.
