Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that Ginori-Mondragon will not be persecuted in Mexico on account of violence that occurred when one of petitioner\u2019s cousins was allegedly killed by drug cartel members in May 2007, and another cousin was presumed dead because of his affair with a cartel leader\u2019s wife in 2009. <em>See Grava v. INS, </em>205 F.3d 1177, 1181 n. 3 (9th Cir.2000) (purely personal retribution is not persecution on account of a protected ground). In addition, Ginori-Mondragon did not establish that he was part of a cognizable social group consisting of Americanized Mexicans who will be targeted for violence. <em>See Delgado-Ortiz v. Holder, </em>600 F.3d 1148, 1151-52 (9th Cir.2010) (rejecting as a particular social group \u201creturning Mexicans from the United States\u201d). Accordingly, the BIA did not err in denying Ginori-Mondragon\u2019s application for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"A26\">Ginori-Mondragon also failed to establish that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to Mexico, and thereby he failed to establish eligibility for CAT protection. <em>See id. </em>at 1152.</p>\n<p id=\"ACc\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b641-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
