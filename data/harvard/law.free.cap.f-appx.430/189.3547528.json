He was sentenced to seventy months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Gonzalez-Sandoval contends he was entitled to a decrease in offense level based on minor or minimal role. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">In March 2006, Gonzalez-Sandoval began working as a courier in a money laundering scheme operated by John Wilson Vasquez-Martinez. On April 28, 2006, acting on instructions from Faustino Tovar, Vasquez-Martinez\u2019s right hand man, Gonzalez-Sandoval delivered a suitcase containing approximately six kilograms of 93% pure cocaine to an individual in a hotel in Bogota, Colombia. He received $12,700 in payment, which he delivered to Tovar.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">On September 17, 2007, a grand jury indicted Gonzalez-Sandoval, Vasquez-Martinez, and three co-defendants of eleven counts of various drug-related and money laundering offenses. Gonzalez-Sandoval was charged with a single count of intentional distribution of more than five kilograms of cocaine, knowing the cocaine would be unlawfully imported into the United States, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 959 and 960(b)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. On December 5, 2007, Colombian authorities arrested Gonzalez-Sandoval, and he was later extradited to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-11\">On August 10, 2009, Gonzalez-Sandoval pleaded guilty. In the plea agreement, Gonzalez-Sandoval stipulated he knew: 1) he was delivering approximately six kilograms of cocaine in exchange for payment, 2) the cocaine would be unlawfully imported into the United States, and 3) the cocaine would be transported to Newark, New Jersey. The District Court accepted Gonzalez-Sandoval\u2019s plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-13\">In a Presentence Report (PSR), the United States Probation Office recommended a base offense level of thirty two under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(4) because Gonzalez-Sandoval delivered more than five and less than fifteen kilograms of cocaine. The PSR recommended a two-level reduction under the \u201csafety valve\u201d of U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 5C1.2 and 2Dl.l(b)(ll) because Gonzalez-Sandoval had no criminal history points, did not threaten or use violence, did not cause injury in committing the offense, did not lead others or engage in a continuing criminal enterprise, and truthfully provided all information he possessed concerning the offenses. It recommended a further three-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b) for accepting responsibility. The PSR concluded no mitigating role adjustment was warranted under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 because the cocaine\u2019s purity and value indicated Gonzalez-Sandoval was a trusted conspirator, not a mere delivery \u201cmule\u201d who played a \u201cminor\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-14\">The PSR recommended a total offense level of twenty seven which, combined with Gonzalez-Sandoval\u2019s lack of criminal history and safety valve reduction, resulted in an advisory sentencing guideline range of seventy to eighty seven months\u2019 imprisonment. The District Court, after hearing argument, determined a mitigating role adjustment was unwarranted, adopted the PSR without change, and sentenced Gonzalez-Sandoval to seventy months\u2019 impris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>onment. Gonzalez-Sandoval timely appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">On appeal, Gonzalez-Sandoval contends the District Court erred in denying his request for a decrease in offense level based on minor or minimal role.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 3B1.2 of the United States Sentencing Commission\u2019s <em>Guidelines Manual </em>provides for a four-level decrease in offense level if Gonzalez-Sanchez was a \u201cminimal participant\u201d in an offense, a two-level decrease if he was a \u201cminor participant,\u201d and a three-level decrease if he falls between. While a defendant is a \u201cminimal participant\u201d if \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group,\u201d that classification applies \u201cinfrequently.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. n.4. A defendant is a \u201cminor participant\u201d if \u201cless culpable than most other participants, but whose role [cannot] be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">When applying these designations, \u201cthe culpability of a defendant courier must depend necessarily on such factors as the nature of the defendant\u2019s relationship to other participants, the importance of the defendant\u2019s actions to the success of the venture, and the defendant\u2019s awareness of the nature and scope of the criminal enterprise.\u201d <em>United States v. Headley, </em>923 F.2d 1079, 1084 (3d Cir.1991) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe court may also wish to consider the amount of money the courier [received] as an indicator of the importance of the defendant\u2019s actions to the success of the venture.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>342 F.3d 296, 301 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">Gonzalez-Sandoval argues he is entitled to a decrease in his offense level because he is the least culpable of the indicted group and his guilt is based on one act of cocaine distribution with little knowledge of the transaction\u2019s details. However, \u201c[t]he fact that a defendant\u2019s participation in a drug operation was limited to that of courier is not alone indicative of a minor or minimal role.\u201d <em>Headley, </em>923 F.2d at 1084. As the Fifth Circuit has explained, \u201c[a] courier who willingly undertakes illegal transit without asking many questions is especially valuable to a criminal organization. When police apprehend[ ] a studiously ignorant courier, the organization can rest comfortably, knowing that its other operations remain hidden from the law.\u201d <em>United States v. Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d 135, 138 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-12\">Gonzalez-Sandoval executed an exchange of highly pure cocaine he knew was bound for the United States for a substantial sum of money. He understood the illegal nature of the transaction and had previously performed a similar role in Vasquez-Martinez\u2019s scheme. Based on these facts, the District Court concluded Gonzalez-Sandoval was \u201cas culpable as the others.\u201d A74. The Court did not clearly err in concluding Gonzalez-Sandoval did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>deserve a decrease in his offense level based on minor or minimal role.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b213-8\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b213-9\">. We \"must sustain a district court\u2019s factual findings as to a \u00a7 3B1.2 minimal or minor role adjustment unless those findings are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez, </em>280 F.3d 318, 351 (3d Cir.2002). Because the District Court's determination is \"heavily dependent upon the facts of a particular case,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. n.3(C), \"district courts are allowed broad discretion in applying this section.\u201d <em>United States. v. Isaza-Zapata, </em>148 F.3d 236, 238 (3d Cir.1998). We will reverse only if we are \"left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Grier, </em>475 F.3d 556, 570 (3d Cir.2007) <em>(en Banc) </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
