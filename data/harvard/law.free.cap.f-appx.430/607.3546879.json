Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, applying the standards governing adverse credibility determinations created by the Real ID Act. <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039 (9th Cir.2010). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-14\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding because Santiago-Ramirez\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with the letter she submitted from Dennis and Flory Vander Zyl concerning the reason the gang harassed and mistreated her. <em>See id. </em>at 1040-44 (adverse credibility determination was reasonable under the Real ID Act\u2019s \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d); <em>Pal v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 935, 938 (9th Cir.2000) (inconsistencies between testimony and documentary evidence support an adverse credibility finding). In the absence of credible testimony, Santiago-Ramirez\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003) .</p>\n<p id=\"b630-16\">We lack jurisdiction over Santiago-Ramirez\u2019 CAT claim because she did not exhaust it before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677-78 (9th Cir.2004) .</p>\n<p id=\"b630-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b630-12\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
