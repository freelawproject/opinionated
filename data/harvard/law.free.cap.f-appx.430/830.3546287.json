The ALJ denied Mason\u2019s application for DIB after finding that she retained the residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to return to her past work.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-15\">On appeal, Mason argues that the ALJ, when calculating her RFC, inappropriately discounted the opinions of Dr. Charles Ga-lea and Dr. Robert Pumpelly, two of her treating physicians. Mason also argues that contrary to the ALJ\u2019s finding that she did not credibly testify about the limiting effects of her pain, her persistent efforts to seek medical attention entitled her to a favorable credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-17\">We review the agency\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo, </em>and its factual findings to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Ingram v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1260 (11th Cir.2007). Substantial evidence is defined as \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under this standard, we must affirm an agency decision supported by substantial evidence \u201ceven if the proof preponderates against it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b853-18\">DIB claimants must show that they were disabled on or before their last-insured date. <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). Consequently, to prove her eligibility for DIB, Mason had to prove that she suffered from a disability between her alleged onset of December 2004, and her last-insured date of December 2005. \u201cIf a claimant becomes disabled [a]fter [s]he has lost [her] insured status, [her] claim must be denied despite [her] disability.\u201d <em>Demandre v. Califano, </em>591 F.2d 1088, 1090 (5th Cir.1979) (holding that substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s denial where the evidence showed that the claimant was insured until June 1973, but the medical evidence showed that his condition did not become disabling until some point in 1974).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>The Social Security regulations establish a five-step, \u201csequential\u201d process for determining whether a claimant is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(1). If an ALJ finds a claimant disabled or not disabled at any given step, the ALJ does not go on to the next step. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). At the first step, the ALJ must determine whether the claimant is currently engaged in substantial gainful activity. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(I). At the second step, the ALJ must determine whether the impairment or combination of impairments for which the claimant allegedly suffers is \u201csevere.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(ii). At the third step, the ALJ must decide whether the claimant\u2019s severe impairments meet or medically equal a listed impairment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iii). The ALJ must then determine, at step four, whether the claimant has the RFC to perform her past relevant work. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iv). Where, as here, the ALJ finds that the claimant has the RFC to perform past relevant work, she is not disabled, and her claim for DIB is denied. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">As a general matter, the ALJ must afford the opinion of an examining physician considerable weight. <em>Marbury v. Sullivan, </em>957 F.2d 837, 840 (11th Cir.1992). An ALJ may reject a treating physician\u2019s opinion, however, upon a showing of good cause. <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cGood cause\u201d exists when the: \u201c(1) treating physician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) treating physician\u2019s opinion was conclusory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1240-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Where a treating physician expresses uncertainty as to his own medical findings, the ALJ has no obligation to defer to his opinion. <em>Edwards v. Sullivan, </em>937 F.2d 580, 584 (11th Cir.1991). Further, a treating physician\u2019s opinion is not entitled to considerable weight if it conflicts with the claimant\u2019s own testimony regarding her daily activities. <em>Id. </em>at 1241. Where the medical record contained a retrospective diagnosis, that is, a physician\u2019s post-insured-date opinion that the claimant suffered a disabling condition prior to the insured date, we affirm only when that opinion was consistent with pre-insureddate medical evidence. <em>See Payne v. Weinberger, </em>480 F.2d 1006, 1007-08 (5th Cir.1973) (holding that the ALJ erred in determining that the claimant was disabled when a retrospective diagnosis, along with all other medical evidence, supported a finding of disability); <em>Estok v. Apfel, </em>152 F.3d 636, 640 (7th Cir.1998) (ruling that \u201c[a] retrospective diagnosis may be considered only if it is corroborated by evidence contemporaneous with the eligible period\u201d and citing cases from that First, Second, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits that were in accord).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Dr. Galea did not see Mason until February 2006, after her insured status expired. In the absence of corroborating medical evidence that Mason suffered from a disability during the relevant disability period \u2014 December 2004 to December 2005 \u2014 the ALJ had good cause to discount this opinion. To begin, while Mason visited Dr. Galea frequently, these visits began on February 15, 2006, nearly two months after her last-insured date. Because Dr. Galea did not assess Mason\u2019s medical condition until after the relevant disability period, his opinion was a retrospective diagnosis that was not entitled to deference unless corroborated by contemporaneous medical evidence of a disabling condition. However, despite Dr. Galea\u2019s opinion that Mason was unable to perform any significant work, numerous medical records indicate that, during the relevant period, Mason\u2019s conditions were not persistent, alternating at random from asymp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>tomatic to \u201cflares\u201d and radiological tests showed only mild degenerative conditions. Further, objective physical examinations tended to show tenderness but no swelling, and she appeared in no acute distress. Finally, her pain appeared to be controlled through adjusting types and levels of medication, and she was specifically counseled against more drastic measures such as surgery. This conflict between the medical evidence and Dr. Galea\u2019s opinion supports a decision to discount that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">With respect to Dr. Pumpelly, the ALJ did not discount his opinion at all, but simply found, consistent with our law, that his RFC assessment was irrelevant because it did not specify that it pertained to Mason\u2019s condition during the disability period. The ALJ relied extensively on Dr. Pumpelly\u2019s medical records, and his decision is replete with cites to Dr. Pumpelly\u2019s examination notes. Insofar as the ALJ found that Dr. Pumpelly\u2019s RFC assessment was irrelevant, he was correct because the assessment did not state that it pertained to the disability period and the evidence tended to show that Mason\u2019s condition may have worsened between her last-insured date and the assessment date. Moreover, while Dr. Pumpelly placed a check next to a sentence attesting to his belief that Mason\u2019s disabling condition existed prior to the insured date, and also opined that she had been unable to work since 2004, those documents would not make his RFC assessment relevant because they did not specify how, if at all, Mason\u2019s RFC differed between the relevant disability period and the time in which he submitted his formal assessment. Additionally, Dr. Pumpelly\u2019s opinion on Mason\u2019s RFC conflicted with abundant medical evidence, for the same reasons discussed as to Dr. Galea. Accordingly, we conclude that no error occurred in the ALJ\u2019s treatment of both opinions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">In cases where a claimant attempts to establish disability through her own testimony concerning pain or other subjective systems, we apply a three-part \u201cpain standard.\u201d <em>Holt v. Sullivan, </em>921 F.2d 1221, 1223 (11th Cir.1991). This standard requires evidence of an underlying medical condition; and either: (1) objective medical evidence confirming the severity of the alleged pain arising from that condition; or (2) that the objectively determined medical condition is of such severity that it can be reasonably expected to give rise to the alleged pain. <em>Id. </em>Factors that are relevant to the pain inquiry include: (I) the claimant\u2019s daily activities; (ii) the location, duration, frequency, and intensity of the claimant\u2019s pain or other symptoms; (iii) precipitating and aggravating factors; (iv) the type, dosage, effectiveness, and side effects of any medication the claimant took to alleviate pain or other symptoms; (v) treatment, other than medication, the claimant received for relief of pain or other symptoms; and (vi) any measures the claimant personally used to relieve pain or other symptoms. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(c)(3); <em>Watson v. Heckler, </em>738 F.2d 1169, 1172-73 (11th Cir.1984). When the record shows that treating physicians have established physical limitations, \u201cparticipation in everyday activities of short duration\u201d will not disqualify a person from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>disability. <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1441 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Agency rulings on credibility have determined that, when the record extends over a lengthy period of time, an individual\u2019s attempt to obtain treatment \u201clend support\u201d to her</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-5\">allegations of intense and persistent pain or other symptoms for the purposes of judging the credibility of the individual\u2019s statements. Persistent attempts by the individual to obtain relief of pain or other symptoms, such as by increasing medications ... may be a strong indication that the symptoms are a source of distress to the individual and generally lend support to an individual\u2019s allegations of intense and persistent symptoms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">SSR 96-7p at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">If the ALJ decides not to credit a claimant\u2019s subjective testimony, \u201che must articulate explicit and adequate reasons for doing so.\u201d <em>Holt, </em>921 F.2d at 1223. These reasons must be supported by substantial evidence and \u201ctake into account and evaluate the record as a whole.\u201d <em>McCruter v. Bowen, </em>791 F.2d 1544, 1548 (11th Cir. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">Mason\u2019s testimony was contradicted by her own admissions that, between December 2004 and December 2005, she engaged in significant physical activity, and these statements were corroborated by medical evidence. Despite Mason\u2019s position that her pain was crippling and she was unable to work, she reported an ability to walk up to three miles both before and after her last-insured date. From 2005 until at least 2006, she also did some gardening outdoors, shopped, painted, drove on her own, and performed routine exercise. Her daughter largely corroborated her activities, and opined that she had no problems grooming herself or preparing meals. This testimony about her activities was corroborated further by the medical records. She reported to physicians that standing and walking did not aggravate her symptoms. Accordingly, we hold that substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b853-12\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981)(en banc), this Court adopted as binding precedent all of the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b855-6\">. Insofar as Mason additionally asserts that the ALJ violated the Hearings, Appeals, and Litigation Law Manual (\"HALLEX\u201d) by sending Dr. Galea a letter without first notifying the parties, we hold that, even if Mason was correct that a violation occurred, any such error was harmless because Dr. Galea's failure to respond did not alter the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that his opinion was inconsistent with the other medical evidence. <em>See Diorio v. Heckler, </em>721 F.2d 726, 728 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
