The action stems from events that occurred in October and November 2007 in Georgia. Bridgewater filed the complaint in April 2010, more than two years after either event. The district court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed her complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), finding that it was time barred. Bridgewater appears to contend that the statute of limitations should have been tolled under Georgia Code \u00a7 9-3-99 while \u201c[c]harges were pending against [her] from 2007 thru [sic] 2009\u201d for \u201ctheft by taking.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim under to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), viewing all allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Mitchell v. Farcass, </em>112 F.3d 1483, 1489-90 (11th Cir.1997). The length of the limitations period governing a \u00a7 1983 action is dictated by state law. <em>Wallace v. Kato, </em>549 U.S. 384, 387, 127 S.Ct. 1091, 1094, 166 L.Ed.2d 973 (2007). \u201c[T]he proper limitations period for all section 1983 claims in Georgia is the two year period set forth in O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-3-33 for personal injuries.\u201d <em>Williams v. City of Atlanta, </em>794 F.2d 624, 626 (11th Cir.1986); <em>see also </em>Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 9-3-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Georgia provides for statutory tolling of tort claims arising from a crime until the prosecution of the person who committed that crime is final. GA. CODE ANN. \u00a7 9-3-99. That tolling, however, is expressly limited to \u201cany cause of action in tort that may be brought <em>by the victim </em>of an alleged crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Bridgewater admits that she was not the victim of the alleged crime, but instead she was the <em>defendant </em>charged with the crime. <em>See Valades v. Uslu, </em>301 Ga.App. 885, 689 S.E.2d 338, 342 (2009). Therefore, \u00a7 9-3-99 did not toll the two-year statute of limitations period.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AkM\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b860-6\">. \"We construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings liberally.\u201d <em>H &amp; R Block E.
