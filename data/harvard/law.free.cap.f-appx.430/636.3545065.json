We review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Lo v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 934, 937 (9th Cir.2003). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-21\">I. Lack of Notice</p>\n<p id=\"b658-22\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in declining to reopen the proceedings on the basis of lack of notice. The notice sent to the most recent address provided by petitioner was sufficient to satisfy the notice requirements of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a)(2)(A). <em>See Popa v. Holder, </em>571 F.3d 890, 897-98 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-23\">II. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b658-24\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion when it held that petitioners failed to make a case for reopening their proceedings based on ineffective assistance of counsel. Petitioners did not demonstrate that they were prejudiced by counsel\u2019s actions. They did not comply with the requirements in <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), or demonstrate \u201cclear and obvious\u201d ineffectiveness that would justify an exception from those requirements. <em>See Castillo-Perez v. INS, </em>212 F.3d 518, 525-26 (9th Cir.2000); <em>see also ho, </em>341 F.3d at 937. Because petitioners failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, tolling of the deadline for filing a motion to reopen was not warranted. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 897-98 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-25\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AFS\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
