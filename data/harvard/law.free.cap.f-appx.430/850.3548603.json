We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-13\">Sanchez was paroled into the United States in June 1995. In May 1997, his status was adjusted to that of a lawful permanent resident, which was deemed retroactive back to June 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-15\">In July 2000, Sanchez was indicted for, <em>inter alia, </em>conspiracy to steal a vehicle moving an interstate shipment. In January 2001, he was convicted of that charge and sentenced to ten months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-16\">Upon Sanchez\u2019s release from prison, the Department of Homeland Security served him with a notice to appear, charging him as removable for committing a crime of moral turpitude within five years of his admission into the United States. <em>See </em>Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)\u00ae. Sanchez did not contest the charge or seek relief from removal, and the IJ ordered him removed in December 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-18\">Over seven years later, in April 2009, Sanchez filed a motion to reopen the removal proceedings. He argued that he was not removable because, while he was convicted of a crime of moral turpitude, that conviction did not occur within five years of the date of his admission, which he considered to be June 1995. He therefore requested the IJ to reopen the proceedings so that he could apply for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-19\">In a written decision issued on July 17, 2009, the IJ denied Sanchez\u2019s motion. The IJ found that Sanchez\u2019s date of admission was May 1997, not June 1995, and this date was within five years of the date of his 2001 conviction. Alternatively, the IJ found that Sanchez\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely because it was filed more than seven years after the final order of removal, which far exceeded the 90-day filing deadline. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1). Significantly, the IJ\u2019s decision included a certificate of service reflecting that the decision was mailed to Sanchez\u2019s attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>three days later. The record also contains a cover letter, issued that same day by the Clerk of Immigration Court, indicating that the IJ\u2019s decision was mailed to Sanchez\u2019s attorney at the correct address.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">On March 31, 2010, Sanchez, seemingly unaware of the IJ\u2019s decision, filed a motion with the IJ requesting a decision on his motion to reopen. In response, the Clerk of Immigration Court mailed Sanchez a copy of the IJ\u2019s decision to the same address to which the decision was originally sent.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">On May 3, 2010, Sanchez filed a notice of appeal in the BIA from the IJ\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen. Sanchez proceeded under the assumption that the IJ\u2019s decision was issued on March 31, 2010, not July 17, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">The BIA dismissed Sanchez\u2019s appeal as untimely. The BIA noted that, although Sanchez claimed to be appealing a decision issued on March 31, 2010, the IJ\u2019s decision was issued on July 17, 2009, and was mailed to Sanchez three days later. Thus, the BIA concluded that Sanchez\u2019s appeal well exceeded the 30-day filing deadline. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.38(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">Sanchez then filed the instant motion for reconsideration, arguing that he did not receive the IJ\u2019s decision until March 31, 2010, and therefore his notice of appeal, filed on May 3, 2010, was timely. The BIA denied Sanchez\u2019s motion for reconsideration, finding that he failed to identify any error in the BIA\u2019s decision. The BIA emphasized that Sanchez failed to timely appeal from the IJ\u2019s July 17 decision, and the IJ properly mailed Sanchez that decision. Sanchez now petitions this Court for review of the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">\u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2007) (citation omitted). Our review is thus \u201climited to deciding whether the BIA exercised its discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Jiang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252, 1256 (11th Cir.2009). An alien may request that the BIA reconsider a prior decision, but that motion must specify the errors of law or fact in the BIA\u2019s previous order and must be supported by pertinent authority. INA \u00a7 240(c)(6), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6); 8 C:F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-12\">In this case, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Sanchez\u2019s motion for reconsideration, for it correctly dismissed as untimely Sanchez\u2019s appeal from the IJ\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen. The IJ issued its decision on July 17, 2009, and mailed that decision to Sanchez three days later. Thus, Sanchez had 30 days from that date to file his appeal, but he did not do so until May 2010. Sanchez asserts that he did not receive the IJ\u2019s decision until it was forwarded to him by the Clerk on March 31, 2010. But there is nothing in the record to support that contention. To the contrary, the record reflects that the Clerk mailed the IJ\u2019s decision to Sanchez\u2019s attorney at the proper address three days after the decision issued. Indeed, the Clerk mailed the decision to the very same address where the copy was successfully received by Sanchez\u2019s attorney on March 31. Moreover, even if Sanchez, through no fault of his own, did not receive the decision until March 31, the proper course of action would have been to seek re-issuance of the decision by the IJ, presumably by submitting an affidavit or some other evidence indicating a lack of receipt. In the absence of such evidence or re-issuance of the IJ\u2019s decision, we cannot say that the BIA abused its discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>in denying Sanchez\u2019s motion for reconsideration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b875-19\">. We also note that at no point has Sanchez explained why he waited over seven years to file his motion to reopen the removal proceedings. Indeed, we see no reason why his argument \u2014 that his conviction occurred more than five years after the date of his admission \u2014 could not have been raised during the removal proceedings. Thus, the IJ's determination that his motion to reopen was untimely would have likely been unassailable even if he had timely appealed diat decision to the BIA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
