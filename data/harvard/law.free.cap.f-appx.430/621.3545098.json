We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s application of substantive law, and for clear error its factual determinations, <em>Wyatt v. Terhune, </em>315 F.3d 1108, 1117 (9th Cir.2003), and we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-25\">The district court dismissed White\u2019s action for failure to exhaust in reliance on defendants\u2019 submission of an unverified inmate appeal report. However, this document, unaccompanied by a declaration describing its import or completeness, is insufficient to meet the defendants\u2019 burden to show nonexhaustion. <em>See id. </em>at 1120 (defendants\u2019 \u201cAppeal Record\u201d document was insufficient to show nonexhaustion where the accompanying affidavit did not state whether the inmate had exhausted his appeals, and there was no evidence in the record establishing that the report was a complete record of the inmate\u2019s grievances, as defendants represented). We therefore remand to the district court for further proceedings, including an opportunity for both parties to offer additional evidence pertaining to exhaustion.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b643-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
