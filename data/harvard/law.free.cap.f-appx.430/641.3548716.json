We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Gonzalez-Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 995, 998 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that, even if Singh credibly established past persecution, any presumption of a well-founded fear was rebutted by evidence that he could reasonably relocate within India. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(i)(B); <em>Gonzalez-Hernandez, </em>336 F.3d at 998-99 (presumption was rebutted where the BIA rationally construed an ambiguous country report and provided an individualized analysis of the petitioner\u2019s situation). We reject Singh\u2019s contentions that the BIA failed to consider all relevant evidence. <em>See Larita-Martinez v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1092, 1095-96 (9th Cir.2000) (petitioner must overcome the presumption that the agency has considered all the evidence); <em>see also Najmabadi v. Holder, </em>597 F.3d 983, 990 (9th Cir.2010) (\u201c[t]he [BIA] does not have to write an exegesis on every contention.\u201d) (internal quotes omitted). Accordingly, Singh\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-16\">Because Singh failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Gonzalez-Hernandez, </em>336 F.3d at 1001 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-17\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b664-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
