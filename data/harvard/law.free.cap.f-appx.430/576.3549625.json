The record reflects that the district court did not address at re-sentencing those portions of the sentence that, like the three-year term of supervised release, were neither discussed nor disputed by the parties. <em>See United States v. W.P.L., </em>635 F.3d 455, 456 n. 1 (9th Cir.2011) (explaining that, despite a variation between the oral and written sentencing pronouncements, there was no direct conflict between the two when viewed \u201cin context\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b599-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
