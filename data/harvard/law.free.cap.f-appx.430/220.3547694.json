On appeal, Brooks contends that the district court erroneously found him to be a citizen of North Carolina and thus found complete diversity of citizenship to be lacking. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">\u201cIf the district court determines at any time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3). When a defendant challenges the existence of subject matter jurisdiction in fact, \u201cthe plaintiff bears the burden of proving the truth of such facts by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States ex. rel. Vuyyuru v. Jadhav, </em>555 F.3d 337, 347 (4th Cir.2009). Unless the jurisdictional facts are intertwined with the facts central to the dispute, the district court may \u201cresolve the jurisdictional facts in dispute by considering evidence outside the pleadings, such as affidavits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">\u201cCitizenship, like the other ingredients or elements of diversity jurisdiction ... presents a preliminary question of fact to be determined by the trial court.\u201d <em>Sligh v. Doe, </em>596 F.2d 1169, 1171 (4th Cir.1979). \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s jurisdictional findings of fact on any issues that are not intertwined with the facts central to the merits of the plaintiffs claims under the clearly erroneous standard and any legal conclusions flowing therefrom <em>de novo.\u201d Vuyyuru, </em>555 F.3d at 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-14\">Mindful of these standards, we have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Brooks failed to carry his burden of demonstrating the district court\u2019s jurisdiction over the matter. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s orders. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
