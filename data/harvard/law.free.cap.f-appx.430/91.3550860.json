The District Court summarily dismissed the complaint. It noted that Hoffenberg had a separate suit pending before another judge in the District of New Jersey, <em>see </em>No. 09-cv-04784, and it found that the other suit \u201cis identical to the instant matter in all substantive respects.\u201d Docket # 7 at \u00b6 2. The District Court thus dismissed the present complaint sua sponte as \u201cduplicative.\u201d Hoffenberg then filed several postjudgment motions, including a timely motion for reconsideration. The District Court denied the motions. Hoffenberg appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-24\">We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a review of the record, we will vacate the order of dismissal and remand for further proceedings. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6 (sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>mary action is appropriate if an appeal presents \u201cno substantial question\u201d). Hoffenberg\u2019s complaint in Civil Action No. 09-cv-04784 asserted claims against individual BOP staff under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> His claims in the present suit are ostensibly against the United States of America for damages under the FTCA. The two suits do not appear \u201cduplicative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\"><em>Bivens </em>affords \u201cvictims of a constitutional violation by a federal agent ... a right to recover damages against the official in federal court despite the absence of any statute conferring such a right.\u201d <em>Carlson v. Green, </em>446 U.S. 14, 18, 100 S.Ct. 1468, 64 L.Ed.2d 15 (1980). The FTCA, in contrast, \u201cwaived the United States\u2019 sovereign immunity for claims arising out of torts committed by federal employees.\u201d <em>Ali v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>552 U.S. 214, 217-18, 128 S.Ct. 831, 169 L.Ed.2d 680 (2008). The Supreme Court has observed that \u201cCongress views FTCA and <em>Bivens </em>as parallel, complementary causes of action,\u201d <em>Carlson, </em>446 U.S. at 20, 100 S.Ct. 1468, and it is clear that \u201c[t]he differing standards of the FTCA and <em>Bivens </em>may lead to different results.\u201d <em>Ting v. United, States, </em>927 F.2d 1504, 1513 (9th Cir.1991). Moreover, while an inmate may not recover damages from both the United States and one of its employees, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(b)(1), there is no prohibition against a plaintiff filing suit under both legal theories. <em>See, e.g., Ting, </em>927 F.2d at 1513 n. 10 (\u201cWhile a plaintiff may maintain both a FTCA and a <em>Bivens </em>action, he may not receive double recovery.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">In short, the dismissal of Hoffenberg\u2019s FTCA complaint on the ground that it is \u201cidentical ... in all substantive respects\u201d to his <em>Bivens </em>suit lacks support. While there may be similar factual allegations in the two suits, the proposed legal theories differ. Accordingly, we will vacate the order that dismissed the complaint and remand for further proceedings. We express no view on the merits. We note that the District Court elected to dismiss the complaint without ruling on Hoffenberg\u2019s application to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and did not assess the filing fee. On remand, the District Court should resolve the filing fee issue and screen the complaint in accordance with 28 U.S.C \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and 1915A.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b113-16\">. Hoffenberg\u2019s timely filed motion for reconsideration tolled his time to appeal the order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>that dismissed his complaint; his notice of appeal was timely filed within thirty days after entry of the order denying the motion for reconsideration. <em>See </em>Fed.
