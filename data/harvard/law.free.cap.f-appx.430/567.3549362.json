We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Hamazaspyan v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 744, 747 (9th Cir.2009), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">The agency did not abuse its discretion by denying Cui\u2019s motion to reopen because it considered the evidence Cui submitted and acted within its broad discretion in determining that the evidence was insufficient to warrant reopening. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002) (BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen shall be reversed if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational, and contrary to law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b590-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
