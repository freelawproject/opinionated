The BIA previously affirmed the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) denial of Bekov\u2019s application for asylum under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a); withholding of removal under the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3); and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16. Bekov argues that the BIA erred in denying his motion to reopen because he presented new evidence that was previously unavailable. After thorough review, we deny Bekov\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-17\">\u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen removal proceedings for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Zhang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks and alterations omitted). Our review \u201cis limited to determining whether the BIA exercised its discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Id. \u201cA </em>motion to reopen shall not be granted unless it appears to the [BIA] that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available ... at the former hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). \u201cAn alien who attempts to show that the evidence is material bears a heavy burden and must present evidence that demonstrates that, if the proceedings were opened, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case.\u201d <em>Jiang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252, 1256 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-18\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Bekov\u2019s motion to reopen. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>The BIA found that Bekov failed to establish how part of the evidence he submitted in support of his motion, the affidavit of an expert witness, was unavailable to him at the time of his removal proceedings. Although Bekov explained that the expert was unable to attend his removal proceedings because of illness, he did not explain why the expert could not have submitted the same affidavit in lieu of live testimony during Bekov\u2019s removal proceedings. The expert witness\u2019s affidavit addressed the general conditions in Uzbekistan, not conditions that arose after Bekov\u2019s removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">The BIA also found that Bekov failed to satisfy his \u201cheavy burden\u201d to prove that his brother\u2019s affidavit, which he submitted in support of his motion, \u201cwould likely change the result in the case.\u201d <em>See Jiang, </em>568 F.3d at 1256. Bekov\u2019s brother\u2019s affidavit corroborated Bekov\u2019s account of the physical injuries he suffered in Uzbekistan. The IJ, however, determined that Bekov\u2019s physical injuries were not inflicted on account of a statutorily protected ground and therefore did not warrant asylum relief. See INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Bekov testified before the IJ that he was not a member of a political group or organization. The IJ also expressly found that \u201c[Bekov] ha[d] not shown that any of the harm that he suffered in the past was on account of his membership in a particular social group.\u201d In light of this finding and Bekov\u2019s testimony, Bekov has not established that his brother\u2019s affidavit would likely change the outcome of his removal proceedings. <em>See Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1292-93, 1303 (11th Cir.2001) (noting that an applicant who is unable to meet the standard for asylum generally cannot satisfy the more stringent standards for withholding of removal and CAT relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">For these reasons, we deny Bekov\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
