On appeal, Wells argues that her application was timely because the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) did not properly close out her protective filing date established by her father\u2019s 1998 application for retirement benefits, as required by the SSA\u2019s Program Operations Manual System (\u201cPOMS\u201d). After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">\u201cIn Social Security appeals, we must determine whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1178 (11th Cir.2011) (quotations omitted). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Under the Social Security Act, a child of an individual entitled to old-age benefits may be eligible to receive child\u2019s insurance benefits. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(d). To obtain child\u2019s insurance benefits, the claimant must file an application while she is unmarrried and either: (1) under 18 years of age or a full-time elementary or secondary school student under 19 years of age, or (2) suffers from a disability. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(d)(1)(A) &amp; (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-13\">The SSA has promulgated the POMS as \u201cpublicly available operating instructions for processing Social Security claims.\u201d <em>Wash. State Dep\u2019t of Soc. &amp; Health Servs. v. Guardianship Estate of Keffeler, </em>537 U.S. 371, 385, 123 S.Ct. 1017, 154 L.Ed.2d 972 (2003). The Supreme Court has noted that \u201cthese administrative interpretations are not products of formal rulemaking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 385, 123 S.Ct. 1017. In the context of reviewing the Commissioner\u2019s calculation of disability benefits under the Social Security Act\u2019s windfall elimination provision, we have stated that, although the SSA\u2019s POMS can be persuasive, it does not have the force of law. <em>Stroup v. Barnhart, </em>327 F.3d 1258, 1262 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-14\">In this case, the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) decision was based on proper legal standards because he correctly concluded that the POMS does not have the force of law, and, therefore, the Commissioner\u2019s alleged failure to adhere to the POMS does not entitle Wells to child\u2019s insurance benefits. <em>See Keffeler, </em>537 U.S. at 385, 123 S.Ct. 1017 (stating that the POMS\u2019s interpretations \u201care not products of formal rulemaking\u201d); <em>Stroup, </em>327 F.3d at 1262 (concluding that the POMS does not have the force of law). Furthermore, Wells\u2019s reliance on <em>Hall v. Schweiker, </em>660 F.2d 116 (5th Cir.1981),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is misplaced, because, unlike the ruling at issue in <em>Hall, </em>the POMS does not constitute formal rules that bind the SSA. <em>See Keffeler, </em>537 U.S. at 385, 123 S.Ct. 1017; <em>Hall, </em>660 F.2d at 119 n. 4 (addressing Social Security Ruling 79-19 and noting that Social Security Rulings \u201care binding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>on all components of the Administration\u201d) (quotations omitted). Moreover, the POMS at issue in this case does not relate to Wells\u2019s procedural rights at a hearing before the ALJ. Thus, the Commissioner did not violate any rule, and the results of the hearing before the ALJ may stand. <em>See Hall, </em>660 F.2d at 119. In addition, because the POMS does not have the force of law and a violation of the SSA\u2019s internal guidelines does not entitle Wells to the relief she seeks, we need not address whether the Commissioner adhered to the POMS.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Finally, substantial evidence supported the Commissioner\u2019s denial of child\u2019s insurance benefits because the record demonstrated that Wells was not statutorily eligible for those benefits. When she filed her application in 2003, Wells was over 18 years of age, was not a full-time elementary or secondary school student, and was not disabled. Accordingly, substantial evidence supported the Commissioner\u2019s denial of child\u2019s insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b808-9\">.
