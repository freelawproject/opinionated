Apr. 8, 2010), <em>ajfg </em>No. A094 938 603 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 14, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the I J\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision, i.e., minus the arguments for denying relief that were rejected by the BIA. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009). For applications governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his account, and inconsistencies in his statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see also Matter of JY-C-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 260, 265 (B.I.A. 2007). Analyzed under the REAL ID Act, the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-13\">In finding Weng\u2019s testimony not credible, the IJ relied in part on her demeanor, noting that her \u201chesitant,\u201d \u201crepetitive,\u201d and \u201cnonresponsive\u201d testimony gave the impression that she was \u201csimply reciting from a script rather than giving testimony of a person having experienced life-changing circumstances and events.\u201d Because the IJ was in the best position to observe Weng\u2019s manner while testifying, we afforded this finding particular deference. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73-74 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir.2007). The record reflects that Weng paused during her testimony, and on one occasion was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>mumbling to herself. Although Weng submits that an interpretation problem may have caused her slow responses, we decline to address the argument in the first instance, because, as the Government argues, Weng failed to raise this argument before the BIA. <em>See Lin Zhang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 122 (2d Cir.2007). Moreover, because the agency identified other reasons to doubt Weng\u2019s testimony, we rely more confidently on the IJ\u2019s demeanor finding. <em>See Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 109 (2d Cir.2006). Accordingly, the IJ\u2019s demeanor finding was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">In finding Weng not credible, the agency also reasonably relied on an inconsistency in her testimony as to whether she used her own passport to depart China. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam). Under the REAL ID Act, an adverse credibility finding may be supported by inconsistencies in an alien\u2019s testimony, even when those inconsistencies are not central to the applicant\u2019s claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Weng argues that her testimony was not inconsistent, because she explained that she fled to Hong Kong using the documents arranged by the smuggler, but left Hong Kong using her own passport. However, the agency did not err in finding Weng\u2019s testimony inconsistent, as this explanation is insufficient to resolve the inconsistencies in her testimony and would not necessarily be compelling to a reasonable factfinder. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005):</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The agency also reasonably found implausible that Weng was a fugitive from the Chinese police but was able to depart China without difficulty, and, according to her final version of events, using her own passport. Weng argues that her ability to depart from Hong Kong with her own passport does not undermine her credibility. Again, however, her explanation would not be compelling to a reasonable factfinder. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">Lastly, the agency reasonably noted that Weng\u2019s failure to provide a document she claimed Chinese police had served on her parents further undermined her credibility. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii). Although Weng argues that it would have been difficult for her illiterate parents to deliver this document from China, the agency did not err finding that her failure to produce this document further undermined her credibility. <em>See Biao Yang v. Gonzales, </em>496 F.3d 268, 273 (2d Cir.2007) (holding that the agency may rely on a lack of corroborative evidence where an applicant\u2019s testimony is not otherwise credible); <em>Majidi, </em>430 F.3d at 80-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">Ultimately, because a reasonable fact-finder would not be compelled to conclude to the contrary, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence, and the agency\u2019s denial of Weng\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief was not in error as all three claims shared the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006) (withholding of removal); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005) (CAT). To the extent that Weng claims to fear torture due to her illegal departure from China, we decline to address this claim because Weng did not exhaust it before the BIA. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 122 (2d Cir.2007). Regardless, because Weng fails to point to any evidence in support of her illegal departure claim, it is without merit. <em>See Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 160 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
