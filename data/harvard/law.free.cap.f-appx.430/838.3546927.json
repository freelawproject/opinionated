After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">On appeal, Michel argues that the district court violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights by imposing a 16-level guidelines enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), based upon Michel\u2019s prior felony conviction for armed robbery with a weapon. Michel contends that the district court could not rely on this prior conviction because it was not charged in Michel\u2019s indictment or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">However, as Michel acknowledges, this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). We repeatedly have explained that, even after <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and its progeny <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) , and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) , we are bound by <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>until it is explicitly overruled by the Supreme Court. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273-74 (11th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1246-47 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-13\">Michel argues that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>permits a sentencing court to find only the mere fact of a conviction and that <em>Apprendi, Booker, </em>and <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), bar judge-made findings about the factual nature of the prior convictions. This Court has already rejected this argument. <em>See Greer, </em>440 F.3d at 1275 (explaining that <em>Apprendi, Booker </em>and <em>Shepard </em>do not \u201cforbid a judge from determining the factual nature of a prior conviction,\u201d but instead \u201crestrictf] the sources or evidence that a judge (instead of a jury) can consider in making that finding\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-15\">In any event, at sentencing the district court did not resolve any disputed facts related to Michel\u2019s prior conviction for armed robbery with a weapon. Michel objected to the 16-level enhancement only on constitutional grounds. Michel did not object to the fact of his prior conviction (paragraph 26 of his Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d)) or argue that his prior conviction did not qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). Thus, Michel admitted the existence and nature of his prior conviction for sentencing purposes. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that there is no statutory <em>Booker </em>error where the defendant\u2019s sentence was enhanced based on facts to which the defendant did not object in the PSI at sentencing); <em>United States v. Burge, </em>407 F.3d 1183, 1191 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-16\">For all these reasons, the district court did not err in using Michel\u2019s prior armed robbery with a weapon conviction in calculating Michel\u2019s advisory guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
