After a bench trial, Brown was convicted and sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment and four years\u2019 supervised release. On appeal, Brown argues the counterfeit identification he used was insufficient to support his conviction. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-23\">In January 2008, police arrested Brown and his girlfriend, Heather Golden, in Houston, Texas after they presented a counterfeit check to purchase jewelry. Brown and Golden had schemed to defraud multiple jewelry stores by buying jewelry using fraudulent checks. After release on bail, Brown and Golden fled to the mobile home of Golden\u2019s stepfather, Scott Nevins, in Austin, Texas. In Austin, Brown and Golden met Jason Brooks, who was renting a trailer owned by Robert Storey, Golden\u2019s family friend and a resident of St. Croix. Storey\u2019s trailer is located on Nev-ins\u2019s property. After spending one night in Nevins\u2019s home, Brown took without permission Brooks\u2019s expired Texas driver\u2019s license from the glove compartment of Brooks\u2019s unlocked truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-24\">Brown and Golden subsequently fled to St. Croix. Before leaving Texas, they pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>chased a counterfeit Arkansas identification card. The false card displayed the name \u201cJason Brooks\u201d and Brooks\u2019s birth date as obtained from his driver\u2019s license, along with a fabricated address and Brown\u2019s photograph. In St. Croix, Brown and Golden resumed their scheme. They used a check-making software program to print checks in the name of \u201cJason Brooks\u201d that displayed account and routing numbers taken without permission from the payroll checks of the business \u201cCheeseburgers in Paradise.\u201d Brown and Golden used these checks to buy goods at stores in both St. Croix and St. Thomas, including $10,170 worth of jewelry from H. Stern Jewelry Store (H. Stern) in St. Thomas. For the H. Stern purchase, Brown identified himself using the counterfeit Arkansas identification card. On April 17, 2008, Brown attempted to use a fraudulent check to buy jewelry from the store Cruzan Gold in St. Croix. The vendor alerted police, who arrested Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Brown and Golden were charged under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344 with conspiracy to commit bank fraud in connection with their scheme to defraud H. Stern. Brown was also charged with aggravated identity theft under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(A) for assuming the identity of another individual during the transaction. Brown and Golden initially pleaded guilty, but Brown withdrew his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">In February 2010, Brown was charged with forty-five counts of various offenses. These charges included possession of contraband while incarcerated, conspiracy to possess counterfeit securities, and substantive bank fraud, as well as the aforementioned conspiracy to commit bank fraud and aggravated identity theft. Brown pleaded guilty to all except aggravated identity theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">On March 30, 2010, a federal grand jury indicted Brown of one count of aggravated identity theft in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1028A(a)(l) and 2. Following a bench trial on April 6, 2010, the District Court convicted Brown. On July 15, 2010, the court sentenced Brown to two years\u2019 imprisonment and four years\u2019 supervised release to run consecutively. Brown timely appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">On appeal, Brown contends the government produced insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction for aggravated identity theft.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He claims the counterfeit identification he used was insufficient to identify a specific person. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-13\">To prove aggravated identity theft, the government had to show beyond a reasonable doubt that Brown \u201cknowingly transferred], possesse[d], or use[d], without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A \u201cmeans of identification\u201d consists of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>any name or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific individual, including any-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-4\">(A) name, social security number, date of birth, official State or government issued driver\u2019s license or identification number, alien registration number, government passport number, employer or taxpayer identification number;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">(B) unique biometric data, such as fingerprint, voice print, retina or iris image, or other unique physical representation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">(C) unique electronic identification number, address, or routing code; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">(D) telecommunication identifying information or access device (as defined in section 1029(e))[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Brown argues <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>518 F.3d 230 (4th Cir.2008), supports reversal of his conviction. In <em>Mitchell, </em>the defendant selected a corresponding first and last name, city and state of residence, and year of birth from a phone book to create a false license. The counterfeit license contained no middle name and a fabricated house number, street name, month and day of birth. The court found these \u201cnon-unique identifiers ... were a hopeless muddle of matching and non-matching information,\u201d and \u201cthe non-matching identifiers ... were much more specific.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236. Furthermore, the defendant appropriated no \u201cunique identifier\u201d that might identify an individual alone, such as a social security or identification number. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">Brown contends his counterfeit Arkansas identification card did not display Brooks\u2019s middle name, Brooks\u2019s Texas address, or Brooks\u2019s individual identification number, all of which appear on Brooks\u2019s Texas driver\u2019s license. Brown argues these distinctions and omissions render the fraudulent Arkansas identification card incapable of constituting a \u201cmeans of identification\u201d of the Jason Brooks from whom Brown stole a Texas license.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-13\">When viewed in the light most favorable to the government, there was sufficient evidence for the District Court to conclude Brown knowingly used Brooks\u2019s \u201cmeans of identification\u201d and to convict Brown of aggravated identity theft. Brooks was an individual known to Brown whose driver\u2019s license Brown stole. From the first and last name, as well as the day, month, and year of birth on that license, Brown fashioned a counterfeit identification card he used to commit bank fraud. This information is more complete and specific to Brooks than the information found insufficient by the Fourth Circuit in <em>Mitchell. </em>Section 1028(d)(7) requires Brown to knowingly use information that constitutes a \u201cmeans of identification\u201d of a specific individual to support a conviction for aggravated identity theft. The District Court reasonably concluded the matching names and birth date on Brooks\u2019s genuine Texas driver\u2019s license and Brown\u2019s counterfeit Arkansas identification card did just that.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-15\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-6\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b221-7\">.

We will affirm \"if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v.
