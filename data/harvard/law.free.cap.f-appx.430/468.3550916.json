WHITE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b491-19\">Plaintiff-Appellant Wyvonnia Brooks appeals from the district-court order affirming the decision of the Commissioner of Social Security denying Brooks\u2019s claim for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income. For the reasons set forth below, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court and REMAND to the agency for thorough consideration of the entire record.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-20\">\n<em>FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b491-21\">In May 2004, Brooks filed applications for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income payments for the period beginning December 20, 2003, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>based on severe carpal tunnel syndrome in both hands and degenerative disc disease in her neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">A. <em>Medical Records</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">In September 2003, Brooks was working as a certified nurse technician when she injured herself moving a patient. Brooks was treated at the Baptist Hospital emergency room for pain and numbness in her left shoulder, wrist, and hand. A cervical spine x-ray showed \u201cdegenerative changes\u201d at the C5-6 level with \u201cdisc space narrowing and anterior osteophyte formation.\u201d Ten days later, Brooks underwent an MRI, which revealed \u201cminimal central posterior disc bulges at C4-5 and C5-6.\u201d The MRI report concluded that Brooks had \u201c[mjinimal spondylotic change at C4-5 and C5-6.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Although Brooks apparently did not complain about her neck, shoulder, or back to her primary care physician, Dr. Salil Roy, during a December 2003 visit, Brooks had been seeing another physician, Dr. Karl Fournier, during that time for \u201cneck pain and numbness of both upper extremities.\u201d On January 20, 2004, Dr. Fournier noted that \u201cShe has not improved very well with her cervical spine. I told her there is no[t] much else we can [do] as far as her neck pain. She is going to have to learn to live with it because there is not enough to do surgery and I decided not to do any discogram of her cervical spine because I do not think she will do well with surgery which might involve up to three levels if we do it because she has degenerative discs in her cervical spine like a lot of people in her age range.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">Dr. Fournier also diagnosed Brooks with carpal tunnel syndrome in both upper extremities, noting (based on nerve conduction studies) that it was more severe on the right side, but that Brooks had more symptoms on the left. Dr. Fournier had Brooks wear splints at night and work \u201con light duty with no lifting more than 20 pounds, no repetitive twisting, no repetitive bending.\u201d The splints did not work well and in February 2004 Dr. Fournier referred Brooks to a hand-surgery specialist, Dr. Barry Callahan. Dr. Fournier maintained Brooks\u2019s work restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">Dr. Callahan saw Brooks in February 2004. In his physical-exam notes, Dr. Callahan wrote that Brooks had a positive Phalen\u2019s test, positive Tinel\u2019s test, and a positive median-nerve-root-compression test on both her left and right hand and wrist.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dr. Callahan also noted that Brooks was obese. He recommended that Brooks undergo carpal-tunnel release surgery on both sides. In April 2004, Dr. Callahan examined Brooks and again recommended surgical release.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">Brooks sought an additional opinion with regard to her symptoms, and saw Dr. Douglas Weikert in May 2004. According to Dr. Weikert\u2019s notes, Brooks reported pain in her left and right arms and discomfort in her back and neck. Dr. Weikert diagnosed her with \u201cbilateral right greater than left, chronic advanced carpal tunnel syndrome\u201d and, like Dr. Callahan, recommended surgical release. Dr. Weikert opined that Brooks\u2019s carpal-tunnel syndrome developed gradually over the years and that her \u201cmorbid obesity\u201d was a risk factor in the development of the disease. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>He restricted Brooks to lifting no more than ten pounds and asked her to limit repetitive pushing and pulling.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Brooks underwent a surgical carpal-tunnel release on her right hand on June 3, 2004, and on her left hand on June 29, 2004. In an August 2004 visit to Dr. Weikert, Brooks complained of left shoulder pain and some locking of her right ring finger, along with \u201csome generalized pain, numbness and tingling in her fingers.\u201d Dr. Weikert noted that Brooks had well-healed incisions, and \u201cgood capillary refill, intact light touch sensation, and a negative Phalen\u2019s test in both hands.\u201d Dr. Weikert restricted Brooks to lifting 10 pounds or less occasionally, but noted that \u201cshe should be nearing a point where she can work without restrictions soon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">On September 12, 2004, Dr. Celia Gulbenk, a non-examining medical consultant for the State Disability Determination Services (DDS), assessed Brooks\u2019s physical residual functional capacity (RFC). Dr. Gulbenk listed morbid obesity as her primary diagnosis and carpal-tunnel syndrome as her secondary diagnosis. In the section of the RFC assessment form entitled \u201cExertional Limitations,\u201d Gulbenk checked boxes denoting that Brooks could 1) occasionally lift and/or carry 50 pounds, 2) frequently lift and/or carry 25 pounds, 3) stand and/or walk about 6 hours in an 8-hour work day, 4) sit about 6 hours in an 8-hour work day, and 5) push and/or pull without limitations. Dr. Gulbenk recommended no postural, environmental, or manipulative limitations. \u201cNo manipulative limitations\u201d means Brooks is not limited in 1) reaching in all directions (including overhead), 2) handling, 3) fingering, and 4) feeling. In the section of the form where Dr. Gulbenk was directed to explain how the evidence supports her conclusions, she noted Brooks\u2019s September 2003 MRI as showing minor spondylitis and \u201cno other abnormalities.\u201d Dr. Gulbenk also noted \u201cSevere CTS [carpal-tunnel syndrome], expected to improve to nonsevere by 12 months [after] AOD [alleged onset date]; pain is expected to subside.\u201d Dr. Gulbenk also noted \u201cNo evidence of any severe neck D/O [disorder].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">Brooks saw Dr. Weikert on September 20, 2004. He noted that Brooks complained of \u201cintermittent numbness and tingling, wrist pain as well as neck and shoulder pain.\u201d Brooks had a negative elbowflexion test and a negative Phalen\u2019s test. Dr. Weikert ordered a repeat nerve-conduction study and gave Brooks work restrictions limiting any lifting to 20 pounds and limiting grasping and pushing and pulling to less than 50% of the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">On October 26, 2004, Brooks underwent the repeat nerve-conduction study ordered by Dr. Weikert. In the conclusions section of the report, Dr. Robert Clendenin stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A__\">Abnormal study. There is electrodiagnostic evidence of moderate carpal tunnel syndrome bilaterally. There is no acute denervation present. The median latencies are much improved on comparison with the pre-op studies. The persistent slowing is most likely a remnant from the previous cts [carpal tunnel syndrome] and not a new acute syndrome. If her symptoms persist repeat median conductions would be useful to rule out a worsening or acute cts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-13\">Brooks next saw Dr. Weikert on November 1, 2004. Dr. Weikert noted that Brooks \u201cis complaining today of some left upper extremity, neck, and shoulder pain.\u201d Dr. Weikert compared Brooks\u2019s pre-surgery nerve study with her October 2004 study: \u201cPreoperatively, her electrical studies revealed a motor latency of 9 on the right and 5 on the left. Postoperatively, her electrical studies are 4.92 on the right and 4.45 on the left.\u201d After examining Brooks, Dr. Weikert opined that she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>reached maximum medical improvement and retained 4% impairments to both upper extremities. With regard to work restrictions, Dr. Weikert limited Brooks to occasionally lifting between 11 and 25 pounds, and directed that she should abide by that restriction until her next visit three months later. Dr. Weikert wrote that he \u201cwould expect this weight-lifting limit to be not permanent after the next visit,\u201d and \u201csuggested that if her neck and shoulder pain appears to be worsening, then she should consider having this evaluated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Brooks saw Dr. Weikert again on February 7, 2005. Brooks complained that her left shoulder was \u201ckilling\u201d her. Brooks also complained that her right ring finger would get \u201cstuck\u201d while straightened and that she had pain in both wrists, discomfort in her forearms, and intermittent tingling. Dr. Weikert noted that Brooks had a negative Phalen\u2019s test, but also noted that she had left shoulder pain during a supraspinatus stress test, and that her AC [acromioclavicular] joint was tender and her trapezium was painful along the anterior margin. Dr. Weikert concluded again that Brooks had reached maximum medical improvement as to her carpal-tunnel releases, and removed the lifting limitations he had previously put in place, leaving Brooks with no restrictions. Dr. Weikert discharged Brooks, stating, \u201cI have nothing further to add to her care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">On February 22, 2005, Brooks returned to her primary care physician, Dr. Roy. Dr. Roy noted \u201ctenderness cervical spine (C5-C7); pain left shoulder \u2014 spasm; pain both wrists.\u201d Dr. Roy also noted that Brooks was \u201cnot working now\u201d and was \u201crunning out of TennCare.\u201d Dr. Roy con-</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">tinued to be treat Brooks through at least May 2006; the record shows that Brooks saw Dr. Roy 17 times. In those visits, Brooks complained of left shoulder pain at least eight times, and of restricted movement of her left shoulder seven times. Dr. Roy also noted that Brooks reported pain and sometimes stiffness in both hands and wrists, a weak grip with her left hand, and pain in her neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">Dr. Roy at one point referred to Brooks\u2019s left-arm pain as \u201cbursitis,\u201d and consistently prescribed 800 milligrams of ibuprofen. At one point, Brooks apparently experienced relief with the ibuprofen. However, notes from later appointments show that she subsequently complained of pain in her left shoulder and wrist. In a March 2006 appointment, Brooks\u2019s left shoulder range of movement was apparently \u201cimproved.\u201d However, in April 2006 she complained of \u201cdrawing\u201d of her left arm. By May 2006, Roy noted an \u201cincreased range of movement.\u201d He also discontinued the ibuprofen and substituted Tylenol.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">On April 24, 2006, Dr. Roy filled out a form entitled \u201cMedical Source Statement of Ability to Do Work-Related Activities (Physical).\u201d Under the category of exertional limitations, Dr. Roy reported that 1) Brooks could occasionally lift less than ten pounds, 2) Brooks could stand or walk less than 2 hours in an 8-hour work day, 3) Brooks could sit less than 6 hours in an 8-hour work day, and 4) Brooks was limited in upper extremities in that she could only push or pull up to 90 degrees with her left shoulder. In support of these conclusions, Dr. Roy wrote, \u201cHas bursitis affecting left shoulder; Limited movement of the left shoulder; Neuropathic pain left shoul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>der[.]\u201d With regard to postural limitations, Dr. Roy checked boxes indicating that Brooks could never climb, kneel, crouch, or crawl. With regard to manipulative limitations, Dr. Roy checked boxes indicating that Brooks was limited in the categories of reaching in all directions and fingering/fine manipulation. In support of these conclusions, Dr. Roy wrote, \u201cSevere pain affecting the left shoulder and left upper arm.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">B. <em>Administrative Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"A_L\">The administrative law judge (ALJ) held a hearing on August 9, 2006, at which Brooks and a vocational expert testified. Brooks testified that she was still having trouble with both her hands and the left side of her neck and shoulder. Despite her carpal-tunnel surgery, she still experienced wrist pain and her fingers \u201cdrawing up\u201d or bending and stiffening, and it was extremely painful for her to lift. When asked if she would be able to pick up paper clips on a table in front of her, she testified that she might be able to, but that her hands might draw up, and that she continually dropped things. Brooks stated that she almost broke her dentures the morning of the hearing when she was trying to brush them and her hands \u201creleasefd].\u201d She testified that her symptoms were worse on her left side, that she slept in wrist braces and wore a neck brace continuously while in the house, that she experienced pain on the left side from her hand all the way to her neck and shoulder, and that she had slight continuous headaches. She further testified that her left shoulder ached constantly and that the only way she could sleep was when she took 800 milligrams of ibuprofen, but stated as of the time of the hearing that she just \u201ctr[ies] to take\u201d the pain because \u201cnothing else eases it and Ibuprofen messes my stomach up.\u201d Brooks cut her hair short because the pain in her left arm prevented her from reaching above her head to fix it.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">As for her daily activities, Brooks testified that she had to start at 4:30 or 5:00 in the morning because it took her a long time to bathe and dress, and that she required her 17-year-old daughter\u2019s assistance to shave under her arms or apply deodorant and sometimes to put on her pajamas. Brooks estimated that she spent approximately 30 minutes to an hour per day doing chores. Brooks said she did not pick up the laundry basket, but was sometimes able to do the laundry by picking up one piece at a time; other times her daughter did it while Brooks told her what to do. Brooks also stated that she swept, although with a lot of difficulty because her shoulder \u201cgives [her] a fit\u201d and her hands lock around the handle of the broom. She testified that she and her daughter made the beds together and that her daughter did most of the cooking and washing the dishes. Brooks stated that a neighbor took care of her yard for her. She testified that she went grocery shopping about once a week, taking her daughter or someone else who would \u201cput the stuff in a basket and come out with me and bring it to the house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">Brooks testified that she had to lay down two or three times in a typical day, and that she could stand for 10-15 minutes before she needed to sit down and rest. She estimated that she could walk for 5-10 minutes before being short of breath and needing to rest, and that she could lift no more than 5 or 10 pounds. She stated that there were days she stayed in bed because she was too stiff to move; this happened two or three times a month in the summer, and about four days a week in the winter.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Brooks testified that she was able to drive and did so every day. She drove her daughter to school during the school year and also during summer school. She described participating in church activities including choir on Saturdays (for about an hour); worship and Bible study on Wednesdays (for two hours); overseeing youth Bible study on Thursdays (for an hour); and Sunday School, church services, and other programs on Sundays (for approximately 2-4 hours). When asked if her physical problems gave her difficulties in her church activities, she explained that she mostly sat during church activities, including choir rehearsal.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">The vocational expert (VE) explained that Brooks\u2019s past relevant work was as a certified nurse technician, a medium, semiskilled occupation. In response to the ALJ\u2019s question whether Dr. Gulbenk\u2019s RFC findings \u2014 occasionally lifting 50 pounds, frequently lifting 25 pounds, standing 6 hours per day, sitting 6 hours per day, and no other limitations \u2014 allowed Brooks\u2019s past work, the VE stated that they did. The ALJ then asked about an individual \u201ccapable of lifting less than ten pounds occasionally, no indication for frequent lifting, standing, walking less than two hours out of eight, sitting for less than six. Limitations in the use of the upper extremities, no postural activities except for occasional balancing, limited in the ability to reach and handle gross manipulation, limited in the ability to tolerate vibrations, humidity, wetness, hazardous machinery, fumes, odors, gas, dust.\u201d The VE responded that the capabilities of such a person were \u201cless than a full range of work at any exertional level, it\u2019s like less than a full range of sedentary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">C. <em>ALJ Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">On October 24, 2006, the ALJ issued his decision concluding that Brooks was not disabled. The decision followed the sequential five-step analysis explained in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520. The ALJ found that Brooks had three severe impairments 1) cervical spine spondylosis, 2) obesity, and 3) \u201cstatus post bilateral carpal tunnel release.\u201d The ALJ considered Brooks\u2019s shoulder pain separately from the above impairments and concluded that it was not severe, whether taken alone or in combination with other impairments. The ALJ explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWc\">[Brooks] testified her left shoulder pain is constant but refers to this pain in relation to her neck pain. Throughout the record she alleged shoulder pain multiple times. However, she complained of more neck and hand pain. On numerous occasions she failed to mention any difficulty with her left shoulder. The record lacks appropriate radiological or diagnostic techniques that would support a medical determinable impairment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">The ALJ further concluded that Brooks was capable of performing her past relevant work as a certified nurse technician, and thus was not disabled for purposes of the Social Security Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">In reaching this decision, the ALJ determined that Brooks\u2019s testimony concerning the \u201cintensity, persistence, and limiting effects\u201d of the symptoms of her medical impairments was \u201cnot entirely credible.\u201d The ALJ concluded that Brooks\u2019s subjective allegations were not supported by either the objective medical evidence or her established daily activities. The ALJ cited the fact that Brooks alleged constant debilitating pain, but had not been prescribed muscle relaxants or narcotic pain medication. He also cited the fact that, despite receiving treatment for shoulder pain, \u201cthere [is] no correlating testing such [as a] radiological test or a specific diagnosis.\u201d The ALJ rejected Brooks\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>about needing frequent rests due to shortness of breath as \u201cnot consistent with participation in church activities including choir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">With regard to Brooks\u2019s RFC, the ALJ stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">[Brooks] has the residual functional capacity to perform medium work (lift/carry 50 pounds occasionally and 25 pounds frequently, stand/walk or sit for 6 hours out of an 8-hour workday) without additional limitations prior to December 2004. Following December 2004 the claimant had no severe impairments that would preclude her from performing her past relevant work as she had obtained maximum medical improvement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The physical functional limitations the ALJ found were the same as those recommended by Dr. Gulbenk. The ALJ stated that Dr. Gulbenk\u2019s assessment in her September 2004 non-examining consult \u201cwere well supported and consistent with the daily activities, and thus accorded great weight.\u201d In contrast, the ALJ gave \u201cno weight\u201d to Dr. Roy\u2019s April 2006 medical source statement because it \u201clack[ed] objective findings for upper left extremity impairments and limits.\u201d The ALJ also found that Brooks\u2019s daily activities \u201cdirectly refute\u201d limitations to the degree suggested by Dr. Roy, and that Dr. Roy\u2019s own treatment records did not support his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">The Appeals Council denied Brooks\u2019s request for review of the ALJ\u2019s decision on March 1, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">D. <em>District Court Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">In May 2007, Brooks filed a civil action to review the agency decision. She moved for judgment on the record, arguing among other things that the ALJ erred in affording no weight to Dr. Roy\u2019s assessment and controlling weight to Dr. Gulbenk\u2019s, that the ALJ failed to give good reasons for disagreeing with Brooks\u2019s primary care physician, and that her left shoulder condition was a severe impairment. The magistrate judge denied the motion in a brief order, adopting the arguments made in the Social Security Administration\u2019s response to the motion. In a single-page order, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation over Brooks\u2019s objections. It explained its rejection of Brooks\u2019s argument that the ALJ improperly gave no weight to Dr. Roy as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-13\">The Plaintiff is incorrect! ]. The Administrative Law Judge found the opinion of Dr. Roy to be unsupported by his own treatment record, inconsistent with Plaintiffs daily activities, and inconsistent with the record as a whole. Dr. Roy\u2019s treatment notes did not contain any radiological or diagnostic techniques such as observed swelling, withdrawal of synovial fluid. His treatment was conservative prescribing only Tylenol and ibuprofen. Failure to consider or use such techniques or steroidal injection or surgery suggests the shoulder injury was much milder than Dr. Roy opined.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-14\">[]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-15\">In contradiction to Dr. Roy\u2019s opinion, the Administrative Law Judge considered the opinion and diagnoses of Drs. Weikert, Dulbenik, and Gulbenk.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Administrative Law Judge considered these and the whole record in giving greater weight to their opinions than to those of Dr. Roy. The determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>the Administrative Law Judge is amply-supported by the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-4\">Brooks timely appealed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">A. <em>Legal Standards</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">This court reviews district-court decisions in social security cases <em>de novo. See Jordan v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>548 F.3d 417, 422 (6th Cir.2008). However, appellate review is limited to determining whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision \u201cis supported by substantial evidence and was made pursuant to proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Rogers v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>486 F.3d 234, 241 (6th Cir.2007). \u201cSubstantial evidence is \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lindsley v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>560 F.3d 601, 604 (6th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)). If the Commissioner\u2019s decision is based upon substantial evidence, this- court must affirm, even if substantial evidence exists in the record supporting a different conclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 604-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">A social security disability determination is made according to the five-step analysis set out in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-9\">First, [Brooks] must demonstrate that she is not currently engaged in substantial gainful employment at the time of the disability application. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(b). Second, [Brooks] must show that she suffers from a severe impairment. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(c). Third, if [Brooks] is not engaged in substantial gainful employment and has a severe impairment which is expected to last for at least twelve months, which meets or equals a listed impairment, she will be considered disabled without regard to age, education, and work experience. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(d). Fourth, if the Commissioner cannot make a determination of disability based on medical evaluations and current work activity and [Brooks] has a severe impairment, the Commissioner will then review [Brooks\u2019s] residual functional capacity (RFC) and relevant past work to determine if she can do past work; if so, she is not disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(e).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9U\"><em>Howard v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>276 F.3d 235, 238 (6th Cir.2002). If, under the fourth step, Brooks\u2019s impairment prevents her from doing past work, the analysis proceeds to the fifth step: the \u201cCommissioner will consider her RFC, age, education and past work experience to determine if she can perform other work. If she cannot perform other work, the Commissioner will find her disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(f).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">For the fifth step, the burden of proof shifts to the Commissioner. <em>See McClanahan v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>474 F.3d 830, 836 (6th Cir.2006). To meet this burden,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADp\">the Commissioner must make a finding \u201csupported by substantial evidence that [Brooks] has the vocational qualifications to perform specific jobs.\u201d <em>Varley v.

Specifically, she argues that the rationales given by the ALJ \u2014 that 1) on numerous occasions Brooks failed to mention any difficulty with her left shoulder, 2) there was no testing or other objective evidence of a left-shoulder condition,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 3) Brooks\u2019s daily activities refute the limitations assigned by Dr. Roy, and 4) Dr. Roy\u2019s own medical records fail to support his assessment \u2014 are faulty. Brooks also argues that it was improper for the ALJ to base his RFC finding on Dr. Gulbenk\u2019s recommendation because Dr. Gulbenk\u2019s September 2004 assessment necessarily did not consider the significant medical events and records that occurred afterward. Finally, Brooks argues that the ALJ failed to properly credit Brooks\u2019s symptoms, including pain, and that Brooks\u2019s testimony is supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">1. Whether the ALJ gave good reasons for giving no weight to Dr. Roy\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">a. Brooks\u2019s failure to mention difficulties with her left shoulder</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">\u25a0 The ALJ\u2019s assertion that \u201c[o]n numerous occasions [Brooks] failed to mention any difficulty with her left shoulder\u201d is problematic. The ALJ\u2019s opinion states a mere two sentences before that, \u201c[t]hroughout the record she alleged shoulder pain multiple times.\u201d Further, Brooks\u2019s allegations of shoulder difficulty are well documented in her medical records. She initially complained of shoulder pain at the time of her 2003 work injury. She then complained of left-shoulder pain to Dr. Weikert in August 20\u00d34, September 2004, November 2004, and February 2005, four out of the five visits to Dr. Weikert in the record. In her 17 visits total to Dr. Roy (16 of them between February 2005 and May 2006), Brooks was treated by Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Roy and specifically complained of left-shoulder pain or restricted movement 10 or 11 times. It also appears that Brooks complained about her shoulder when she sought chiropractic treatment in February 2006. On the whole, Brooks complained of shoulder problems more often than not. That Brooks did not complain of shoulder problems every single time she saw a doctor is not a good reason to discount the numerous times she did complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Relatedly, the ALJ discounts the number of times that Brooks complained of shoulder pain because she often complained about it in conjunction with her neck and/or hand pain. <em>See </em>A.R. 17 (\u201cShe testified her left shoulder pain is constant, but refers to this pain in relation to her neck pain. Throughout the record she alleged shoulder pain multiple times. However, she complained of more neck and hand pain.\u201d). But it makes sense that Brooks\u2019s shoulder complaints often overlapped with complaints concerning her neck, hand and wrist.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When Brooks was first injured, she complained of pain and numbness in all of those locations \u2014 shoulder, wrist, neck, and hand. The ALJ failed to explain how Brooks\u2019s concurrent experience of neck or wrist or hand pain along with her shoulder pain cuts against the allegation of shoulder pain. Accordingly, the ALJ\u2019s rationale that Brooks failed to mention difficulties with her left shoulder is not supported by substantial evidence and is not a \u201cgood reason\u201d to afford no weight to Dr. Roy.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">b. No testing or other objective evidence of a left-shoulder condition</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The ALJ reasoned, \u201cAlthough[ ] the treating record reflects treatment for shoulder pain, there [is] no correlating testing such [as a] radiological test or a specific diagnosis. The presence of a medically determinable impairment must be supported by objective medical evidence and cannot rest solely upon a claimant\u2019s subjective allegations. 20 [C.F.R. \u00a7 ] 404.1508.\u201d The ALJ concluded, \u201cThe April 24, 2006, opinion of Dr. Roy lacks objective findings for upper left extremity impairments and limits. Therefore his opinion is given no weight.\u201d (A.R.20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1508 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">What is needed to show an impairment. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-11\">Your impairment must result from anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities <em>which can be shown by medically acceptable clinical and, laboratory diagnostic techniques. </em>A physical or mental impairment must be established by medical evidence <em>consisting of signs, symptoms, and laboratoi'y findings, </em>not only by your statement of symptoms (see \u00a7 404.1527). (See \u00a7 404.1528 for further information about what we mean by symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">(Emphasis added.) 20 [C.F.R. \u00a7 ] 404.1528 states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-14\">Symptoms, signs and laboratory findings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-15\">(b) Signs are anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities which can be observed, apart from your statements (symptoms). Signs <em>must be shown by medically acceptable clinical diagnostic techniques </em>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>(c) Laboratory findings are anatomical, physiological, or psychological phenomena <em>which can be shown by the use of medically acceptable laboratory diagnostic techniques. </em>Some of these diagnostic techniques include chemical tests, electrophysiological studies (electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, etc.), roentgenological studies (X-rays), and psychological tests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">(Emphasis added.) Finally, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529 states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">How we evaluate symptoms, including pain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">(a) General. In determining whether you are disabled, we consider all your symptoms, including pain, and the extent to which your symptoms can reasonably be accepted as consistent with the objective medical evidence and other evidence. <em>By objective medical evidence, we mean medical signs and laboratory findings as defined in \u00a7 404.1528(b) and (c).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">In more than one place, the regulations state that objective medical evidence is medical signs and laboratory findings as defined in \u00a7 404.1528(b) and (c). <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1512(b)(1), 404.1529(a); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 404.1508. Since Dr. Roy did not conduct any lab tests, the only issue is whether Dr. Roy employed any \u201cmedically acceptable clinical diagnostic techniques\u201d under \u00a7 404.1528(b). On this record, we need not specifically define \u201cclinical diagnostic techniques\u201d in order to observe that it would be difficult to conclude that Dr. Roy employed any. Even if simply observing Brooks\u2019s shoulder would be a sufficient \u201ctechnique,\u201d Dr. Roy\u2019s notes referring to reduced motion and muscle spasm do not indicate whether he observed these aspects about Brooks\u2019s shoulder or whether she reported them. Thus, we conclude that the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Dr. Roy did not perform specific testing or show other objective medical evidence of a left-shoulder condition is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">The question that necessarily follows is whether this is a \u201cgood reason\u201d to afford Dr. Roy\u2019s conclusions no weight. While it is reasonable to give less weight to an opinion that lacks medical signs and lab findings to support it, the record <em>does </em>contain objective medical evidence of Brooks\u2019s shoulder impairment. In February 2005, Dr. Weikert\u2019s medical records state that Brooks\u2019s \u201cleft shoulder reveals pain with supraspinatus stress test.\u201d Further, there are numerous tests and other clinical diagnostic information in the record supporting Brooks\u2019s carpal-tunnel syndrome and cervical-spine spondylosis; again, two impairments that the ALJ acknowledged were severe. And there is no indication that the doctors who treated Brooks for those conditions regarded her shoulder pain (of which Brooks complained at the time) as resulting from a separate condition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Under other circumstances, the ALJ\u2019s lack-of-testing-or-objective-evidence rationale could be a good reason to dismiss Dr. Roy\u2019s opinion. However, on this record, we cannot conclude that Brooks\u2019s shoulder pain was distinct from her other well-documented and fully diagnosed impairments. Thus, the ALJ did not articulate a good reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">c. Brooks\u2019s daily activities refute the limitations assigned by Dr. Roy</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The ALJ\u2019s opinion characterized Brooks\u2019s daily activities as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">Her daily activities consist of driving her daughter to school everyday, going to the library, going to choir practice for 1 hour once a week, attending worship service every Wednesday, conducts youth bible study on Thursday, Sunday she goes to church from 10:00 to 12:30 and 3:00 to 5:00, and during holidays she attends church additionally.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The ALJ concluded that those activities \u201cdirectly refute\u201d the limitations Dr. Roy found. These limitations included only occasionally lifting less than ten pounds; standing or walking less than 2 hours in an 8-hour work day; sitting less than 6 hours in an 8-hour work day; no climbing, kneeling, crouching, or crawling; being limited in reaching (including overhead) and handling (gross manipulation); and being limited in exposure to vibration, humidity, wetness, machinery, heights, and fumes.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">The ALJ did not explain <em>how </em>Brooks\u2019s daily activities directly refuted Dr. Roy\u2019s stated limitations. Brooks\u2019s activities mostly involve sitting inside, and traveling by car to places where one generally sits inside. None of her daily activities necessarily involve the lifting, extended standing, extended walking or sitting, climbing or crouching from which she was restricted. Accordingly, the rationale that Brooks\u2019s activities \u201cdirectly refute\u201d Dr. Roy\u2019s limitations is not well supported by the record, and thus is not a good reason to devalue Dr. Roy\u2019s assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">d. Dr. Roy\u2019s own medical records fail to support his assessment</p>\n<p id=\"b502-13\">We have already discussed Dr. Roy\u2019s record entries depicting Brooks\u2019s pain and limitation of movement and his lack of record entries demonstrating testing or clinical techniques. The only significant point on this topic not yet addressed concerns Dr. Roy\u2019s recommended environmental limitations. Dr. Roy checked boxes indicating that Brooks should limit her exposure to 1) vibrations, 2) humidity and wetness, 3) hazards (machinery, heights, etc.), and 4) fumes, odors, chemicals, and gases. The ALJ\u2019s conclusion that the assessment is unsupported is correct as to the environmental-limitation portion of Dr. Roy\u2019s assessment. Dr. Roy wrote \u201cRecurrent upper [rjespiratory tract infections and allergy\u201d as the explanation for his assigned limitations. But Dr. Roy\u2019s medical records show only a single occurrence of a respiratory-tract infection, and make no mention of allergies.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-14\">The fact that Dr. Roy\u2019s records fail to support his environmental limitations is undoubtedly a good reason to afford no weight to that part of Dr. Roy\u2019s assessment. However, this limited deficiency is not sufficient reason to give <em>no </em>weight to <em>any portion of </em>Dr. Roy\u2019s assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Of the four \u201cgood reasons\u201d that .the ALJ can be understood to have offered for his decision to afford no weight to Dr. Roy\u2019s assessment, two are not supported by the record. Another, although technically supported by the record, is not a legitimate rationale for dismissing Dr. Roy\u2019s assessment. The final reason justifies affording no weight only to Dr. Roy\u2019s suggested environmental limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">2. Whether the ALJ properly gave \u201cgreat weight\u201d to Dr. Gulbenk\u2019s RFC determination</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Dr. Gulbenk concluded that Brooks could perform medium work (which involves lifting/carrying 50 pounds occasionally and 25 pounds frequently, and standing, walking or sitting for 6 hours out of an 8-hour workday), that she was unlimited in her ability to push and pull, and that she had no manipulative or postural limitations. The ALJ gave Dr. Gulbenk\u2019s RFC assessment \u201cgreat weight\u201d and ultimately assigned Brooks the exact same RFC as Dr. Gulbenk did. Of the three types of medical sources (non-examining sources, examining sources, and treating sources), a non-examining, non-treating physician is generally given the least weight. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(l)-(2). However, it is not always illegitimate for an ALJ to decide to accord greater weight to an agency physician over a treating source: \u201cIn appropriate circumstances, opinions from State agency medical ... consultants ... may be entitled to greater weight than the opinions of treating or examining sources.\u201d <em>Blakley, </em>581 F.3d at 409 (citing Soc. Sec. Rui. 96-6p, 1996 WL 374180, at *3 (July 2, 1996)). \u201cOne such circumstance may occur, for example, when the \u2018State agency medical ... consultant\u2019s opinion is based on a review of a complete case record that ... provides more detailed and comprehensive information than what was available to the individual\u2019s treating source.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Here, though, the ALJ gave inadequate reasons for affording Dr. Gulbenk\u2019s opinion great weight. Dr. Gulbenk\u2019s September 2004 assessment was necessarily limited in the medical records he reviewed, since many of Brooks\u2019s medical records are from after that date. This is especially significant because when Dr. Gulbenk examined Brooks\u2019s records, Brooks had just completed carpal tunnel release surgery on both hands and was seeing Dr. Weikert for follow up. At that time, Brooks\u2019s most recent doctor visit (August 2004) had been optimistic \u2014 although Brooks complained of left shoulder pain, locking of her right ring finger and some generalized pain, numbness, and tingling in her fingers, she had only recently completed her second surgery on June 29, 2004. Dr. Weikert noted that her incisions had healed well and that she had \u201cgood capillary refill, intact light touch sensation, and a negative Phalen\u2019s test in both hands.\u201d He anticipated a thorough recovery \u2014 \u201cshe should be nearing a point where she can work without restrictions soon.\u201d Thus, in September 2004, Dr. Gulbenk\u2019s assessment regarded Brooks\u2019s carpal-tunnel syndrome as \u201csevere ... [but] expected to improve to non-severe by 12 mos [after alleged onset date]; pain is expected to subside.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">But subsequent medical records show that Dr. Gulbenk\u2019s prediction proved inaccurate. Brooks continued to complain of pain to Dr. Weikert in visits leading up to and after the date 12 months after the alleged onset of her impairment (December 20, 2004). Eighteen days after Dr. Gulbenk\u2019s determination that Brooks could occasionally lift and/or carry 50 pounds, and push and pull without limitations, Dr. Weikert ordered a repeat nerve-conduction study and limited Brooks to lifting 20 pounds and to grasping, pushing and pull<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>ing less than 50% of the day. The nerve-conduction study was conducted October 26, 2004, and noted abnormal results, likely from Brooks\u2019s previous carpal-tunnel syndrome. The report portion of the study concluded that \u201cif [Brooks\u2019s] symptoms persist repeat median conductions would be useful to rule out a worsening or acute cts.\u201d Thus, the medical evidence indicated continuing carpal-tunnel symptoms inconsistent with Dr. Gulbenk\u2019s prior estimations. Further, Brooks saw her treating physician, Dr. Roy, 16 times after Dr. Gulbenk\u2019s September 2004 assessment. These records document Brooks\u2019s complaints of shoulder pain, wrist pain, restricted shoulder movement, weak hand grip, and various other symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Accordingly, in affording Dr. Gulbenk great weight, the ALJ relied upon a non-treating, non-examining source who reviewed Brooks\u2019s records a year and a half before Dr. Roy\u2019s assessment, and who did not have access to significant medical records from the period after her assessment that contained evidence of continuing problems with a relevant impairment. The ALJ could perhaps have relied on Dr. Gulbenk\u2019s dated assessment if the ALJ made clear that he had considered the effect of the subsequent medical records on the reliability of that assessment. <em>See Blakley, </em>581 F.3d at 409 (\u201c[W]e require some indication that the ALJ at least considered [the subsequent medical records] before giving greater weight to an opinion that is not based on a review of a complete case record.\u201d (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)). The ALJ did not do this here, however. The ALJ\u2019s opinion only acknowledges Brooks\u2019s first and last visits to Dr. Roy, and neglects to mention the numerous other documented visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">As we have noted above, the ALJ\u2019s opinion mischaracterizes Brooks\u2019s complaints of shoulder problems to Dr. Roy, and only selectively describes Brooks\u2019s subsequent visits to Dr. Weikert. Though the opinion mentions that Dr. Weikert concluded that Brooks had reached maximum medical improvement in November 2004 and released the temporary lifting restrictions he had imposed in February 2005, the ALJ gave no indication that he considered Dr. Weikert\u2019s November 2004 suggestion that \u201cif [Brooks\u2019s] neck and shoulder pain appeal!] to be worsening, then she should consider having this evaluated,\u201d and his notation on February 2005 that Brooks\u2019s left shoulder was \u201ckilling\u201d her. The opinion also ignores Brooks\u2019s October 2004 repeat nerve-conduction study. While the opinion <em>does </em>state that Gulbenk\u2019s limitations were consistent with Brooks\u2019s later account of her daily activities, this does not substitute for the ALJ\u2019s failure to demonstrate consideration of all of the relevant subsequent medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Because there is no indication that the ALJ separately considered all of the relevant medical records that post-dated Dr. Gulbenk\u2019s assessment when deciding to afford it great weight, the ALJ impermissibly violated the agency\u2019s rules, warranting remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">3. Whether the ALJ failed to properly credit Brooks\u2019s symptoms, including pain</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">The ALJ concluded that Brooks\u2019s testimony concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of her symptoms was \u201cnot entirely credible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">On the whole, the ALJ\u2019s conclusion is supported by substantial evidence. Brooks\u2019s testimony portrayed someone with very debilitating limitations \u2014 she testified that she was in constant pain, that during the winter she could not leave bed an average of four days per week, and that she could walk only about 5 to 10 minutes or stand 10 to 15 minutes because of being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>short of breath. The ALJ cited Brooks\u2019s daily driving, significant involvement in church activities, and performance of household chores as conflicting with Brooks\u2019s account of her symptoms. The ALJ may consider a claimant\u2019s daily activities in determining the credibility of her complaints of pain. <em>See Vance v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>260 Fed.Appx. 801, 805 (6th Cir.2008) (unpublished); <em>Cruse v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>502 F.3d 532, 542 (6th Cir.2007). In particular, the ALJ found Brooks\u2019s shortness-of-breath testimony inconsistent with participation in her church choir. The ALJ also noted that \u201c[d]espite her alleged constant debilitating pain, she has not been prescribed muscle relaxants or narcotic pain medication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Brooks raises several arguments in response, including that she stopped taking the ibuprofen for pain because it upset her stomach, that she had been prescribed oxycodone, Percocet, and Ultracet, and that the ALJ did not acknowledge the other steps she took to avoid pain such as getting her hair cut short so she would not have to reach for it, and having her daughter apply her underarm deodorant. While some of these arguments are legitimate, none undermine the valid substantial evidence the ALJ cited to support his conclusion. <em>See Blalcley, </em>581 F.3d at 407 (\u201c[I]f substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision, this Court defers to that finding \u2018even if there is substantial evidence in the record that would have supported an opposite conclusion.\u2019 \u201d) (citing <em>Key v. Callahan, </em>109 F.3d 270, 273 (6th Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The ALJ\u2019s conclusion that the Brooks\u2019s own account of the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of her symptoms was less than wholly credible is therefore supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Despite the fact that the ALJ\u2019s partial rejection of Brooks\u2019s hearing testimony is supported by substantial evidence, the ALJ did not give good reasons for giving <em>no </em>weight to Brooks\u2019s treating physician\u2019s assessment of her limitations and giving great weight to the assessment of an agency consulting physician. Several of the reasons the ALJ gave for discounting Brooks\u2019s treating physician\u2019s opinion were not supported by the record, and the two that were did not provide \u201cgood reason\u201d to reject the entirety of Dr. Roy\u2019s opinion. And, there is no indication that the ALJ considered significant medical records generated after the agency physician\u2019s September 2004 assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">Treating-physician opinions that are well-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and not inconsistent with other record evidence are entitled to <em>controlling weight. See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2). In the event that a treating physician\u2019s opinion is not entitled to that high level of deference, an ALJ must present <em>good </em>reasons, as articulated in the applicable regulations, not only for the lack of controlling weight afforded the treating physician, but for the weight afforded to the agency physician or other competing opinion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">After careful review of the record before us, we are convinced that this standard was not met here.

It appears the significant amounts of ibuprofen had an adverse affect on Brooks\u2019s stomach.

The ALJ did not explicitly list this as a rationale for giving no weight to Dr. Roy's opinion.

Regardless, because Dr. Roy's RFC conclusion depended upon Brooks\u2019s left shoulder injury/pain, the ALJ's rejection of Brooks\u2019s shoulder trouble as a severe impairment is an implicit reason for giving no weight to Dr. Roy\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b500-7\">. It is not the case, as the ALJ asserted, that Brooks \"complained [] more\u201d of neck and hand pain. Brooks complained about neck, shoulder, and hand pain roughly the same amount before February 2005. After February 2005, she complained of shoulder pain numerous times, wrist/hand pain twice, and neck pain once.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b501-10\">. The Commissioner would respond that the carpal-tunnel and spondylosis record evidence cannot shore up Dr. Roy\u2019s medical records because Dr. Roy himself chose the alternate diagnosis \"bursitis\u201d (but did not perform typical diagnostic tests for bursitis, and only treated it conservatively with ibuprofen and Tylenol). This is true in part \u2014 in his medical-source statement, Dr. Roy does note that Brooks \u201d[h]as bursitis affecting left shoulder.\u201d However, in the same document, Dr. Roy wrote \"[njeuropathic pain left shoulder,\u201d an indication that he had determined that Brooks\u2019s shoulder pain <em>was </em>related to her prior nerve injuries, the carpal-tunnel syndrome and cervical-spine spondylosis. <em>See </em>The Merck Manuals Online Medical Library: The Merck Manual for Healthcare Professionals, available at http://www.merck.com/ mmpe/sec 16/ch209/ch209c.html?qt=neuro-pathic% 20pain &amp; alt=sh (\"Neuropathic pain results from <em>damage to or dysfunction of </em>the peripheral or <em>central nervous </em>system.... <em>Neuropathic pain is suggested by its typical symp</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number><em>toms when </em>nerve injury <em>is known or suspected.\u201d) (Emphasis added), </em>see also http://www. merck.com/mmpe/se c04/ ch042/ch042f.html# sec04-ch042-ch042f-992 (carpal tunnel syndrome is a nerve compression syndrome); http://www.merck.com/ mmpe/sec 16/ch224/ ch224d.html? qt=cervical% 20spine% 20spondylosis &amp; alt=sh (cervical spondylosis categorized as a \u201cneurologic disorder\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
