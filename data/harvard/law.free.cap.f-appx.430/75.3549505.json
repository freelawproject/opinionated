Preska, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b98-20\">\n<em>SUMMARY ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b98-21\">We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case, which we summarize as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>In 1990, following a jury trial, Benefield was convicted of possession of a firearm after he had been convicted of a felony. He and a companion had used a sawed-off shotgun to rob a bookstore in Boston. He was sentenced to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment and 5 years\u2019 supervised release. He completed his sentence and was released on supervision in April 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">In May 2009, Benefield got into an altercation with a woman outside an apartment complex in Watertown, New York. He reportedly threatened and hit her with a metal pipe. He pled guilty in state court to menacing in the second degree and was sentenced in December 2009 to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment. Based on this state court conviction, on January 25, 2010, he pled guilty in the court below to a violation of his supervised release. The district court sentenced Benefield to time served, or 28 days, and 56 months of supervised release, to give him an opportunity to go to a treatment facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">On May 18, 2010, however, Benefield tested presumptively positive for the use of cocaine. The Probation Department commenced revocation proceedings based on this drug test, and Benefield pled guilty to the violation on June 7, 2010. A drug test administered the same day also was positive for cocaine and marijuana. With a Grade C violation and a criminal history category of VI, Benefield\u2019s range under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (the \u201cGuidelines\u201d) was 8 to 14 months. The district court sentenced Benefield to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment, without any additional term of supervised release. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">As in the sentencing context generally, a sentence in the revocation context must be reasonable, both substantively and procedurally. <em>See United States v. Verkhoglyad, </em>516 F.3d 122, 127 (2d Cir.2008); <em>see generally United States v. Cavera, </em>550 F.3d 180 (2d Cir.2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">Benefield challenges his sentence in two respects. First, he argues that the district court committed procedural error by failing to explain adequately its reasoning. We review this claim for plain error, as Benefield did not raise this procedural objection below. <em>Verkhoglyad, </em>516 F.3d at 128. Second, he argues that the district court committed substantive error by imposing a sentence ten months above the top of the Guidelines range. We apply a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-discretion standard\u201d here, as we consider whether the district court\u2019s sentence was \u201cwithin the range of permissible decisions.\u201d <em>Cavera, </em>550 F.3d at 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">First, as to the issue of procedural reasonableness, we conclude that the district court did not commit any error, much less plain error. It adequately explained \u201cin open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c). The district court noted that Benefield had been given \u201cmany opportunities to try and straighten out.\u201d Indeed, it noted that it had gone \u201cout of its way\u201d to give Benefield another chance when it sentenced Benefield to time served \u2014 only 28 days \u2014 for an earlier violation of supervised release following Benefield\u2019s guilty plea in state court to menacing a woman with a metal pipe. The district court also noted that Benefield had \u201ca history of violent criminal conduct\u201d and that he had \u201ccertainly violated the court\u2019s trust.\u201d The court referred also to Benefield\u2019s \u201congoing conduct,\u201d a reference to the fact that Benefield had tested positive for drug use not only on May 18, 2010, but again on June 7, 2010, the very day of the revocation hearing. <em>See, e.g., Verkhoglyad, </em>516 F.3d at 127-32 (holding that district court\u2019s oral statement of reasons for imposing 57-month sentence for possession of drugs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>while on probation was sufficient, where Guidelines range was 5 to 11 months); <em>United States v. Goffi, </em>446 F.3d 319, 320-21 (2d Cir.2006) (finding that district court\u2019s \u201cbrief explanation\u201d of specific reason for 24-month sentence was sufficient, where Guidelines range was 12 to 18 months).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Second, as to substantive reasonableness, we hold that the district court\u2019s determination to impose an above-Guidelines sentence of 24 months was not \u201cexceptional\u201d and fell \u201cwithin the range of permissible decisions.\u201d <em>Cavera, </em>550 F.3d at 189. In light of all the factors articulated by the district court, including, in particular, Benefield\u2019s breach of the district court\u2019s trust after it had shown him leniency in the prior violation for menacing, the sentence imposed was reasonable and appropriate. Moreover, Benefield\u2019s assertion that the district court failed to \u201caccount\u201d for his history of substance abuse, Appellant Br. 8, is misplaced, as Benefield\u2019s prior drug use was the subject of much discussion at the hearing by the district court as well as defense counsel. The district court acted well within its \u201cconsiderable sentencing discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>531 F.3d 163, 174 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">We have considered Benefield\u2019s remaining arguments, and conclude that they are without merit. For the reasons stated above, the sentence of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
