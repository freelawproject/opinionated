On appeal, Muhammad argues that: (1) the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his motion for default judgment against defendant Brenda Bethel because she never answered his complaint; and (2) the district court abused its discretion in <em>sua sponte </em>dismissing his action for failing to comply with its order to amend his complaint in accordance with local and federal procedural rules. After careful review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-19\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for default judgment for abuse of discretion. <em>Wahl v. McIver, </em>773 F.2d 1169, 1174 (11th Cir.1985). We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of an action for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>abuse of discretion. <em>Dynes v. Amy Air Force Exch. Serv., </em>720 F.2d 1495, 1499 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">First, we are unpersuaded by Muhammad\u2019s argument that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his motion for default judgment. A default judgment \u201cis a drastic remedy which should be used only in extreme situations.\u201d <em>Wahl, </em>773 F.2d at 1174. We have upheld the denial of a motion for default judgment where the district court found \u201cconvincing evidence\u201d that the defendant had not been served with the complaint and that the plaintiff had <em>not been </em>prejudiced. <em>Hamm v. DeKalb Cnty., </em>774 F.2d 1567, 1576 (11th Cir.1985) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\"> Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Muhammad\u2019s motion for default judgment against defendant Brenda Bethel. Although Muhammad alleged in his motion that Bethel had \u201creceived notice of the complaint,\u201d he did not offer proof that this was true. If Bethel had not been served with the complaint, then she was under no obligation to respond. The district court was correct to deny such a \u201cdrastic remedy\u201d where Muhammad offered no proof that Bethel was obligated to respond to his complaint. As to Muhammad\u2019s attempt, after the denial of this motion, to prove that Bethel had been served, the district court did not err in disregarding his proffer. The certified mail return receipt was signed by a \u201cTracey Estes,\u201d and Muhammad offered no proof that Estes was an agent \u201cspecifically authorized by [Bethel] to receive [Bethel\u2019s] mail.\u201d Ala.R.Civ.P. 4(i)(2)(C). Further, as discussed below, because the district court correctly dismissed Muhammad\u2019s action for failing to comply with its orders, Muhammad was not prejudiced by the denial of his motion for default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-12\">We also reject Muhammad\u2019s claim that the district court abused its discretion in <em>sua sponte </em>dismissing his action. A district court may <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss an action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b) for failing to comply with a court order. <em>Lopez v. Ark. Cnty. Indep. Sch. Disk, </em>570 F.2d 541, 544 (5th Cir.1978)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b). \u201c[Dismissal upon disregard of an order, especially where the litigant has been forewarned, generally is not an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Moon v. Newsome, </em>863 F.2d 835, 837 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-13\">However, where the statute of limitations will bar future litigation of an action dismissed without prejudice, we review the dismissal as if it was with prejudice. <em>Gray v. Fid. Acceptance Corp., </em>634 F.2d 226, 227 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Muhammad\u2019s claim is governed by Alabama\u2019s two-year statute of limitations under Ala.Code \u00a7 6-2-38 (1<em>). See City of Hialeah, Fla. v. Rojas, </em>311 F.3d 1096, 1103 n. 2 (11th Cir.2002) (\u201cSection 1983 claims are governed by the forum state\u2019s residual personal injury statute of limitations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-14\">Although <em>pro se </em>pleadings are to be construed liberally, a court may not \u201cserve as <em>de facto </em>counsel for a party\u201d or \u201crewrite an otherwise deficient pleading in order to sustain an action.\u201d <em>GJR Invs., Inc. v. Cnty. of Escambia, Fla., </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998), <em>overruled on other grounds, </em>see <em>Randall v. Scott, </em>610 F.3d 701, 709 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>As an initial matter, Muhammad\u2019s action was dismissed approximately one month before Alabama\u2019s two-year statute of limitations would have run. Thus, Muhammad had time to re-file his lawsuit before the statute of limitations ran, and we do not review the dismissal as if it was with prejudice. <em>See Gray, </em>634 F.2d at 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Next, Muhammad is incorrect that the court should have held a status conference to specify on which claims he could proceed. The court was not allowed to serve as Muhammad\u2019s <em>\u201cde facto </em>counsel,\u201d and in its order to amend his complaint, the court had already provided clear instructions on how to do so. <em>GJR Invs., Inc., </em>132 F.3d at 1369.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Finally, despite Muhammad\u2019s argument on appeal that the district court did not provide clear instructions on how to amend his complaint, the court twice warned Muhammad that he would be bound by both local and federal procedural rules and that the court could not rewrite deficient pleadings for him. As noted, the court also provided clear instructions on how to fix the complaint\u2019s deficiencies, including citations to the relevant local rules, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and an Eleventh Circuit case explaining shotgun pleadings. Furthermore, the court also twice warned Muhammad that his action would be dismissed without prejudice if he failed to correct the deficiencies in his complaint. Despite these instructions and warnings, Muhammad\u2019s second amended complaint was a 36-page document which included a series of rights that the defendants allegedly violated; an incorporation of facts and claims from Muhammad\u2019s previous filings \u2014 which the court had expressly forbidden in an earlier order; a single-spaced section listing a variety of constitutional sections, statutory sections, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and cases; and a single-spaced section listing a number of rulings that Muhammad hoped the court would make. This complaint did not comply with the court\u2019s order to file a double-spaced, concise complaint that would make clear which claims for relief related to which facts. Because Muhammad failed to comply with the court\u2019s order to fix these deficiencies, even after being warned that failure to comply would result in the dismissal of his action without prejudice, the court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing his lawsuit. <em>See Moon, </em>863 F.2d at 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b773-12\">.
