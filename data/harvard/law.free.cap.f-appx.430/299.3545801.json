The district court sentenced Franco to 57 months of imprisonment and a three-year term of supervised release. Franco filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>According to Franco, the Government failed to present any evidence that would sustain his conviction. To prove an escape offense under \u00a7 751(a), the Government must prove that the \u201cdefendant made 1) an unauthorized departure or escape, 2) from custody of an institution where the prisoner is confined by direction of the Attorney General, 3) where the custody or confinement is by virtue either of arrest for a felony or conviction of any offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>933 F.2d 307, 309 (5th Cir.1991). Franco stipulated to the second and third elements of the escape offense. To prove an attempt, the Government must show that \u201cthe defendant acted with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the commission of the underlying substantive offense\u201d and that \u201cthe defendant had engaged in conduct which constitutes a substantial step toward commission of a crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Partida, </em>385 F.3d 546, 560 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">In determining whether there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See United States v. Resio-Trejo, </em>45 F.3d 907, 910 (5th Cir.1995). The evidence here was that a bar was missing from Franco\u2019s cell, which he alone occupied. Two other inmates saw Franco outside his cell in the catwalk area between his cell and an exterior wall that had windows. The fifth window from the end was broken, and Franco had had one of the other inmates call a phone number and state that Franco needed help. The note also referenced the \u201cfifth one.\u201d Franco later had that same inmate call the number again to find out when the recipient of the telephone call was coming. A reasonable trier of fact could conclude from this evidence that Franco took a substantial step toward escaping from the ODC. <em>See Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). We thus uphold the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Franco argues that, during closing argument, the prosecutor improperly commented that the evidence against him was overwhelming. As Franco did not object in the district court, his challenge to the prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments is reviewed only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>482 F.3d 781, 785 (5th Cir.2007). A review of the challenged comment shows that it was not improper because it was clear that any conclusions urged by the prosecutor were to be drawn from the evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 785-86. Accordingly, Franco has failed to show plain error in this regard. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b321-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
