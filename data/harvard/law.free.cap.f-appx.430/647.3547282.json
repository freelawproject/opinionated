We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Sangha v. INS, </em>103 F.3d 1482, 1487 (9th Cir.1997), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-23\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that the harassment and discrimination Sudjana experienced in Indonesia did not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1016-18 (9th Cir.2003). In addition, the incidents her family and family\u2019s babysitter experienced in Indonesia while Sudjana was in the United States do not establish that she suffered past persecution. <em>See Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1060 (9th Cir.2009) (no past perse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>cution where harm to others was not a part of \u201ca pattern of persecution closely tied to\u201d petitioner). Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s finding that Sudjana failed to demonstrate a clear probability of future persecution because, even as a member of a disfavored group, she did not establish sufficient individualized risk, <em>see Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2003), and Sudj ana\u2019s similarly-situated family members have remained in Indonesia without harm, <em>see Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 816-17 (9th Cir.2001). Accordingly, Sudjana\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Sudjana failed to challenge the agency\u2019s denial of her CAT claim in her opening brief. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256,1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (issues in the opening brief not supported by argument are deemed abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b669-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
