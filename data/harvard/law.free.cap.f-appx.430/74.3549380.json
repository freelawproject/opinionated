May 18, 2010). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that such motions are \u201cdisfavored.\u201d <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 322-23, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992)). There is no dispute that Xia\u2019s October 2009 motion to reopen was untimely because her administrative order of removal became final in 2006. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a (c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Although Xia contends that the time and number limitations do not apply to her motion to reopen as it is \u201cbased on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c) (7) (C) (ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii), her arguments are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Xia asserts that she demonstrated changed conditions because she joined the Party for Freedom and Democracy in China (\u201cPFDC\u201d) after being ordered removed from the United States, and Chinese officials contacted her mother-in-law about her activities. However, as the BIA found, Xia\u2019s membership in the PFDC was a change in her personal circumstances, not a change in country conditions. <em>See Yuen Jin v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 143, 155 (2d Cir.2008). The record supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Xia has not established changed conditions \u201carising in\u201d China, as the evidence of conditions in China showed only a continuation of repression of political dissidents. <em>See id.; Wei Guang Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 273-74 (2d Cir.2006). Therefore, we find no abuse of discretion in the BIA\u2019s denial of Xia\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>Yuen Jin, </em>538 F.3d at 155. Because Xia did not establish an exception to the filing deadline, we do not reach her argument that she established her <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
