For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-17\">In 2006, the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire sentenced Edmunds to 252 months\u2019 imprisonment and a lifetime of supervised release following his pleading guilty to child pornography charges. It does not appear that Edmunds appealed from that judgment or moved to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-18\">In June 2010, Edmunds, who was (and still is) serving his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution at Fort Dix in New Jersey, filed a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (hereinafter \u201cthe District Court\u201d), challenging the legality of his confinement. On September 28, 2010, the District Court, acting sua sponte, dismissed the petition without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction and directed the District Court Clerk to close the case. In doing so, the court held that a \u00a7 2255 motion filed in the sentencing court, not a \u00a7 2241 petition, was the proper vehicle for presenting Edmunds\u2019s challenge to his confinement. The court further held that, because Edmunds had not timely pursued his remedies in the sentencing court, and since his petition did not appear to raise viable claims, \u201cit would not be in the interest of justice to transfer this Petition to the trial court, as a possible \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d (Dist. Ct. Op. of Sept. 28, 2010, at 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-19\">Edmunds subsequently filed a document titled \u201cmotion for summary judgment\u201d in the District Court in further support of his habeas petition. On March 29, 2011, the District Court entered an order reopening the case, denying the motion for summary judgment as moot, and directing the Clerk to re-close the case. The court concluded that, even if the motion had been filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>prior to the court\u2019s earlier order, the court would have denied the motion when it dismissed the petition. Edmunds now seeks to appeal from this most recent order.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Although Edmunds\u2019s notice of appeal challenges only the District Court\u2019s March 29, 2011 order, that order was informed by the court\u2019s analysis in its September 28, 2010 opinion. Accordingly, we will consider that analysis here.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">A \u00a7 2255 motion is the presumptive means by which a federal prisoner may attack his conviction or sentence. <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002). Relief under \u00a7 2241 is appropriate only if \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of the prisoner\u2019s detention. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002) (per curiam). \u201cA \u00a7 2255 motion is inadequate or ineffective only where the petitioner demonstrates that some limitation of scope or procedure would prevent a \u00a7 2255 proceeding from affording him a full hearing and adjudication of his wrongful detention claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Section 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective, however, merely because the prisoner has failed to file his \u00a7 2255 motion within the one-year statute of limitations period. <em>Id. </em>at 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">In this case, we agree with the District Court that (1) Edmunds failed to show that \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention, and (2) his habeas petition thus was subject to dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. Because the District Court lacked jurisdiction to consider Edmunds\u2019s habeas petition, the court properly denied his motion for summary judgment. As this appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order denying Edmunds\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
