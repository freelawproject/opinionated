We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal, <em>Huftile v. Miccio-Fonseca, </em>410 F.3d 1136, 1138 (9th Cir.2005), and decision regarding qualified immunity, <em>Beier v. City of Lewiston, </em>354 F.3d 1058, 1064 (9th Cir.2004). We review for an abuse of discretion the denial of leave to amend, <em>Chodos v. W. Publ\u2019g Co., </em>292 F.3d 992,1003 (9th Cir.2002). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">The district court properly dismissed Hudson\u2019s due process claim because it was barred by the release that he previously accepted. <em>See Marder v. Lopez, </em>450 F.3d 445, 449, 453 (9th Cir.2006) (discussing release of claims under California law and affirming dismissal of claims based upon release). Hudson\u2019s contentions that defendants breached the release are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">The district court properly dismissed Hudson\u2019s First Amendment claim without leave to amend after concluding that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity because the law regarding a prisoner\u2019s right to receive publications from non-approved vendors was not clearly established. <em>See Hope v. Pelzer, </em>536 U.S. 730, 739, 122 S.Ct. 2508,153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002) (\u201cFor a constitutional right to be clearly established, its contours must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>see also Cato v. United States, </em>70 F.3d 1103, 1106-07 (9th Cir.1995) (dismissal without leave to amend is not an abuse of discretion where amendment would be futile).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">Hudson\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-13\">We do not consider matters not specifically and distinctly raised and argued in the opening brief. <em>See Padgett v. Wright, </em>587 F.3d 983, 985 n. 2 (9th Cir.2009) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-14\">Hudson\u2019s request for publication is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b665-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
