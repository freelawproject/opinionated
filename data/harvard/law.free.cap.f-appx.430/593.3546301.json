Brady contends that his sentence, which exceeded the Guidelines range of 27-33 months, is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">The district court did not procedurally err. <em>United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 991-93 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc). And the sentence was not substantively unreasonable. Though the sentence was very harsh, the judge gave valid reasons for it, and the record supported the view that the defendant had an unrelenting history of crime and proved a high danger to the public whenever released. The district court was within its discretion in deviating from the advisory Guidelines sentence, and the court provided adequate reasons for the deviation, which remained within the statutory maximum. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(C); <em>United States v. Mohamed, </em>459 F.3d 979, 988-89 (9th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Cherer, </em>513 F.3d 1150, 1161 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b616-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
