Greatly condensed, the plaintiffs-appellants \u2014 who include Nicky Boy, a \u201cThoroughbred Female Horse,\u201d a dog named \u201cPooch\u201d or \u201cPouch,\u201d and human parties Solange Chadda and Kelly Hall \u2014 accused the defendants-appellees of engaging in a conspiracy to injure them and their animals, commit fraud upon them, extort them, threaten them, and defraud them of revenue, all ostensibly in connection with a series of events and misadventures connected to competitive horseracing. The center of this conspiracy was alleged to be Jeff Mullins, a well-known figure in the horseracing world. The storm of filings having settled, the District Court dismissed the action for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Plaintiffs-appellants attempted to amend their complaint, which was again dismissed <em>(sua </em>sponte) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Then, following a brief fugue in which plaintiffs-appellants attempted to remove the presiding District Judge on the \u201cbasis of his bias and prejudice,\u201d they filed a notice of appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We will now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">As tribunals of limited jurisdiction, federal courts must determine whether the case before them properly invokes either federal-question jurisdiction or diversity jurisdiction. Federal-question jurisdiction requires that a complaint \u201caris[e] under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, while diversity jurisdiction requires parties to be, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201ccitizens of different States,\u201d and to fulfill an amount-in-controversy requirement. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a). Here, despite plaintiffs-appellants\u2019 assertions regarding violations of \u201cfederal law,\u201d we discern no claims that may be fairly construed as arising under or involving federal law; as the District Court observed, the one federal statute to which plaintiffs-appellants cite is a criminal statute that does not grant a private right of action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, the plaintiffs-appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>lants may proceed only by demonstrating facts by which diversity jurisdiction can be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Instead, they have demonstrated to the contrary. Federal subject-matter jurisdiction may only be premised on diversity of citizenship when that diversity is complete: no plaintiff can be a citizen of the same state as any defendant. <em>Strawbridge v. Curtiss, </em>7 U.S. (3 Cranch) 267, 2 L.Ed. 435 (1806); <em>Midlantic Nat\u2019l Bank v. Hansen, </em>48 F.3d 693, 696 (3d Cir.1995). Citizenship for the purposes of jurisdiction is determined at the start of suit. <em>Smith v. Sperling, </em>354 U.S. 91, 93 n. 1, 77 S.Ct. 1112, 1 L.Ed.2d 1205 (1957); <em>Grand Union Supermarkets of the V.I. v. H.E. Lockhart Mgmt., </em>316 F.3d 408, 410 (3d Cir.2003). \u201cA natural person is deemed to be a citizen of the state where she is domiciled,\u201d <em>Swiger v. Allegheny Energy, Inc., </em>540 F.3d 179, 182 (3d Cir.2008), and we define \u201cdomicile\u201d as residency with intent to remain. <em>See Krasnov v. Dinan, </em>465 F.2d 1298, 1300 (3d Cir.1972). Here, it is undisputed that plaintiff-appellant Hall is a citizen of Arkansas who \u201cvisit[s] Philadelphia ... on occasion\u201d to stay with plaintiff-appellant Chadda. <em>See </em>Hall Aff., ECF No. 038. Defendant David Jolly also is a citizen of Arkansas. Therefore, as a plaintiff and a defendant shared the same state of citizenship, diversity jurisdiction could not lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">While the plaintiffs-appellants have filed a <em>pro se </em>appellate brief, they declined to address the relevant jurisdictional issue, presenting instead a confusing, jumbled array of conclusory arguments and accusations. Accordingly, the District Court correctly dismissed the action for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">Following this dismissal, the plaintiffs-appellants accused Judge Kelly of \u201cbias and prejudice,\u201d because of his \u201cgain from the racing entitity [sic ].\u201d They declined to substantiate these allegations, let alone show how Judge Kelly\u2019s \u201cimpartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). We perceive no error in Judge Kelly\u2019s failure to recuse. <em>See Securacomm Consulting v. Securacom, </em>224 F.3d 273, 278 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-6\">. Respondents David G. Jolly and Stepahead Farm assert that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal, as the plaintiffs-appellants \"have never filed an Appeal from the Order of November 9, 2010\u201d that originally dismissed the suit for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. While correctly observing that plaintiffs-appellants\u2019 notice of appeal is not timely when measured from the November 9, 2010, order, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), the order from which the appeals period should be measured is the one entered November 22, 2010. Dismissal on the basis of subject-matter jurisdiction is generally without prejudice. <em>See Ray v. Eyster (In re Orthopedic \"Bone Screw\u201d Prods. Liab. Litig.), </em>132 F.3d 152, 155 (3d Cir.1997). \"To be appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, an order of dismissal must ordinarily be with prejudice.... [However,] a plaintiff can appeal from a dismissal without prejudice when he declares his intention to stand on his complaint or when he cannot cure the defect in his complaint.\u201d <em>Booth v. Churner, </em>206 F.3d 289, 293 n. 3 (3d Cir.2000); <em>see also Borelli v. City of Reading, </em>532 F.2d 950, 951-52 (3d Cir.1976) (per curiam). Plaintiffs-appellants attempted to amend before \u201cstanding\u201d on their complaint after the November 22, 2010, order. Accordingly, the appeal was timely, and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 to exercise <em>de novo </em>review over the dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>See Huber v. Taylor, </em>532 F.3d 237, 243 (3d Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b215-11\">. On appeal, the plaintiffs-appellants assert violations of, <em>inter alia, </em>the Hobbs Act and Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) by the defendants-appellees. \"Absent compelling circumstances[,][we] will not consider issues that are raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>Shell Petroleum, Inc. v. United States, </em>182 F.3d 212, 219 (3d Cir.1999) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>(quoting <em>Patterson v. Cuyler, 729 </em>F.2d 925, 929 (3d Cir.1984)). No such circumstances are apparent. Procedural hurdles notwithstanding, plaintiffs-appellants still have not stated a plausible federal claim. <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1950, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009); <em>Santiago v. Warminster Twp., </em>629 F.3d 121, 128 (3d Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
