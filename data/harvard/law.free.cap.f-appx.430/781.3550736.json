Carr\u00f3n argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Carron\u2019s sentence is reasonable. Carr\u00f3n was convicted previously of possessing a firearm as a convicted felon and, as the district court found, received a \u201ctremendous break\u201d by being sentenced to 6 months of imprisonment and 24 months of supervised release. Four months after he completed that sentence, police officers found Carr\u00f3n in possession of burglary tools, tactical vests and equipment, and \u201csome very serious weapons,\u201d including four semi-automatic handguns, a pipe bomb, and seven improvised explosive devices. The district court reasonably determined that the guideline range of 70 to 87 months of imprisonment failed to address adequately Carron\u2019s decision to \u201cdo the same thing\u201d on a \u201cmore egregious scale,\u201d and that an upward variance was necessary to address the seriousness of Carron\u2019s offense, his disregard for the law, and his recidivism, and to provide a just punishment and protect the public. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court did not abuse its discretion by sentencing Carr\u00f3n to a term of imprisonment nine months above the top of the guideline range and well below the statutory maximum term of 120 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Carron\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
