Because the appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-15\">Kinley has previously attempted to litigate his dispute over injuries he claims he sustained as a result of alleged medical malpractice. In <em>Kinley v. St. Francis Medical Center, </em>Civ. No. 3:08-cv-05496 (D.N.J.2008), he brought a claim pursuant to the District Court\u2019s diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, and sought damages under numerous state law theories. Because complete diversity of citizenship did not exist between the parties, the District Court dismissed his complaint. Kinley did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-17\">In the instant action, Kinley again sought to litigate his dispute, this time invoking the District Court\u2019s federal question jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. He claimed that the Defendants violated his \u201cconstitutional right to due process\u201d by dismissing his state medical malpractice claim for failing to file an affidavit of merit, denying him a court appointed attorney and an expert witness to perform a medical exam, and \u201ckeeping all the materials that [he has] that prove [his] case off the records until this day.\u201d Compl. 2, ECF No. 1. The District Court dismissed his complaint pursuant to its authority under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-18\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions, <em>Mitchell v. Horn, </em>318 F.3d 523, 530 (3d Cir.2003), and can affirm the District Court\u2019s order on any ground supported by the record. <em>See Tourscher v. McCullough, </em>184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir.1999). We may summarily affirm if the appeal presents no substantial question. See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-19\">Dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e) is proper if a complaint is frivolous or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. To state a claim, a complaint must raise an allegation of sufficient factual matter which, if accepted as true, could \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, -, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). Kinley\u2019s filings do not do so. He provides no support for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>argument that the affidavit of merit requirement has been applied unconstitutionally, noting only that he \u201cfeels\u201d that that requirement denies him his \u201cconstitutional right to due process.\u201d Compl. 2. Accordingly, the District Court was correct to dismiss the action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">We are satisfied that amendment of Kinley\u2019s Complaint would have been futile, especially in light of the dismissal of his earlier attempt to bring this suit. The District Court therefore properly dismissed without leave to amend. <em>See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">As the appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the judgment below. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4 and 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-14\">. To the extent Kinley\u2019s complaint constituted an attempt to appeal the District Court's decision in his prior case, we agree with the District Court that Kinley should have filed an appeal from that decision instead.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
