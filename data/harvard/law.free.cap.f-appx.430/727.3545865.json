HARTZ, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b749-27\">Defendant Leonard Haskins was charged in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas with being a felon in possession of ammunition. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 924(a)(2). The district court denied Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the ammunition after ruling that (1) Wichita, Kansas, police officer Jonathan Estrada had lawfully stopped Defendant\u2019s car, and (2) under the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule, the evidence obtained in the search of Defendant\u2019s car incident to his arrest would not be suppressed even though the search was unlawful under the later Supreme Court decision in <em>Arizona v. Gant, </em>556 U.S. 332, 129 S.Ct. 1710, 173 L.Ed.2d 485 (2009). Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-28\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm. The information known to Officer Estrada gave him reasonable suspicion to believe that Defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>car was in violation of a Wichita ordinance. And the district court properly applied the good-faith exception. <em>See Davis v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2419, 2423-24, 180 L.Ed.2d 285 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">While Officer Estrada was driving his patrol car at 12:09 p.m. on November 25, 2008, he saw a blue Chevrolet Impala stop at an intersection. The Impala\u2019s brake lights turned on when the car stopped; but when the car began moving again and its brake lights went off, Estrada noticed that the right taillight was not operational. Estrada pursued the Impala, intending to stop it and issue its driver a citation for the defective taillight.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">The Impala eventually stopped in the driveway of a private residence. Officer Estrada turned on his emergency lights and pulled up behind the car. He told Defendant, who was already leaving the Impala, to remain inside; but Defendant shut the car door, stated that he was going to talk to someone in the house, and started walking away. Estrada commanded Defendant to stop. Defendant ignored the command until Estrada fired his taser. Although it malfunctioned, Defendant complied with Estrada\u2019s order to stop and place his hands on his car. But only briefly. As Estrada attempted to reset his taser, Defendant took off running away from the house. After being caught by another officer a few blocks away, Defendant was arrested, handcuffed, and locked in the back seat of a patrol car near his own car.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">Officer Estrada then searched the Impala incident to Defendant\u2019s arrest. In the driver\u2019s seat he found a jacket containing two .38 caliber bullets in one of its pockets.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">After being indicted, Defendant moved to suppress the bullets, arguing that both the initial stop and the search of his car incident to his arrest were illegal. The district court denied the motion. Defendant entered a conditional plea of guilty (allowing him to appeal the denial of his suppression motion) and was sentenced to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b750-13\">Defendant contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress because (1) the initial traffic stop was not justified at its inception; and (2) even if the traffic stop was legal, the search incident to his arrest was illegal under <em>Gant, </em>and the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule should not apply. \u201cIn reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we accept the factual findings of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous. The ultimate determination of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is a question of law, which we review de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Albert, </em>579 F.3d 1188, 1193 (10th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-14\">A. The Initial Traffic Stop</p>\n<p id=\"b750-15\">\u201cTo determine the initial validity of a traffic stop, we ask whether the stop was objectively justified.\u201d <em>United States v. De-Gasso, </em>369 F.3d 1139, 1143 (10th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). A stop is objectively justified if it \u201cis based on an observed traffic violation or if the police officer has reasonable articulable suspicion that a traffic or equipment violation has occurred or is occurring.\u201d <em>United States v. Eckhart, </em>569 F.3d 1263, 1271 (10th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). The officer\u2019s actual motivations or subjective intentions and beliefs are irrelevant. <em>See Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 813, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996). In particular, if the facts known to the officer support reasonable suspicion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>of a traffic offense, it does not matter that the officer was motivated by a belief that a different offense (even one for which there was not reasonable suspicion) had been committed. <em>See Eckhart, </em>569 F.3d at 1271-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">In this case Officer Estrada had the requisite reasonable suspicion to stop Defendant because he had observed that the Impala\u2019s taillight did not work and Wichita ordinances prohibit driving a vehicle with an inoperable taillight. One ordinance, entitled \u201cLights, reflectors on vehicles,\u201d requires every vehicle on Wichita\u2019s roadways to \u201cbe equipped with at least two tail-lamps.\u201d Wichita, Kan., Code \u00a7 11.60.040(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A second ordinance, entitled \u201cDriving without proper equipment unlawful,\u201d provides that \u201c[i]t is a traffic infraction for any person to drive or move ... any vehicle ... which ... is not <em>at all time </em>equipped with such lamps and other equipment <em>in proper condition and adjustment </em>as required in this chapter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 11.60.010(a) (emphasis added)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>. Taken together, these ordinances make clear that a vehicle being driven in Wichita must be equipped with operational taillights regardless of the time of day.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">On appeal Defendant asserts that Officer Estrada initiated the stop because he incorrectly believed that Defendant had violated Wichita ordinance \u00a7 11.60.030. That ordinance (entitled \u201cLighting headlamps \u2014 When\u201d) requires that taillights be illuminated \u201cfrom a half hour after sunset to a half hour before sunrise and at any other time when, due to insufficient light or unfavorable atmospheric conditions, persons and vehicles on the highway are not clearly discernable at a distance of one thousand feet ahead.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 11.60.030(a). Defendant argues that he had not violated that ordinance because the stop occurred shortly after noon on a sunny day. As we previously explained, however, Estrada\u2019s state of mind is irrelevant. A stop is supported by reasonable suspicion if, as here, the facts known to the officer indicate that an ordinance is being violated even if the officer mistakenly believes that another ordinance is the one that is being violated. <em>See Eckhart, </em>569 F.3d at 1271 (although an officer \u201cwas incorrect about which provision of law had in fact been violated\u201d at the time he initiated the stop, the stop was lawful because \u201che was not mistaken that what he observed ... violated [the] law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>Defendant also argues that ordinance \u00a7 11.60.010(a) itself requires that taillights be operational only when \u00a7 11.60.030 requires them to be illuminated. Thus, according to Defendant, his lights did not have to be in working order when Officer Estrada stopped him at noon on a sunny day \u2014 he could have taken his taillight to be repaired before sundown or he could simply have refrained from driving the Impala when it was dark. We reject that argument. Section 11.60.010(a) requires that a vehicle be <em>\u201cat all time equipped </em>with such lamps and other equipment <em>in proper condition and adjustment.\u201d </em>Wichita, Kan., Code \u00a7 11.60.010(a) (emphasis added). This language requires more than just that equipment work when it is needed. Officers need not wait until sundown to issue a citation to a driver whose vehicle is not properly equipped for travel after dark. In particular, the ordinance specifically includes \u201clamps\u201d as equipment that must be functional; yet if the ordinance meant what Defendant says it means, the word <em>lamps </em>could be omitted because ordinance \u00a7 11.60.040 already requires lamps to work (and be turned on) at designated times. We do not read <em>Carlson v. Ferguson, </em>270 Kan. 576, 17 P.3d 333 (2001), as suggesting anything different. Although <em>it </em>addressed a duty to have rear taillights on a towed vehicle, it considered state law, not a Wichita ordinance; and state law did not require the vehicle in question to be equipped with lamps \u201cat all time,\u201d but only at \u201call times specified in K.S.A. 8-1703,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 336-37 (internal quotation marks omitted), which required lighted lamps only from sunset to sunrise and when it is otherwise dark. The Wichita ordinance\u2019s \u201cat all time\u201d requirement is not qualified in a similar manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">We conclude that Officer Estrada had an objectively reasonable suspicion that Defendant had committed an equipment violation when he initiated the stop. The stop was therefore lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">B. The Vehicle Search</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">On appeal Defendant does not challenge the lawfulness of his arrest (assuming the traffic stop to have been lawful). Nor does he dispute that the search of his Impala was incident to his arrest. Also, he recognizes that under Tenth Circuit precedent predating <em>Gant </em>the search would have been lawful, <em>see United States v. Brothers, </em>438 F.3d 1068, 1073 (10th Cir.2006) (interpreting <em>New York v. Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 460, 101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1981), to \u201cestablish[] the bright-line rule that, \u2018when a policeman ha[d] made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, he [could], as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Belton </em>453 U.S. at 460, 101 S.Ct. 2860)), <em>abrogation recognized by United States v. McCane, </em>573 F.3d 1037, 1041-2 (10th Cir.2009). Defendant argues only (1) that under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gant, </em>the search incident to his arrest was unlawful, and (2) that the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule should not apply, so the fruits of the car search should have been suppressed. The second component of that argument fails under the recent precedents of <em>Davis </em>and <em>United States v. Soza, </em>643 F.3d 1289 (10th Cir.2011), because the search of Defendant\u2019s vehicle was after <em>Brothers </em>and before <em>Gant. </em>We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">III.
