McKAY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">Ronald Brown appeals from the district court\u2019s order dismissing without prejudice his pro se complaint for money damages in which he alleged that he was a victim of discrimination at a McDonald\u2019s restaurant because the cashier refused to accept his debit card. After granting Mr. Brown\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis, the court reviewed the complaint and issued an order to show cause why it should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim for relief. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) (providing that for complaints filed in for-ma pauperis, \u201cthe court shall dismiss the case ... if [it] determines that ... [it] fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted\u201d). The court considered the response and determined that Mr. Brown failed to state any actionable legal claims, and dismissed the case without prejudice. This appeal followed. We conclude that the court\u2019s order dismissing the complaint was not a final decision, and as such, we lack jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 to hear the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">Mr. Brown argues that the following facts in his complaint and response to the show-cause order stated a claim for the violation of his civil rights. Among other things, he alleged that he was flat refused to use my Bank of America Debt Card, I was told I had to <em>\u201cPay Cash.\u201d </em>R., Vol. I at 6. \u201cI [was] not able to purchase w/cash, my company give us cash for repairs. I told this wom[a]n, a Mexican lady.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As to the reason for the alleged discrimination, Mr. Brown asserted that \u201cI had some belief it was the tee shirt I was wearing had Arizona on it etc. But however her pro[ ]fessionalism was very bad. Had no people of color, it didn\u2019t Black etc. just mostly Mexican.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. He asked for money damages because he \u201chad to purchase my food not wanted in another location over [the cashier\u2019s] personal attitude she put out.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">In his response to the show-cause order, Mr. Brown stated that \u201c[i]t was a case of discrimination and my Civil Rights were violated when McDonald\u2019s employee denied me the right to be able to use my debit card, which all McDonald\u2019s across the country, accept debit cards.... The McDonald\u2019s employee refused me service by not allowing me to use my debit card.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-13\">The district court summarized the allegations \u201cas alleging a discriminatory practice by the defendant\u2019s employee, but [] failfing] to allege any actionable basis for a discrimination claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23. As the court further explained, Mr. Brown \u201chas not referred to any law that protects his status as a debit card user or that covers him for wearing a tee shirt with \u2018Arizona <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>on it,\u2019 \u201d <em>id.,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>noting in particular that \u201c[h]e has not alleged that he is a member of a racial minority and that he has been discriminated against on the basis of his race,\u201d <em>id,. </em>In deciding to dismiss the complaint without prejudice, the court wrote: \u201cBecause the plaintiff may be in a position to allege a basis for discrimination that is actionable, the court will dismiss the complaint without prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">\u201cA dismissal of the complaint is ordinarily a non-final, nonappealable order (since amendment would generally be available ...).\u201d <em>Moya v. Schollenbarger, </em>465 F.3d 444, 449 (10th Cir.2006). \u201cIn evaluating finality, ... we look to the <em>substance </em>and <em>objective intent </em>of the district court\u2019s order, not just its terminology.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The substance and objective intent of the district court\u2019s order is clear. The order acknowledged that Mr. Brown \u201cmay be in a position to allege a basis for discrimination that is actionable,\u201d and thus dismissed the complaint without prejudice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This was \u201ca sufficiently clear invitation to resurrect the action,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 454 (internal quotation marks omitted), that the dismissal without prejudice is not a final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction. Mr. Brown\u2019s \u201cMotion for Reconsideration by Plaintiff By the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals Denver, CO\u201d is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b723-10\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b724-7\">. As near as we can ascertain, Mr. Brown's theory is that the Hispanic cashier discriminated against him in response to Arizona's attempted crack-down on illegal immigrants and the fact that he was wearing an Arizona tee shirt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b724-24\">. On appeal, Mr. Brown appears to concede that his complaint does not contain anything about his race, arguing instead that the pertinent information was contained in the Civil Cover Sheet. Setting aside the fact that the allegations in the complaint are what is at issue, we have examined the Civil Cover Sheet and find no such information.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
