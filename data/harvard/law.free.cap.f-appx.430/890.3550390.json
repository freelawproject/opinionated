Shinseki, </em>23 Vet.App. 464, 471 (2010). Mr. King argues that the Veterans Court erred by failing to require an earlier effective date based on March 1995 and June 1997 communications between Mr. King and medical examiners at the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d). Because we find that the Veterans Court committed no reversible legal error in affirming the May 15, 2000 effective date, and since all other appealed issues extend beyond our jurisdiction, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b913-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b913-14\">Mr. King served in the United States Army from February 1980 to October 1983. Believing he had schizophrenia, Mr. King applied in February 1992 for service-connected benefits to a Veterans Affairs Regional Office (\u201cRO\u201d). The RO denied this claim, however. After an appeal, the Board also denied the claim (in August 1994). Mr. King chose not to appeal the Board\u2019s decision to the Veterans Court. As such, the adjudication became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-15\">On May 15, 2000, Mr. King sought to formally reopen his claim for service connection, providing as a basis medical records generated during March 1995 and June 1997 visits to a VA hospital. The Board ultimately reopened the claim, finding that Mr. King had presented new and material evidence since the initial 1994 Board decision. In 2004, the RO granted Mr. King a service connection for schizophrenia with a 100% disability rating, ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>fective May 15, 2000 (the date Mr. King formally applied to reopen his claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Mr. King, however, believed that he was entitled to an earlier effective date because of certain communications he made to the VA medical examiners during his March 1995 and June 1997 hospital visits. In particular, Mr. King believed his communications constituted \u201cinformal claims\u201d under the VA regulations. Therefore, he appealed the RO\u2019s decision to the Board. The Board denied Mr. King\u2019s request for an earlier effective date because the record \u201cd[id] not include any communication from the veteran or his representative received prior to May 15, 2000, that may reasonably be construed as an indication that he was seeking to reopen his claim for service connection.\u201d A Veterans Court panel affirmed, concluding that none of the records or other evidence associated with Mr. King\u2019s March 1995 and June 1997 medical visits showed that Mr. King possessed the necessary intent required by the VA regulations to warrant an earlier effective date. <em>See King, </em>23 Vet.App. at 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Mr. King timely appealed the Veterans Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">This court\u2019s jurisdiction to review decisions by the Veterans Court is limited. We have exclusive jurisdiction \u201cto review and decide any challenge to the validity of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof ... and to interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, to the extent presented and necessary to a decision.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(c). Absent a constitutional issue, we lack jurisdiction to review \u201c(A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">A. 38 c.f.r. \u00a7 3.155(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">Mr. King asks us to decide whether he is entitled to an effective date before May 15, 2000, which is the date he filed his request to reopen the final adjudication. The effective date for a benefits award stemming from a veteran\u2019s request to reopen a final adjudication is typically \u201cthe date that the request to reopen was filed.\u201d <em>Jones v. Shinseki, </em>619 F.3d 1368, 1371 (Fed.Cir.2010) (citing 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5110(a)). The VA regulations, however, permit claimants to obtain an earlier effective date in certain circumstances. For instance, under 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.155(a), \u201c[a]ny communication or action, indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits\u201d can qualify as an \u201cinformal claim\u201d so long as that claim \u201cidentifies] the benefit sought\u201d and is made by \u201ca claimant, his or her duly authorized representative, a Member of Congress, or some person acting as next friend of a claimant who is not sui juris.\u201d Under this court\u2019s precedent, a communication qualifies as an informal claim pursuant to \u00a7 3.155(a) if that communication (1) is written; (2) indicates an intent to apply for benefits; and (3) identifies the benefits sought. <em>Rodriguez v. West, </em>189 F.3d 1351, 1354 (Fed.Cir.1999). If these requirements are met, the date of the informal claim can serve as the effective date for the benefits award provided that the claimant timely submits an application form to the VA in accordance with the regulation. <em>See </em>38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.155(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">On appeal, Mr. King argues that he asserted an informal claim for benefits under 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.155(a) during both his March 1995 and June 1997 medical visits to the VA hospital and is thus entitled to a March 1995 or June 1997 effective date. While neither Mr. King nor any of the other entities listed in \u00a7 3.155(a) who may file on behalf of Mr. King submitted a written communication to the VA hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>staff during these visits, Mr. King argues that he satisfied \u00a7 3.155(a) because he communicated his intent to file a claim to the VA medical examiners who then recorded the contents of these communications in their written reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">In particular, the report from the March 1995 visit states that Mr. King \u201cis N[on-]S[ervice-]C[onnected] but is trying.\u201d The June 1997 report states that the \u201c[vjeteran wants to file a claim for service connected disability.\u201d If these notes show that Mr. King intended to file a claim for benefits during his VA hospital visits, as opposed to merely informing the medical examiners of his intent to file a claim in the future, it might be argued that he could enjoy March 1995 or June 1997 as his effective date instead of May 15, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">As the Veterans Court explained, the Board did not directly address the March 1995 and June 1997 visits in its opinion. <em>King, </em>23 Vet.App. at 472. The Board simply stated that the record \u201cd[idj not include any communication from the veteran or his representative received prior to May 15, 2000, that may reasonably be construed as an indication that he was seeking to reopen his claim for service connection.\u201d The Veterans Court did discuss the medical visits, however, characterizing Mr. King\u2019s communications to the VA examiners as mere \u201cwish[esj or desire[s] to obtain service connection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 471. The court concluded that Mr. King\u2019s statements that he \u201cwas \u2018trying\u2019 to obtain service connection and \u2018wanted to file\u2019 for service connection\u2019 ... failed to manifest the requisite intent to reopen a previously denied schizophrenia service-connection claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469. As such, the court held that the Board\u2019s decision setting May 15, 2000 as the effective date was not arbitrary and capricious. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">As evident in the Veterans Court\u2019s analysis, determining whether Mr. King\u2019s communications with VA examiners support a finding of intent under \u00a7 3.155(a) requires considering the facts in the recL ord and discerning what Mr. King was thinking when he visited the VA hospital. We lack jurisdiction to make findings regarding these fact-based issues and, therefore, cannot upset the Veterans Court\u2019s intent ruling. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2). As a result, we cannot award Mr. King an effective date prior to May 15, 2000 based on his argument that he had the intent necessary to file an informal claim under \u00a7 3.155(a) in March 1995 or June 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">In addition to the intent argument, Mr. King asserts that the Veterans Court erred because it interpreted \u00a7 3.155(a) to only permit the veteran himself (or one of the other entities listed in the provision who can file on behalf of the veteran) to satisfy the writing requirement. <em>See Rodriguez v. West, </em>189 F.3d at 1355 (holding that a communication can only qualify as an informal claim under \u00a7 3.155(a) if in writing). Under such an interpretation, a writing created by a person not listed in \u00a7 3.155(a), such as a VA doctor, arguably would not qualify as an informal claim under the regulation even if it accurately summarized the veteran\u2019s communications.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Veterans Court\u2019s interpretation is problematic for Mr. King because the VA medical examiners are the individuals who created the writings that Mr. King now asserts as his informal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">While we have jurisdiction to resolve this matter because it involves a purely legal interpretation of a regulation, <em>see </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(c), we decline to exercise that jurisdiction. \u201c[A]s an appellate court (where our jurisdiction permits), \u2018[w]e sit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>to review judgments, not opinions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Szemraj v. </em>Principi, 357 F.3d 1370, 1375 (Fed.Cir.2004). Therefore, \u201cif our decision cannot affect the judgment of the court below, because there was no legal error in the judgment itself, there is no basis for reversal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Here, a holding that the Veterans Court misconstrued \u00a7 3.155(a) in the manner proposed by Mr. King would not impact the court\u2019s finding that Mr. King lacked an intent to file an informal claim before May 15, 2000. Indeed, the intent element and the writing element each require their own, independent analyses. Put differently, even if we agreed with Mr. King and concluded that a writing produced by a medical examiner could qualify as an informal claim under \u00a7 3.155(a), Mr. King\u2019s effective date of May 15, 2000 would not change because of the Veterans Court\u2019s intent finding. As mentioned, the Veterans Court\u2019s intent finding must stand because we lack jurisdiction to review it. Because a ruling on who can write an informal claim under \u00a7 3.155(a) would not impact the ultimate judgment in this case (i.e., that May 15, 2000 is the effective date), we decline to address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">B. 38 c.f.r. \u00a7 3.157</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">Next, Mr. King challenges the Veterans Court\u2019s interpretation of 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.157, another VA regulation permitting an earlier effective date based on the filing of an informal claim. This provision permits a medical report itself to qualify as an informal claim in certain circumstances. <em>See </em>38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.157. On appeal, Mr. King does not argue that the medical reports produced during the March 1995 and June 1997 VA hospital visits meet the requirements of \u00a7 3.157. Instead, Mr. King argues that the Veterans Court erroneously construed \u00a7 3.157 such that it is the only regulation under which a veteran can rely on a medical record to support an informal claim. We have jurisdiction to resolve this issue because it involves a purely legal interpretation of a regulation. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">Nothing in the Veterans Court opinion suggests that the court construed \u00a7 3.157 as Mr. King alleges. Instead, the court\u2019s own analysis under \u00a7 3.155 indicates that it did not view \u00a7 3.157 as the only regulation permitting medical reports to support informal claims. Indeed, when analyzing intent under \u00a7 3.155, the court considered at length the medical reports from the March 1995 and June 1997 VA hospital visits. Therefore, we reject Mr. King\u2019s \u00a7 3.157 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">C. Board\u2019s Consideration of March 1995 and June 1997 Hospital Visits</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">Finally, Mr. King argues that the Board did not consider his March 1995 and June 1997 visits to the VA hospital when setting May 15, 2000 as the effective date. Therefore, according to Mr. King, the Veterans Court had no findings on this issue to review. As a result, Mr. King asserts that the Veterans Court\u2019s conclusions regarding the VA hospital visits (e.g., that Mr. King lacked intent under \u00a7 3.155) constituted initial, and thus improper, factual findings. In support of its argument, Mr. King relies on <em>Hensley v. West, </em>212 F.3d 1255, 1263 (Fed.Cir.2000), which states that the \u201cstatutory provisions [applying to veterans] are consistent with the general rule that appellate tribunals are not appropriate fora for initial fact finding.\u201d For the reasons stated below, we reject Mr. King\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">As acknowledged by the Veterans Court, the Board did not specifically mention Mr. King\u2019s March 1995 and June 1997 visits to the VA hospital in its opinion. <em>King, </em>23 Vet.App. at 472. The Board generally stated, however, that the record \u201cd[id] not include any communication from the veteran or his representative received prior to May 15, 2000, that may reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>be construed as an indication that he was seeking to reopen his claim for service connection.\u201d It is undisputed that the record before the Board contained the medical reports created during Mr. King\u2019s hospital visits. The Board is presumed to have considered all evidence contained in the record. <em>See Newhouse v. Nicholson, </em>497 F.3d 1298, 1302 (Fed.Cir.2007) (Board\u2019s failure to mention evidence in opinion does not overcome presumption that Board considered the evidence). Because the record before the Board contained the March 1995 and June 1997 medical reports, we must presume that the Board considered these reports and that its ultimate judgment setting the effective date at May 15, 2000 included a finding that these reports did not provide a basis for an earlier effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">The Veterans Court found no error in the Board\u2019s decision to set the effective date at May 15, 2000. <em>King, </em>23 Vet.App. at 472. The Veterans Court did, however, elaborate on the medical records issue, explaining that these records do not undermine the Board\u2019s conclusions. <em>Id. </em>at 470-71. Determining whether these elaborations rise to the level of initial fact findings requires a comparison between the Board\u2019s findings and the Veterans Court\u2019s findings. We lack jurisdiction to conduct this fact-based analysis. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">Mr. King attempts to couch his argument that the Veterans Court made initial factual findings argument as purely legal. In particular, Mr. King argues that had the \u201cVeterans Court applied the correct legal standard for judicial review, it would have concluded that the Board\u2019s finding of fact on the issue of whether Mr. King filed a claim to reopen prior to May 2000[was] arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d We could only reach this conclusion, however, after comparing the Board and Veterans Court findings in the manner discussed in the previous paragraph. Because Mr. King\u2019s proposed legal argument ultimately reduces to a fact-based analysis, we lack jurisdiction to address this matter under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292. <em>See Cook v. Principi, </em>353 F.3d 937, 937-38 (Fed.Cir.2003) (finding no jurisdiction because review of issue \u201cultimately reduce[d] to an application of the law to facts\u201d where veteran \u201cpresent[ed] his argument as a legal premise couched in terms of statutory interpretation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">Because we find that the Veterans Court committed no reversible legal error in affirming the May 15, 2000 effective date, and since all other appealed issues are beyond our jurisdiction, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b915-7\">. It is unclear whether the Veterans Court interpreted \u00a7 3.155(a) in the manner Mr. King alleges, but we will assume it did for purposes of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
