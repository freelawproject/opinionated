R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b592-16\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-17\">Defendant-Appellant Todd Howard appeals his convictions for harboring a fugitive, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071, and making a false statement, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-18\">I. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b592-19\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational juror could have found all of the essential elements of both crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-20\">A. Harboring a Fugitive</p>\n<p id=\"b592-21\">The evidence was sufficient for the jury to have found that Howard knew about the warrant for Hughes\u2019s arrest. FBI Agent Kraus testified that he told Howard to his face that Hughes had a warrant out for his arrest and was wanted by the FBI. <em>Cf. United States v. Yarbrough, </em>852 F.2d 1522, 1543 (9th Cir.1988) (holding that the government may prove knowledge of the warrant by inference). A reasonable juror could have concluded that Howard need not have physically inspected the warrant to have knowledge that Hughes was wanted.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Howard provided food, shelter, a shower, and a ride to Hughes after being told that Hughes was a fugitive. This rises to the level of harboring or concealing. <em>See id.; see also United States v. Hill, </em>279 F.3d 731, 738 (9th Cir.2002). Hughes told Howard he needed a ride to the storage unit so that he could retrieve items to sell to aid in his disappearance. The evidence was sufficient for the jury to have found that Howard harbored Hughes with the intent to prevent his discovery or arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">B. False Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">When asked by Agent Reid Nakamura whether he knew Hughes was wanted, Howard said that he did not know. As already discussed, sufficient evidence supports the jury\u2019s conclusion that Howard knew about the warrant; that same evidence supports a conclusion that Howard\u2019s statement to Nakamura was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">As Howard\u2019s statement pertained to the FBI\u2019s investigation of Hughes\u2019s flight from North Carolina, a jury could reasonably have found that the statement was material. <em>See United States v. Boone, </em>951 F.2d 1526, 1545 (9th Cir.1991) (\u201cThe materiality requirement ... is satisfied if the statement is capable of influencing or affecting a federal agency.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Finally, Howard contests the sufficiency of the evidence of intent. Because he raised this argument for the first time in his reply brief, it is waived, and we decline to address it. <em>Smith v. Marsh, </em>194 F.3d 1045, 1052 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">II. Agent Kraus\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">Howard expressly stated in his trial brief that, subject to a few conditions, he did not object to Agent Kraus\u2019s proposed testimony about the Sovereign Citizen movement. In the absence of an objection, we review the admission of evidence for plain error, and will only reverse if the appellant shows prejudice. <em>See United States v. Tisor, </em>96 F.3d 370, 376 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-13\">The majority of Agent Kraus\u2019s testimony, as appropriately limited by the district court, was relevant because it tended to show Howard\u2019s motive and intent. Even if some of the testimony might have been excluded had Howard objected as arguably irrelevant because the government failed to show that Howard himself held particular beliefs, any error in admitting the testimony was either not so obvious and clear-cut so as to be \u201cplain,\u201d or it was clearly harmless in the context of the case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-14\">III. Validity of the Indictment</p>\n<p id=\"b593-15\">Howard waived any challenge to the validity of the indictment by failing to raise alleged defects in the grand jury proceedings before trial. <em>See United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 630, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002) (holding that a defendant may waive his grand jury right and that defects in an indictment do not deprive a court of subject matter jurisdiction); <em>see also United States v. Kahlon, </em>38 F.3d 467, 469 (9th Cir.1994) (\u201cIrregularities in grand jury proceedings are considered defects in the institution of prosecution .... Failure to raise such defects before trial results in waiver of the objections.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b592-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-11\">. Howard\u2019s opening brief contains a passing mention of Kraus\u2019s supposed testimony concerning Howard's truthfulness.

Because I do not agree that the evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 for the making of a false statement to the FBI, I respectfully dissent in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The chai'ged false statement is that Defendant Howard said to FBI Special Agent Reid Nakamura in response to Nakamura\u2019s question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">Did you know [Hughes] was wanted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">Howard: Who is he wanted by?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-8\">Nakamura: The FBI. He\u2019s wanted by the FBI and he has an arrest warrant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-9\">Howard: No. I didn\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">Defendant contends that the statement, \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t know,\u201d was not material, which is an essential element of a false statement chai'ge. <em>See United States v. Gaudin, </em>515 U.S. 506, 509, 115 S.Ct. 2310, 132 L.Ed.2d 444 (1995) (\u201c[C]onviction ... requires that the statements be \u2018material\u2019 to the Government inquiry, and that \u2018materiality\u2019 is an element of the offense that the Government must prove.\u201d). The majority conclusorily states that \u201ca jury could reasonably have found that the statement was material,\u201d Maj. Disp. at 571 (citing <em>United States v. Boone, </em>951 F.2d 1526, 1545 (9th Cir.1991)) (\u201cThe materiality requirement ... is satisfied if the statement is capable of influencing or affecting a federal agency.\u201d), but the evidence does not support this assertion. There was no testimony or other showing as to how the statement could have \u201cinfluenced] or affect[ed]\u201d the FBI. Agent Nakamura testified that the question was \u201c|j]ust a standard question,\u201d \u201ca logical question.\u201d Moreover, as the majority concedes, the FBI already knew the answer to the question because, as FBI Special Agent Gregory Kraus testified at trial, \u201che told Howard to his face that Hughes had a warrant out for his arrest and was wanted by the FBI.\u201d Maj. Disp. at 570. Thus, it is quite plain that Defendant\u2019s denial, \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t know,\u201d made at a time when the FBI already knew that Defendant did know, was not a material statement. There is no way that this statement could have influenced the FBI and, indeed, it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">According to the Supreme Court, a \u201cmisrepresentation is material if it has a natural tendency to influence, or was capable of influencing, the decision <em>of the decision making body </em>to which it was addressed.\u201d <em>Kungys v. United States, </em>485 U.S. 759, 770, 108 S.Ct. 1537, 99 L.Ed.2d 839 (1988) (emphasis added). Similarly, we have said that \u201c[a] statement is considered material if it has the propensity to <em>influence agency action </em>.... \u201d <em>United States v. Vaughn, </em>797 F.2d 1485, 1490 (9th Cir.1986) (emphasis added). The government must prove \u201cthat the false statement has the intrinsic capability of influencing or affecting <em>the agency\u2019s or department\u2019s decision.\u201d United States v. Facchini, </em>874 F.2d 638, 643 (9th Cir.1989) (en banc) (emphasis added). Here, there was no possibility that Defendant\u2019s false statement could have influenced or affected the agency\u2019s, <em>i.e., </em>the FBI\u2019s, action because the FBI knew that the statement was false. After all, it was FBI Agent Kraus who told Defendant that Hughes was wanted and had an outstanding arrest warrant. That Agent Nakamura was momentarily misled because he did not then know all that the agency itself knew is of no moment. The statement was, in the circumstances, incapable of influencing the FBI \u2014 the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-13\">Because the charged statement was not material, I would reverse the conviction on the false statement charge, Count 2, vacate the sentence, and remand for resentencing on the remaining count. I respectfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>dissent from Part I.B. of the majority\u2019s disposition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
