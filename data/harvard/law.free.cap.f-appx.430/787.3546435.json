We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-17\">Yearty contends he was entitled to a mistrial because a government agent\u2019s testimony, which suggested his defense counsel had also been engaged in corrupt activities, materially prejudiced him. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Yearty\u2019s motion for a mistrial. <em>See United States v. Newsome, </em>475 F.3d 1221, 1227 (11th Cir.2007) (reviewing for abuse of discretion). The witness\u2019 testimony was not so prejudicial as to be incurable by the district court\u2019s curative instruction. <em>See id.) see also United States v. O\u2019Keefe, </em>461 F.3d 1338, 1350 (11th Cir.2006) (comments that impugned defense counsel\u2019s integrity were remedied by curative instruction). In addition, because the record contains sufficient independent evidence of guilt, Yearty cannot show that, but for the improper remarks, the outcome of the trial would be different. <em>See </em>New<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number><em>some, </em>475 F.3d at 1227. The district court did not err in denying a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Yearty also contends the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal as to his false statements conviction, because the questions asked during his August 18, 2008 FBI interview were fundamentally ambiguous. We reject the argument. <em>See United States v. Swindall, </em>971 F.2d 1531, 1553-54 (11th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Descent, </em>292 F.3d 703, 706 (11th Cir.2002) (denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal is reviewed <em>de </em>novo). The questions posed during his FBI interview were not so ambiguous that \u201cmen of ordinary intelligence\u201d could not agree as to their meaning. <em>See Swindall, </em>971 F.2d at 1553-54. Yearty\u2019s understanding of the questions was a matter for the jury to decide. The district court properly denied the motion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">In addition, Yearty contends the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the false statements count of the indictment (Count III), arguing the statements alleged did not relate to a material matter within the FBI\u2019s jurisdiction. We reject Yearty\u2019s contention that his false statements were legally immaterial. They pertained to facts forming the basis of the FBI\u2019s federal bribery investigation. <em>See' United States v. Rodgers, </em>466 U.S. 475, 477, 481-82, 104 S.Ct. 1942, 1945, 1947, 80 L.Ed.2d 492 (1984) (the statutory language of \u00a7 1001 \u201cclearly encompasses criminal investigations conducted by the FBI\u201d); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 533(1) (the FBI is authorized \u201cto detect and prosecute crimes against the United States\u201d); <em>United States v. Robison, </em>505 F.3d 1208, 1226 n. 24 (11th Cir.2007) (denial of a motion to dismiss is reviewed for abuse of discretion; underlying legal issue is reviewed <em>de </em>novo). The district court correctly concluded the false statements count of the indictment was not legally defective.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">Yearty also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal based on sufficiency of the evidence. Yearty challenges the sufficiency of the evidence as to his convictions for bribery, conspiracy to accept bribes, making false statements to the FBI, and as to his affirmative defense of entrapment. A reasonable construction of the evidence allowed the jury to find Yearty guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. McNair, </em>605 F.3d 1152, 1195-98 (11th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Lichenstein, </em>610 F.2d 1272, 1277-78 (5th Cir.1980), <em>abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Gaudin, </em>515 U.S. 506, 509, 115 S.Ct. 2310, 2313, 132 L.Ed.2d 444 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>(1995) <em>as recognized in United States v. Boffil-Rivera, </em>607 F.3d 736, 741 (11th Cir.2010);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Brown, </em>43 F.3d 618, 624-26 (11th Cir.1995). The district court did not err in denying Yearty\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Lastly, Yearty argues that the district court erred by denying his motion for a new trial \u201cbased upon the cumulative effect of errors at trial.\u201d We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for new trial only for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Vicaria, </em>12 F.3d 195,198 (11th Cir.1994). The district court did not err in any of its rulings, let alone commit cumulative errors that would entitle Yearty to a new trial. <em>See United States v. Waldon, </em>363 F.3d 1103, 1110 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201c[Because no individual errors ... have been demonstrated, no cumulative errors can exist.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b811-7\">. To the extent that Yearty argues that Count III is defective because it does not sufficiently allege enough to \"stand on its own content without dependence for its validity on the allegations of any other count not expressly incorporated,\u201d <em>United States v. Schmitz, </em>634 F.3d 1247, 1261 (11th Cir.2011), he has waived that argument because he did not raise it in the district court, <em>see Access Now, Inc. v. </em>Sw. <em>Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004) (\"This Court has repeatedly held that an issue not raised in the district court and raised for the first time in an appeal will not be considered by this court.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). Although Yearty argued to the district court that Count III should be dismissed, his argument in that court was that the FBI could not have jurisdiction because it did not ask the proper \"specific question to Defendant Yearty to establish the authority of the agency,\u201d and therefore \u201cthe questioning by the F.B.I. failfed] to invoke a statutory basis as it does not relate to any specific offense within the jurisdiction of the F.B.I.\u201d As we explained above, the district court properly rejected that argument because Yearty's false statements were material to the FBI\u2019s bribery investigation. The deficiency, if any, was that Count III did not include enough information to \"stand on its own,\u201d <em>Schmitz, </em>634 F.3d at 1261, not that the FBI was incapable of having jurisdiction based on its line of questioning, but Yearty did not raise that issue in the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b812-15\">.
