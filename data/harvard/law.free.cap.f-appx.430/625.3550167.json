Edwards (\u201cEdwards\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress grand jury testimony and dismiss the indictment. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-23\">Assuming, without deciding, that the district court erred in denying Edwards\u2019s motion to suppress Ledbetter\u2019s grand jury testimony, we conclude that the error was harmless. \u201c[A]s a general matter, a district court may not dismiss an indictment for errors in grand jury proceedings unless such errors prejudiced the defendants.\u201d <em>Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, </em>487 U.S. 250, 254, 108 S.Ct. 2369, 101 L.Ed.2d 228 (1988). Since the testimony and documentary evidence that Special Agent Brian Applegate presented to the grand jury were clearly sufficient to support the indictment, the admission of Ledbetter\u2019s testimony did not \u201c \u2018substantially [influence] the grand jury\u2019s decision to indict\u2019 \u201d and the district court properly declined to dismiss the indictment. <em>See id. </em>at 256, 108 S.Ct. 2369(quoting <em>United States v. Mechanik, </em>475 U.S. 66, 78, 106 S.Ct. 938, 89 L.Ed.2d 50 (1986) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring)).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b647-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b647-25\">Judge N.R. SMITH</author>\n<p id=\"A9g\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-26\">The district court did not err in refusing to dismiss the indictment or suppress Led-better\u2019s testimony, because there was no violation of the tax practitioner privilege. Congress specified that the privilege \u201cmay only be asserted in \u2014 (A) any noncriminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number><em>tax </em>matter before the Internal Revenue Service; and (B) any noncriminal <em>tax </em>proceeding in Federal court brought by or against the United States.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7525(a)(2) (emphases added). It is obvious that a grand jury hearing is not a matter before the Internal Revenue Service. Edwards conceded at oral argument that the grand jury hearing was not a tax proceeding in Federal court. The privilege was therefore inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">There is no reason for the court to extend a common-law privilege in this case. Congress has expressly provided that a tax practitioner-client privilege should only apply to a \u201cnoncriminal tax matter before the Internal Revenue Service\u201d or a \u201cnoncriminal tax proceeding in Federal court.\u201d <em>Id.; </em>Fed.R.Evid. 501 (\u201c[T]he privilege of a witness ... shall be governed by the principles of the common law,\u201d \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise ... provided by Act of Congress.\u201d)</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
