The district court sentenced him to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment, below the low end of the advisory guidelines range of 37 to 46 months. When he appealed, the United States moved to enforce the appeal waiver. <em>See United States v. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d 1315, 1328 (10th Cir.2004) (en banc) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Under <em>Hahn, </em>in evaluating a motion to enforce a waiver, we consider: \u201c(1) whether the disputed appeal falls within the scope of the waiver of appellate rights; (2) whether the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his appellate rights; and (3) whether enforcing the waiver would result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1325. In his response to the motion to enforce, Mr. Roman-Fernandez contends his appeal does not fall within the scope of the appeal waiver. Because he does not challenge the knowing-and-voluntary and miscarriage-of-justice factors, we need not consider them.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. porter\u00a1 </em>405 F.3d 1136, 1143 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">The appeal waiver in Mr. Roman-Fernandez\u2019s agreement is quite broad:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-12\">The defendant knowingly and voluntarily waives any right to appeal ... any matter in connection with this prosecution, the defendant\u2019s conviction, or the components of the sentence to be imposed .... The defendant is aware that Title 18, U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 affords a defendant the right to appeal the conviction and sentence imposed. By entering into this agreement, the defendant knowingly waives any right to appeal a sentence imposed which is within the guideline range determined appropriate by the court.... In other words, the defendant waives the right to appeal the sentence imposed in this case except to the extent, if any, the court departs upwards from the applicable sentencing guideline range determined by the court.... Notwithstanding the forgoing waivers, the parties understand that the defendant in no way waives any subsequent claims with regards to ineffective assistance of counsel or prosecutorial misconduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Mot. to Enforce, Attach. 1 (Plea Agreement) at 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">In response to the motion to enforce, Mr. Roman-Fernandez states he wishes to appeal the district court\u2019s addition of 16 offense levels for returning to the United States without authorization after being convicted of a felony crime of violence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). Without those 16 levels, the high end of the applicable Guideline range would have been less than the 24 months of imprisonment he received. He relies on the waiver\u2019s exception for \u201cthe situation where \u2018the court departs upwards from the applicable sentencing guideline range determined by the court.\u2019 \u201d Resp. at 2. He asserts, \u201c[implicit in this exception is that if the court makes an error in determining the applicable guideline, the exception is triggered.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">This argument is meritless. The upward-departure exception does not implicitly preserve challenges to alleged district court errors in calculating a Guidelines range. To hold the appeal waiver does not encompass such alleged errors would nullify the waiver based on the very sort of claim it was intended to waive. Further, it would ignore the concession in the plea agreement that the applicable Guidelines range is the one \u201cdetermined appropriate by the court.\u201d Mot. to Enforce, Attach. 1 (Plea Agreement) at 6. In <em>United States v. Smith, </em>500 F.3d 1206, 1210 (10th Cir.2007), this court examined a waiver stating, as in this case, \u201c[t]he defendant waives the right to appeal the sentence imposed in this case except to the extent, if any, the court departs upwards from the applicable sentencing guideline range determined by the court.\u201d The court held the appellant\u2019s \u201cchallenges to the District Court\u2019s application of the offense-level adjustments clearly fall within the scope of the waiver.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-12\">Because the appeal is within the scope of the waiver, the motion to enforce the plea agreement is GRANTED and this appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b676-9\"> This panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b676-10\">. In his introduction, Mr. Roman-Fernandez briefly alleges counsel was ineffective for not objecting to a 16-offense-level increase, but he does not develop this argument or explain why it would require non-enforcement of the waiver. Inadequate briefing results in a waiver. <em>See Phillips v. Calhoun, </em>956 F.2d 949, 954 (10th Cir. 1992) (\u201c[I]ssues designated for review are lost if they are not actually argued in the party\u2019s brief.\u201d). In any event, whether a defendant suffered ineffective assistance of counsel generally is best considered in collateral proceedings, even when a defendant seeks to invalidate an appeal waiver because of ineffective assistance. <em>See United States v. Porter, </em>405 F.3d 1136, 1144 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b677-7\">. The docketing statement indicated that Mr. Roman-Fernandez wished to withdraw his guilty plea and proceed to trial. Mr. Roman-Fernandez has since been appointed new counsel on appeal, so we rely on the representations in the response rather than the statement of issues in the docketing statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
