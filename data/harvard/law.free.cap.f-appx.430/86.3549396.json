We will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">On January 20, 2005, Delgado pleaded guilty before the United States District Court for the Northern District of Iowa to various drug-related offenses, and was sentenced to 234 months of imprisonment and a 10-year term of supervised release. <em>See </em>Judgment, <em>United States v. Delgado, </em>No. 5:04-cr-04043 (N.D.Ia. Jan. 20, 2005), ECF No. 28. Delgado did not appeal this sentence or a later denial of relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">Now housed at FCI Fort Dix, Delgado filed the instant 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey on July 14, 2010, claiming alternately that he was \u201cin custody in violation of Title 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851\u201d (which sets out procedures for sentence enhancements due to prior convictions) and that his counsel\u2019s \u201cperformance was unreasonable for not noticing and challenging the deficiency\u201d under that section. He argued that \u00a7 2241 relief was proper because he was \u201cnot challenging his conviction[;] instead[,] he [was] contesting the \u00a7 851 enhancement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">The District Court disagreed, holding that Delgado had not \u201cassert[ed] any grounds as to why Section 2255 would be [an] inadequate or ineffective\u2019 remedy to address his challenges to his federal sentence. All he assert[ ed was] that his federal sentence was erroneously enhanced.\u201d <em>Delgado v. Zickefoose, </em>No. 10-3661, 2010 WL 4366165, at *2, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115109, at *5 (D.N.J. Oct. 28, 2010). It therefore dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at *2, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115109, at *6.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-16\">The District Court was correct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is well settled that \u201c[mjotions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 are the presumptive means by which federal prisoners can challenge their convictions or sentences that are allegedly in violation of the Constitution.\u201d <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002). Section 2255 applies to claims \u201cthat [a] sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States ... or is otherwise subject to collateral attack,\u201d unless \u201cremedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [the] detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a), (e). Inadequacy is not presumed simply because procedural requirements, such as the one-year limitations period of \u00a7 2255(f), present an impediment to filing. <em>See Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538-39 (3d Cir.2002). Rather, proper use of \u00a7 2241 as a substitute for \u00a7 2255 is limited to rare circumstances, such as when a petitioner \u201chad no earlier opportunity to challenge his conviction for a crime that an intervening change in substantive law [negated].\u201d <em>See In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-17\">Here, Delgado seeks relief that would ordinarily be available under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Since he was not prevented from pursuing a \u00a7 2255 motion, \u201chabeas corpus relief is unavailable for lack of jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>tion.\u201d <em>Application of Galante, </em>437 F.2d 1164, 1165 (3d Cir.1971) (per curiam). As no substantial issue is before us, we will therefore summarily affirm<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-12\">. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and \"exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions [while applying] a clearly erroneous standard to its findings of fact.\u201d <em>See O'Donald v. Johns, </em>402 F.3d 172, 173 n. 1 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b110-13\">. Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6 allow us to summarily affirm when it is clear that no substantial question is presented by an appeal. <em>See United States v. Baptiste, </em>223 F.3d 188, 190 n. 3 (3d Cir.2000); <em>Tourscher v. McCullough, </em>184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
