(collectively, \u201cBouriez\u201d) with respect to Bouriez\u2019s negligent misrepresentation claim. Bouriez conditionally cross appeals the District Court\u2019s dismissal of his fraudulent misrepresentation claim. For the reasons that follow, we will vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-16\">We write for the parties\u2019 benefit and recite only the facts essential to our disposition. We also assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the two previous opinions issued by this Court in this matter. <em>See Bouriez v. Carnegie Mellon Univ., </em>585 F.3d 765 (3d Cir.2009) <em>(\u201cBouriez </em>II\u201d); <em>Bouriez v. Carnegie Mellon Univ., </em>359 F.3d 292 (3d Cir.2004) <em>(\u201cBouriez I </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-17\">CMU is a non-profit research university located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1997, an unincorporated nonacademic division of CMU was in the process of developing a \u201cmicrowave-enhanced catalytic cracking project\u201d (the \u201cmicrowave technology\u201d). <em>Bouriez II, </em>585 F.3d at 767. Later that year, CMU entered into a contractual relationship (the \u201csponsorship agreement\u201d) with third parties Governors Technologies Corporation and Governors Refining Technologies, LLC (collectively, \u201cGovernors\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the sponsorship agreement, Governors agreed to fund the commercialization of the microwave technology in exchange for the licensing rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-18\">Bouriez lives in London, England. In 1999, CMU approached Bouriez in order to solicit his investment in the microwave technology. After meeting with representatives of both CMU and Governors, Bouriez agreed to invest $5 million in Governors. Bouriez never entered into a contractual relationship with CMU.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-19\">Bouriez subsequently lost his investment, and both Bouriez and Governors claimed that CMU had induced their investments by making false representations about the microwave technology. In December 2002, Bouriez initiated this action against CMU, asserting claims for fraudulent misrepresentation and negligent mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>representation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bouriez did not file a complaint against Governors. In January 2003, CMU filed a demand for arbitration against both Bouriez and Governors, invoking an arbitration provision of the sponsorship agreement. CMU also filed a motion before the District Court to compel Bouriez to join that arbitration, a motion that Bouriez opposed. The District Court granted the motion, but this Court reversed in <em>Bouriez I </em>due to the lack of a contractual relationship between CMU and Bouriez. 359 F.3d 292. As a result, only CMU and Governors proceeded to arbitration, while the dispute between CMU and Boui\u2019iez remained before the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">On August 25, 2006, the arbitrator issued a final award against CMU and in favor of Governors (the \u201cArbitration Award\u201d). Appendix (\u201cApp.\u201d) 109-148. The Arbitration Award found, <em>inter alia, </em>that CMU had made negligent misrepresentations regarding the feasibility of the microwave technology to Governors; that the contract between the two parties should be rescinded; and that CMU should return Governors\u2019 investment, with interest and costs, and that all rights, title, and interest in the microwave technology should revert to CMU. In deciding against CMU on the claim for negligent misrepresentation, the Arbitration Award determined that CMU owed Governors \u201ca duty of full disclosure\u201d in light of the \u201cspecial\u201d or \u201cconfidential\u201d relationship between the two parties. App. 144-47. The Arbitration Award also held that in light of this relationship, Governors \u201cjustifiably relied\u201d on CMU\u2019s misrepresentations. App. 147. The Arbitration Award did not make any findings in regard to CMU\u2019s relationship with Bouriez. Ultimately, CMU paid Governors approximately $10 million to satisfy the Arbitration Award.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Bouriez and CMU subsequently filed cross motions for summary judgment before the District Court regarding the effect of the Arbitration Award. Bouriez argued that the Arbitration Award conclusively established CMU\u2019s liability on his claims pursuant to the doctrine of collateral estoppel, while CMU posited that its satisfaction of the Arbitration Award precluded Bouriez from establishing the requisite proximate causation elements of his fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation claims. On August 30, 2007, the District Court agreed with CMU and granted summary judgment in CMU\u2019s favor. App. 85-108. In <em>Bouriez II, </em>this Court vacated and remanded that decision. 585 F.3d 765. In so doing, we explicitly noted that \u201c[bjecause the collateral estoppel issue does not affect the outcome of this appeal, we express no opinion with regard to that dispute.\u201d <em>Bouriez II, 585 </em>F.3d at 766 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">On February 12, 2010, the District Court issued a Memorandum Opinion, holding that the Arbitration Award \u2014 which pertained only to the dispute between CMU and Governors \u2014 had a \u201cpreclusive effect\u201d on the dispute between CMU and Bouriez. App. 6-13. Bouriez subsequently filed a renewed motion for summary judgment on his negligent misrepresentation claim. CMU opposed this motion and filed its own motions for summary judgment, including one for summary judgment on Bouriez\u2019s negligent misrepresentation claim based upon the applicability of Pennsylvania\u2019s economic loss doctrine. On April 6, 2010, the District Court issued a Memorandum Opinion, granting Bouriez\u2019s motion and denying CMU\u2019s motions. App. 21-30. Specifically, the District Court held that \u201c[a]s is implicit in the Court\u2019s ruling on the preclusive effect of the Arbitration Award [in the February 12, 2010 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Memorandum Opinion], [Bouriez is] correct that said Award establishes [his] claim of negligent misrepresentation against CMU herein.\u201d App. 22. The District Court also determined that because Bouriez was \u201cnot bound by contract ... [Bouriez\u2019s] negligent misrepresentation claim is not precluded by the economic loss doctrine.\u201d App. 26 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Although neither Bouriez nor CMU previously moved for summary judgment as to Bouriez\u2019s claim for fraudulent misrepresentation, the District Court entered final judgment in favor of Bouriez following its April 6, 2010 Memorandum Opinion and ordered that the case be marked as closed. The parties thereafter filed a joint motion requesting that the District Court clarify its holding in regard to Bouriez\u2019s fraudulent misrepresentation claim. On April 26, 2010, the District Court entered a Revised Order and Judgment dismissing the claim for fraudulent misrepresentation \u201c[b]ased on ... [the] ruling that the Arbitration Award has preclusive effect on critical issues in this case ... [and] the Arbitrator\u2019s finding that Governors could not sustain its burden of proving fraudulent misrepresentation.\u201d App. 19. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">This is a diversity action governed by Pennsylvania law. <em>Bouriez II, </em>585 F.3d at 770. The District Court had jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(2) and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is plenary, and we apply the same legal standard as the District Court. <em>Vitalo v. Cabot Corp., </em>399 F.3d 536, 542 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">CMU appeals the District Court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of Bouriez with respect to Bouriez\u2019s negligent misrepresentation claim. Bouriez conditionally cross appeals the dismissal of his fraudulent misrepresentation claim. We will discuss each of Bouriez\u2019s claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">In its Memorandum Opinion dated February 12, 2010, the District Court held that the Arbitration Award had a \u201cpreclusive effect\u201d on the dispute between CMU and Bouriez.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court\u2019s subsequent grant of summary judgment in favor of Bouriez on his negligent misrepresentation claim in the April 6, 2010 Memorandum Opinion relied wholly on this finding. As noted above, the District Court held that \u201c[a]s is implicit in the Court\u2019s ruling on the preclusive effect of the Arbitration Award [in the February 12, 2010 Memorandum Opinion], [Bouriez is] correct that said Award establishes [his] claim of negligent misrepresentation against CMU herein.\u201d App. 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-14\">The District Court\u2019s reliance on the Arbitration Award to establish conclusively Bouriez\u2019s claim for negligent misrepresentation constitutes a misapplication of the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Pursuant to Pennsylvania law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Collateral estoppel is used offensively when the plaintiff seeks to foreclose the defendant from litigating an issue the defendant has previously litigated unsuccessfully in an action against another party....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-4\">[Collateral estoppel is valid if 1) the issue decided in the prior adjudication was identical with the one presented in the later action, 2) there was a final judgment on the merits, 3) the party against whom the plea is asserted was a party in privity or in privity with a party to the prior adjudication, 4) the party against whom it is asserted has had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in question in a prior action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-5\"><em>Shaffer v. Smith, </em>543 Pa. 526, 673 A.2d 872, 874 (1996) (internal quotations and citation omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cCollateral estoppel is based on the policy that \u2018a losing litigant deserves no re-match after a defeat fairly suffered, in adversarial proceedings, on an issue identical in substance to the one he subsequently seeks to raise.\u2019 \u201d <em>Plaxton v. Lycoming Cnty. Zoning Hearing Bd., </em>986 A.2d 199, 208 (Pa.Commw.Ct.2009) (quoting <em>McGill v. Southwark Realty Co., </em>828 A.2d 430, 434 (Pa.Commw.Ct.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">The District Court\u2019s February 12, 2010 Memorandum Order determined that all four elements for collateral estoppel were met in this case. In regard to the first element \u2014 that the issue decided in the prior adjudication be identical to the one presented in the later action \u2014 the District Court simply held \u201cthat the essential issues decided in the arbitration are identical to the ones presented in this case.\u201d App. 11. In two significant respects, this conclusion is erroneous in regards to Bouriez\u2019s negligent misrepresentation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">First, any claim for negligence, including a claim for negligent misrepresentation, requires the existence of a duty. <em>See Bouriez II, </em>585 F.3d at 771 (listing the elements of a negligent representation claim and including \u201ca duty recognized by law, requiring the actor to conform to a certain standard of conduct for protection of others against unreasonable risks\u201d (internal quotations omitted)). As noted, the Arbitration Award determined that CMU owed <em>Governors </em>a duty in light of the two parties\u2019 \u201cconfidential\u201d or \u201cspecial\u201d relationship. <em>See </em>App. 144^47. The Arbitration Award did not, however, discuss the relationship between CMU and <em>Bouriez, </em>and thus never held that CMU owed <em>Bouriez </em>any legally cognizable duty.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>Second, and related, an essential element of any negligent misrepresentation claim is that \u201cinjury must result to the party acting in justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation.\u201d <em>Gibbs v. Ernst, </em>538 Pa. 193, 647 A.2d 882, 890 (1994). In this case, the Arbitration Award relied on the existence of the \u201cspecial\u201d or \u201cconfidential\u201d relationship just noted to conclude that Governors \u201cjustifiably relied\u201d on CMU\u2019s misrepresentations. App. 147. Again, the Arbitration Award did not discuss the relationship between CMU and Bouriez, and as a result, there is no finding in the Arbitration Award that Bouriez justifiably or even actually relied on any representations made by CMU.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Accordingly, in regard to both of these issues, the District Court erred in relying on the Arbitration Award alone to establish Bouriez\u2019s negligent misrepresentation claim against CMU. Collateral estoppel \u201cforecloses the relitigation of an issue of law or fact only when ... the legal or factual issues are <em>identical.\u201d Yonkers v. Donora Borough, </em>702 A.2d 618, 620 (Pa.Commw.Ct.1997) (emphasis added). For the reasons stated, the legal and factual issues resolved by the Arbitration Award are not identical to the legal and factual issues presented by this case. We will therefore vacate and remand with instructions for the District Court to determine whether CMU owed Bouriez a legally cognizable duty under Pennsylvania law and whether Bouriez actually and justifiably relied on CMU\u2019s misrepresentations. CMU is entitled to litigate a defense on these issues before the District Court in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">In remanding this case, we also correct an error in the District Court\u2019s analysis regarding Pennsylvania\u2019s economic loss doctrine. The economic loss doctrine, stated in its most general form, precludes recovery in tort if the plaintiff suffers a loss that is exclusively economic, unaccompanied by an injury to either property or person. <em>See Excavation Techs., Inc. v. Columbia Gas Co. of Pa., </em>604 Pa. 50, 985 A.2d 840, 841 n. 3 (2009). In determining that the economic loss doctrine did not apply in this case, the District Court relied primarily on the assumption that because Bouriez was \u201cnot bound by contract ... [Bouriez\u2019s] negligent misrepresentation claim is not precluded by the economic loss doctrine.\u201d App. 26 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">This is wrong as a matter of Pennsylvania law. Pennsylvani\u00e1 has not limited the applicability of the economic loss doctrine to situations in which the parties are bound by a contractual relationship or are otherwise in privity with one another. Rather, as we have noted in two recent cases, Pennsylvania\u2019s economic loss doctrine may apply even in the absence of a contractual duty. <em>See Azur v. Chase Bank, </em>601 F.3d 212, 223-24 (3d Cir.2010); <em>Sovereign Bank v. BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club, Inc., </em>533 F.3d 162, 180 (3d Cir.2008); <em>see also Am. Stores Props., Inc. v. Spotts, Stevens &amp; McCoy, Inc., </em>648 F.Supp.2d 707, 713 (E.D.Pa.2009) (collecting cases and noting that \u201ccontrolling Federal and Pennsylvania state law hold that privity of contract is not required for application of the economic loss doctrine to [] negligence claims\u201d). The District Court thus erred in holding that the absence of a contractual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>remedy, by itself, precluded the applicability of the economic loss doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Pennsylvania has, however, carved out an exception to the economic loss doctrine for claims of negligent misrepresentation asserted pui\u2019suant to Section 552 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts. <em>See Excavation Techs., Inc. v. Columbia Gas Co. of Pa., </em>604 Pa. 50, 985 A.2d 840 (2009); <em>Bilt-Rite Contractors, Inc. v. The Architectural Studio, </em>581 Pa. 454, 866 A.2d 270 (2005). Section 552 \u201csets forth the parameters of a duty owed when one supplies information to others, for one\u2019s own pecuniary gain, where one intends or knows that the information will be used by others in the course of their own business activities.\u201d <em>Azur, </em>601 F.3d at 223 (internal quotations omitted). Accordingly, on remand, in the course of determining whether CMU owes Bouriez any legally cognizable duty, the District Court should determine whether CMU owes Bouriez a duty pursuant to Section 552, as such a duty would preclude the application of Pennsylvania\u2019s economic loss doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">In the April 26, 2010 Revised Order and Judgment, the District Court dismissed Bouriez\u2019s claim for fraudulent misrepresentation \u201c[biased on ... [the] ruling that the Arbitration Award has preclusive effect on critical issues in this case ... [and] the Arbitrator\u2019s finding that Governors could not sustain its burden of proving fraudulent misrepresentation.\u201d App. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">This holding misconstrues the doctrine of collateral estoppel, which, as noted above, only applies when \u201cthe party against whom [collateral estoppel] is asserted was a party or in privity with a party to the prior adjudication.\u201d <em>Capek v. Devito, </em>564 Pa. 267, 767 A.2d 1047, 1051 (2001). In this case, <em>CMU </em>was the party to the arbitration with Governors. Accordingly, the District Court erred in relying on the Arbitration Award to collaterally estop <em>Bouriez\u2019s </em>claim for fraudulent misrepresentation. <em>Cf. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. George V. Hamilton, Inc., </em>571 F.3d 299, 310 (3d Cir.2009) (\u201c[T]here is generally a bar against applying collateral estoppel to those who were not parties in the prior litigation.\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">CMU concedes this point, but invites this Court to extrapolate from the District Court\u2019s June 22, 2006 one-page order granting CMU\u2019s motion in limine to exclude any claim by Bouriez for punitive damages as somehow also constituting a dismissal of Bouriez\u2019s claim for fraudulent misrepresentation. <em>See </em>App. 5. Specifically, CMU posits that in the June 22, 2006 order, the District Court ruled \u201cthat the intent to deceive necessary for a fraud-based award of punitive damages is lacking in this case \u2014 and this is the same intent necessary to support any claim for fraudulent misrepresentation.\u201d CMU R. at 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">We disagree. As an initial matter, the District Court provided no rationale for its holding that Bouriez is not entitled to an award of punitive damages, and so it is purely hypothetical to assume that the holding was based on the lack of intent. And, in any event, CMU\u2019s argument fails as a matter of law. In Pennsylvania, a plaintiff may establish the \u201cintent to deceive\u201d adequate to support a claim for fraud but still fail to produce the requisite \u201cmalice\u201d necessary to support an award of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>punitive damages. <em>Cf. Tunis Bros. Co. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>952 F.2d 715, 740-41 (3d Cir.1991) (noting that under Pennsylvania law \u201cfraud is not alone a sufficient basis upon which to premise an award of punitive damages,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he rule, rather, is that for punitive damages to be awarded there must be acts of malice, vindictiveness and a wholly wanton disregard of the rights of others.\u201d (quoting <em>Smith v. Renaut, </em>387 Pa.Super. 299, 564 A.2d 188, 193 (1989))). We will therefore vacate and remand to the District Court to resolve Bouriez\u2019s fraudulent misrepresentation claim in the first instance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will vacate and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b206-5\">. Bouriez also asserted a claim for unjust enrichment, which he subsequently withdrew.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b207-8\">. There is no merit to Bouriez\u2019s claim that \"CMU does not challenge this decision and, therefore, is bound by the Arbitration Award.\u201d Bouriez Br. at 23. CMU appeals from the District Court's April 26, 2010 Revised Order and Judgment, App. 16-17, which explicitly relies on the February 12, 2010 Memorandum Opinion to grant Bouriez summary judgment on his claim for negligent misrepresentation, App. 19-20. CMU also consistently argues on appeal that \u201cthe District Court stretched precepts of collateral estoppel and judicial efficiency beyond their breaking point.\u201d CMU Br. at 22.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b208-6\">. This is a case of so-called \"offensive non-mutual collateral estoppel,\u201d as Bouriez is attempting to estop CMU from litigating issues that CMU previously lost in its arbitration with third-party Governors. <em>See generally Burlington N. R.R. Co. v. Hyundai Merch. Marine Co., </em>63 F.3d 1227, 1232 (3d Cir.1995). The Supreme Court has noted that this brand of estoppel may create perverse incentives: \u201cSince a plaintiff will be able to rely on a previous judgment against a defendant but will not be bound by that judgment if the defendant wins, the plaintiff has every incentive to adopt a 'wait and see' attitude, in the hope that the first action by another plaintiff will result in a favorable judgment.\u201d <em>Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, </em>439 U.S. 322, 330, 99 S.Ct. 645, 58 L.Ed.2d 552 (1979). This is precisely what appears to have happened in this case: Bouriez successfully opposed arbitrating his dispute with CMU, but now seeks to use the findings from that very same arbitration to estop CMU from litigating a defense before the District Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b208-11\">. Indeed, unlike CMU and Bouriez, CMU and Governors had a contractual relationship, and the existence of such a contractual relationship is a significant component in determining whether a \"special\" or \"confidential\u201d relationship exists under Pennsylvania law. <em>See Duquesne Light Co. v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., </em>66 F.3d 604, 612 (3d Cir.1995) (\"Pennsylvania courts analyzing whether there was a duty to speak [resulting from a confidential relationship] <em>rely almost exclusively on the nature of the contract between the parties </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>the scope of one party's reliance on the other\u2019s representations.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b209-7\">. Moreover, although there is some overlap between the alleged representations made by CMU to both Governors and Bouriez in 1997, Bouriez\u2019s claim for negligent misrepresentation also relies on different representations made by CMU solely to Bouriez in 1999, which were never discussed in the Arbitration Award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b210-8\">. Furthermore, Bouriez's claim for fraudulent misrepresentation \u2014 like his claim for negligent misrepresentation \u2014 is predicated not only on misrepresentations that CMU made to Governors in 1997, but also on misrepresentations that CMU made only to Bouriez in 1999. <em>See </em>supra note 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b211-17\">. Since we vacate the District Court\u2019s entry of judgment in favor of Bouriez, we will not address the various arguments relating to damages on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
