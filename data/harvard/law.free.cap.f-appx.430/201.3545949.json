(\u201cDiebold\u201d) filed this action against Continental Casualty Company (\u201cContinental\u201d) seeking a declaratory judgment that Continental is required under a commercial crime insurance policy to provide coverage for certain losses caused by Tri-State Armored Sendees, Inc. (\u201cTriState\u201d). The District Court determined that the policy\u2019s discovery clause precluded coverage because the losses were caused after Diebold\u2019s Risk Management Department had discovered prior losses caused by Tri-State and, on that ground, granted summary judgment to Continental. We will affirm for substantially the reasons set forth in the District Court\u2019s comprehensive and well-reasoned opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-13\">We write solely for the parties and discuss the facts only to the extent necessary to address the issues Diebold raises on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-14\">Diebold contracts with banks to provide various ATM services. For a time, Die-bold sub-contracted the \u201ccash replenishment\u201d or \u201ccash handling\u201d portion of its ATM services to Tri-State, a now-defunct armored car company. Under the arrangement, Diebold\u2019s customers would directly supply Tri-State with funds, usually by wire transfer or cash delivery, for TriState to replenish the ATMs. While in TriState\u2019s custody, significant amounts of Die-bold\u2019s customers\u2019 money \u201cdisappeared and/or were stolen.\u201d (A.1281.)</p>\n<p id=\"b224-15\">Diebold had notice of losses incurred by clients serviced by Tri-State as early as 1998. For instance, three Diebold managers were copied on a March 31, 1998 letter from Sharonview Federal Credit Union (a Diebold client) to Tri-State \u201cconcerning the serious problem with our cash account currently serviced by Tri-State,\u201d with more than $100,000 being at issue. (A.2389.) This correspondence was preceded by a Januax-y 20, 1998, letter to a Diebold customer sex-vice manager in which Sharonview demanded that Diebold pay it more than $100,000 \u201ccurrently being held by [Tri-State], as a direct result of funds removed by them, from Sharon-view\u2019s Cash Dispensers, from the period August 1, 1997 \u2014 December 31, 1997.\u201d (A.2388.) On May 12, 1999, NIH Federal Credit Union wrote to Diebold\u2019s Vice President of Service \u201cto inform you that several unexplained settlement differences have occux-red in our ATM\u2019s that are currently being sex*viced by Tri-State ... through a contractual relationship with Diebold.\u201d (A.2417.) The letter requested that Diebold x*eimburse NIH in the amount of $67,420. (A.2418.) A subsequent letter assex-ted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>the shortages had grown to $119,570 and demanded that Diebold remit that amount to NIH. (A.2419.)</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Diebold was not contractually liable to its customers for the losses caused by TriState, but nonetheless decided to reimburse them. For example, on July 1,1999, Diebold\u2019s \u201cManager of Risk Analysis,\u201d Jack J. Fortune, acknowledged NIH\u2019s claims and agreed to pay NIH $81,860. (A.2421.) As the District Court related in considerable detail, prior to October 2000, there were numerous other instances of Diebold receiving notice of losses or shortages sustained by Diebold customers serviced by Tri-State, and Diebold then making payments to its customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">In May 2000, Diebold was informed by the FBI that it was investigating a TriState official and suspected that the official may have taken \u201ca rough sum of about $2-$6 [million] dollars.\u201d (A.2474.) As a representative of Diebold, Fortune was informed of the FBI investigation suggesting theft by a Tri-State employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">In July 2000, Diebold was informed by its client, SunTrust Bank, of shortages attributed to Tri-State exceeding $30,000. (A.2422.) Fortune subsequently approved a payment by Diebold of $31,000 to Sun-Trust. (A.2424-25.) In August 2000, Die-bold\u2019s Director of Internal Audit received a telephonic status report from the FBI. His notes of the conversation state that there was \u201csome indication of internal embezzlement at Tri-State that could exceed $15-16 million since 1997.\u201d (A.2483.) On August 31, 2000, Fortune approved a payment by Diebold of $129,820 to First Union National Bank, writing that \u201c[t]his is a theft that took place in February.... Either a Diebold or Tri-State employee (or former employee) stole the money.\u201d (A.2450.)</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Notwithstanding this extremely troubling information, Diebold did not sever its relationship with Tri-State, and Tri-State continued to service Diebold clients after August 2000. Significantly, after August 2000, Diebold continued to receive notice of losses incurred by its clients attributable to Tri-State. For example, in January 2001, Diebold was copied on a letter sent by United National Bank to Tri-State that listed ATM settlement issues from November 2000. Diebold also continued to reimburse client losses after August 2000. It was not until February 26, 2001, that Diebold terminated its relationship with Tri-State. On March 2, 2001, Tri-State filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">Diebold initially sought to recover the amounts it had paid to its customers on account of Tri-State\u2019s conduct from TriState\u2019s insurer, but the insurer succeeded in rescinding Tri-State\u2019s policy on the basis of equitable fraud. <em>See In re Tri-State Armored Servs., Inc., </em>366 B.R. 326 (D.N.J.2007). Diebold then sought to recover the amounts it paid out and which its customers did not recover in the Tri-State bankruptcy \u2014 approximately $5.8 million \u2014 from its own insurer, Continental, under its \u201cCommercial Crime Policy,\u201d which, in part, covers \u201cdirect loss of Money or Securities caused by actual destruction, disappearance or Theft while ... in the care and custody of ... an armored motor vehicle company.\u201d (A.70.)</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">After Continental denied coverage for Diebold\u2019s claim, Diebold brought this action in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. Both parties moved for summary judgment with respect to Continental\u2019s affirmative defense that, \u201c[p]ursuant to Section IV.C, the [policy] does not cover any loss caused by TriState after discovery of an actual or potential loss caused by Tri-State.\u201d (A.419.) The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Continental.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment under a plenary standard of review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Lamont v. New Jersey, </em>637 F.3d 177, 181 (3d Cir.2011). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">In granting summary judgment in favor of Continental on the basis of its \u201cdiscovery\u201d defense, the District Court concluded that the losses for which Diebold seeks coverage were caused by Tri-State after Diebold had discovered an actual or potential loss caused by Tri-State. Continental\u2019s defense was based on the following last sentence of Section IV.C of the policy: \u201cThere is no coverage under this bond for any loss caused by a wrongdoer after discovery of an actual or potential loss caused by that wrongdoer.\u201d (A.75.) Section IV.C also provides that \u201c[djiscovery occurs when the Risk Management Department of the Insured ... first becomes aware of facts which would cause a reasonable person to assume that a loss of a type covered by this bond ... has been or will be incurred.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The District Court recognized that the availability of the \u201cdiscovery\u201d defense turned on the resolution of three issues. First, \u201cwhen did the \u2018Claimed Funds\u2019 [\u2014 the money identified in Diebold\u2019s Proof of Loss submitted to Continental \u2014 ] come into Tri-State\u2019s possession?\u201d (A.20.) Second, when did Diebold \u201c \u2018become aware of facts which would cause a reasonable person to assume that a loss ... has been or will be incurred\u2019?\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>And third, \u201cwhich Diebold employees are encompassed by the term \u2018Risk Management Department,\u2019 as that term is used in the Policy?\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">As to the first question \u2014 when did TriState come to possess the Claimed Funds \u2014 the District Court found that the earliest loss for which coverage is sought in this action occurred in October 2000. This determination was based upon the bankruptcy proofs of claim Diebold\u2019s customers had filed in Tri-State\u2019s bankruptcy proceeding. Diebold submitted its customers\u2019 proofs of claim to calculate the Claimed Funds in this action. In an exhibit to its Proof of Loss providing the \u201c[djetails of losses claimed,\u201d Diebold listed nineteen customers, the \u201closs amount\u201d for each customer as indicated in the customer\u2019s proof of claim, the amount each customer received in Tri-State\u2019s bankruptcy, and the difference between those amounts or the \u201cremaining claim.\u201d (A.1555.) Die-bold\u2019s total claim of approximately $5.8 million dollars represented the sum total of the \u201cremaining claim\u201d listed for each of the nineteen customers, plus legal fees. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">As the District Court explained, out of the nineteen proofs of claim filed in TriState\u2019s bankruptcy by Diebold\u2019s customers, fifteen proofs of claim identified the date on which the debt was incurred and four proofs of claim did not. Further, out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>the fifteen proofs of claim that identified a date on which the debt was incurred, one proof of claim bore the earliest date: October 2000. Thus, October 2000 became \u201cthe operative date for the discovery analysis.\u201d (A.29.) That is, the District Court had to determine whether any issue of fact existed as to whether, prior to October 2000, Diebold had discovered an actual or potential loss caused by Tri-State.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Although the District Court acknowledged that the fifteen proofs of claim are \u201carguably inadmissible hearsay\u201d (A.23), it determined that because Diebold relied on the information in the proofs of claim in constructing its Proof of Loss, Diebold adopted as true the information contained in the proofs of claim. Diebold acknowledges that it relied on its customers\u2019 proofs of claim in constructing its own Proof of Loss, but nonetheless argues that there is \u201cno evidence\u201d that it intended to adopt <em>all </em>the information contained in those proofs of claim. (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 55.) Diebold thus contends that, in considering the \u201cfull contents\u201d of its customers\u2019 proofs of claim, the District Court considered inadmissible hearsay. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Contrary to Diebold\u2019s assertion, the District Court\u2019s consideration of the proofs of claim to ascertain the earliest date of loss did not abridge the hearsay rule. The \u201cevidence\u201d of Diebold\u2019s \u201cadoption or belief\u2019 in the truth of the information contained in the proofs of claim was its very reliance on those proofs of claim for the purpose of quantifying its own losses. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(B) (\u201cA statement is not hearsay if ... [t]he statement is offered against a party and is ... a statement of which the party has manifested an adoption or belief in its truth.... \u201d); 4 Wig-more, Evidence \u00a7 1073 (Chadbourn rev. 1972) (\u201cThe party\u2019s use of a document made by a third person will frequently amount to an approval of its statements as correct, and thus it may be received against him as an admission by adoption.\u201d (emphasis omitted)). Indeed, Diebold\u2019s direct and apparently exclusive reliance on its customers\u2019 proofs of claim in setting forth its own claimed losses to Continental strongly manifests Diebold\u2019s assent to the accuracy and truth of the proofs of claim\u2019s general contents. We therefore do not find any error in the District Court\u2019s consideration of the dates Diebold\u2019s customers indicated on their proofs of claim as the dates the debts were incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">Diebold argues that even if the District Court properly considered the dates indicated on fifteen of its customers\u2019 proofs of claims as adoptive admissions, the dates are not dispositive of when the customers\u2019 losses were actually incurred. Diebold is correct; any adoptive admission of the information contained in Diebold\u2019s customers\u2019 proofs of claim constitutes an evidentiary admission that may be \u201ccontroverted or explained.\u201d <em>Keller v. United States, </em>58 F.3d 1194, 1198-99 n. 8 (7th Cir.1995). Diebold, however, did not produce any other evidence to establish when its customers\u2019 funds were lost or converted by TriState. Diebold argues that it in fact would be \u201cimpossible\u201d to determine when the funds reflected on Diebold\u2019s customers\u2019 proofs of claim were either lost or converted by Tri-State.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 57.) This argument does not substitute for evidence controverting Diebold\u2019s adoptive ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>mission on the issue of when Diebold\u2019s customers incurred losses. The proofs of claim state the dates when losses were sustained, and the inability of Diebold\u2019s expert to verify these dates does not mean that the losses were incurred at some time prior to October 2000. Accordingly, we find no error in the District Court\u2019s determination that the dates specified in the fifteen proofs of claim established when those fifteen customers\u2019 losses occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Diebold raises a further challenge to the District Court\u2019s treatment of Diebold\u2019s customers\u2019 proofs of claim. As mentioned, four of Diebold\u2019s customers\u2019 proofs of claim did not indicate the date on which the debt was incurred. Although acknowledging that Continental bore the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to its defense that the amounts sought by Die-bold concerned losses that occurred after Diebold\u2019s discovery of the wrongful diversion of funds, the District Court determined that Diebold bore the burden of production on the issue of the timing of Diebold\u2019s customers\u2019 losses. Relying upon <em>Griggs v. Bertram, </em>88 N.J. 347, 443 A.2d 163 (1982), the District Court reasoned that the burden was properly placed on Diebold because it was \u201cfar more likely to know, or have superior access to, facts relevant to when [Tri-State] came to possess the Claimed Funds.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (A.27.)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Diebold argues that the burden of production was unfairly placed on it because, contrary to the District Court\u2019s assessment, Diebold was not in a better position to ascertain when Tri-State stole or otherwise caused the loss of Diebold\u2019s customers\u2019 funds. In this regard, Diebold reiterates its expert\u2019s testimony concerning the \u201cimpossibility\u201d of determining the timing of the losses. While this argument may indicate the difficulty Diebold had in meeting the burden of production, it does not undermine the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Diebold, as the insured seeking coverage for losses sustained by its customers, was in a superior position to \u201cat least make a prima facie showing that the loss dates occurred before the operative discovery date.\u201d (A.28.) We conclude that, under the facts of this case, the District Court properly applied the holding in <em>Griggs </em>that the burden of production of evidence should be placed on the insured where, as here, it is reasonable to conclude that the insured has superior access to pertinent information. Accordingly, we do not find any error in the District Court\u2019s allocation of the burden of production and agree with the District Court that, in spite of the lack of record evidence demonstrating when the four banks\u2019 losses were incurred, Continental\u2019s motion for summary judgment did not fail for lack of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">After concluding that the earliest date of loss with respect to Diebold\u2019s Claimed Funds was October 2000, the District Court then had to determine whether, pri- or to October 2000, Diebold was aware of facts sufficient to cause a reasonable person to conclude that a covered loss had occurred. The District Court\u2019s opinion provides a thorough recitation of the numerous instances beginning in 1998 that Diebold\u2019s customers contacted Diebold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>concerning \u201ccash shortages\u201d and \u201cout-of-balance conditions\u201d occurring in ATMs serviced by Tri-State. It is further clear that, prior to October 2000, the FBI was in contact with Diebold concerning the agency\u2019s investigation of Tri-State and that Diebold was made aware that it could be a victim of Tri-State\u2019s theft.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In light of the evidence, which is more detailed in the District Court\u2019s opinion, we agree that there can be no genuine dispute that, prior to October 2000, Diebold was aware of facts that \u201ccould only lead a reasonable person to conclude that a potential loss had been or would be incurred.\u201d (A.30.)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Diebold argues that the \u201cdiscovery\u201d defense could only be established if Continental proved that Diebold knew not only of actual or potential losses, but also that those losses were the result of wrongdoing. The policy, however, explicitly provides that \u201c[discovery occurs when the Risk Management Department of the Insured ... first becomes aware of facts which would cause a reasonable person to assume that a loss of a type covered by this bond ... has been or will be incurred.\u201d (A.75.) The \u201cdisappearance\u201d of money in the care and custody of an armored car company is a \u201closs of a type covered by [the] bond.\u201d (A.70.) Clearly, therefore, a loss may be \u201cdiscovered\u201d within the meaning of the policy without Diebold\u2019s knowledge of any wrongdoing on the part of Tri-State.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">Finally, we address Diebold\u2019s arguments concerning the third question the District Court resolved: Which Diebold employees are encompassed by the term \u201cRisk Management Department\u201d? Throughout the period during which Die-bold had actual knowledge of facts sufficient to conclude that a covered loss had been or would be incurred, Diebold\u2019s Risk Management Department was comprised of Mark Tucker, Director of Risk Management, one \u201cRisk Analyst,\u201d and possibly, for a time, one individual who handled workers\u2019 compensation claims. The District Court noted that the parties did not dispute that Tucker was not \u201ccontemporaneously aware\u201d of Diebold\u2019s customers\u2019 shortages in ATMs serviced by Tri-State, Diebold\u2019s reimbursements to the customers, or Diebold\u2019s meetings with the FBI. (A.30.) Diebold argued below and argues now that this fact is fatal to Continental\u2019s \u201cdiscovery\u201d defense. The District Court rejected Diebold\u2019s argument, finding that, under the facts of this case, the term \u201cRisk Management Department\u201d encompassed Jack Fortune, the Diebold Manager of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Risk Analysis who indisputably was aware of actual or potential losses caused by TriState prior to October 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Diebold argues that the term \u201cRisk Management Department\u201d is clear and unambiguous, and that the District Court therefore erred in failing to apply the term literally to exclude Fortune, an employee within the Service Department. We agree with the District Court that, under the particular circumstances of this case, a literal construction of the term \u201cRisk Management Department\u201d would produce an absurd result. While Fortune\u2019s position was not within the \u201cRisk Management Department,\u201d the record establishes that Fortune managed risk for Diebold\u2019s ATM cash handling service. Tucker testified that Fortune was \u201cbrought into the services operations to help manage ... risk from these cash losses\u201d (A.4063), and Die-bold concedes that Fortune\u2019s position involved the management of risk \u201cin some sense\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 26). Fortune was involved in the investigation of Die-bold\u2019s customers\u2019 ATM shortage claims and authorized check reimbursements for those claims. While Tucker managed risk on a \u201cbroad[ ] scale\u201d (A.4057), it is clear that Fortune, not just in \u201csome sense,\u201d but in every practical sense, managed risk attendant to Diebold\u2019s cash handling service. Thus, we find no error in the District Court\u2019s determination that the term \u201cRisk Management Department\u201d encompassed Fortune.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Accordingly, for substantially the reasons set forth in the District Court\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned opinion, we will affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of Continental.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b226-8\">. In its brief, Continental challenges the District Court\u2019s determination that New Jersey law governs the dispute and argues that either Ohio or Illinois law should apply. It appears that Continental relies on Ohio or Illinois law only in its alternative argument that this Court should affirm the judgment on the ground that Diebold\u2019s claim is not covered under the policy. Because we do not reach this alternative argument, we see no need to review the District Court\u2019s choice of law analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b227-7\">. Diebold\u2019s expert testified that, in the absence of a \"subsidiary ledger,\u201d it would be impossible to determine the timing of Die-bold\u2019s customers\u2019 losses because Tri-State commingled the customers' funds. (A.3855-57.) According to the expert, the dates on the customers\u2019 proofs of claim \"just happened to be the date[s] that [the customers] didn't get that replenishment completed by Tri-State,\u201d and did not reflect the actual date of loss or theft. (A.3856.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b228-6\">. In <em>Griggs, </em>the insured sought enforcement of a settlement it entered into with a third-party claimant after the insurer improperly disclaimed coverage. The court held that although the insurer had the ultimate burden of persuasion as to the reasonableness and good faith of the settlement, \u201c[t]he initial burden of going forward with proofs of these elements rests upon the insured.\u201d 443 A.2d at 174. The court in part reasoned that this allocation of the burden of production made sense where the insured was in the position to \"best marshal the basic facts relating to the settlement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 173.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b229-6\">. Diebold contends that the District Court improperly considered numerous documents submitted as exhibits in support of Continental\u2019s motion for summary judgment, including correspondence between Diebold and its customers evidencing the customers\u2019 shortages and Diebold\u2019s frequent reimbursement of those shortages, because the documents are inadmissible hearsay. The documents, however, were not considered for the truth of the matters asserted in them, but, rather, as evidence of Diebold\u2019s awareness of actual or potential losses caused by Tri-State prior to October 2000. Accordingly, the District Court did not err in considering them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b229-11\">.
