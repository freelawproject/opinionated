For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-23\">Boyd is currently serving a 12- to 26-year prison sentence in connection with his 2000 conviction in the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County, Pennsylvania, for several sex-related crimes. In November 2010, Boyd commenced this action against the Governor of Pennsylvania by filing a complaint in the District Court. The complaint, which sought damages and Boyd\u2019s release from custody, claimed that Boyd was being imprisoned unlawfully because his speedy trial rights had been violated in the aforementioned criminal proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-24\">The District Court referred the complaint to a Magistrate Judge, who issued a report recommending that the court dismiss the complaint without leave to amend for failure to state a claim. In doing so, the Magistrate Judge concluded that a habeas corpus petition, not a complaint, was the proper vehicle for challenging the legality of Boyd\u2019s confinement. The Magistrate Judge further concluded that Boyd\u2019s claim for damages failed because Boyd had not established that his convictions had been invalidated. On December 27, 2010, the District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report and dismissed Boyd\u2019s complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and 1915A(b) for failure to state a claim. Boyd subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration, which the District Court denied on January 27, 2010. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-25\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-26\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s sua sponte dismissal of Boyd\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>complaint, <em>see Allah v. Seiverling, 229 </em>F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000), and review the court\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>See Max\u2019s Seafood Cafe ex rel. Lou-Ann, Inc. v. Quinteros, </em>176 F.3d 669, 673 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">For substantially the reasons set forth in the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report, we agree with the District Court\u2019s decision to dismiss Boyd\u2019s complaint without leave to amend for failure to state a claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Furthermore, we conclude that the District Court did not err in denying Boyd\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Because this appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s December 27, 2010 and January 27, 2011 orders. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6. Boyd\u2019s motion challenging the Clerk\u2019s April 13, 2011 order regarding the payment of the filing fee for this appeal is denied, for his claim that he should not have to pay the fee lacks merit. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b)(1) (\u201c[I]f a prisoner brings a civil action or files an appeal in forma pauperis, the prisoner shall be required to pay the full amount of a filing fee.\u201d).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b106-6\">. We note that Boyd has previously (and unsuccessfully) challenged these convictions in a habeas proceeding. As a result, even if the District Court had construed the instant complaint as another habeas petition, the petition would have been subject to dismissal as an unauthorized second or successive habeas petition. <em>See Burton v. Stewart, </em>549 U.S. 147, 157, 127 S.Ct. 793, 166 L.Ed.2d 628 (2007) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
