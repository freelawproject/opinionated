Givens\u2019 appellate claims regarding the sanctions order against him and his request for appointment of counsel are moot, given that the sanctions order was vacated and the case remanded at Givens\u2019 request. Accordingly, we dismiss this portion of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-19\">Turning to Givens\u2019 appeal from the denial of his motion for sanctions against Defendants, we have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Givens v. Main Street Fin. Servs., </em>No. 5:10-cv-00027-FPS-JSK, 2010 WL 4386725 (N.D.W.Va. Oct. 28, 2010). We deny Givens\u2019 motion to strike Appellees\u2019 brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-20\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
