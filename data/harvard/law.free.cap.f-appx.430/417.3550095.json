WHITE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">In this diversity suit, Plaintiff Mosser Construction, Inc. (\u201cMosser\u201d) alleges that its insurer, Defendant, The Travelers Indemnity Company (\u201cTravelers\u201d), wrongfully declined to defend and indemnify Mosser against an underlying claim brought against Mosser by the City of Port Clinton, Ohio (\u201cPort Clinton\u201d). The district court granted summary judgment to Travelers after finding that the relevant term in the insurance contract between the parties had a plain meaning that absolved Travelers of the obligations to defend and indemnify Mosser in the underlying action. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">Mosser is a construction firm based in Fremont, Ohio. Travelers issued Mosser three consecutive commercial general liability (\u201cCGL\u201d) insurance policies from 2005 to 2008. The insurance policy in effect at the times relevant to this suit established a general obligation of Travelers to defend Mosser against suits seeking damages for property damage caused by Mosser. The policy contained the following exclusion from coverage, known as the \u201cyour-work exclusion.\u201d The second sentence of the exclusion provides an exception to the exclusion known as the \u201csubcontractor exception\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b440-13\">Exclusions</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-14\">This insurance does not apply to: ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-15\">1. Damage To Your Work</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-16\">\u201cProperty damage\u201d to \u201cyour work\u201d arising out of it or any part of it and included in the \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-17\">This exclusion does not apply if the damaged work or the work out of which the damage arises was performed on your behalf by a subcontractor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-18\">The your-work exclusion thus bars coverage for damage to \u201cyour work\u201d (e.g. a structure constructed by Mosser) after work on it has been \u201ccompleted or abandoned.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The exception to the exclusion provides that Travelers will still provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>coverage to damage to \u201cyour work\u201d if the work was performed by a subcontractor. Unlike the other relevant terms in the policy, \u201csubcontractor\u201d is not defined. This suit concerns the meaning of \u201csubcontractor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">On July 29, 2002, Mosser entered into a construction contract with Port Clinton to make improvements to Port Clinton\u2019s waste-water treatment facility. Mosser was the general contractor for the project. The contract required Mosser to \u201cfurnish all labor, materials, supplies, equipment and other facilities and things necessary or proper or incidental to complete performances of the work under [the] Contract.\u201d That work included placing structural backfill beneath and around the foundation of a new odor-control building. The contract required that the backfill meet the size and grading requirements for AASHTO # 57 coarse aggregate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Mosser contracted with Gerken Materials, Inc. (\u201cGerken\u201d) for the purchase of the specified structural backfill. The only contract between Mosser and Gerken is a standard two-page purchase order that specifies that Gerken will sell to Mosser several grades of crushed limestone, including \u201c# 57 Stone @ $5.00/Ton.\u201d The purchase order notes that the stone is being obtained for use in the Port Clinton waste-water treatment plant, but does not otherwise refer to terms from Mosser\u2019s master contract with Port Clinton.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The # 57 aggregate was a standard inventory item that Gerken regularly produced by crushing quarried limestone, and it regularly stocked the aggregate at its facility in Port Clinton. Gerken conducts standard quality control testing on all of the crushed stone it produces, but did not perform any special or additional testing on the backfill purchased by Mosser. Gerken did not deliver the stone to the construction site; Mosser picked up the backfill, trucked it to the site, and completed the on-site work itself. Gerken\u2019s invoices for the stone total $31,148.87, representing approximately 0.5% of the total master-contract price of $6.8 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">Mosser substantially completed the Port Clinton project by December 31, 2004. After construction was complete, however, the walls of the new odor-control building began to crack. Port Clinton\u2019s investigation indicated that the cracking was due to failure of the structural backfill beneath and around the foundation of the building. Port Clinton alleged that the backfill material was defective because it contained gypsum that leached out of the material when exposed to groundwater, causing improper settling. Port Clinton alleged that in addition to the odor-control building, a 42-inch effluent line and a pressurized grit line placed in the backfill were also damaged due to the defective fill material. Port Clinton notified Mosser about these problems. Mosser then notified Travelers of the property damage via a notice of claim letter on June 28, 2007. Travelers denied Mosser coverage on November 6, 2007. Port Clinton filed suit against Mosser on December 26, 2007, seeking damages for property damage resulting from breach of contract. Mosser sent a copy of Port Clinton\u2019s complaint to Travelers, but Travelers again denied coverage on January 16, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">Mosser filed suit against Travelers in Ohio state court in September 2008, seeking a declaratory judgment that Travelers had duties to defend and indemnify Mosser in the underlying action, and damages for breach of contract and bad faith. Travelers removed the action to the Unit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>ed States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio in October 2008, and the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Travelers argued that Gerken was not a subcontractor and thus any damage caused by defective backfill it produced is not covered under the insurance policy because of the your-work exclusion. Mosser argued that Ger'ken was a subcontractor, and thus the subcontx'actor exception to the your-work exclusion preserved coverage. The district court granted Travelers\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denied Mosser\u2019s motion. It held that the meaning of \u201csubcontx'actor-\u201d in the insurance agreement is unambiguous, and that Gerken was not a subcontx'actor under that definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">A. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">We x\u2019eview a district coux-t\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Cady v. Arenac Cnty., </em>574 F.3d 334, 339 (6th Cir.2009). We uphold summary judgment if \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any maternal fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). When considering a motion for summary judgment, we must draw all reasonable inferences and view all evidence in favor of the non-moving party. <em>See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986); <em>Am. Express Travel Related Servs. Co. v. Kentucky, </em>641 F.3d 685, 688 (6th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">B. THE SUBCONTRACTOR EXCEPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">This case requires that we interpret the term \u201csubcontractor\u201d as used in the subcontractor exception to the your-work exclusion in the insurance agreement, and to determine whether Gerken falls within that term under the circumstances presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">Because this is a diversity case, we apply Ohio law. <em>See Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938); <em>Pennington v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>553 F.3d 447, 450 (6th Cir.2009). Ohio courts have \u201cconsistently held that insurance contracts must be construed in accordance with the same rules as other written contracts.\u201d <em>Hybud Equip. Corp. v. Sphere Drake Ins. Co., Ltd., </em>64 Ohio St.3d 657, 597 N.E.2d 1096, 1102 (1992). Thus, \u201cif the language of the policy\u2019s provisions is clear and unambiguous, this court may not \u2018resort to construction of that language.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Karabin v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>10 Ohio St.3d 163, 462 N.E.2d 403, 406 (1984)). A contract term is unambiguous if it has a \u201cplain and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Karabin, </em>462 N.E.2d at 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">If the meaning of a term is ambiguous, however, then that ambiguity should be \u201cinterpreted strictly against the drafter and in favor of the nondrafting party.\u201d <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 797 N.E.2d 1256, 1262 (2003). \u201cThus, an ambiguity in an insurance contract is ordinarily interpreted against the insurer and in favor of the insured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[Sjince insurance policies are interpreted strictly against the insurer, \u2018[i]t will not suffice for [the insurer] to demonstrate that its interpretation is more reasonable than the policyholder\u2019s.\u2019 \u201d <em>Andersen v. Highland House Co., </em>93 Ohio St.3d 547, 757 N.E.2d 329, 333 (2001) (citation omitted) (second alteration in original). The insurer, \u201chaving prepared the policy, must also be prepared to accept any reasonable interpretation, consistent with the foregoing, in favor of the insured.\u201d <em>Gomolka v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>70 Ohio St.2d 166, 436 N.E.2d 1347, 1348 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Exclusions in insurance policies are construed narrowly such that \u201cthat which is not clearly excluded from the operation of the contract is included in the operation thereof.\u201d <em>Southside River-Rail Terminal, Inc. v. Crum &amp; Forster Underwriters of Ohio, </em>157 Ohio App.3d 325, 811 N.E.2d 150, 154 (2004) (quoting <em>Home Indemn. Co. of New York v. Plymouth, </em>146 Ohio St. 96, 64 N.E.2d 248, 248 (1945) (paragraph two of the syllabus)). The burden is on the insurer to show that an exclusion specifically applies. <em>Neal-Pettit v. Lahman, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 327, 928 N.E.2d 421, 424 (2010). \u201c[0]nce the insurer establishes that an exclusion is applicable, the burden shifts back to the insured to establish the applicability of an exception to the exclusion.\u201d <em>Goodrich Corp. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>2008 WL 2581579, at *23 (Ohio Ct.App. June 30, 2008). If a term in an exception to an exclusion is unambiguous, and if \u201cthe context in which it is employed does not indicate that it should be given any other meaning,\u201d then we must give that term its plain meaning. <em>Hybud Equip., </em>597 N.E.2d at 1102. If a term is ambiguous, however, then, as with terms in the main body of the contract, it must be construed broadly in favor of the insured and against the insurer. <em>See Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. G.L.H., Inc., </em>2008 WL 2940663, at *7 (Ohio Ct.App. Aug. 1, 2008) (unpublished); <em>see also TRB Invs., Inc. v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>40 Cal.4th 19, 50 Cal.Rptr.3d 597, 145 P.3d 472, 477 (2006); <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Lefton Iron &amp; Metal Co., Inc., </em>296 Ill.App.3d 475, 230 Ill.Dec. 771, 694 N.E.2d 1049, 1057 (1998); <em>Rufener v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. </em>221 Wis.2d 500, 585 N.W.2d 696, 699 (1998); <em>Hughes v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>2007 WL 2874849, at *4 (W.D.Pa. Sept.27, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The your-work exclusion and the subcontractor exception are standard insurance contract terms that are used widely in the industry. <em>See </em>9A Lee R. Russ &amp; Thomas F. Segalla, Couch on Insurance \u00a7 129:18 (3d ed.2010) (available on West-law) (hereinafter \u201cCouch on Insurance\u201d). Neither the insurance agreement between Travelers and Mosser nor the commonly-used standard commercial general liability policy on which it is based define \u201csubcontractor.\u201d Further, no Ohio court has defined the term \u201csubcontractor\u201d in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">Dictionary definitions of \u201csubcontractor\u201d provide limited guidance. Older editions of Black\u2019s Law Dictionary define \u201csubcontractor\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-9\">One who takes portion of a contract from principal contractor or another subcontractor. One who has entered into a contract, express or implied, for the performance of an act with the person who has already contracted for its performance. One who takes from the principal or prime contractor a specific part of the work undertaken by the principal contractor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed.1990). Newer editions provide a similar definition: \u201cOne who is awarded a portion of an existing contract by a contractor, esp. a general contractor. For example, a contractor who builds houses typically retains subcontractors to perform specialty work such as installing plumbing, laying carpet, making cabinetry, and landscaping....\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th ed.2009). Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines \u201csubcontractor\u201d as \u201can individual or business firm that contracts to perform part or all of another\u2019s contract.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (Unabridged) (2002); <em>see also </em>American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (available at http://education. yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/ subcontractor) (\u201cOne that enters into a subcontract and assumes some of the obli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>gations of the primary contractor.\u201d). These definitions are broad, and could be read to encompass a material supplier like Gerken because, read literally, Gerken contracted (via the backfill purchase order) to take a portion of Mosser\u2019s general contract, the obligation to provide backfill.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">The parties urge us to define \u201csubcontractor\u201d with reference to cases interpreting the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 3131, which \u201crequires a prime contractor of a federal project to furnish a payment bond to insure payment to individuals who supply labor and/or materials for federal projects.\u201d <em>United States for the Use and Benefit of Consol. Pipe &amp; Supply Co. v. Morrison-Knudsen Co., </em>687 F.2d 129, 131 (6th Cir.1982). Under the Miller Act, \u201cthe payment bond protects only those persons who have a contractual agreement with a pi\u2019ime contractor or subcontractor engaged in a federal project. Persons supplying labor or material to a mere materialman are not protected.\u201d <em>United States for the Use and Benefit of Conveyor Rental &amp; Sales Co. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Surety Co., </em>981 F.2d 448, 450 (9th Cir.1992) (citation omitted). Therefore, in Miller Act cases, courts frequently must decide whether an entity is a subcontractor or merely a material supplier under the Act. In <em>Clifford F. MacEvoy Co. v. United States for Use and Benefit of Calvin Tomkins Co., </em>322 U.S. 102, 64 S.Ct. 890, 88 L.Ed. 1163 (1944), the Supreme Court held that under the Miller Act \u201ca subcontractor is one who performs for and takes from the prime contractor a specific part of the labor or material requirements of the original contract, thus excluding ordinary laborers and material-men.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 109, 64 S.Ct. 890. Subsequent cases have held that subcontractor status is determined by the \u201csubstantiality and importance of [the purported subcontractor\u2019s] relationship with the prime contractor.\u201d <em>F.D. Rich Co. v. United States for the Use of Indus. Lumber Co., </em>417 U.S. 116, 123, 94 S.Ct. 2157, 40 L.Ed.2d 703 (1974). Courts have looked to multiple factors in making this determination, including whether \u201cthe. product supplied is custom fabricated,\u201d whether \u201cthe supplier is required to perform on site,\u201d and whether or not the materials supplied come from existing inventory. <em>Conveyor Rental &amp; Sales, </em>981 F.2d at 451-52 (listing 18 factors and citing cases applying them). Under the general definition advanced in <em>MacEvoy, </em>Gerken could be a subcontractor because it performed and took from Mosser \u201ca specific part of the ... material requirements of the original contract.\u201d Gerken might not be considered a contractor under <em>Conveyor Rental </em>and similar cases, as it performed no on-site work and supplied the backfill from existing inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The parties also debate the significance of <em>J.T Weybrecht\u2019s Sons Co. v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>161 Ohio St. 436, 119 N.E.2d 836 (1954). There, the Ohio Supreme Court interpreted the term \u201csubcontractor\u201d as used in a state statute governing contractors\u2019 performance-bond requirements. The court held that \u201c[t]he ordinary meaning of the word \u2018subcontractor\u2019 will include such a materialman who contracts to furnish material to a contractor for use in performing his contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 839. Thus, \u201cthe word \u2018subcontractor\u2019 as used in [the statute] should be given its ordinary meaning, so that it may include one who contracts with the general contractor for performance of part of the work to be performed under the general contract, even though the part contracted for involves only the furnishing of matei'ial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 842. Under this definition, Gerken would qualify as a subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Although the Miller Act cases and <em>Weybrecht\u2019s </em>are instructive, they are not controlling because they interpret \u201csubcontractor\u201d in contexts different from that at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>issue here. No Ohio court has discussed the meaning of \u201csubcontractor\u201d in the your-work exclusion, but several courts applying the law of other states have done so. They have all concluded that material suppliers can be subcontractors, but that some combination of fabrication to custom specifications or on-site work is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">In <em>Wanzek Construction, Inc. v. Employers Insurance of Wausau, </em>679 N.W.2d 322, 329 (Minn.2004), the Supreme Court of Minnesota concluded that the term \u201csubcontractor\u201d was ambiguous because it was not defined in the policy or by statute or regulation. The court construed the ambiguity in favor of the insured and held that \u201cwhere, as here, a supplier custom fabricates the materials to the owner\u2019s specifications and provides on-site services in connection with the installation, the supplier meets the definition of subcontractor under the exception to the \u2018your works\u2019 exclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, in <em>National Union Fire Insurance Co. v. Structural Systems Technology, Inc., </em>756 F.Supp. 1232 (E.D.Mo.1991), <em>amended by </em>764 F.Supp. 145 (E.D.Mo.1991), a district court interpreting Missouri law concluded that the supplier of steel rods for construction of a radio tower was a subcontractor and not \u201cmerely a materialman\u201d because it fabricated the rods according to the specific design and manufacturing specifications and delivered them to the site. <em>Id. </em>at 1240. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Structural Sys. Tech., Inc., </em>964 F.2d 759, 763 (8th Cir.1992). The Fourth Circuit, interpreting Pennsylvania law, has cited National Union approvingly and held that a supplier that \u201ccustom manufactured ... steam pipe in accordance with the shop drawings and project specifications, and [that] provided on-site installation instructions\u201d was a subcontractor. <em>Limbach Co. LEG v. Zurich Am. Ins. Co., </em>396 F.3d 358, 364-65 (4th Cir.2005). The court further held that the term \u201csubcontractor\u201d was ambiguous and that it must therefore be construed in favor of the insured to preserve coverage. <em>Id. </em>at 365. Other courts agree that material suppliers that perform onsite work or manufacture materials to custom specifications fit within the definition of subcontractor. <em>See CGU/Hawkeye Sec. Ins. Co. v. Oasis Las Vegas Motor Coach Park, L.P., </em>65 Fed.Appx. 182, 183-84 (9th Cir.2003) (unpublished) (interpreting Nevada law); <em>Bldg. Specialties, Inc. v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>712 F.Supp.2d 628, 650-51 (S.D.Tex.2010) (interpreting Texas law) (\u201cCourts holding a supplier of building materials a \u2018subcontractor\u2019 for the purposes of the \u2018your work\u2019 exception typically do so on the basis of custom fabrication combined with an on-site presence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">These cases provide guidance as to what entities do qualify as subcontractors, but there are few useful examples of cases identifying entities that are not subcontractors within the meaning of the subcontractor exception. <em>See CGU/Hawkeye, </em>65 Fed.Appx. at 184 (Graber, J., dissenting) (offering dissenting view that \u201csupplier and deliverer\u201d of concrete was not a subcontractor, but merely a materialman); <em>Collett v. Ins. Co. of the W., </em>64 Cal.App.4th 338, 75 Cal.Rptr.2d 165, 169-70 (1998) (holding that a building inspector hired by masonry contractor was not a \u201csubcontractor,\u201d even under the broadest definition of that term); <em>see also Bldg. Specialties, </em>712 F.Supp.2d at 651 (\u201cThe record is inadequate to permit this court to find that [the insulation supplier] is, or is not, a subcontractor as a matter of law.\u201d); <em>Web Constr. Inc. v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., </em>2007 WL 4230751, at *8 (D.Minn. Nov.29, 2007) (holding that issues of material fact exist as to whether concrete supplier provided standard-mix or custom-fabricated concrete and whether it performed significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>on-site work for purposes of qualifying as subcontractor). Thus, cases construing the subcontractor exception leave considerable uncertainty regarding where exactly to draw the line between subcontractors and mere material suppliers.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Relevant cases require something more than mere supply of standard inventory items. Secondary sources agree. Couch on Insurance states that \u201c[a] manufacturer or supplier will ... typically only constitute a subcontractor for purposes of the exception where the manufacturer or supplier custom fabricates the materials to the owner\u2019s specifications or otherwise performs part of the on-site construction work which the insured had contracted to perform.\u201d 9A Couch on Insurance \u00a7 129:18. Similarly, Bruner and O\u2019Connor on Construction Law states that \u201c[a] supplier that fabricates or otherwise provides unique materials should have little difficulty meeting the requirement of being a subcontractor.\u201d 4 Philip L. Bruner &amp; Patrick J. O\u2019Connor, Jr., Construction Law \u00a7 11:105 (2010) (available on Westlaw). Further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMf\">[suppliers, regardless of whether they provide labor on site, that perform their services pursuant to the terms and conditions of the general -contractor\u2019s agreement are, in all material respects, \u201csubcontractors.\u201d While a bit more attenuated, a supplier that furnishes standard or \u201coff-the-shelf\u2019 goods but does so pursuant to an agreement incorporating the terms and conditions of the owner/general contractor agreement should be deemed a \u201csubcontractor.\u201d A supplier that simply sells goods to a general contractor on an open account is not \u201ctaking\u201d under the general contractor\u2019s agreement with the owner and, therefore, is not a subcontractor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">\n<em>Id</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>3</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Based on the foregoing, in the context of this case the term \u201csubcontractor\u201d as used in the your-work exclusion is ambiguous. Competing definitions of subcontractor from other contexts, including dictionaries, the Miller Act cases, and Weybrecht\u2019s, establish that there are multiple reasonable interpretations of the term. The handful of cases defining the term in the context of the your-work exclusion also find ambiguity. Because the term is ambiguous, we must construe it strictly against Travelers and in favor of Mosser. <em>Westfield Ins., </em>797 N.E.2d at 1262. This means that Travelers must \u201cbe prepared to accept any reasonable interpretation, consistent with the [policy], in favor of the insured.\u201d <em>Gomolka, </em>436 N.E.2d at 1348. Although this standard favors Mosser, we must still construe the term to determine whether Mosser\u2019s interpretation is reasonable. Although Mosser\u2019s interpretation need not be the <em>most </em>reasonable one, <em>Andersen, </em>757 N.E.2d at 333, it cannot be a meaning that the words of the contract will not bear. <em>Brannon v. Troutman, </em>75 Ohio App.3d 233, 598 N.E.2d 1333, 1336 (1992) (citing <em>Ohio Crane Co. v. Hicks, </em>110 Ohio St. 168, 143 N.E. 388, 389 (1924)).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">At oral argument, Mosser proposed that any material supplier, even a hardware store selling standard-inventory nails, would qualify as a subcontractor. Mosser\u2019s interpretation, that <em>any </em>materials supplier is a subcontractor, is not reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>able. Although the meaning of the term is ambiguous, its meaning is not as broad as Mosser urges. For a material supplier who does not perform work at the site to be a subcontractor, the supplier must manufacture the material according to specifications supplied by the general contractor, and, its materials contract with the general contractor must explicitly incorporate terms from the master contract or otherwise explicitly indicate that the materials at issue are manufactured or supplied specifically for the master contract\u2019s project.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Gerken qualifies as a subcontractor under the above definition. Gerken manufactured the # 57 coarse aggregate at its own facility using its own equipment. It did not purchase the aggregate from another supplier like a hardware store would with off-the-shelf nails. The only reason Gerken already stocked the correct grade of crushed stone on its property, and thus did not need to custom fabricate it to order for Mosser for use in the Port Clinton project, is that the AASHTO sets industry-wide standards for the production of coarse aggregate, and most or all purchasers will seek a grade of aggregate consistent with an AASHTO standard specifications. Moreover, the purchase order explicitly identifies Mosser\u2019s Port Clinton project\u2014 the subject-matter of the master contract \u2014 as the \u201cJob\u201d for which Gerken supplied the aggregate at issue. Although Gerken may have produced all or part of the backfill before entering into the purchase order with Mosser, the circumstances of this case are enough to nudge Gerken over the line separating mere material suppliers from subcontractors. Construing ambiguities in the contract in favor of Mosser, we conclude that Gerken was a subcontractor for purposes of the Travelers insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the district court granting summary judgment to Travelers.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">C. TRAVELERS\u2019S DUTY TO DEFEND</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">Based on our above holding that Gerken is a subcontractor, Travelers has a duty to defend against the underlying Port Clinton suit. The standard governing when an insurer has a duty to defend the insured against suit has been clearly described by Ohio courts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-11\">An insurer\u2019s duty to defend is broader than and distinct from its duty to indemnify. <em>Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. v. Continental Cas. Co., </em>[144 Ohio St. 382, 59 N.E.2d 199 (1945) ], paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>W. Lyman Case &amp; Co. v. Natl. City Corp., </em>[76 Ohio St.3d 345, 667 N.E.2d 978, 979 (1996)]. The scope of the allegations in the complaint against the insured determines whether an insurance company has a duty to defend the insured. <em>Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. v. Trainor, </em>[33 Ohio St.2d 41, 294 N.E.2d 874 (1973) ], paragraph two of the syllabus. The insurer must defend the insured in an action when the allegations state a claim that potentially or arguably falls within the liability insurance coverage. <em>Willoughby Hills v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., </em>[9 Ohio St.3d 177, 459 N.E.2d 555, 557 (1984) ]. However, an insurer need not defend any action or claims within the complaint when all the claims are clearly and indisputably outside the contracted coverage. <em>Preferred Risk </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number><em>Ins. Co. v. Gill, </em>[30 Ohio St.3d 108, 507 N.E.2d 1118, 1123 (1987) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><em>Ohio Gov\u2019t Risk Mgmt. Plan v. Harrison, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 241, 874 N.E.2d 1155, 1159-60 (2007). Further, \u201cthe duty to defend need not arise solely from the allegations in the complaint but may arise at a point subsequent to the filing of the complaint.\u201d <em>Willoughby Hills, </em>459 N.E.2d at 557. The complaint in the underlying Port Clinton suit alleges facts sufficient to implicate Travelers\u2019 duty to defend against claims that the backfill produced and supplied by Gerken caused damage to the waste water treatment plant facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court granting summary judgment to Travelers.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b440-9\">. The insurance policy defines \"property damage\u201d as \"a. Physical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property .... or b. Loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.\u201d The term \"your work\u201d means \"(1) Work or operations performed by you or on your behalf; and (2) Materials, parts or equipment furnished in connection with such work or operations.\" The clause referring to the \"products-completed operations hazard\u201d has the effect of preserving insurance coverage for property damage to Mosser\u2019s work while construction is still ongoing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b441-8\">. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) sets standard specifications for the production of coarse aggregate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b446-5\">. Although some secondary sources provide more general definitions of subcontractor that could encompass any and all material suppliers, those sources provide little discussion and uniformly cite cases that require some combination of custom fabrication or on-site work. <em>See </em>3 New Appleman on Insurance, Law Library Ed. \u00a7 1 S.03[12][d] (Jeffrey E.

We find the cases from other jurisdictions interpreting the your-work exclusion to be persuasive on this point.
