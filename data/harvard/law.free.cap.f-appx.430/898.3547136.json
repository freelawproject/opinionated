Rogers\u2019 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 292 qui tarn relator suit. Conair also moves for an order to show cause why an order of contempt should not be issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">On September 16, 2011, the President signed into law the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, H.R. 1249, 112th Cong. (1st Sess.2011), amending 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 292 and including the following text regarding the effective date of this provision: \u201cThe amendments made by this subsection shall apply to all eases, without exception, that are pending on, or commenced on or after, the date of the enactment of this Act.\u201d Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, \u00a7 16(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-12\">In light of the enactment of the LeahySmith America Invents Act, we deem it the better course to deny Conair\u2019s petition in order for the district court to address the potential effect of the Act on this case in the first instance. To the extent necessary, Conair can petition for a writ of mandamus seeking the same relief after such issues are resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-13\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b921-14\">It Is Ordered That:</p>\n<p id=\"b921-15\">(1) The petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-16\">(2) The motion for order to show cause is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-17\">(3) The stay is lifted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
