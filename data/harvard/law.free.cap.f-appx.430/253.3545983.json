Rodriguez would have us discredit this testimony in light of prior inconsistent statements. But she neglects that these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>pretrial statements go to Hebert\u2019s credibility as a witness, not the legal sufficiency of the evidence. The determination of a witness\u2019s credibility \u201c\u2018lies at the core of a jury\u2019s factfinding function\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and is not the province of judges.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In other words, it is irrelevant whether <em>we </em>are persuaded of Hebert\u2019s version of the events in this case \u2014 what matters is that the <em>jury </em>was persuaded. The evidence here is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">We also affirm the jury\u2019s damages award. The trial record contains legally sufficient evidence to support all of Hebert\u2019s damages claims: lost business income, emotional distress, and punitive damages. We also find that the punitive-damages award was not excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">We further affirm the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 the court\u2019s award was properly calculated and carefully explained.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-15\">We further affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Hebert\u2019s municipal-liability claims, which he argues sound in both federal and state law. As to his municipal-liability claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, Hebert failed to present evidence to support one of the very few exceptions<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to the general rule that local governments are liable only for \u201ctheir <em>own </em>illegal acts.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, the district court was correct to dismiss his claim. As to municipal liability under Louisiana law, we hold that Hebert waived this claim by failing to properly present it to the district court<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and to this court on appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-16\">We further affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Hebert\u2019s defamation claims. Hebert has failed to show \u2014 as he must to overcome the district court\u2019s grant of judgment as a matter of law \u2014 \u201ca conflict in substantial evidence on each essential element\u201d of his defamation claims.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Finally, we affirm the two evidentiary rulings Hebert now challenges. He argues that the district court erred by excluding the testimony of his expert witness, but this issue is mooted by the court\u2019s proper dismissal of his municipal-liability claims. Hebert also argues that the district court erred in admitting, on a motion in limine, evidence of Hebert\u2019s twenty-six-year-old felony conviction. However, Hebert waived his objection to the admission of this evidence by first presenting it himself on direct examination.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">In conclusion, we AFFIRM in all respects the jury\u2019s verdict and the rulings of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b276-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Circuit Local Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Circuit Local Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-16\">.
