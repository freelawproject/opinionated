Rohan, which denied Lin\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Xue Feng Lin, </em>No. A095 688 005 (B.I.A. Apr. 1, 2010), <em>affg </em>No. A095 688 005 (Immig. Ct. N.Y.C. June 2, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have considered both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions \u201cfor the sake of completeness.\u201d <em>Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008). The applicable standards of review are well established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008); <em>Salimatou Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-13\">The agency reasonably concluded that Lin did not suffer past persecution based on her mother\u2019s forced sterilization. <em>See Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 308 (2d Cir.2007) <em>(en </em>banc) (holding that \u201capplicants can become candidates for asylum relief only based on persecution that they themselves have suffered or must suffer\u201d); <em>Shao Yan Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>417 F.3d 303, 305 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that children of people persecuted under a coercive family planning policy are not per se eligible for asylum). The agency also reasonably concluded that Lin\u2019s experiences, including being detained for one day and being unable to register at a vocational school, did not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Joaquin-Porras v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 172, 182 (2d Cir.2006) (upholding agency\u2019s determination that applicant was not eligible for withholding of removal based on \u201cbrief\u2019 detention after which he was released \u201cwithout harm\u201d); <em>Ai Feng Yuan v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>416 F.3d 192, 198 (2d Cir.2005) (upholding agency\u2019s determination that applicant had not been persecuted where applicant \u201cwas detained only briefly, and was not mistreated while in custody\u201d), <em>overruled on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 305; <em>Damico v. INS, </em>430 F.3d 626, 636-37 (2d Cir.2005) (concluding that applicant\u2019s expulsion from university, while \u201cnot fair,\u201d did not constitute persecution, where it did not result in \u201ceconomic deprivation so severe that her life or her freedom was threatened\u201d), <em>vacated on other grounds and superseded by Damico v. INS, </em>178 Fed.Appx. 85(2nd Cir. 2006). The agency also reasonably concluded that, without a spouse or children, Lin\u2019s claim that she fears future persecution because she is of child-bearing age <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>and wants to have children is \u201cspeculative,\u201d and insufficient to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125,129 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that, absent solid suppoi\u2019t in the record for the petitioner\u2019s assertion that he would be subjected to forced sterilization, his fear was \u201cspeculative at best\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">Furthermore, the agency x'easonably determined that Lin failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution or eligibility for CAT x\u2019elief based on her illegal departure from China. <em>See Saleh v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>962 F.2d 234, 239 (2d Cir.1992) (\u201cPunishment for violation of a generally applicable criminal law is not persecution.\u201d); <em>see also Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 159-60 (2d Cir.2005) (evidence that some individuals who leave China illegally are imprisoned, and that human rights violations including torture occur in Chinese pxisons, is insufficient to establish a clear probability of torture for a particular illegal emigrant); <em>Mu-Xing Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 143-4 (2d Cir.2003) (holding relevant inquiry in determining whether a particular petitioner is eligible for CAT relief is whether someone in the petitioner\u2019s \u201cpax'ticular alleged circumstances\u201d is more likely than not to be tortured).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">For the foregoing x'easons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our x'eview, any stay of removal that the Coux\u2019t px'eviously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for ox'al ax'gument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Fedex*al Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
