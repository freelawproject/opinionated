Judgment was entered on January 7, 2010, and his undated notice of appeal was filed in the record on August 13, 2010. Gomez-Rodriguez\u2019s notice of appeal was filed more than seven months after the final judgment was entered and beyond the time for extending the appeal period under Federal Rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Appellate Procedure 4(b)(4). <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A)\u00ae, (b)(4). Gomez-Rodriguez did not file a timely notice of appeal, and he has not asserted any ground for excusable neglect. Therefore, his appeal is DISMISSED as untimely. <em>See United States v. Leijano-Cruz, </em>473 F.3d 571, 574 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, his motions for appointment of counsel and to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal are DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b327-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
