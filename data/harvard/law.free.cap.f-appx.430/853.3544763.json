Solomon challenges the finding of the administrative law judge that Solomon\u2019s complaints of pain and fatigue were not credible. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">We review the decision of the Commissioner \u201cto determine if it is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004). Substantial evidence consists of \u201c \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1439 (11th Cir.1997)). \u201cAn administrative law judge may properly challenge the credibility of a claimant\u201d and, because \u201cthe resolution of conflicting evidence is for the Secretary and the administrative law judge,\u201d <em>Allen v. Schweiker, </em>642 F.2d 799, 801 (5th Cir.1981), \u201cwe may not decide the facts anew\u201d as long as substantial evidence supports the findings of fact, <em>Smallwood v. Schweiker, </em>681 F.2d 1349, 1351 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">Substantial evidence supports the finding that Solomon\u2019s testimony about his physical limitations was not credible. \u201c[T]o establish a disability based on testimony of pain and other symptoms,\u201d a disability claimant must present \u201cevidence of an underlying medical condition\u201d and either medical evidence that he suffers severe pain or evidence that the condition is \u201cexpected to give rise to the claimed pain.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1225 (11th Cir.2002). Solomon testified that pain and fatigue caused by scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, and migraine headaches prevented him from resuming his job as a commercial truck driver, but the administrative law judge found that Solomon\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with his own statements and objective medical evidence. Solomon said that he had \u201cexcruciating\u201d headaches, but he testified that he took medicine for the pain and the results of a head MRI in 2006 and an evaluation in 2007 revealed that he had no neurological abnormalities. Solomon testified he was incapable of maneuvering a truck, but his treating physicians, Dr. Urmesh Raturi and Dr. Jay Reese, released Solomon to resume work in 2004 and, in May 2004, rheumatologist Harris Mcllwain released Solomon for \u201ccomplete duties\u201d other than placing a tarp over his cargo. In 2005, Dr. Raul Nodal gave Solomon a score of 4 out of 5 for the strength of his grip and shoulders and a perfect score for the strength in his other upper and his lower extremities. Although Dr. Nodal observed that Solomon had shortness of breath when he stood up repeatedly and had difficulty exercising fine motor skills, the evidence established these limitations did not prevent Solomon from driving a commercial truck. Two state medical consultants found that Solomon could sit for 6 hours at a time and had unlimited ability to push, pull, and operate hand and foot controls. Solomon told an emergency room physician that he had lifted heavy objects around his house in April 2007, and the physician found that Solomon had \u201c[ejqual and good power in all four ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>tremities.\u201d In May 2007, Dr. Mack Knowles found that Solomon had a full range of motion in his fingers and ankle. The record supports the finding of the administrative law judge that Solomon could perform his past relevant work.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Solomon asks that this Court remand his case because the Appeals Council failed to consider medical findings that Dr. Harris Mcllwain made after Solomon\u2019s evidentiary hearing, but Solomon did not present this argument to the district court. In the district court, Solomon challenged only the findings of the administrative law judge. Because Solomon \u201cehallenge[d] the administrative law judge\u2019s decision to deny benefits, but not the decision of the Appeals Council to deny review of the administrative law judge, [the district court was not required to] consider [the] evidence [Solomon] submitted to the Appeals Council.\u201d <em>Ingram v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1266 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">The denial of Solomon\u2019s application for benefits is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
