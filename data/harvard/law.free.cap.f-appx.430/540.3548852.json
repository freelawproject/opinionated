The district court sentenced him to 36 months in prison. Garcia-Vasquez argues on ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>peal that the court mistakenly concluded that his prior Illinois conviction for unlawful restraint was an aggravated felony under the Sentencing Guidelines, resulting in an incorrect guidelines range. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Garcia-Vasquez, a Mexican citizen, was removed from the United States at least once in the late 1990s, again in February 2007, and yet again in November 2007 before police in Will County, Illinois, took him into custody in March 2009. Garcia-Vasquez admitted to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials that he had returned to the United States without applying for readmission. He pleaded guilty to one count of illegal re-entry. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">This appeal centers on the classification of Garcia-Vasquez\u2019s Illinois felony conviction in 1997 for unlawful restraint, 720 ILCS 5/10-3, after he forcibly prevented a woman from leaving his car. The woman entered the car to talk to Garcia-Vasquez, who had been causing a disturbance in front of her home. Garcia-Vasquez then began to drive away, and as the woman tided to get out of the car, he grabbed her hand to keep her from escaping. At sentencing, both parties disagreed with the probation officer\u2019s characterization of the offense as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d triggering a 16-level increase in his offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Because the Illinois unlawful restraint statute does not have, as an element, \u201cthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\u201d against another person, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n.l(B)(iii); <em>United States v. Wallace, </em>326 F.3d 881, 886 (7th Cir.2003), the government conceded that Garcia-Vasquez\u2019s offense was not a crime of violence under the guideline and that the 16-level increase did not apply. But the government argued that unlawful restraint was an aggravated felony warranting an 8-level increase, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), while Garcia-Vasquez argued that the offense fell into the category of \u201cany other felony,\u201d meriting only a 4-level increase, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(D). The district court sided with the government\u2019s characterization of the offense as an aggravated felony because it involved \u201ca substantial risk of the use of force.\u201d Based on a total offense level of 13 and Garcia-Vasquez\u2019s category-VI criminal history,. the court calculated a guidelines range of 33 to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment and sentenced him to 36 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">Garcia-Vasquez maintains on appeal that unlawful restraint fits in the category of \u201cany other felony,\u201d <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(D), and contends that his total offense level should be 10 rather than 13 \u2014 the result of a base offense level of 8, a 4-level' increase for his unlawful-restraint conviction, and a 2-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2L1.2(a), 3El.l(a). These figures, in his view, dictate a guidelines range of 24 to 30 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">Under Illinois law, \u201cA person commits the offense of unlawful restraint when he or she knowingly without legal authority detains another.\u201d 720 ILCS 5/10-3(a). Determining whether a prior conviction for unlawful restraint is an \u201caggravated felony\u201d requires a journey through a few sentencing provisions. The . sentencing guidelines for illegal re-entry define \u201caggravated felony\u201d by reference to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43), which in turn lists several types of offenses that fall within the meaning of \u201caggravated felony,\u201d including \u2014 as is relevant here \u2014 a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 \u201cfor which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n.3(A). Section 16, in turn, defines a crime of violence as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXN\">(a) an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>(b) any other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. Section 16(a) does not apply here because physical force is not an element of unlawful restraint. <em>See </em>720 ILCS 5/10 \u2014 3(a); <em>People v. Lissade, </em>403 Ill.App.3d 609, 343 Ill.Dec. 813, 935 N.E.2d 1041, 1044 (2010); <em>People v. Bowen, </em>241 Ill.App.3d 608, 182 Ill.Dec. 43, 609 N.E.2d 346, 361 (1993). The issue, then, is whether unlawful restraint is a crime of violence under \u00a7 16(b) and, therefore, an aggravated felony under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)\u00a9.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Section 16(b) covers violent, active crime that typically presents a substantial risk that force will be used against another person during its commission. <em>See Leocal v. Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 10-11, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004). It is not coextensive with the \u201cresidual clause\u201d of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), which also defines violent felonies and covers \u201cconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d The residual clause addresses the risk of injury, while \u00a7 16(b) focuses on the use of force and does not encompass all offenses that create a substantial risk of injury. <em>See Leocal </em>543 U.S. at 10-11, 125 S.Ct. 377; <em>Jimenez-Gonzalez v. Mukasey, </em>548 F.3d 557, 562 (7th Cir.2008). But the statutes\u2019 resemblance allows analysis of an offense under one of them to serve as persuasive authority for analysis of the offense under the other. <em>See Jimenez-Gonzalez, </em>548 F.3d at 562 (observing that \u00a7 16(b) and residual clause contained similar language, and that Supreme Court applied similar logic in <em>Leocal </em>(a \u00a7 16(b) case) and <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137,128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008) (a residual clause case)); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>629 F.3d 290, 296 n. 4 (2d Cir.2011) (whether offense was crime of violence under \u00a7 16(b) was instructive in deciding whether offense was violent felony under residual clause); <em>United States v. Daye, </em>571 F.3d 225, 232-34 (2d Cir.2009) (same); <em>Ramirez v. Mukasey, </em>520 F.3d 47, 50 (1st Cir.2008) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">We have not squarely addressed whether an Illinois unlawful-restraint conviction is a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b), but our decisions in <em>United States v. Wallace, </em>326 F.3d 881 (7th Cir.2003), <em>United States v. Franco-Fernandez, </em>511 F.3d 768 (7th Cir.2008), and <em>United States v. Capler, </em>636 F.3d 321 (7th Cir.2011), suggest convincingly that it is. All three decisions focus on the risk of force. <em>Wallace </em>held that an Illinois unlawful-restraint offense is a violent felony under the residual clause because of the serious risk of injury from the use of force during the initial restraint or an attempted escape. 326 F.3d at 886-87. <em>Franco-Femandez </em>drew from <em>Wallace </em>and reasoned in dicta \u2014 by way of distinguishing unlawful restraint from child abduction \u2014 that unlawful restraint requires detaining a person against his will and thus involves a substantial risk of force, either during restraint or escape. 511 F.3d at 772. And we recently reaffirmed <em>Wallace </em>in <em>Capler, </em>636 F.3d at 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">Garcia-Vasquez offers no reason to distinguish between \u00a7 16(b) and the residual clause when analyzing his unlawful restraint conviction. In fact, he frames his argument in terms of the residual clause, contending that <em>Wallace </em>and <em>United States v. Billups, </em>536 F.3d 574 (7th Cir.2008)\u2014 which cited <em>Wallace </em>in holding that Wisconsin\u2019s crime of false imprisonment was a crime of violence \u2014 are no longer good law in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Begay </em>and <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 122, 129 S.Ct. 687, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009). Garcia-Vasquez contends that unlawful restraint cannot be classified as a crime of violence merely because it pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>ents a serious risk of physical injury. He argues that under <em>Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 142-45,128 S.Ct. 1581 and <em>Chambers, </em>129 S.Ct. at 691-92, a court must also conclude that unlawful restraint is similar in kind (i.e., purposeful, violent, and aggressive) to burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives \u2014 the offenses enumerated before the residual clause. Garcia-Vasquez apparently believes that <em>Wallace </em>and <em>Billups </em>are flawed because we did not perform a similar-in-kind analysis in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">But <em>Capler </em>forecloses Garcia-Vasquez\u2019s argument by explicitly reaffirming <em>Wallace </em>and rejecting the argument that <em>Wallace </em>is a dead letter in light of <em>Begay. See Capler, </em>636 F.3d at 322. <em>Capler </em>explains that <em>Wallace </em>anticipated <em>Begay </em>and \u201cstrongly implie[d]\u201d that unlawful restraint was categorically similar to the enumerated crimes that precede the residual clause. <em>Capler, </em>636 F.3d at 324. Moreover, in <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011), the Supreme Court recently rejected the idea that courts must conclude that an offense is purposeful, violent, and aggressive for it to fall within the scope of the residual clause. Such a requirement, the Court said, \u201cover-reads the opinions of this Court.\u201d <em>Sykes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2275. The \u201cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive\u201d language was used only to explain the result in <em>Begay, </em>which involved a crime \u2014 driving under the influence \u2014 that the Court analogized to strietliability, negligence and recklessness offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 2275-76. Unlawful restraint, which requires \u201cknowingly\u201d detaining a person, 720 ILCS 5/10-3(a), is not such a crime, so the only relevant question is how much risk it presents. <em>See id. </em>at 2273, 2275-76. In light of <em>Wallace </em>and <em>Capler, </em>it is a crime of violence under the residual clause, and, as noted, Garcia-Vasquez offers no reason to conclude that it is not also a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Garcia-Vasquez raises one other sentencing issue regarding what he views as the district court\u2019s erroneous reliance on unsubstantiated hearsay in the presentence report. When he was arrested and charged with unlawful restraint, he was also charged with criminal sexual assault and possession of cocaine, but both of those counts were dropped. The district court struck language in the presentence report describing the alleged sexual assault, but Garcia-Vasquez objects to language not struck which states that he forcibly held his victim\u2019s hand to keep her inside the vehicle, in spite of her pleas to be allowed to leave. However, nothing in the record suggests that the district court rested its conclusion upon the language that Garcia-Vasquez cites, or upon any of the stricken language. The court did not refer at all to the description of the offense in the presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">We AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
