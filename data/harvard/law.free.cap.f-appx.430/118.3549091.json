The District Court granted summary judgment to the School District, and Phillis appealed. We disagree with her arguments, and thus affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-23\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b141-24\">Phillis was hired by the Harrisburg School District in 2001 and assigned to the District\u2019s high school as a learning support teacher in September 2004. There, her supervisors included then-assistant principal Bankus and then-principal Kimber.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>In July 2005, Bankus evaluated Phillis\u2019s performance as unsatisfactory. Phillis grieved that evaluation with her union and filed a complaint with the Pennsylvania Human Rights Commission (PHRC).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The latter charged that Bankus had discriminated against Phillis based on her age, and asserted that Bankus had also shown animus toward older teachers by stating that Phillis\u2019s classroom (which was located in the basement) had a \u201cmusty but[t] smell.\u201d App. 516. Ultimately, Phillis\u2019s union grievance was successful and the evaluation was withdrawn based on the School District\u2019s failure to follow correct procedures in issuing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">In August 2005, Kimber allegedly stated to a group of teachers, including Phillis, that \u201cif you are no longer an effective teacher, you should pack up your excess baggage and leave,\u201d and commented that an older teacher had retired and was at home taking a \u201clong nap.\u201d Then, in October 2005, Bankus again evaluated Phillis\u2019s performance as unsatisfactory and placed her on an \u201cIndividual Teacher Improvement Plan\u201d (ITIP), with the stated goal of improving her teaching skills. In January 2006, Bankus informed Phillis that she had not improved her performance as required by the ITIP. One month later, Bankus observed Phillis\u2019s classroom performance, and deemed it unsatisfactory. In April 2006, Phillis received a letter of reprimand from Bankus, which accused Phillis of violating both school policy and the requirements of the ITIP by placing class rules on a table, rather than posting them on the wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">In June 2006, the School District identified two purported discrepancies in Phillis\u2019s application for employment with it. First, Phillis indicated on her application that the reason for leaving her previous position with the Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania School District was that she had been a temporary employee without a long-term contract. However, she did not disclose that her short-term contract was not renewed because she received an unsatisfactory teaching evaluation. Second, Phillis also indicated that she had never been convicted of a crime, when in fact she pled guilty to driving while intoxicated in 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">On June 26, 2006, Phillis applied for disability retirement due to job-related stress. One month later, the School District informed Phillis that it intended to bring termination proceedings, and that a termination hearing would be held on August 11. In August, the School District suspended Phillis indefinitely and without pay, but her request for disability retirement was approved in September 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">In June 2007, the parties entered into a partial settlement agreement, in which Phillis agreed to release \u201c[the] District, and its board members, directors, officers, agents, employees and attorneys, and all other persons or entities who could be said to be jointly or severally liable with it,\u201d from all future claims, subject to the following exception: \u201c[Njothing in this Agreement will serve to release the pending actions against the District listed below before the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Conunission and any subsequent action in State or Federal Court arising therefrom, insofar as they seek relief other than reinstatement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">After receiving a collection of \u201cright to sue\u201d letters from the PHRC, Phillis filed her complaint in this case, alleging claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 261 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cADEA\u201d); Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq.; </em>and the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">While the case was pending, Kimber died. Phillis did not move to substitute Kimber\u2019s estate as a defendant pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 25(a), and the District Court granted defendants\u2019 subsequent motion to dismiss Kimber from the case. The Court later granted summary judgment in favor of the two remaining defendants. It concluded that, under the partial settlement agreement, Phillis unambiguously gave up her rights both to sue Bankus at all and to bring a Title VII claim against the School District.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Turning to Phillis\u2019s remaining claims, the District Court concluded that the ADEA is the sole available remedy for claims of age discrimination and associated retaliation, and dismissed Phillis\u2019s constitutional claims on that basis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Then, after reviewing the summary judgment submissions at length, it held that Phillis did not successfully establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. Additionally, it granted summary judgment to the School District concerning Phillis\u2019s ADEA retaliation claim, concluding that Phillis failed to rebut the School District\u2019s proffered non-retaliatory explanations for its actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Phillis now appeals both the grant of summary judgment and the order dismissing Kimber from the case following her death. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">We review the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Ray v. Twp. of Warren, </em>626 F.3d 170, 173 (3d Cir.2010).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We also review <em>de novo </em>the District Court\u2019s legal conclusion that Fed. R.Civ.P. 25(a) required Kimber\u2019s dismissal. <em>See Barlow v. Ground, </em>39 F.3d 231, 233 (9th Cir.1994). We address the District Court\u2019s conclusions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">A. Phillis\u2019s Claims Against Kimber and Bankus</p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">Phillis argues the District Court \u201ccould have and perhaps should have\u201d substituted Kimber\u2019s estate into the case <em>sua sponte. </em>This is inconsistent with the plain language of Fed.R.Civ.P. 25(a), which states that, absent a motion \u201cmade within 90 days after service of a statement noting the death, the action by or against the decedent <em>must </em>be dismissed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The mandatory language of this rule does not leave room for the District Court to save Phillis from her failure to file a motion for substitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-15\">In any event, the Court correctly concluded that the settlement agreement between Phillis and the School District released any claims against Bankus, and that conclusion would apply equally to Kimber (and Kimber\u2019s estate). \u201c[T] he interpretation of a contract generally is a question of law\u201d we review <em>de novo. United States v. Hardwick, </em>544 F.3d 565, 570 (3d Cir.2008). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Paragraph Three of the settlement agreement specifies that Phillis \u201cforever discharges District, and its board members, directors, officers, agents, employees and attorneys, and all other persons or entities who could be said to be jointly or severally liable with it,\u201d except for \u201cthe pending actions against the District listed below ... and any subsequent action in State or Federal Court arising therefrom.... \u201d App. 612. Notably, the release covers a wide-ranging list of individuals, whereas the exception \u2014 found in the same paragraph \u2014 includes only the District. As the District Court held, the only reasonable interpretation of that language is that it releases Phillis\u2019s claims against Bankus and Kimber, leaving only her claims against the School District.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">B. Phillis\u2019s Age Discrimination Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Phillis argues that the District Court erred by granting summary judgment on her ADEA claim, and asserts that she demonstrated the existence of a disputed material fact as to each element of her <em>prima facie </em>case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">An ADEA plaintiff can make her <em>pnma facie </em>case by putting forth direct and/or indirect evidence of discrimination. <em>Fasold v. Justice, </em>409 F.3d 178, 183-84 (3d Cir.2005). Where a plaintiff relies on indirect evidence, we follow the burden-shifting framework articulated in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Phillis points to a handful of instances that she contends provide direct or circumstantial evidence of discrimination. They are: 1) that Bankus commented that Phillis\u2019s basement classroom had a \u201cmusty but[t]\u201d smell, and that \u201cmusty butt\u201d is \u201can Ebonics term used to refer derogatorily to older people,\u201d Appellant Br. at 29; 2) that Kimber made a negative comment about \u201cveteran\u201d teachers; 3) that older teachers were given undesirable work assignments and storage areas; and 4) that both Phillis and another older teacher successfully grieved \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d evaluations in 2005. Even evaluated collectively, we hold that this evidence is insufficient to meet Phillis\u2019s initial burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">At the outset, we note that, despite a voluminous appendix in this case, Phillis primarily relies on her own unsworn declaration in order to establish the existence of disputes of material fact. Unsworn declarations are permissible at the summary judgment stage if they conform to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746\u2019s requirement that declarants state that the contents of their declarations are true, subject to penalty of perjury. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>see also Woloszyn v. Cnty. of Lawrence, </em>396 F.3d 314, 323 (3d Cir.2005). Phillis\u2019s declaration does not comply with this requirement, and thus the District Court was free to disregard it.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">Even considering that declaration, Phillis\u2019s evidence of age discrimination falls short. First, she provides no citation for her \u201cproffer\u201d that \u201cmusty butt\u201d is an \u201cEbonics term used to refer derogatorily to older people,\u201d Appellant Br. at 29, and this is not the sort of \u201cfact\u201d of which we could take judicial notice. Nor does the withdrawn 2005 evaluation, which rated as unsatisfactory Phillis\u2019s performance in maintaining personal hygiene, help Phillis\u2019s case in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">Second, even drawing all inferences in Phillis\u2019s favor, Kimber\u2019s negative statements about \u201cveteran and returning\u201d teachers generally, and about one particular teacher (Ms. Withers), do not evidence discrimination. It is not clear from the record how old the returning teachers are; presumably many of them were significantly younger than 40, and some new teachers (like Phillis herself) were older than 40 when they started with the School <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>District. The second statement appears to be directed at Ms. Withers\u2019s behavior, and not all teachers or even all older teachers. Likewise, Phillis\u2019s unsworn statements that she was assigned undesirable work and storage areas and that \u201cthe atmosphere was like a workhouse, with some older female teachers pushing carts full of materials great distances,\u201d App. 211, are insufficient to defeat summary judgment. These statements do not establish that similarly situated younger teachers received better treatment, and therefore do not evidence discrimination. Finally, that Phillis and another older teacher \u2014 among approximately 1,300 School District employees \u2014 received unsatisfactory evaluations, which they then successfully grieved, does not suggest age discrimination absent more information about the total number of unsatisfactory evaluations issued and the age of the teachers who received them. Nor does it help Phillis\u2019s cause that the evaluations were later withdrawn on procedural grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment on Phillis\u2019s discrimination claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">C. Phillis\u2019s Retaliation Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">This case involves two species of retaliation claim \u2014 one brought under the ADEA\u2019s retaliation provision, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(d), and one brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging a violation of Phillis\u2019s First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">The District Court concluded that the ADEA\u2019s retaliation provision preempts Phillis\u2019s First Amendment claims that defendants violated her speech and petition rights by retaliating against her for filing PHRC petitions and union grievances. As the Court acknowledged, we have not yet decided this issue. And we decline to do so today. Instead, we conclude that Phillis\u2019s constitutional claims fail because she has not demonstrated a dispute of material fact as to whether the School District may be held liable under <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">In the District Court, Phillis argued that the School District demonstrated a policy of retaliation by continuing to rely on the incidents underlying the 2005 unsatisfactory evaluation even after that evaluation had been withdrawn. We do not see what this has to do with whether the School District had a policy of retaliating against teachers who file PHRC complaints or union grievances. Additionally, when asked during her deposition about \u201cfacts relating to a policy of retaliation and discrimination,\u201d Phillis stated only that she had \u201cseen teachers who were older in what looked to me [to be] systematically experiencing constructive discharge,\u201d but could not remember the names of those teachers, except for one Ms. Pottiger (as to whom she offered no details). App. 657. That answer was insufficient to create a dispute of fact as to whether the School District had a policy or custom of retaliating against teachers, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>was hopelessly vague even as to whether it had a policy of age discrimination.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Finally, because Phillis has not shown the existence of a dispute of fact as to her ADEA retaliation claim, that claim also fails. To establish an \u00c1DEA retaliation claim, a plaintiff must first demonstrate a <em>prima facie </em>case, <em>Fasold, </em>409 F.3d at 188, which the District Court concluded Phillis had done. This triggered the School District\u2019s burden to state a \u201clegitimate non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action,\u201d at which time \u201cthe burden of production returns to [Phillis] to demonstrate that the employer\u2019s proffered rationale was a pretext.... \u201d <em>Smith v. City of Allentown, </em>589 F.3d 684, 690 (3d Cir.2009). Because the School District does not appear to contest the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Phillis established her <em>prima facie </em>case, we proceed directly to analyze the District\u2019s articulated reasons for taking the relevant adverse employment actions \u2014 placing Phillis on an ITIP in October 2005, and recommending her termination in August 2006 \u2014 and whether Phillis has succeeded in showing a disputed material fact as to whether those reasons were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Regarding the ITIP, Bankus testified that the Plan was imposed primarily based on the complaints about Phillis that arose the previous school year, as well as a handful of incidents that occurred in September or early October 2005. Phillis posits that the previous year\u2019s incidents were no longer fair game because they had been included in the procedurally unsound unsatisfactory evaluation, yet she points to nothing that supports that position. Further, while Phillis states in her unsworn .declaration that at least one of the relevant incidents did not occur,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> she does not deny others. Thus, we see no basis to disturb the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Phillis failed to show a genuine issue of material fact whether the School District\u2019s stated reasons for placing her on the ITIP were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">Likewise, the School District has satisfied its burden by giving two general reasons for terminating Phillis: that she failed to follow her supervisors\u2019 instructions (including those contained in her ITIPs), and the two discrepancies in Phillis\u2019s job application. Starting with the School District\u2019s second reason, we agree that Phillis has shown that there is at least a dispute of fact whether it had actual or constructive knowledge of her DUI conviction much earlier than 2006. As Phillis points out, she had submitted to the School District forms containing information about her conviction during a licensing proceeding that took place in 2002, and a reasonable factfinder could infer that School District administrators had reviewed those forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">However, we are not similarly convinced that, because Phillis\u2019s explanation regarding her departure from Mechanicsburg, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Pennsylvania School District was technically correct, it could not have been a basis for her dismissal. At minimum, Phillis\u2019s statement was misleading \u2014 we note that during litigation subsequent to Phillis\u2019s departure from the Mechanicsburg School District, a Pennsylvania Court stated that she \u201creceived an unsatisfactory rating <em>and was </em>dismissed.\u201d <em>Phillis v. Bd. of Sch. Dirs. of Mechanicsburg Area Sch. Dist., </em>151 Pa.Cmwlth. 497, 617 A.2d 830, 832 (1992) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">As to the District\u2019s reliance on Phillis\u2019s failure to follow supervisory instructions, she asserts broadly that the various infractions that the School District claims she committed during the course of her employment were \u201cresoundingly debunk[ed]\u201d by her declai'ation. But we have already discussed why that declaration is insufficient to defeat summary judgment. Beyond her general statement, Phillis specifically challenges only the School District\u2019s decision to issue her a formal letter of reprimand for failing to post classroom rules in the manner required by school policy and her ITIP. In Phillis\u2019s brief in our Court, she labels as \u201cutterly absurd\u201d the contention that she violated this rule by \u201cposting\u201d her class rules horizontally, on a desk, instead of adhering them to a wall or chalkboard. Appellant Br. at 35. However, we deem Phillis\u2019s \u201chorizontal posting\u201d argument insufficient to allow a reasonable fact finder to conclude that the School District was acting pretextually.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Accordingly, we see no reason to overturn the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Phillis\u2019s retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-6\">. Phillis also cross-filed this complaint, as well as several subsequent PHRC complaints, with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The District Court's opinion details when these complaints were filed, and we do not repeat that history here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b143-7\">. Phillis also made a claim under the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act in her Complaint. However, the District Court concluded that Phillis had abandoned that claim, and she does not argue otherwise on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b143-8\">. Phillis does not appeal the District Court\u2019s conclusion regarding her Title VII claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b143-16\">. She has now disavowed any equal protection claim based on age discrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b143-17\">. In Phillis\u2019s opening brief, her counsel stated his belief that the ''opinions of this [Cjourt ... appear to give [district court opinions] some measure of deference.\u201d Appellant Br. at 24-25. We assure Phillis and her counsel that this is not the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b145-9\">. We note that Phillis asserts in her brief that her evidence of retaliation also serves as indirect evidence of discrimination. For the reasons stated in the following section, we conclude as well that Phillis's indirect evidence of retaliation is also insufficient.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b145-10\">. Under <em>Monell </em>and its progeny, the School District is liable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 only if Phillis can show that a District employee \u201cacted pursuant to a formal government policy or a standard operating procedure,\u201d that actions were taken by an individual with \"policy making authority,\u201d or that \u201can official with authority has ratified the unconstitutional actions of a subordinate....\u201d <em>McGreevy v. Stroup, </em>413 F.3d 359, 367 (3d Cir.2005). .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b146-6\">. Finally, though Phillis did not make this argument, we note that <em>Monell </em>liability could be established if the relevant actors \u2014 generally Kimber and Bankus \u2014 had \"final, unreviewable discretion to make a decision or take action.\u201d <em>McGreevy, </em>413 F.3d at 369. Pennsylvania law makes clear, however, that the relevant unreviewable discretion is vested in either the school board or the superintendent. 24 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 11-1123 (\"no unsatisfactory rating shall be valid unless approved by the district superintendent\u201d) &amp; 11-1127 (referring to due process procedures to which tenured teachers are entitled before they may be dismissed by the \"board of school directors\u201d). Thus, this avenue of establishing School District liability for Kimber's and Bankus's alleged constitutional violations is also unavailable to Phillis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b146-12\">. Specifically, Phillis denies that she told students that she had sent pictures of herself, wearing a bikini, to another teacher.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
