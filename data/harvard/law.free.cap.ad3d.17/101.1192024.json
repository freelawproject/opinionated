Defendant\u2019s factual allegations were insufficient to support a claim that his guilty plea should be vacated on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel (see <em>Hill v Lockhart, </em>474 US 52 [1985]). Contrary to defendant\u2019s claim, counsel\u2019s advice relative to the deportation consequences of his plea, judged on the facts of the particular case and viewed as of the time the advice was rendered (see <em>Strickland v Washington, </em>466 US 668, 690 [1984]), did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness <em>(compare People v McDonald, </em>1 NY3d 109 [2003]). Counsel\u2019s advice, provided after consultation with experts on immigration law, on the deportation consequences of defendant\u2019s plea, was sound at the time the advice was given <em>(compare United States v Couto, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>311 F3d 179 [2002]), and it did not express an inappropriate level of expectation as to those consequences. This advice was only rendered erroneous by subsequent developments in two areas of the law that a competent attorney could not be expected to have reasonably foreseen.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Since defendant did not satisfy the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, there is no need to determine whether defendant established prejudice. We have considered and rejected defendant\u2019s remaining claims. Concur\u2014Buckley, EJ., Tom, Andrias, Friedman and Sullivan, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
