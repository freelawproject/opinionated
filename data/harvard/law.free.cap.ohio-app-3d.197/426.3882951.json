A separation agreement and shared-parenting plan was attached and incorporated into the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">{\u00b6 3} The separation agreement set forth the parties\u2019 agreed child support, which was based upon Mierzwiak\u2019s annual income of $315,000 and Lanham\u2019s annual income of $37,200. The trial court ordered Mierzwiak to pay $584.88 per month per child for each of the four minor children, for a total obligation of $2,585.17 including processing charges.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition to the agreed monthly child-support payment, Mierzwiak agreed to pay $2,000 per month in spousal support to Lanham through August 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">{\u00b6 4} In February 2005, Mierzwiak moved the trial court for modification of his child-support obligation based upon a change in circumstances with respect to the oldest child, who came to live with him full-time. On November 20, 2007, the trial court rendered a judgment entry that provided that the parties agreed to the following child-support obligation based upon Mierzwiak\u2019s annual total gross income of $352,379 and Lanham\u2019s annual total gross income of $86,923:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-11\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c1. Commencing October 1, 2007 and continuing through June 30, 2008, [Mierzwiak] shall pay, as and for child support for the three remaining minor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>children, the amount of [$800] per month, per child, plus a [2 percent] processing fee, for a total monthly payment of [$2,448];<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c2. Commencing July 1, 2008 and continuing through June 30, 2009, [Mierzwiak] shall pay, as and for child support for the two remaining minor children, the amount of [$1,200] per month, per child, plus a [2 percent] processing fee, for a total monthly payment of [$2,448];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c3. Commencing July 1, 2009 and continuing through August 31, 2009, [Mierzwiak] shall pay, as and for child support for the one remaining minor child, the amount of [$2,400] per month, for the one minor child, plus a [2 percent] processing fee, for a total monthly payment of [$2,448].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c4. As of September 1, 2009, the child support obligation of the parties shall be subject to recalculation based upon the law then in effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">{\u00b6 9} Mierzwiak\u2019s spousal-support obligation remained unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">{\u00b6 10} Thereafter, on June 11, 2009, Lanham filed a motion to modify child support because the November 2007 order did not account for child support for the remaining minor child subsequent to August 31, 2009. In response to this motion, Mierzwiak filed his own motion to modify child support and argued that child support for the remaining minor child should remain at $2,400 per month after August 31, 2009. Subsequently, on January 29, 2010, Lanham filed an amended motion to modify support in which she requested attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">{\u00b6 11} In a decision dated May 14, 2010, the magistrate ordered Mierzwiak to pay $4,576.25<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> per month in child support for the remaining minor child. In reaching this decision, the magistrate determined that Mierzwiak\u2019s annual gross income was $545,829 and Lanham\u2019s was $111,491, which included her husband\u2019s annual income. Further, the magistrate found that there was a vast disparity in the income of the parties and that R.C. 3119.04(B) is applicable. In his decision, the magistrate relied on <em>Bunkers v. Bunkers, </em>6th Dist. No. WD-06-030, 2007-Ohio-561, 2007 WL 431418, \u00b6 23, in which we determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by using the extrapolation method to calculate the proper amount of child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">{\u00b6 12} In support of his decision, the magistrate considered that Lanham worked 80 hours per week to earn an income \u201cthat is significant but such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>schedule is burdensome especially when raising a teenage daughter. There is no doubt that [Mierzwiak] also works numerous hours per week but his income does not coincide with or compliment his work schedule.\u201d The magistrate concluded, \u201cThe Court has computed child support at both the $150,000.00 level and the extrapolated level. The Court finds that the extrapolated amount is reasonable and in compliance with R.C. 3119.04.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">{\u00b6 13} Subsequently, Mierzwiak filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. Thereafter, in adopting the magistrate\u2019s decision, the trial court found \u201cno reason under the circumstances of the case and the facts presented not to use the extrapolation method of computation in determining child support. The magistrate considered the incomes of the parties, the needs of the parties, the work/lifestyle of the parties, the marginal costs of the health insurance expense incurred for the child and the time-sharing arrangement of the parties with their child. The Magistrate mathematically-correctly extrapolated the statutory child support guidelines with the parties\u2019 combined income exceeding $150,000. The Court finds the application of the extrapolation method to be in the best interests of the child and fair and equitable to the parties. In these regards, the Court reminds the parties that the child is entitled to the economic lifestyle which she would have enjoyed had the parties remained married.\u201d The trial court also determined that each party was responsible for his or her own costs and attorney fees. From this decision, Mierzwiak appeals, asserting three assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">{\u00b6 14} In his first assignment of error, Mierzwiak contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cIt was reversible error for the trial court to utilize the extrapolation method to calculate child support, without considering the qualitative needs and standard of living of the child and parents.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">{\u00b6 16} A trial court is vested with broad discretion in deciding child-support matters and will be reversed only upon a finding that the trial court abused its discretion. <em>Dunbar v. Dunbar </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 369, 371, 627 N.E.2d 532, citing <em>Booth v. Booth </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 142, 144, 541 N.E.2d 1028; <em>Kendall v. Kendall, </em>6th Dist. No. OT-04-004, 2005-Ohio-1777, 2005 WL 859447, \u00b6 8. An abuse of discretion connotes that the court\u2019s attitude is \u201cunreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable and not merely an error of law or judgment.\u201d <em>Kunkle v. Kunkle </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 64, 67, 554 N.E.2d 83, citing <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140. \u201cWhere a judgment is supported by some competent, credible evidence, there is no abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Barone v. Barone, </em>6th Dist. No. L-07-1336, 2008-Ohio-5793, 2008 WL 4823343, \u00b6 15, citing <em>Van Vorce v. Van Vorce, </em>3d Dist. No. 2-04-11, 2004-Ohio-5646, 2004 WL 2377839, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>{\u00b6 17} In his first assignment of error, Mierzwiak argues that it was reversible error for the trial court to use the extrapolation method to calculate his modified child-support obligation under R.C. 3119.04(B), \u201cwithout considering the qualitative needs and standard of living of the child and parents.\u201d Mierzwiak argues that his new child-support obligation is excessive, and that <em>Siebert v. Tavarez, </em>8th Dist. No. 88310, 2007-Ohio-2643, 2007 WL 1559565, supports his contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">{\u00b6 18} In <em>Siebert, </em>the father earned $2.6 million per year and the use of extrapolation would have resulted in a monthly child-support award of $21,666. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6'35. The <em>Siebert </em>court stated, \u201cSome Ohio courts have employed the \u2018extrapolation\u2019 method of calculating child support in cases where the basic child support schedule is inapplicable because the combined income of the parents exceeds $150,000. This method takes the applicable percentage under the child support schedules for couples with combined incomes of $150,000 and applies it directly to whatever income the parents make. For example, in <em>[Cyr v. Cyr, </em>8th Dist. No. 84255, 2005-Ohio-504, 2005 WL 315375,] we noted that if the guideline percentage was 14.6%, the court would apply 14.6% of the combined incomes for child support * * *. Some courts have continued to use the extrapolation method of calculating child support under R.C. \u00a7 3119.04(B).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 32-33. The <em>Siebert </em>court concluded that \u201cas the combined income of the parents rises sharply, mere extrapolation can lead to large, and possibly. unrealistic, child support amounts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 35. Relying on <em>Siebert, </em>Mierzwiak argues that the use of the extrapolation method resulted in an excessive child-support award.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">{\u00b6 19} Our analysis of the trial court\u2019s judgment that adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision begins with R.C. 3119.04(B), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cIf the combined gross income of both parents is greater than [$150,000] per year, <em>the court, with respect to a court child support order </em>* * * <em>shall determine the amount of the obligor\u2019s child support obligation on a case-by-case basis and shall consider the needs and the standard of living of the children who are the subject of the child support order and of the parents. </em>The court * * * shall compute a basic combined child support obligation that is no less than the obligation that would have been computed under the basic child support schedule and applicable worksheet for a combined gross income of [$150,000] unless the court * * * determines that it would be unjust or inappropriate and would not be in the best interest of the child, obligor, or obligee to order that amount. If the court * * * makes such a determination, it shall enter in the journal the figure, determination, and findings.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">{\u00b6 21} We have construed this provision to mean that the trial court must \u201c \u2018(1) set the child support amount based on the qualitative needs and standard of living of the children and parents; (2) ensure that the amount set is not less than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>$150,000-equivalent, unless awarding the $150,000-equivalent would be inappropriate (i.e. would be too much); and (3) if it decides, the $150,000-equivalent is inappropriate or unjust (i.e. awards less), then journalize the justification for that decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barone, </em>2008-Ohio-5793, 2008 WL 4823343, at \u00b6 18, quoting <em>Zeitler v. Zeitler, </em>9th Dist. No. 04CA008444, 2004-Ohio-5551, 2004 WL 2348151, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">{\u00b6 22} In fact, this court has specifically stated, \u201c \u2018 \u201cNothing in the new version of the statute, however, prohibits the court from using [extrapolation] to determine the amount of support due in high income cases; it merely no longer mandates that the court use this method. Moreover, the statute does not require any explanation of its decision unless it awards less than the amount awarded for combined incomes of $150,000. [A] trial court [does not err] therefore, if it used the extrapolation method to determine the amount of child support due.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Bunkers, </em>2007-Ohio-561, 2007 WL 431418, at \u00b6 21, quoting <em>Kendall, </em>2005-Ohio-1777, 2005 WL 859447, at \u00b6 25, quoting <em>Cyr v. Cyr </em>(Feb. 10, 2005), 8th Dist. No. 84255, 2005-Ohio-504, 2005 WL 315375, \u00b6 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">{\u00b6 23} Applying existing case law to Mierzwiak\u2019s assignment of error, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in making the child-support award. Because the amount set is not less than the $150,000 equivalent, the trial court was not required to make any findings. <em>Barone </em>at \u00b6 19, citing <em>Siebert, </em>2007-Ohio-2643, 2007 WL 1559565, at \u00b6 31. See also <em>Cyr, </em>2005-Ohio-504, 2005 WL 315375, at \u00b6 55. Rather, the trial court was required only to \u201cconsider the needs and the standard of living of the children who are the subject of the child support order and of the parents.\u201d R.C. 3119.04(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">{\u00b6 24} Lanham is a registered nurse and massage therapist. She is currently employed by St. Vincent Medical Center, Mercy Home Care, and Northwest Ohio Emergency Services. In regard to her needs and standard of living, the court considered that Lanham must work 80 hours per week in order to maintain a level of income to provide for her daughter\u2019s basic needs. Lanham\u2019s testimony regarding this issue is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-8\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c[Lanham\u2019s attorney] Are you able to provide for [the minor child] the same standard of living in your home that she has in her father\u2019s home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-9\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c[Lanham] Right now? I provide for her needs I would say\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-10\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c[Lanham\u2019s Attorney] My question in\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-11\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c[Lanham] \u2014more so\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-12\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c[Lanham\u2019s Attorney] \u2014are you able to provide the same standard of living in your home as her father\u2019s home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-13\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c[Lanham] No, I can\u2019t but I try.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-14\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c[Lanham\u2019s Attorney] And when you say you try, what do mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>{\u00b6 32} \u201c[Lanham] No, I try to \u2014 to provide her with \u2014 I guess I\u2019m just \u2014 I do by working my jobs I\u2019m able to \u2014 to\u2014I mean, honestly I just do the basics. * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c[Lanham\u2019s Attorney] Why are you working two jobs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c[Lanham] So that I can pay for my house and the electric and the kids\u2019 groceries and \u2014 and the expenses that are \u2014 there are minimal expenses that they had ever since we were married.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c[Lanham\u2019s Attorney] Are you able to do that without working two jobs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c[Lanham] No, I am not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">{\u00b6 37} The trial court also considered that Lanham had refinanced her home twice and that she wished to reduce her working hours but would not be able to provide the basic needs of her child if she reduced her hours. Lanham also testified that she has had to use the equity in her home to meet her monthly expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">{\u00b6 38} Mierzwiak is a physician employed by Omni Health Services Limited, a partnership, and Omni Administrative Service Corporation. Mierzwiak is paid an hourly wage by Omni Health Services and also received bonus payments from Omni Administrative Services. As to his needs and standard of living, Mierzwiak testified that his corporation took on additional partners so that he would not have to work more than 60 hours per week. Despite this, Mierzwiak\u2019s annual income has increased from $315,000 in 2003 to $545,829 in 2009. Mierzwiak also testified that this new child-support payment causes a financial hardship. In support of this, Mierzwiak testified that he spends approximately $3,500 per month paying for the college educational expenses of his three older children. At the time of the hearing, however, Mierzwiak had paid all tuition due for the year for his older children, with $2,000 remaining in a college savings fund. Further, Mierzwiak testified that he took out education loans for his oldest child in the amount of $114,000. He argues on appeal that it was not necessary for Lanham to take out any educational loans. However, Mierzwiak took out the loans, not out of necessity, but rather with the intention of investing the proceeds in an education account earning a higher interest rate than the loan interest rate to \u201chopefully come out ahead.\u201d We note that Mierzwiak went on to testify that \u201cwhen the market tanked last year so did the fund, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m just leaving that money in that fund and that\u2019s the money that I\u2019m going to use to pay back the college loans.\u201d Despite this, at the time of the hearing, Mierzwiak had managed to save $45,000 to repay the educational loan that would not be due until after December 2010. Mierzwiak also testified that he was able to contribute the maximum amount to his 401(k), approximately $46,000 in 2009. Evidence admitted in the trial court also shows that Mierzwiak contributed $9,730 into a health savings account in 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>{\u00b6 39} Finally, in regard to the needs and standard of living of the remaining minor child, the magistrate plainly stated that he reviewed the \u201cstandard of living, educational costs, sports, and other enrichment activities for the minor child\u201d as well as \u201cthe actual time share of the parents in conjunction with the parties\u2019 responsibilities pursuant to their Shared Parenting Plan.\u201d Testimony was elicited in the trial court that the minor child spends four days per week with Lanham and three days with Mierzwiak, but she spends some time each day at Lanham\u2019s house eating and doing laundry. Testimony reveals that the minor child takes art classes and that Lanham\u2019s work schedule made it difficult for the minor child to participate in travel volleyball. Thus, it is evident that the trial court considered the needs and lifestyle of the child, but also the needs and lifestyle of both parents when extrapolating the child-support payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">{\u00b6 40} Therefore, because the trial court considered the needs and standard of living of both parties and the children as required by R.C. 3119.04(B), we cannot hold that the trial court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">{\u00b6 41} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">{\u00b6 42} Mierzwiak\u2019s second assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cIt was reversible error for the trial court to fail to apply the <em>Barone </em>case in determining the award of child support.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">{\u00b6 44} In <em>Barone, </em>2008-Ohio-5793, 2008 WL 4823343, at \u00b6 19, this court reiterated that \u201cR.C. 3119.04(B) neither contains nor references any factors to guide the court\u2019s determination in establishing the amount of child support; instead, the court must determine the amount of child support on a <em>case-by-case </em>basis. Moreover, unless the court awards support that is less than the amount listed in the child support guidelines worksheet for combined incomes of $150,000, the court need not state its reasons for the determined amount.\u201d (Emphasis added and citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">{\u00b6 45} We also specifically noted that \u201cdeviations pursuant to R.C. 3119.22 and factors relevant to granting deviations pursuant to R.C. 3119.23 are expressly applicable only to deviations from the basic support schedule and worksheet \u2014 and not case-by-case determinations under R.C. 3119.04(B).\u201d <em>Barone </em>at \u00b6 20. We held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion considering the deviation factors set forth in R.C. 3119.23 in determining an appropriate support order when the parties\u2019 combined incomes exceed $150,000, so long as the court fulfills the analysis mandated by R.C. 3119.04(B). <em>Id. </em>Thus, we concluded that the trial court was not required to apply the deviation factors in order to come to a reasonable child-support order; it simply did not abuse its discretion in so considering those factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>{\u00b6 46} <em>Barone </em>is further distinguishable from the instant case because, in addition to the $1,800 in child support per month, the father in <em>Barone </em>voluntarily contributed $25,000 per year for private school tuition, clothing, educational expenses, expenses for sports activities, living expenses, and vacation expenses for the minor child. <em>Barone </em>at \u00b6 10-11. Most importantly, however, R.C. 3119.04(B) requires that the trial court examine each case on a <em>case-by-case </em>basis. For reasons specifically stated in appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, we find that the trial court properly considered the standard of living for the parents and child in determining the modified child-support amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">{\u00b6 47} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">{\u00b6 48} In his third assignment of error, appellant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cIt was reversible error for the trial court to award child support as a substitute for Ms. Lanham\u2019s recent loss in spousal support.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">{\u00b6 50} Appellant\u2019s argument is that he previously paid an agreed spousal-support payment of $2,000 per month in addition to the $2,400 monthly child-support obligation. Because Mierzwiak\u2019s new child-support payment amounted to approximately $4,576.25 per month, he concludes that the trial court\u2019s award is \u201can attempt to compensate [appellant] for her \u2018lost\u2019 spousal support payments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">{\u00b6 51} We disagree. The fact that Mierzwiak\u2019s previous combined child-support and spousal-support payment is relatively the same amount as his new child-support payment is a mathematical coincidence. The trial court used Mierzwiak\u2019s gross income of $545,829 and Lanham\u2019s gross income of $111,491. The trial court then used the extrapolation method to determine Mierzwiak\u2019s child-support obligation of $65,186.84. After imputing Lanham\u2019s income, the trial court arrived at Mierzwiak\u2019s annual child-support obligation of $53,838.25.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In so computing the new amount, the trial court used a mathematical formula, and Mierzwiak does not contend that any mathematical error occurred in the trial court\u2019s calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">{\u00b6 52} As we have previously determined that the trial court properly considered the needs and standard of living of the child who is the subject of the child-support order and of the parents as required by R.C. 3119.04(B), nothing further was required of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-11\">{\u00b6 53} Therefore, we find appellant\u2019s third assignment of error not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>{\u00b6 54} The judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division, is hereby affirmed.
