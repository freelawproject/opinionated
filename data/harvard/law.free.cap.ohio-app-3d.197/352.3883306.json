CBIZ Accounting &amp; Tax Advisory, L.L.C. (collectively referred to as \u201cCBIZ\u201d), injunctive relief, damages, attorney fees, litigation fees, and costs in CBIZ\u2019s action for breach of various agreements. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">{\u00b6 2} This matter arises from a series of agreements that CBIZ entered into with defendants, certified public accountants who are licensed by the state of Minnesota and work in Minnesota. In 1988, Barton was hired by the New Hope, Minnesota firm of Bertram, Vallez, Kaplan &amp; Talbot, Ltd. (\u201cBertram Vallez\u201d), an accounting firm that performs \u201cattest accounting services,\u201d or services such as audits, reviews of financial statements, and examinations of financial information that require an accountant to exercise independence, and \u201cnonattest services,\u201d such as bookkeeping services, payroll services, and tax services.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to Minn.Stat. 326A.10, only CPA licensees may perform attest services. Minnesota nonetheless recognizes an \u201calternative practice structure\u201d under which a company may be compensated for providing staffing and labor for attest accounting services and performing nonattest services. See Minn.Stat. 326A.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Barton\u2019s Agreements</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">{\u00b6 3} By 1998, Barton had become a shareholder at Bertram Vallez, and defendants Krier, Stelzer, and Walter were also working there under employment agreements. On August 20, 1998, CBIZ, an Ohio company that is not a licensed public accounting firm, bought Bertram Vallez\u2019s nonattest accounting practice for $12 million and renamed it \u201cCBIZ BVKT, L.L.C.\u201d (\u201cCBIZ BVKT\u201d). Barton received $184,756 in cash and 12,545 shares of CBIZ stock, plus an \u201cearn-out\u201d payment of $112,320 and an additional 6,815 shares of stock. On August 20, 1998, Barton and other shareholders of Bertram Vallez signed an agreement and plan of merger (\u201cmerger agreement\u201d) and an executive-employment agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">{\u00b6 4} The merger agreement prohibited Barton from disclosing confidential information, including information pertaining to clients and prospective clients and information pertaining to employees. The noncompetition provision of the merger agreement prohibited Barton and the other shareholders from entering into, engaging in, promoting, or assisting any business that competes with CBIZ BVKT in the greater Minneapolis metropolitan area, encompassing seven counties, for five years from the date of the agreement, which would be August 20, 2003. The noncompetition provision additionally prohibited Barton from soliciting clients and prospective clients, inducing CBIZ BVKT employees, agents, and others to terminate their relationship with the corporation, and from employing such individuals for ten years from the date of the agreement, or until August 20, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">{\u00b6 5} The merger agreement further indicated that violations and attempted violations would entitle CBIZ BVKT to liquidated damages, entitling CBIZ BVKT to 100 percent of the gross revenue derived from violation of the merger agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">{\u00b6 6} Barton and CBIZ BVKT also signed an executive-employment agreement in August 1998. This document provided that Barton\u2019s employment would commence on August 20, 1998, and \u201cexpire on the seventh anniversary of\u2019 that date, or August 20, 2005, but that Barton\u2019s obligations under Sections 6-10 of the executive-employment agreement would \u201csurvive expiration of\u2019 the seven-year term.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">{\u00b6 7} Section 6 of the executive-employment agreement set forth various restrictions in place \u201cduring the period in which the Executive is employed by the Company and for five (5) years thereafter\u201d and provided that Barton would not engage in any business that competes with CBIZ BVKT in the seven counties comprising the greater Minneapolis metropolitan area, would not solicit CBIZ BVKT clients, would not induce CBIZ BVKT employees and other individuals to terminate their relationship with the corporation, and would not employ such individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>{\u00b6 8} Section 7 of the executive-employment agreement also prohibited Barton from disclosing at any time \u201cconfidential information,\u201d which was defined to include the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of clients and \u201cqualified prospective clients\u201d and employees\u2019 compensation rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">{\u00b6 9} Remedies for violations were set forth in Section 10 and included a liquidated-damages provision entitling CBIZ BVKT to 100 percent of the gross revenue derived during the two-year period following the violation and also included injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Stelzer\u2019s, Walter\u2019s, and Krier\u2019s Agreements</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">{\u00b6 10} Following the sale of the nonattest accounting services to CBIZ BVKT, Bertram Vallez continued to perform attest accounting services. Bertram Vallez then entered into an administrative services agreement with CBIZ BVKT, wherein it agreed that CBIZ BVKT would provide nonattest accounting services for its clients and Bertram Vallez would provide only attest accounting services and would purchase its professional administrative services from CBIZ BVKT.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">{\u00b6 11} Upon the execution of the agreements described infra, all of Bertram Vallez\u2019s existing employment contracts were terminated. Defendants Stelzer, Walter, and Krier continued to work as at-will employees of CBIZ BVKT. By 2004, CBIZ BVKT informed these employees that they were required to sign a confidentiality-and-nonsolicitation agreement, which prohibited them from soliciting firm clients and employing firm employees. The confidentiality-and-nonsolicitation agreement also contained a liquidated-damages provision entitling CBIZ BVKT to 100 percent of the gross revenue derived during the 24-month period following the violation. It provided that the agreement would be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Ohio and that if disputes arose, the employee would submit to Ohio jurisdiction with venue in Cuyahoga County and would consent to service of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">2005 Merger</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">{\u00b6 12} In 2005, CBIZ BVKT informed defendants that in order to remain in New Hope, Minnesota, Bertram Vallez would be merged into Mayer Hoffman McCann, P.C. (\u201cMHM\u201d), an entity that was also located in New Hope, Minnesota, and also had an administrative-services agreement with CBIZ, under which it provided accounting services under the \u201calternative practice structure.\u201d CBIZ provided personnel to assist with the attest accounting services, and CBIZ performed the nonattest accounting services.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">{\u00b6 13} Bertram Vallez subsequently consented to the merger and terminated its accounting practice. Defendants signed various agreements with MHM and became employees and shareholders of that entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>{\u00b6 14} By late 2007, CBIZ BVKT informed defendants that CBIZ BVKT\u2019s New Hope office was to be consolidated with CBIZ\u2019s office in Minneapolis, Minnesota. On August 1, 2008, defendants resigned from CBIZ BVKT and MHM and formed Barton, Walter <em>&amp; </em>Krier, L.L.C. (\u201cBWK\u201d). On August 2, 2008, under letterhead from the new firm, defendants informed their clients of their resignations, provided them with defendants\u2019 new e-mail addresses and phone numbers, and provided them with form letters for terminating their existing relationship with CBIZ BVKT and MHM and for engaging BWK. On August 2, 2008, defendants contacted some of their former co-workers at the New Hope office and offered them positions with BWK. On August 4, 2008, ten other employees resigned from CBIZ BVKT.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">{\u00b6 15} On August 7, 2008, CBIZ and CBIZ BVKT filed a complaint against defendants<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for breach of the merger agreement, breach of the executive-employment agreement, breach of the confidentiality-and-nonsolicitation agreement, breach of duty of loyalty, and trade-secret misappropriation. On that same day, CBIZ obtained an ex parte temporary restraining order against defendants, which prohibited them from soliciting CBIZ clients or entering into any business that competes with CBIZ in the greater Minneapolis metropolitan area and ordered them to return property and \u201cany information of any sort\u201d to CBIZ.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">{\u00b6 16} The trial court held a consolidated hearing on the preliminary and permanent injunctions on September 4, 2008, per the agreement of the parties. Thereafter, on October 9, 2008, the trial court granted the preliminary and permanent injunctions, concluding that defendants had breached their confidentiality-and-nonsolicitation agreement and that CBIZ was entitled to injunctive relief. The court ordered that for a period of five years from the date of its order, Barton was enjoined from engaging in, promoting, assisting, or consulting with any business that competes with CBIZ; soliciting, attempting to solicit, and calling upon any of CBIZ\u2019s clients or prospective clients; inducing employees, agents, and various others to terminate its relationship with the corporation; and employing those individuals. The remaining defendants were similarly enjoined for a two-year period. The court also concluded that plaintiffs were entitled to attorney fees and costs associated with the injunctive relief and held a hearing as to the issues of contempt of court, attorney fees, and expenses on January 20, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">{\u00b6 17} CBIZ\u2019s claims for money damages proceeded to a jury trial on January 25, 2010. Timothy Talbot, senior managing director of the Minneapolis CBIZ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>office, testified that CBIZ bought the nonattest accounting practice from Bertram Vallez for around $12 million. At that time, Barton signed the merger agreement and the executive-employment agreement, which contained noncompetition and nonsolicitation provisions. The noncompetition term remains in effect for five years after the end of Barton\u2019s employment with CBIZ. The agreements provide for injunctive relief plus damages in the amount of 100 percent of the fees for that client for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">{\u00b6 18} Talbot also established that after CBIZ bought Bertram Vallez, its existing employment contracts were terminated. Defendants Krier, Walter, and Stelzer then worked at CBIZ as at-will employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">{\u00b6 19} Talbot stated that in 2008, CBIZ decided to consolidate MHM with its downtown Minneapolis office. Defendants voiced objections to moving downtown, but after a series of meetings, Talbot believed that they had agreed to do so. On the afternoon of Friday, August 1, 2008, however, each of the defendants had left resignation letters on the keyboard of Talbot\u2019s computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">{\u00b6 20} CBIZ subsequently retained a forensic computer specialist, Mark Lanterman of Computer Forensic Services, who established that defendants had downloaded confidential client information, employee personnel information, templates, and spreadsheets. Eventually, Talbot received disengagement letters from approximately 500 of CBIZ\u2019s former clients. Talbot acknowledged that Bertram Vallez owned client lists and client files before the merger with CBIZ and that after Bertram Vallez\u2019s merger with CBIZ, client lists were openly shared between the two entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">{\u00b621} Michael Gleespen, general counsel for CBIZ, testified that under Minnesota law, it is permissible for CBIZ to provide labor for attest work if the employee remains under the direction and control of a CPA. Further, under Minnesota law, the relationship between the client and the licensee is actually a relationship between the client and the CPA firm, rather than individual accountants. As to confidentiality, Gleespen testified that CBIZ\u2019s information and files were protected by a detailed security policy that employees were required to sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">{\u00b6 22} Gleespen further established that the total average billing for all four defendants was $4,474,275.16 in the years 2006 and 2007. Most of the billing reflects work for nonattest services, rather than for attest services. Gleespen indicated that CBIZ had incurred a $7 million loss due to defendants\u2019 breach of their contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">{\u00b6 23} Lanterman testified to the data analysis performed in this matter. Lanterman analyzed the computer hard drives of computers that defendants used for their competing accounting practice and computers they had used at CBIZ, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>well as other external storage devices. Using the search terms \u201cCBIZ,\u201d \u201cMHM,\u201d \u201cBVKT,\u201d and variations of those terms, Lanterman determined that data had been copied from defendants\u2019 CBIZ computers to other devices and that there had been a mass deletion of information from a CBIZ BVKT computer. Lanterman also established that Computer Forensic Services had billed approximately $600,000 for its work in this matter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">{\u00b6 24} Defendant Stelzer testified on cross-examination that he is a licensed CPA and began work for Bertram Vallez in 1993. After resigning from CBIZ in August 2008, he became the managing partner of defendants\u2019 new firm, BWK. He admitted signing the confidentiality-and-nonsolicitation agreement and that he had solicited clients and employees in violation of that agreement, but he stated that approximately 80 percent of the new firm\u2019s clients were former CBIZ clients and that he continues to perform the same services he had provided for CBIZ.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">{\u00b6 25} Stelzer next stated that he and the defendants did not want to move to the downtown Minneapolis location, but he admitted that he did not inform CBIZ of his intentions. He was also unaware that CBIZ had continued to maintain office space in New Hope for the convenience of clients and workers. Stelzer admitted downloading information, including confidential client and billing information, from the CBIZ computer, but he stated that he had done so on a regular basis during his employment with CBIZ. He stated that under Minnesota law, a licensed CPA\u2019s information is the property of the individual CPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">{\u00b6 26} Defendant Thomas Barton also testified on cross-examination. He admitted that he signed the merger agreement and received $184,000, plus 12,545 shares of CBIZ stock. He later received an additional $112,000 and 6,815 shares of stock. Barton admitted that following his resignation from CBIZ, he solicited CBIZ employees and clients for his new firm, BWK. He has done attest and nonattest work for the clients he solicited.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">{\u00b6 27} Defendant Anthony Krier admitted on cross-examination that he had taken client information to use at BWK, and he admitted that approximately 80 percent of BWK\u2019s clients had been CBIZ clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">{\u00b6 28} Jerome Grisko, president and CEO of CBIZ, Inc., testified that he had served as manager of CBIZ\u2019s New Hope office. This office performs attest and nonattest services, but the client list belongs to CBIZ. In 2007, CBIZ\u2019s New Hope office had the second highest profit margin of all the 27 CBIZ offices. The New Hope office was to be consolidated with a downtown office as part of a larger pattern of consolidating nearby offices with complementary services.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>{\u00b629} Forensic accountant Robert Brlas, of BBP Partners, testified as a valuation expert for CBIZ. Brlas stated that he conducted a liquidated-damages calculation and a lost-profits analysis. Under the liquidated-damages calculation, CBIZ had sustained liquidated damages in the amount of $6,423,955. Under the lost-profits analysis, CBIZ lost $7,255,024 in profits due to the actions of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">{\u00b6 30} For their case, defendants presented testimony, videotaped depositions, and transcripts of depositions. Michael Kohler, CEO of Millstone Systems, Inc., of Golden Valley, Minnesota, testified that Krier had performed chief financial officer (\u201cCFO\u201d) functions for his company and that he had no real relationship with CBIZ. He retained Krier following the split with CBIZ, and he does not want to parse out the attest and nonattest services to different companies. David Gonyea of Gonyea Development also testified that Krier had been his accountant for years.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">{\u00b6 31} Frank Pichelman, president of Ardel Engineering &amp; Manufacturing, likewise testified, via videotaped deposition, that Barton has been his accountant for the last ten years and he selected BWK as his accounting firm. He preferred a suburban company and would not have chosen an accountant located in downtown Minneapolis.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">{\u00b6 32} Greg Evgen, the owner of Regal Machine, Inc., and Advanced Machine Technologies, Inc., and John Timmersman, CEO of Marshall Manufacturing, testified that Barton has been their accountant for many years. Both men hired BWK following Barton\u2019s departure from CBIZ and did not want to go to an accounting practice in downtown Minneapolis.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">{\u00b6 33} Defendant Anthony Krier testified that he is a licensed CPA. According to Krier, the Bertram Vallez firm had a client list, and it created client invoices for its attest work. He further asserted that he did not want to sign the confidentiality-and-nonsolicitation agreement because he received no consideration for it. By the winter of 2004, however, Talbot informed him that he would not receive the rest of his compensation for the year until he signed and returned the confidentiality-and-nonsolicitation agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">{\u00b6 34} Defendant Stelzer testified, with regard to the confidentiality-andnonsolicitation agreement, that Talbot informed him that he would not receive the bonus he earned in 2004 if he did not sign the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">{\u00b6 35} Stelzer further testified that he opposed the move to the Minneapolis office because it would mean more expenses and more competition. He admitted that he and the others solicited their former clients, but he stated that only about 10 percent of BWK\u2019s clients are from CBIZ, but about 71 percent are original customers of Bertram Vallez, and about 19 percent are new clients. After Stelzer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>and the others resigned, they still needed their client papers, which under Minnesota law, belong to the CPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">{\u00b6 36} Kristie Hasselbroek, the bookkeeper for CBIZ who was hired by BWK, testified that after leaving CBIZ, she copied various information folders.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">{\u00b6 37} Lance Bolson, CBIZ\u2019s information and technology officer, and site controller, stated that Barton and Krier met with him in July 2008 and offered him the job of controller if he joined BWK. Bolson submitted a letter of resignation to CBIZ on August 4, 2008. He then used a flash drive to copy all the data from his CBIZ computer. He testified that he believed that the data belonged to the client. He later deleted all the CBIZ information that he had.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">{\u00b6 38} Albert Yondra of PriceWaterhouseCoopers accounting firm provided expert testimony as to the value of the business that CBIZ lost to BWK. Based upon his review of various annual reports and quarterly financial records filed by CBIZ, CBIZ incurred liquidated damages of $1,137,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">{\u00b6 39} Vondra further testified that CBIZ\u2019s valuation expert Brlas\u2019s calculations were erroneous in that they were based upon a five-year projection of increasing revenues, which was out of line with the actual attest revenues and CBIZ\u2019s financial statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">{\u00b6 40} Barton testified that he has been a practicing accountant for 25 years and that clients such as Evgen and Timmersman have been with him for decades. Most of his clients are small-business owners who do not want to hire downtown firms. He further stated that he netted $300,000 after CBIZ purchased the nonattest practice from Bertram Vallez. Following the purchase, both entities used the same client list.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">{\u00b6 41} Barton acknowledged on cross-examination that about 80 percent of his clients are in the seven counties set forth in the noncompetition provision. He also acknowledged that the client-engagement letters that he had used prior to forming BWK indicated that the entities CBIZ BVKT or MHM would be the holder of client information, as opposed to the client\u2019s individual accountant.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">{\u00b6 42} Walter testified that he has been an accountant for over 20 years. He performs attest services and has had long-term clients. With regard to the confidentiality-and-nonsolicitation agreement, he stated that he received no consideration for signing this document and that Talbot informed him that he would not receive the balance of his 2003 earnings until he signed the document. On cross-examination, he admitted to soliciting CBIZ clients after he joined BWK.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">{\u00b6 43} Finally, CBIZ presented rebuttal testimony from Talbot and Grisko in which they indicated that defendants were told that they could rejoin CBIZ, but if they did not do so, the company would do all it could to protect its interests and legal rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>{\u00b6 44} At the close of the evidence, the trial court determined that there was sufficient consideration to support the confidentiality-and-nonsolicitation agreements under either Ohio law or Minnesota law. The court directed a verdict in favor of CBIZ on the breach of contract, and the matter was submitted to the jury on the issue of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">{\u00b6 45} The jury awarded CBIZ actual and liquidated damages totaling $4,450,936 ($1,725,219 against Walter, $940,394 against Stelzer, $1,371,968 against Krier, and $413,355 against Barton). The jury found in favor of defendants on the claims for misappropriation of trade secrets and breach of confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">{\u00b6 46} The trial court additionally concluded that under the terms of the confidentiality-and-nonsolicitation agreement, CBIZ was also entitled to legal fees and costs. Following an evidentiary hearing, May 12, 2010, the trial court ordered Krier, Walter, and Stelzer to pay CBIZ $170,833.89, the attorney fees and costs incurred to the date of the permanent injunction; $154,371.71 for CBIZ\u2019s computer forensic expert, Lanterman, for work performed as of the date of the permanent injunction; and $706,984.36 for CBIZ\u2019s attorney fees and costs incurred from the date of the permanent injunction through the end of the trial. The court additionally ordered that defendants Krier, Walter, and Stelzer pay plaintiffs $88,898.91 for fees and expenses of CBIZ\u2019s co-counsel, John Aisenbrey of Stinson Morrison Hecker, L.L.P. The court ordered that these defendants pay $185,068.57 for other litigation expenses, including court reporters and expert witnesses. Finally, the court awarded CBIZ prejudgment interest, plus interest at the statutory rate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">{\u00b6 47} Defendants now appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">{\u00b6 48} Defendants\u2019 first assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cThe court had no personal jurisdiction over Barton.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">{\u00b6 50} Within this assignment of error, defendants assert that there was no personal jurisdiction over Barton because the noncompetition provision of the merger agreement expired after five years from the date of signing, i.e., on August 20, 2005; the nonsolicitation provision of the merger agreement expired after ten years from the date of signing, i.e., on August 20, 2008; and the forum-selection clause of the executive-employee agreement expired after seven years from the date of signing, i.e., on August 20, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>{\u00b6 51} The merger agreement signed by Barton stated that it was governed by Ohio law and that the \u201cShareholders irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction and venue in Cuyahoga County, Ohio for \u2018any dispute\u2019 arising out of the agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AlZ\">{\u00b6 52} In addition, Barton\u2019s executive-employment agreement stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-4\">Executive hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Ohio, with venue in Cuyahoga County, over any dispute arising out of this Agreement and agrees that all claims in respect of such dispute or proceeding shall be heard and determined in such court. Executive hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which he may have to the venue of any such dispute brought in such court[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">{\u00b6 53} This document indicates, however, that it would be governed by the laws of the state of Minnesota.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">{\u00b6 54} Under the laws of the state of Minnesota, trial courts are vested with discretion to enforce a forum-selection clause, and the court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed unless the clause is so unreasonable that its enforcement would be clearly erroneous and against both logic and the facts on record. <em>C.H.

Personal jurisdiction over Barton was vested in the courts of Cuyahoga County, Ohio under the terms of the agreements that Barton signed on August 20, 1998. Defendants did not present any argument that the agreements were unfair, unreasonable, or unjust. Moreover, the clauses at issue pertain to any dispute arising out of the agreement and are not limited to a specified duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">{\u00b6 57} The first assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">{\u00b6 58} Defendants\u2019 second assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-11\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cKrier, Walter and Stelzer\u2019s confidentiality and nonsolicitation agreements fail for lack of consideration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">{\u00b6 60} Within this assignment of error, defendants maintain that the validity of the confidentiality-and-nonsolicitation agreements must be determined under Minnesota law and that under Minnesota law, noncompetition agreements en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>tered into subsequent to an initial employment contract require independent consideration beyond the mere continuation of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">{\u00b6 61} We review this issue de novo. <em>Stephen Dev. Co. v. Farm Bur. Life Ins. Co. of Michigan </em>(Oct. 30, 2000), Stark App. No. 1999CA00387, 2000 WL 1663596, citing <em>Castlebrook Ltd. v. Dayton Properties Ltd. Partnership </em>(1992), 78 Ohio App.3d 340, 604 N.E.2d 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">{\u00b6 62} As to the choice-of-law issue, we note that Ohio follows the rule that when the parties have specifically designated a forum other than the place of performance, the parties\u2019 choice-of-law provisions are enforceable unless \u201cthe chosen state has no substantial relationship to the parties or the transaction and there is no other reasonable basis for the parties\u2019 choice, or application of the law of the chosen state would be contrary to the fundamental policy of a state having a greater material interest in the issue than the chosen state and such state would be the state of the applicable law in the absence of a choice by the parties.\u201d <em>Schulke Radio Prods., Ltd. v. Midwestern Broadcasting Co. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 436, 453 N.E.2d 683, syllabus.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The <em>Schulke </em>court held that under these circumstances, the correct rule to apply is set forth in the Restatement of Law 2d (1971) 561, Conflict of Laws, Section 187, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">(2) The law of the state chosen by the parties to govern their contractual rights and duties will be applied, even if the particular issue is one which the parties could not have resolved by an explicit provision in their agreement directed to that issue, unless either</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">(a) the chosen state has no substantial relationship to the parties or the transaction and there is no other reasonable basis for the parties\u2019 choice, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">(b) application of the law of the chosen state would be contrary to a fundamental policy of a state which has a materially greater interest than the chosen state in the determination of the particular issue and which, under the rule of \u00a7 188, would be the state of the applicable law in the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">{\u00b6 63} Section 188 enumerates factors that courts should consider in the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties. <em>Ohayon v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Illinois </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 474, 747 N.E.2d 206. Under Section 188, courts should consider (1) the place of contracting, (2) the place of negotiation, (3) the place of performance, (4) the location of the subject matter, and (5) the domicile, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>residence, nationality, place of incorporation, and place of business of the parties. Id. at 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">{\u00b6 64} In this matter, the contracts were negotiated and signed in Minnesota. The place of performance of the contracts is Minnesota. The parent company of CBIZ is located in Ohio, and it appears that many of the agreements governing CBIZ\u2019s relationships are governed by Ohio law. CBIZ BVKT conducts no business in Ohio, but we recognize that pursuant to Restatement of Law 2d (1971) Conflict of Laws, Section 187, Comment f, the state where one of the parties is domiciled or has his principal place of business is sufficient to establish a \u201csubstantial relationship\u201d to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">{\u00b6 65} As to whether application of the law of the chosen state would be contrary to a fundamental policy of a state that has a materially greater interest than the chosen state in the determination of the particular issue, we note that under Minnesota law, noncompetition agreements are \u201c \u2018invalid unless bargained for and supported by adequate consideration.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schmit Towing, Inc. v. Frovik </em>(Nov. 9, 2010), Minn.App. No. A-10-362, 2010 WL 4451572, quoting <em>Sanborn Mfg. Co. v. Currie </em>(Minn.App.1993), 500 N.W.2d 161, 164. In addition, noncompetition agreements entered into subsequent to an initial employment contract require independent consideration. <em>Schmit Towing, </em>citing <em>Overholt Crop Ins. Serv. Co., Inc. v. Bredeson </em>(Minn.App.1989), 437 N.W.2d 698, 702; <em>Medtronic, Inc. v. Hedemark </em>(Mar. 30, 2009), Minn.App. No. A08-0987, 2009 WL 511760; <em>Cook Sign Co. v. Combs </em>(Aug. 26, 2008), Minn.App. No. A07-1907, 2008 WL 3898267. As stated in <em>Schmit Towing, </em>\u201cThe underlying public-policy concern is based on the disparity in bargaining power that exists in an employer-employee relationship[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">{\u00b6 66} Nonetheless, Minnesota courts have found adequate consideration when the employee receives training and support in licensing applications. See <em>Witzke v. Mesabi Rehab. Serv. Inc. </em>(Minn.App.2008), Minn.App. No. A07-0421, 2008 WL 314535.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">{\u00b6 67} In Ohio, however, continued employment is sufficient consideration to enforce a noncompetition agreement entered into after the commencement of an employment relationship. See <em>Lake Land Emp. Group of Akron, L.L.C. v. Columber, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 242, 2004-Ohio-786, 804 N.E.2d 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">{\u00b6 68} We further note, however, that pursuant to Restatement of Law 2d (1971) Conflict of Laws, Section 187, Comment g,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">The forum will not refrain from applying the chosen law merely because this would lead to a different result than would be obtained under the local law of the state of the otherwise applicable law. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>To be \u201cfundamental,\u201d a policy must in any event be a substantial one. * * * a policy of this sort will rarely be found in a requirement, * * *, that relates to formalities (see Illustration 6).[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] Nor is such policy likely to be represented by =i= * * general rules of contract law, such as those concerned with the need for consideration (see Illustration 8).[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] On the other hand, a fundamental policy may be embodied in a statute which makes one or more kinds of contracts illegal or which is designed to protect a person against the oppressive use of superior bargaining power. Statutes involving the rights of an individual insured as against an insurance company are an example of this sort (see \u00a7\u00a7 192-193).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">{\u00b6 69} Applying all the foregoing, we recognize that application of the law of the chosen state, Ohio, differs from the law of Minnesota with regard to the issue of whether independent consideration is required for a noncompetition agreement entered into after the commencement of an employment relationship. However, because Minnesota recognizes the adequacy of consideration when there are advantages available to the employee as the result of the agreement, and in light of the comments and illustrations of Restatement of Law 2d (1971), Conflict of Laws, Section 187, we cannot say that Ohio law is contrary to a fundamental policy of the state of Minnesota. Further, we cannot conclude that Minnesota has a materially greater interest than Ohio in this matter. Therefore, the parties\u2019 choice of Ohio law was properly enforced in this matter and applied to determine the validity of the noncompetition agreements signed by defendants Krier, Walter, and Stelzer.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">{\u00b6 70} This assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">{\u00b6 71} Defendants\u2019 third assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">{\u00b6 72} \u201cThe restrictions on Barton are excessive under Minnesota law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>{\u00b6 73} Within this assignment of error, Barton argues that the five-year time period of the permanent injunction is excessive because, under Minnesota law, noncompetition agreements must not unreasonably restrict the former employee\u2019s ability to earn a living and must be narrowly tailored to fit the employer\u2019s legitimate business interests. According to Barton, five years is excessive under these standards as a matter of law and beyond the time limit set forth in the contract, August 20, 2010. He further maintains that the agreements are ambiguous as to the law to be applied and the duration. He additionally argues that because CBIZ was awarded liquidated damages, it has been adequately compensated, so an injunction is not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">{\u00b6 74} With regard to procedure, we note that the grant or denial of an injunction is solely within the trial court\u2019s discretion and, therefore, a reviewing court should not disturb the judgment of the trial court absent a showing of a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Garono v. State </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 171, 524 N.E.2d 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">{\u00b6 75} The noncompetition provision of the merger agreement stated that it was governed by Ohio law, and the executive-employment agreement, which also contains a noncompetition provision, is governed by the law of Minnesota. Under Ohio law, a noncompete provision will be found to be reasonable when the employer can show by clear and convincing evidence that the restrictions imposed by the noncompete provision (1) are no greater than necessary for the protection of the employer\u2019s legitimate business interests, (2) do not impose undue hardship on the employee, and (3) are not injurious to the public. <em>Brentlinger Ents. v. Curran </em>(2001), 141 Ohio App.3d 640, 752 N.E.2d 994; <em>Ohio Urology, Inc. v. Poll </em>(1991), 72 Ohio App.3d 446, 594 N.E.2d 1027; <em>Levine v. Beckman </em>(1988), 48 Ohio App.3d 24, 548 N.E.2d 267, citing <em>Raimonde v. Van Vlerah </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 21, 325 N.E.2d 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">{\u00b6 76} In Ohio, however, restrictive covenants entered into simultaneously with the sale of a business may be enforced if they are reasonable under the test articulated in <em>Raimonde; </em>see <em>J &amp; B Fleet Indus. Supply, Inc. v. Miller, </em>Mahoning App. No. 09 MA 173, 2011-Ohio-3165, 2011 WL 2536668.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">{\u00b6 77} Under Minnesota law, a noncompetition agreement signed in connection with the sale of a business may be enforced if it does not (1) exceed the protection necessary to secure the good will purchased, (2) place an undue hardship on the covenantor, and (3) have a deleterious effect on the interests of the general public. <em>Sealock v. Petersen </em>(Feb. 5, 2008), Minn.App. No. A06-2479, 2008 WL 314146, citing <em>Bess v. Bothman </em>(Minn.1977), 257 N.W.2d 791, 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">{\u00b6 78} Thus, Ohio and Minnesota apply substantially equivalent tests to evaluate noncompete agreements signed in connection with the sale of a business. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>The court\u2019s conclusions that the covenants are reasonable and necessary, that CBIZ established by clear and convincing evidence that defendants breached their restrictive covenants, that the harm to defendants from the enforcement of the agreements is less than the harm to CBIZ that would result from nonenforcement, and that defendants have alternatives for gainful employment are appropriate and necessary under either the Ohio or Minnesota analysis. We therefore conclude that the trial court did not commit a prejudicial error insofar as it applied Ohio law herein. In any event, even applying Minnesota law, we note that a five-year covenant not to compete that was entered in connection with the sale of a business has been upheld. See <em>Bothman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">{\u00b6 79} Further, as to the claimed ambiguity in the durations set forth in each agreement, we note that the merger agreement prohibited Barton from competing with CBIZ in the seven counties that comprise the greater Minneapolis area for five years from the date of the agreement, or until August 20, 2003, and from soliciting CBIZ clients and employees for ten years from the date of the agreement, or until August 20, 2008, and the executive-employment agreement, signed on August 20, 1998, set forth these restrictions \u201cduring the period in which the Executive is employed by the Company and for five (5) years thereafter[.]\u201d Defendants concede, however, that under Section 9.8 of the merger agreement, the rights and remedies of the merger agreement \u201care cumulative and in addition to all other rights and remedies which may be available}.]\u201d Further, the phrase \u201cduring the period in which the Executive is employed by the Company and for five (5) years thereafter\u201d is not ambiguous in relation to the seven-year \u201cterm\u201d of Barton\u2019s employment, in light of the separate and distinct language used in each provision and the plain meaning of each provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">{\u00b6 80} As to Barton\u2019s additional claim that the trial court erred by awarding both equitable relief and monetary damages, we note that \u201c \u2018equitable relief and damages are not necessarily mutually exclusive remedies.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cynergies Consulting, Inc. v. Wheeler, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 90225, 2008-Ohio-3362, 2008 WL 2623960; <em>Cherne Indus. v. Grounds &amp; Assocs. </em>(Minn.1979), 278 N.W.2d 81. In this matter, the remedies set forth in the agreements included both liquidated damages and equitable relief. This claim is therefore without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">{\u00b6 81} In accordance with all the foregoing, we find no abuse of discretion in connection with the trial court\u2019s permanent injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">{\u00b6 82} The third assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">{\u00b6 83} Defendants\u2019 fourth assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-9\">{\u00b6 84} \u201cLabor for attest services is an attest service.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">{\u00b6 85} Defendants next argue that because CBIZ is not permitted to perform attest accounting services, only nonattest services as a matter of law, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>court erred in enjoining them from performing \u201clabor for attest services.\u201d That is, defendants argue that \u201clabor for attest services\u201d is itself an attest service, which CBIZ is not permitted to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">{\u00b6 86} In this matter, the terms of the administrative-services agreement indicate that CBIZ would provide the staffing and labor necessary for performance of attest accounting services<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that CBIZ would receive 85 percent of the fees earned on attest engagements. There is no indication that CBIZ performs any attest functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">{\u00b6 87} Moreover, the trial court defined \u201cnonattest accounting services\u201d to include \u201clabor for work on attest services performed under the direction of a certified public accountant or registered accounting firm[.]\u201d This comports with the evidence from the permanent-injunction hearing, wherein CBIZ\u2019s general counsel, Gleespen, testified that individuals are not required to be licensed CPAs in order to perform work for certified CPAs on attest services. He stated that under Minnesota law, it is permissible for CBIZ to provide labor for attest work if the employee remains under the direction and control of a CPA. In addition, Talbot testified that CBIZ can employ CPAs to perform accounting work, even though it is not a licensed CPA firm. Further, the evidence indicated that if a CPA was needed for attest work, Bertram Vallez would \u201chave to go to CBIZ and lease that CPA over,\u201d i.e., could provide employees to work with the CPA on the attest work. Therefore, there is no indication that the workers provided by CBIZ are performing any attest functions, and there is competent, credible evidence to support the trial court\u2019s conclusions. <em>Seasons Coal Co. Inc. v. Cleveland </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 80, 461 N.E.2d 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">{\u00b6 88} In accordance with the foregoing, this assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">{\u00b6 89} The fifth assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-9\">{\u00b6 90} \u201cThe trial court committed error in awarding-CBIZ\u2019s attorneys[\u2019] fees and expenses in the amount of $966,717.16 and in imposing it on a joint and several basis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">{\u00b6 91} Here, defendants contend that there is no contractual basis for the award of attorney fees and expenses. They additionally contend that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>court abused its discretion because the award is so high as to \u201cshock the conscience\u201d and that a lower fee is in order under Prof.Cond.R. 1.5, as CBIZ prevailed on only one of its claims for relief, the work of its 16 attorneys was not segregated to delineate work on successful versus unsuccessful claims or duplicative work. Defendants also assert that there is no basis for joint and several liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">{\u00b6 92} With regard to the basis for attorney fees, we note that in defendants\u2019 confidentiality-and-nonsolicitation agreements, defendants agreed to reimburse CBIZ for \u201call expenses, including, without limitation, attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in enforcing the violations of provisions of this Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">{\u00b6 93} As to the reasonableness of the fees, a court\u2019s decision to award fees will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State ex rel.

In the time period preceding the permanent injunction, the amount of the fee was $211,218.32. An additional $120,632.33 was incurred in connection with the motion to show cause. The fees incurred after the permanent-injunction hearing were $713,201.42. After deducting charges solely attributable to the prosecution of claims against Barton, plaintiff sought reimbursement in the amount of $706,984.36. According to Tocco, the fees were reasonable and appropriate under the factors set forth in the Rules of Professional Responsibility and were appropriate for the enforcement of plaintiffs rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">{\u00b6 96} Tocco additionally testified that the $111,524.71 fee bill submitted by co-counsel Aisenbrey of Stinson Morrison Hecker, L.L.P., was reasonable and appropriate under the factors set forth in the Rules of Professional Responsibility. Gleespen, general counsel to CBIZ, testified regarding the additional lit\u00edga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>tion-related expenses that CBIZ incurred additional expenses in this matter, including $149,122 for damages expert Robert Brlas, $14,057.51 for computer expert Brett Harrison, and $11,211 for David Tocco\u2019s expert services.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">{\u00b6 97} The trial court subsequently determined that plaintiffs requested fees in the amount of $706,984.36 and the fee of $88,898.91 for Aisenbrey were reasonable and reasonably related to the enforcement of plaintiffs rights. We find no abuse of discretion. A tremendous amount of work was needed to prosecute CBIZ\u2019s claims for relief, a vast amount of evidence was involved in this case, complex questions were presented, and a great deal of skill was required to achieve a recovery for CBIZ. Further, although CBIZ did not prevail on all its claims for relief, the record indicates that the claims were related and that the same evidence was offered as to each of the claims for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">{\u00b6 98} As to the issue of joint and several liability for the fees, such awards have been ordered when, as here, the defendants act in concert to violate their employer\u2019s restrictive covenants. <em>Huntington Copper Moody &amp; Maguire, Inc. v. Cypert </em>(May 4, 2006), S.D.Ohio No. 1:04-CV-751, 2006 WL 2009847.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">{\u00b6 99} This assignment of error is \"without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">{\u00b6 100} The sixth and seventh assignments of error are interrelated and state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">{\u00b6 101} \u201cThe trial court abused its [sic] erred in ordering Appellants Krier, Walter, and Stelzer jointly liable for expenses incurred by Appellees for expert Lanterman.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-10\">{\u00b6 102} \u201cThe trial court erred in ordering Appellants to pay Lanterman\u2019s fee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">{\u00b6 103} Within these assignments of error, defendants argue that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering them to pay the fees for CBIZ\u2019s forensic expert, Mark Lanterman, because there is no statutory authority for such an award, the fee was unreasonable and excessive, and his billing was inadequate for proper review. Defendants also contend that the award of the Lanterman fee violates the \u201claw of the case\u201d and the doctrine of res judicata since the court initially denied CBIZ\u2019s request for this fee in January 2009, when it totaled $600,721.77, then granted it after trial. Defendants additionally complain that this fee is premised upon CBIZ\u2019s breach-of-trade-secrets and confidentiality claims that the jury rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">{\u00b6 104} As to the basis of the fee, we note that the confidentiality-andnonsolicitation agreements require defendants to reimburse CBIZ for \u201call expenses * * * incurred in enforcing the violations of provisions of this Agreement.\u201d Further, the trial court determined that Lanterman\u2019s \u201cwork was critical to the discovery of\u2019 the full extent of the client data, software, and employee information taken by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>{\u00b6 105} As to the amount of the fee, appellate courts review an award of expert-witness fees under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Vance v. Manon Gen. Hosp., </em>165 Ohio App.3d 615, 2006-Ohio-146, 847 N.E.2d 1229. Here, CBIZ presented evidence at the permanent-injunction hearing that it was reasonable in light of the number of computers and data-storage devices that had to be examined in this matter, as well as the tremendous amount of data that had to be reviewed. The trial court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">{\u00b6 106} Further, as to the argument that the award violated the \u201claw of the case,\u201d we note that there was no action by a reviewing court, and the trial court simply revisited the issue of Lanterman\u2019s fee after the conclusion of the trial on the merits, following its initial consideration of the fee in January 2009, so the trial court\u2019s action is not barred by the law of the case.

Defendants additionally argue that they were entitled to a jury trial on this claim and, because the jury ultimately rendered a defense verdict on this issue, the court\u2019s permanent-injunction findings to the contrary cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">{\u00b6 111} Under the doctrine of res judicata, a valid final judgment rendered upon the merits bars all subsequent actions based upon any claim arising out of transaction or occurrence that was the subject matter of a previous action. <em>Grava v. Parkman Twp. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 379, 653 N.E.2d 226, syllabus. The doctrine is not applied to allow subsequent events to undermine earlier judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>{\u00b6 112} The evidence presented at the hearing on the permanent injunction indicated that CBIZ has an extensive security policy to protect its computer resources, client information, employee policies, and other information. Talbot testified that CBIZ maintains trade secrets and that its client information, employee information, planning, and engagements are confidential. Moreover, Minnesota has sanctioned the alternative-practice structure under which CBIZ holds these documents, and under Minn.Stat. 326A.13, they may be transferred to a \u201cmerged firm or successor in interest to the licensee.\u201d It was also established that defendants downloaded CBIZ files and CBIZ\u2019s Caseware files and forms onto portable storage devices and onto an external hard drive. Over 300,000 files and 2000 tax returns had been copied, and there was a mass deletion of data as well. The record from the permanent-injunction hearing therefore contains competent, credible evidence that defendants took CBIZ\u2019s trade secrets and also spoliated some evidence. The trial court\u2019s findings on the permanent injunction are supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">{\u00b6 113} However, by the time of the jury trial on the claims for damages from these claims for relief, all of CBIZ\u2019s confidential information had been returned, and the jury rendered verdicts for the defendants. The verdicts, which were based upon subsequent events, do not undermine the court\u2019s earlier findings at the permanent-injunction hearing and are supported by competent, credible evidence going to all the essential elements of the case, and are not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">{\u00b6 114} This assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b409-8\">Jones and Gallagher, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-12\">.
