All three charges are felonies of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>third degree. Attorney George Gerken was engaged to represent Johnson in this case. Subsequently, however, appellee, the state of Ohio, filed a motion to disqualify Gerken as defense counsel for Johnson. Appellee asserted that since Gerken would be called as a witness against his client in this cause, he could not act as an advocate for Johnson pursuant to Prof.Cond.R. 3.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">{\u00b6 2} At the hearing on this matter, appellee contended that Gerken had met with the child victim in this case at a Burger King and obtained a written statement from the child that contradicted the statements regarding the alleged sexual abuse that she had made to the police and to the children\u2019s services agency. Appellee therefore claimed that Gerken was an essential witness in this case on the issue of the victim\u2019s credibility. On the other hand, Gerken argued that (1) the child\u2019s mother was present when the child not only made the statement but also wrote it down and therefore the mother could be called as a witness, (2) the victim could be a witness on this issue, (3) the central issue on disqualification was not whether he could testify at trial but whether the evidence was admissible under any other circumstance, (4) appellant was entitled to choice of counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and (5) the prosecutor was required to commit, at the time of the hearing, to calling him as a witness at Johnson\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">{\u00b6 3} In response, the prosecutor admitted that the victim had made the contradictory statements cited by Gerken. She also committed to calling Gerken as a witness at trial to explain the circumstances surrounding the statements and the child\u2019s demeanor in providing these statements. Appellee reiterated that the victim was alone with Gerken when she made these statements. At that point in the hearing, Gerken told the trial judge that he was willing to have the child\u2019s mother testify that she was at the meeting at which the victim made the contradictory statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">{\u00b6 4} The judge then held that the mother\u2019s absence or presence at the meeting between appellant and the victim was not determinative of the question before him. Instead, he found that the fact that Gerken was a potential witness at trial was sufficient to disqualify him from serving as Johnson\u2019s trial counsel. After the court filed its written judgment on this issue, appellant filed a timely notice of appeal. He sets forth the following issues (which we will treat as assignments of error) for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c1. Whether counsel\u2019s proposed testimony as to the authenticity of the executed statement from the alleged victim disqualifies that same counsel from representing Appellant in the related criminal matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-9\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c2. Whether the trial court abused its discretion when disqualifying appellant\u2019s counsel based upon State-Appellee\u2019s contention that counsel is a \u2018necessary\u2019 and \u2018material\u2019 fact witness with respect to the relevant disputed facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>{\u00b6 7} \u201c3. Whether the trial court abused its discretion when disqualifying counsel for Appellant without applying the considerations mandated under Ohio case law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">{\u00b6 8} Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is dispositive of the central issue in this cause. Specifically, appellant argues that the trial court erred in disqualifying counsel without finding that Gerken was a necessary, rather than just a potential, witness at Johnson\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">{\u00b6 9} This court reviews a trial court\u2019s disqualification of counsel under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Clucas v. Vojtech </em>(1997), 119 Ohio App.3d 475, 477, 695 N.E.2d 809. An abuse of discretion is more than an error of judgment; it means that the trial court was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable in its ruling. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">{\u00b6 10} Prof.Cond.R. 3.7 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-8\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(a) A lawyer shall not act as an advocate at a trial in which the lawyer is likely to be a <em>necessary </em>witness unless one or more of the following applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(1) the testimony relates to an uncontested issue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-10\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(2) the testimony relates to the nature and value of legal services rendered in the case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-11\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(3) the disqualification of the lawyer would work substantial hardship on the client.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">{\u00b6 15} Disqualification of a party\u2019s attorney is an extreme measure that should be imposed only when it is absolutely necessary. <em>Akron v. Carter, </em>190 Ohio App.3d 420, 2010-Ohio-5462, 942 N.E.2d 409, \u00b6 19. A party\u2019s simple declaration of an intention to call opposing counsel as a witness at trial is insufficient to establish the necessity for disqualification. Id. at \u00b6 21. Thus, as the movant in the case before us, the state was required to prove that attorney Gerken was a necessary witness. <em>Popa Land Co., Ltd. v. Fragnoli, </em>9th Dist. No. 08CA0062-M, 2009-Ohio-1299, 2009 WL 735969, \u00b6 16. If the evidence that is to be offered by an opposing attorney\u2019s testimony \u201ccan be elicited through other means, then the attorney is not a necessary witness.\u201d <em>Rock v. Sanislo, </em>9th Dist. No. 09CA0031M, 2009-Ohio-6913, 2009 WL 5154889, \u00b6 9. In other words, the attorney must be someone who has relevant, necessary information that no other witness can provide. <em>Popa Land </em>at \u00b6 15. Finally, if the court finds that the testimony of the attorney is necessary, it must then determine whether one of the exceptions in Prof.Cond.R. 3.7 exists. Id. at \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-13\">{\u00b6 16} In the present case, the trial court failed to comply with the test set forth in Prof.Cond.R. 3.7(a) by finding that the fact that attorney Gerken was a potential witness was sufficient to satisfy the rule. Accordingly, the common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>pleas court\u2019s decision to disqualify appellant as Johnson\u2019s attorney was unreasonable, arbitrary, and unconscionable. Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is found well taken. His first and second assignments of error are rendered moot. The judgment of the Wood County Court of Common Pleas is reversed, and this cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this decision. Pursuant to App.R. 24, appellee, the state of Ohio, is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b669-6\">Pietrykowski, J., and Osowik, P.J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
