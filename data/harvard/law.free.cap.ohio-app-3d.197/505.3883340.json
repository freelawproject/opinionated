Williams, appeals from the conviction and sentence imposed for having a weapon under disability. A police officer searching a vehicle in which Williams had been a passenger found a loaded handgun on the floor of the rear seat that Williams had occupied. In four assignments of error, Williams argues that the state employed constitutionally defective prior convictions to demonstrate that he was under a disability and challenges the weight and sufficiency of the evidence adduced to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>establish that he had constructively possessed the handgun. He also asserts, in a single assignment of error, that the sentence imposed was excessive. We find none of the assignments to be meritorious and thus affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">\n<em>I. A Gun on the Car Floor</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">{\u00b6 2} On the evening of September 19, 2010, Ashleigh Schnetzer, the owner of a navy blue, four-door Monte Carlo automobile, picked up her friend, Stephanie Stinespring, and her three-year-old daughter. Stinespring buckled her daughter into a child seat located on the rear passenger\u2019s-side seat. While in Finneytown, Schnetzer asked Williams to accompany the three to meet Stinespring\u2019s boyfriend in Cleves. Williams sat in the rear driver\u2019s-side seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">{\u00b6 3} Officer Matt Pies of the Cleves police department observed Schnetzer\u2019s Monte Carlo stop near a gas station. Several persons were standing near the vehicle. While the individuals continued to talk, Schnetzer parked her vehicle in the gas-station parking lot. Suspecting that a drug sale was occurring, Officer Pies approached. When he reached the vehicle, the adult occupants had already gotten out. Officer Pies asked Schnetzer for permission to search the vehicle, and she gave her consent. The officer quickly discovered a loaded 9-mm Hi Point semiautomatic pistol on the floor of the rear driver\u2019s-side seat that Williams had just vacated. The handgun was found to have been stolen several months before from a Kentucky home.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">{\u00b6 4} Williams was arrested and charged in a three-count indictment with receiving stolen property, carrying a concealed weapon, and having a weapon under a disability. Among other prior convictions, Williams had been twice convicted of misdemeanor marijuana possession. Under R.C. 2923.13(A)(3), the state employed these prior drug convictions to demonstrate that Williams had been under a disability preventing his legal possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">{\u00b6 5} At the conclusion of the bench trial, the trial court found Williams guilty of all three offenses. The court afforded Williams the protections of the multiple-count statute and imposed a single conviction for having a weapon under disability. The trial court ordered a five-year sentence of imprisonment with credit for time already served. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">\n<em>II. Uncounseled Prior Convictions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">{\u00b6 6} Williams raises an initial challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence adduced to support his conviction for having a weapon under disability. He argues that under the rule of <em>State v. Brooke, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 199, 2007-Ohio-1533, 863 N.E.2d 1024, his conviction must be reversed because the state attempted to prove the disability element of the offense by recourse to two prior misdemeanor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>drug convictions that had been obtained without the assistance of counsel. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">{\u00b6 7} R.C. 2923.13(A)(3) provides that no person shall knowingly acquire, have, carry, or use a firearm while under disability. When, as here, the existence of a prior conviction elevates the degree of the crime in question, it \u201ctransforms the crime itself by increasing its degree\u201d and is an essential element of the offense that must be proved by the state. <em>Brooke </em>at \u00b6 8; see also <em>State v. Allen </em>(1987), 29 Ohio St.3d 53, 54, 506 N.E.2d 199 (an element elevates the degree of the offense; an enhancement provision increases only the penalty). Because Williams\u2019s prior drug convictions were an element of the weapon-under-disability offense, the state bore the burden of proving the existence of one of those convictions beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Brooke </em>at \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">{\u00b6 8} The state argues that it discharged that burden. At all times pertinent to Williams\u2019s prosecution, a conviction for misdemeanor drug possession was sufficient to create a disability preventing the legal possession of a firearm. See <em>State v. Robinson, </em>187 Ohio App.3d 253, 2010-Ohio-543, 931 N.E.2d 1110, \u00b6 20. We note that, effective September 30, 2011, R.C. 2923.13(A)(3) now requires that a prior drug conviction be a felony offense to qualify as a disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">{\u00b6 9} At the beginning of this trial, the parties stipulated that Williams had been twice convicted of misdemeanor drug-possession offenses. See former Cincinnati Municipal Code 910-23. Williams\u2019s two prior convictions were memorialized in State\u2019s Exhibit 5: certified copies of the \u201cjudge\u2019s sheets,\u201d one for each conviction. See R.C. 2945.75(B)(1). While Williams stipulated to the existence of the prior convictions, he argued before the trial court, as he argues here, that they were constitutionally defective and thus could not have been used to prove a firearm disability. The trial court, at Williams\u2019s urging, and relying upon the judge\u2019s sheets, took judicial notice that the prior convictions were uncounseled. Nonetheless, the trial court proceeded with the trial and ultimately found that the state had successfully demonstrated the disability element by means of the stipulated misdemeanor drug convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">{\u00b6 10} A defendant may not ordinarily attack past convictions in a subsequent criminal prosecution. See, e.g., <em>State v. Perry </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 226 N.E.2d 104, paragraph nine of the syllabus. But there is a limited right to attack a prior conviction when the state proposes to use that conviction as an element of a subsequent criminal offense. See <em>Brooke, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 199, 2007-Ohio-1533, 863 N.E.2d 1024, at \u00b6 9; see also <em>State v. Culberson </em>(2001), 142 Ohio App.3d 656, 660-661, 756 N.E.2d 734. It is the defendant\u2019s burden to prove a constitutional defect in a prior conviction by a preponderance of the evidence. See R.C. 2945.75(B)(3). If the defendant cannot discharge this burden, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>presume the constitutional regularity of the prior proceeding. See <em>State v. Thompson, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 250, 2009-Ohio-314, 903 N.E.2d 618, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">{\u00b6 11} In <em>Brooke, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court acknowledged that \u201c[a] conviction obtained against a defendant who is without counsel, or its corollary, an uncounseled conviction obtained without a valid waiver of the right to counsel,\u201d is constitutionally defective under the Sixth Amendment. <em>Brooke </em>at \u00b6 9, citing <em>State v. Brandon </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 85, 86, 543 N.E.2d 501, and <em>Nichols v. United States </em>(1994), 511 U.S. 738, 114 S.Ct. 1921, 128 L.Ed.2d 745. But so long as no imprisonment is imposed in a criminal conviction, the constitutional right to counsel does not obtain. See <em>Scott v. Illinois </em>(1979), 440 U.S. 367, 373-374, 99 S.Ct. 1158, 59 L.Ed.2d 383; see also <em>Nichols v. United States, </em>511 U.S. at 746-747, 114 S.Ct. 1921, 128 L.Ed.2d 745. Thus, a prior conviction is constitutionally defective when it results in a sentence of incarceration for a defendant who was unrepresented and did not validly waive his right to an attorney. See <em>Thompson, </em>syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">{\u00b6 12} Here, Williams has failed to carry his burden to prove a constitutional defect by a preponderance of the evidence. Williams was able to establish, by means of the trial court\u2019s judicial notice, only that the prior convictions were obtained without the assistance of counsel. Williams made no showing that he had not validly waived his right to counsel in the prior proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">{\u00b6 13} Even assuming for purposes of argument that the trial court\u2019s judicial notice had subsumed that waiver, we must presume the constitutional regularity of the prior proceedings. Neither of the stipulated judge\u2019s sheets reflects the imposition of a sentence of incarceration. The judge\u2019s sheet, in the case numbered 08CRB-2944, reflects that the trial court had accepted Williams\u2019s guilty plea and had found him guilty. The sentence imposed was a fine of $50 plus costs. In the case numbered 06CRB-12904, also resolved by guilty plea, the only punishment reflected was that the costs of $85 had been remitted. Because the prior convictions did not result in sentences of incarceration for Williams, they were not constitutionally defective. The fifth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">\n<em>III. More Than Mere Proximity to the Gun</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">{\u00b6 14} In three interrelated assignments of error, Williams challenges the weight and sufficiency of the evidence adduced to support his conviction for having a weapon under disability. See R.C. 2923.13(A)(3). \u201cTo \u2018have\u2019 a firearm within the meaning of the weapons-under-a-disability statute, the offender must actually or constructively possess it.\u201d <em>State v. English, </em>1st Dist. No. C-080827, 2010-Ohio-1759, 2010 WL 1631619, \u00b6 31; see also <em>State v. Hankerson </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 87, 434 N.E.2d 1362, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>{\u00b6 15} In <em>State v. Thomas, </em>1st Dist. No. C-020282, 2003-Ohio-1185, 2003 WL 1093938, we summarized that \u201c[(Constructive possession exists when an individual exercises dominion and control over an object, even though that object may not be within his immediate physical possession. The person must be \u2018conscious of the presence of the object.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 9, quoting <em>State v. Hankerson </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 87, 91, 434 N.E.2d 1362. Both dominion and control and whether a person was conscious of the presence of a firearm may be proved by circumstantial evidence. See <em>State v. Trembly </em>(2000), 137 Ohio App.3d 134, 141, 738 N.E.2d 93; see also <em>English, </em>2010-Ohio-1759, 2010 WL 1631619, at \u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">{\u00b6 16} In these assignments of error, Williams argues that the state failed to prove that he had constructively possessed the handgun found on the car floor. Relying upon this court\u2019s 2010 decision in <em>State v. Mitchell, </em>Williams asserts that there was no evidence connecting him to the handgun other than his proximity to it, and that \u201c[p]roximity to an object alone does not constitute constructive possession * * *.\u201d 190 Ohio App.3d 676, 2010-Ohio-5430, 943 N.E.2d 1072, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">{\u00b6 17} Our review of the entire record fails to persuade us that the trial court, acting as the trier of fact, clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the convictions must be reversed and a new trial ordered. See <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541. This is not an \u201cexceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\u201d See <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio-App.3d 172, 175, 485 N.E.2d 717. The state adduced ample evidence that Williams had constructively possessed the handgun. Our holding in <em>Mitchell </em>is readily distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">{\u00b6 18} In <em>Mitchell, </em>we reversed the marijuana-possession conviction of the accused, a passenger in the back seat of a car stopped by police. The driver and front-seat passenger each fled when their vehicle was stopped and \u201cwere not questioned about the marijuana.\u201d 190 Ohio App.3d 676, 2010-Ohio-5430, 943 N.E.2d 1072, at \u00b6 3. Officers discovered marijuana in the backseat pocket only inches from Mitchell\u2019s seat. Mitchell denied any knowledge of the marijuana. See <em>id. </em>at \u00b6 2. Noting the absence of other evidence and that others in the vehicle could have had access to the seat pocket, we concluded that the state had failed to prove constructive possession. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">{\u00b6 19} As in <em>State v. Mitchell, </em>here, the contraband \u2014 a loaded handgun \u2014 had been found within inches of where the accused had been sitting. Williams admitted sitting in the rear driver\u2019s-side seat before exiting the vehicle. As had Mitchell, Williams denied any knowledge of how the contraband came to be located at his feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">{\u00b6 20} But unlike in <em>State v. Mitchell, </em>this was not the entirety of the state\u2019s evidence. First, the other adult occupants of the vehicle testified at trial. Both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>denied that the gun was theirs. The driver-owner, Schnetzer, stated that the gun had not been in the vehicle before she had stopped for Williams. Before Schnetzer picked Williams up, the front-seat passenger, Stinespring, had spent two or three minutes in the back of the vehicle strapping her daughter into a car seat. She testified that she had not seen the gun on the floor during those minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">{\u00b6 21} Yet when the arresting officer looked into the back seat of the car after the group was stopped in Cleves, he spotted the handgun almost immediately. \u201cAs soon as I kneeled down [outside the rear driver\u2019s-side door],\u201d Officer Pies testified that he \u201ccould see the black chunky grip and the back of the slide of [the Hi Point].\u201d The officer did not have to move the seat forward to observe the gun, which was only partially obscured by the driver\u2019s seat. ' The weapon\u2019s presence on the floor, barrel facing forward, readily visible from the doorway, indicates that it had been hastily placed on the floor sometime after Stinespring had placed her child in the car seat. See <em>State v. Berger </em>(Feb. 19, 1998), 8th Dist. No. 71618, 1998 WL 72515.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">{\u00b6 22} Moreover, both Schnetzer and Officer Pies testified that a lip on the car floor beneath the driver\u2019s seat would have prevented the driver from sliding the handgun under her seat to its final, exposed position at Williams\u2019s feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">{\u00b6 23} Thus, the state adduced evidence that the handgun had not been in the car before Williams had joined the other occupants, that Williams had had physical control over the area where the handgun was found, and that the other adult occupants had not had ready access to that area thereafter. While mere presence near a firearm does not establish constructive possession, presence coupled with these facts probative of dominion, control, and consciousness of presence can. See Thomas, 2003-Ohio-1185, 2003 WL 1093938, at \u00b6 13; see also <em>State v. Priest, </em>2nd Dist. No. 24225, 2011-Ohio-4694, 2011 WL 4337156, \u00b643.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">{\u00b6 24} During the cross-examination of Williams, the state introduced evidence that Williams had been convicted the year before of carrying a concealed weapon, also a 9-mm Hi Point pistol. The trial court stated that it employed that evidence for the purpose of evaluating Williams\u2019s credibility and his character for truthfulness. See Evid.R. 609; see also <em>State v. Post </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 380, 384, 513 N.E.2d 754. Because the weight to be given to the evidence in this case and to the credibility of the witnesses was for the trier of fact to determine, the trial court was entitled to believe Schnetzer\u2019s, Stinespring\u2019s, and Officer Pies\u2019s testimony and to reject Williams\u2019s contention that the gun was not his and that his feet were too big to have permitted him to place the gun on the car floor. See <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus. The second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>{\u00b6 25} When reviewing the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction, we must examine the evidence admitted at trial in the light most favorable to the prosecution and determine whether the evidence could have convinced any rational trier of fact that the essential elements of the crime were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State v. Conway, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 214, 2006-Ohio-791, 842 N.E.2d 996, \u00b6 36; see also <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560. In deciding whether the evidence was sufficient, we neither resolve evidentiary conflicts nor assess the credibility of the witnesses, as both are functions reserved for the trier of fact. See <em>State v. Willard </em>(2001), 144 Ohio App.3d 767, 777-778, 761 N.E.2d 688; see also <em>State v. Campbell, </em>195 Ohio App.3d 9, 2011-Ohio-3458, 958 N.E.2d 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">{\u00b6 26} Here, the record reflects substantial, credible evidence from which the trier of fact could have reasonably concluded that all elements of the charged crime had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, including that Williams had constructively possessed the handgun. See <em>Thomas, </em>2003-Ohio-1185, 2003 WL 1093938, at \u00b6 13; see also <em>Conway </em>at \u00b6 36. The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">{\u00b6 27} Moreover, the trial court also could have properly denied Williams\u2019 motion for judgment of acquittal, as reasonable minds could have reached different conclusions as to whether each element of the crime charged had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. See Crim.R. 29; see also <em>State v. Bridgeman </em>(1978), 55 Ohio St.2d 261, 381 N.E.2d 184. The third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">{\u00b6 28} We note that in these three assignments of error, Williams also argues that the trial court erred in finding him guilty of receiving stolen property and carrying a concealed weapon. Although it entered findings of guilt as to each offense, the trial court did not impose a sentence for them. Thus, it has not entered a judgment of conviction as to these offenses. See Crim.R. 32(C); see also <em>State v. Whitfield, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 319, 2010-Ohio-2, 922 N.E.2d 182, \u00b6 12 (\u201ca \u2018conviction\u2019 consists of a guilty verdict <em>and </em>the imposition of a sentence or penalty\u201d). Although the resolution of the possession issue is factually germane to each of the three offenses, we possess the authority to affirm, reverse, or modify only the trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction entered on the having-a-weapon offense. See <em>State v. Baker, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 197, 2008-Ohio-3330, 893 N.E.2d 163, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">\n<em>TV. The Sentence Was Not Excessive</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ARD\">{\u00b6 29} Finally, Williams argues that the trial court erred in'imposing an excessive sentence. After affording Williams the protections of the multiple-count statute and not imposing sentences for the receiving-stolen-property and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>the carrying-a-concealed-weapon offenses, the trial court imposed a single, five-year sentence of imprisonment for the weapon-under-disability offense. The sentence imposed was not contrary to law. See <em>State v. Kalish, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 23, 2008-Ohio-4912, 896 N.E.2d 124, \u00b6 14. It was within the statutory range specified for a third-degree felony under R.C. 2929.14(A)(3). In light of the seriousness of the offense, Williams\u2019s criminal record, and the fact that Williams had been on community control for a previous carrying-a-concealed-weapon conviction when Officer Pies apprehended him, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in imposing sentence. See <em>Kalish </em>at \u00b6 17. The fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">{\u00b6 30} Therefore, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b548-7\">Sundermann, P.J., and Fischer, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
