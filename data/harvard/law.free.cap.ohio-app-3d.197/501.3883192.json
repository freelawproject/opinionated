Attempts were made to locate the defendant by Clark County Sheriffs Deputies as well as the Adult Parole Authority. It was determined that he was <em>not living at his registered offense. </em>The defendant was required to register from a conviction in Clark County Common Pleas Case No. 06-CR-334 for unlawful sexual conduct with a minor a felony of the Fourth Degree.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-15\">{\u00b6 7} On the morning his trial was scheduled to begin, February 11, 2011, defendant filed a motion to dismiss the case against him, contending that \u201cthe indictment does not charge an offense and, therefore, does not invoke the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>jurisdiction of the court. Further, the indictment does not set forth a mental state as required by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">{\u00b6 8} The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion and dismissed the indictment against him. The court found that the indictment is deficient because it \u201cdoes not specify whether [the address to which it refers] is \u2018residence address,\u2019 \u2018school address,\u2019 \u2018institution of higher learning address,\u2019 or \u2018place of employment address.\u2019 \u201d The court further found that the bill of particulars fails to cure the deficiency \u201cbecause it stated \u2018address\u2019 only and did not specify \u2018residence address.\u2019 \u201d Accordingly, the court dismissed the indictment for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">{\u00b6 9} The state filed a timely notice of appeal from the final order dismissing the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe trial court erred in finding that the language contained in the indictment was insufficient [sic] charge the offense of failure to register a change of address in violation of R.C. 2950.05(F).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">{\u00b6 11} The indictment charges that defendant failed to notify a sheriff of a change of address in violation of R.C. 2950.05(A) and (F). R.C. 2950.05(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cIf an offender * * * is required to register pursuant to division (A)(2), (3), or (4) of section 2950.04 or 2950.041 of the Revised Code, * * * the offender * * * shall provide notice of any change of residence, school, institution of higher education, or place of employment address, to the sheriff with whom the offender * * * most recently registered the address under division (A)(2), (3), or (4) of section 2950.04 or 2950.041 of the Revised Code or under division (B) of this section. * * * [T]he offender * * * shall provide the written notice at least twenty days prior to changing the address of the residence, school, or institution of higher education and not later than three days after changing the address of the place of employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">{\u00b6 13} R.C. 2950.05(F)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-13\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cNo person who is required to notify a sheriff of a change of address pursuant to division (A) of this section * * * shall fail to notify the appropriate sheriff in accordance with that division.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-14\">{\u00b6 15} The trial court adopted defendant\u2019s argument and dismissed the indictment for lack of jurisdiction, on a finding that the defect in the indictment that the court identified resulted in a failure to charge a criminal offense. The state argues that the trial court erred, relying on <em>State v. Buehner, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 403, 2006-Ohio-4707, 853 N.E.2d 1162. The question in <em>Buehner </em>was whether an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>omission in an indictment deprived the defendant of notice of the charge against him that due process of law requires, not whether the omission deprived the court of jurisdiction for failure to charge a criminal offense. Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment argued a lack of jurisdiction, not a due-process defect. The trial court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Therefore, we confine our consideration of the error assigned to the issue of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cJurisdiction\u201d means the court\u2019s statutory and constitutional power to adjudicate a case. <em>State ex rel. Ohio Democratic Party v. Blackwell, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 246, 2006-Ohio-5202, 855 N.E.2d 1188. Jurisdiction is complete when the subject matter of an action and the parties to an action are properly before the court. <em>State ex rel. Baker v. Toledo State Hosp. </em>(1951), 88 Ohio App. 345, 100 N.E.2d 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">{\u00b6 17} Defendant was arrested on a warrant issued on the indictment and, following his arraignment, was properly before the court. The courts of common pleas have such subject-matter jurisdiction as is provided by law. Section 4(B), Article III, Ohio Constitution. The court of common pleas has general jurisdiction over all crimes and offenses, except in cases of minor misdemeanors. R.C. 2931.03. An indictment is sufficient to charge an offense if it charges an offense in the words of the statute concerned. Crim.R. 7(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">{\u00b6 18} The trial court reasoned that the indictment fails to charge a violation of R.C. 2950.05(F), which prohibits a failure to comply with the notification duty that R.C. 2950.05(A) imposes, because the indictment does not specify which of the classes of addresses in R.C. 2950.05(A) defendant\u2019s failure to notify involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">{\u00b6 19} R.C. 2950.05(A) creates no criminal liability for a failure to perform the duty that section imposes. Criminal liability is instead imposed by R.C. 2950.05(F). It was sufficient to create jurisdiction in the court of common pleas pursuant to R.C. 2931.03 that the indictment charged a violation of R.C. 2950.05(F) in the terms of that section, which refers to R.C. 2950.05(A) by section number and not with respect to any of the four particular classes of address in R.C. 2950.05(A) that an accused\u2019s failure to notify involved. The indictment satisfied that requirement. Therefore, the court did not lack jurisdiction to determine the charges against defendant that the indictment alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">{\u00b6 20} The assignment of error is sustained. The judgment of the trial court will be reversed and the case will be remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b538-11\">Donovan and Hall, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
