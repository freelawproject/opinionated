Swiergosz, appeals his convictions for three counts of kidnapping, two counts of rape, aggravated burglary, felonious assault, and having a weapon while under a disability. The Lucas County Court of Common Pleas entered a judgment of sentence on these convictions on February 10, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">{\u00b6 2} The core facts from the trial record are undisputed. In the early morning of April 28, 2009, Swiergosz broke into a friend\u2019s home in Wood County and stole two firearms. One was a Glock semi-automatic pistol loaded with a full magazine, and the other a revolver, later determined to be inoperable. He then drove to his wife\u2019s place of employment in the village of Ottawa Hills, a retirement community-home known as Sunset House. An acrimonious divorce was underway, and Swiergosz\u2019s wife, Barb, had recently left their home with the couple\u2019s four children. Swiergosz entered Sunset House armed with the Glock pistol and a zippered duffel bag containing a hatchet, three rolls of masking tape, scissors, a tire iron, and the revolver. He immediately went to the office of Marilyn Sharkey, one of Barb\u2019s co-workers. Sharkey testified that Swiergosz brandished the Glock and told her he would not kill her if she cooperated. Then he ordered her to call Barb to the office. Hearing footsteps near the door, he reached for the tire iron.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>{\u00b6 3} When Barb appeared Swiergosz struck her twice on the head with the tire iron, causing a scalp laceration that bled profusely. Sharkey fled the room as Barb began screaming, and though Barb also started to run, Swiergosz caught her and pulled her into another room. He closed the door and told her to remove her clothes. After she did so, he bound her hands behind her with the tape. From there Swiergosz moved her to a different room with a bed and a bathroom. He testified that he only wanted to talk, but after getting Barb on the bed he removed his clothes and unsuccessfully attempted intercourse. They then went into the bathroom. Swiergosz made Barb sit on the toilet, still bound, and engage briefly in oral sex. But he quickly returned her to the bed where, she testified, forcible intercourse occurred. Shortly afterward, Swiergosz contacted the police by cell phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">{\u00b6 4} The record indicates that over 50 officers from three jurisdictions responded to Sunset House and its adjoining grounds. Once the officers determined that Swiergosz was armed and holding Barb hostage and had apparently barricaded himself in one of the rooms, they placed two nearby high schools on lock-down. The residents at Sunset House were evacuated, and additional police units were summoned, including a SWAT team. Although Swiergosz would occasionally speak by cell phone to a sergeant he knew from the Lucas County Sheriffs Office, he kept the officers at bay for approximately six hours. Eventually, Swiergosz released Barb and then surrendered without further incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">{\u00b6 5} On May 8, 2009, the Lucas County Grand Jury returned a nine-count indictment against Swiergosz.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Before trial, a nolle prosequi was entered on one count of felony intimidation. On January 26, 2010, trial began on the remaining charges, and the jury heard two days of testimony from nine witnesses, including Swiergosz, who testified twice in his own defense. In his first direct testimony, Swiergosz described the estranged relationship with his wife and several incidents that occurred between them in the months preceding his arrival at Sunset House. He was aware that she had a protection order against him with a no-contact provision, but he went there anyway. In the ongoing divorce, he \u201cfelt that [his] children were being harmed\u201d by her actions and that he \u201cdidn\u2019t have any other options.\u201d During cross-examination, he claimed he had not intended to hurt anyone with the weapons he brought into Sunset House; rather, he went there for the \u201csingular purpose\u201d of obtaining answers from his wife. He referred to the Glock as \u201can attention getter.\u201d He denied that Barb was ever frightened, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>insisting their intercourse had been consensual. He admitted hitting her with the tire iron \u201cbecause [he] needed to talk to her [and] wasn\u2019t able to talk to her in any other way.\u201d He also admitted pleading guilty to an earlier felonious-assault charge involving her.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury found Swiergosz guilty of all the charges, and he was sentenced to an aggregate prison term of 44 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">{\u00b6 6} Swiergosz now assigns four errors for our review. The first assigned error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">Mr. Swiergosz was deprived of his right to a fair trial, guaranteed by the Constitutions of the United States and the State of Ohio, through prosecutorial misconduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">{\u00b6 7} For prosecutorial misconduct, the essential question is whether the behavior complained of deprived the defendant of a fair trial based on the entire record. <em>State v. Fears, </em>86 Ohio St.3d 329, 332, 715 N.E.2d 136 (1999); <em>State v. Maurer, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 239, 266, 473 N.E.2d 768 (1984). In reviewing the alleged misconduct, we look to whether the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, questions, or behavior were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>State v. Smith, </em>14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14-15, 470 N.E.2d 883 (1984). \u201c[T]he touchstone of analysis \u2018is the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Hanna, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 285, 2002-Ohio-2221, 767 N.E.2d 678, \u00b6 61, quoting <em>Smith v. Phillips, </em>455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982). Improper comments or questions will not be the basis for reversal if it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have found the defendant guilty even without them. <em>State v. LaMar, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-0hio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, \u00b6 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">{\u00b6 8} In support of this assignment, Swiergosz argues that the prosecutor made \u201cinappropriate comments\u201d during cross-examination that suggested \u201cthe jury need not deliberate\u201d on those charges for which he was essentially admitting the facts and therefore his guilt. In particular, Swiergosz complains that the following exchange was prejudicial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-9\">Q. Now * * * it\u2019s almost like when you were being asked questions [on direct examination] and you admitted that you pled guilty to the Wood County charge and you pled guilty to the other felonious assault charge and you said you did that because you had done those things; right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-10\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Q. Any of the charges that you\u2019re facing here that you\u2019re guilty of in your mind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-5\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">Q. Like what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">A. The word \u2014 the felonious assault. I did strike my wife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-8\">Q. Okay. So you heard during voir dire how each offense is broken down into what we call elements that have to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-10\">Q. And I said to the jury that their job is to decide the essential disputed questions of fact and that maybe not every fact would be in dispute. So you admit that you did cause physical harm to your wife that day; right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-12\">Q. So they don\u2019t even have to worry about that offense; right? I mean, they can just write guilty? They don\u2019t have to debate it because you\u2019re admitting to it; right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-13\">A. I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-14\">Q. Now, another thing that you\u2019re charged with are these firearm specifications that say that you had a firearm on or about your person or under your control. And you have \u2014 and we\u2019ll talk about what a firearm is. But you\u2019re not denying you had that gun; right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-15\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-16\">Q. It was on your person; yes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-17\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-18\">Q. It was under your control; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-19\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-20\">Q. And you had it while you were committing the felonious assault, which is a felony offense; right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-21\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-22\">Q. And you\u2019ve stipulated that the Glock worked, it could fire a projectile, so that means it\u2019s operable. So you\u2019re also guilty of each of those firearm specifications; agreed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-23\">A. I did not stipulate that it worked. I never fired that gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-24\">Q. No. The question is the jury has to determine whether that firearm was operable, whether it could have fired a bullet. And you stipulated to the admissibility of the TPD test-fire report that said yes, this gun works, all right, so they don\u2019t have to \u2014 that\u2019s not [a] disputed question of fact; is it? They can just write guilty on those firearm specifications because you admit that; right? I mean you want to be honest about the things you did, don\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>A. Sir, I don\u2019t know the law, but if what the specification is attached to, if I didn\u2019t do it there wouldn\u2019t be a firearm spec to that. I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">Q. Is that your way of saying yeah, you had a working handgun and you don\u2019t deny it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">A. I\u2019ve answered that several times, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">{\u00b6 9} The prosecutor similarly questioned Swiergosz about having the Glock with him at Sunset House in relation to the separate weapons-disability charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">Q. Okay. Now, you\u2019re also charged with having weapons under a disability, which means you had a working handgun and at the time that you possessed it you were under indictment for a felony offense and that would be the felonious assault charge of March 10th; right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-9\">A. [Nodding].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-10\">Q. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-12\">Q. And so you admit that you\u2019re guilty of that offense too, don\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-13\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-14\">Q. So these folks don\u2019t have to spend any time, they can just go in, sign that verdict form as guilty; right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-15\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-16\">{\u00b6 10} Defense counsel did not object to these questions. This forfeits all but plain error under Crim.R. 52(B). <em>Hanna, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 285, 2002-Ohio-2221, 767 N.E.2d 678, at \u00b6 77. Swiergosz, however, has not bothered to argue that the questioning was plain error. Instead, his appellate brief simply asserts that \u201ccoercing admissionfs] from the unwitting defendant\u201d during cross-examination constituted the misconduct. He then speculates how the jury might have decided these charges without such questioning. Regardless, for there to be \u201cplain error,\u201d there first must be error and, second, the error must be \u201cobvious.\u201d <em>State v. Payne, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 502, 2007-Ohio-4642, 873 N.E.2d 306, \u00b6 16. Neither is present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-17\">{\u00b6 11} In voluntarily taking the stand twice, Swiergosz waived his right against self-incrimination and subjected himself to proper cross-examination. <em>State v. Roten, </em>149 Ohio App.3d 182, 2002-Ohio-4488, 776 N.E.2d 551, \u00b6 12. There is no basis for predicating error on a robust or even rough cross-examination if the prosecutor\u2019s questioning is otherwise within the scope of what is permitted. <em>See </em>Evid.R. 611(B); <em>State v. Smith, </em>80 Ohio St.3d 89, 111, 684 N.E.2d 668 (1997); <em>see also State v. Jones, </em>2d Dist. No. 20349, 2005-Ohio-1208, 2005 WL 628233, \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>{\u00b6 12} The prosecutor\u2019s initial questioning focused on facts that Swiergosz had already testified to, or admitted, on direct examination, such as the Wood County burglary and the March 2009 shooting incident. <em>See Smith </em>at 111. The questions were plainly intended to clarify which elements of the crimes he was not disputing. Frankly, the questions asked were neither particularly aggressive nor unfair, given what Swiergosz said during his direct testimony: he admitted striking his wife; he acknowledged having the dock on him while committing that crime; and he conceded being armed while under indictment for shooting at her six weeks earlier. The jury simply took him at his word.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">{\u00b6 13} In arguing that these lines of cross-examination prejudiced him, Swiergosz cites <em>State v. Durnwald, </em>163 Ohio App.3d 361, 2005-Ohio-4867, 837 N.E.2d 1234. <em>Dumwald,, </em>however, actually supports the state\u2019s position. There, we rejected a defendant\u2019s attempt to predicate reversible error on the prosecutor\u2019s in-court request that he \u201cdemonstrate his ability to perform the one-leg [field sobriety] test,\u201d because that request was <em>\u201cin response to appellant\u2019s comment </em>that he would do as well in court as he had on the night of his arrest.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 55. In other words, where the defendant in his direct testimony opens the door with assertions or even concessions that are reasonably likely to invite queries on cross-examination, he can hardly complain when the prosecutor accepts that invitation and comes through the door. <em>State v. Bennett, </em>2d Dist. No. 15854, 1997 WL 282314 (May 30, 1997), citing <em>State v. Pollard, </em>21 Ohio St.2d 171, 174, 256 N.E.2d 620 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">{\u00b6 14} Here, the prosecutor was not \u2014 as in the classic misconduct scenario\u2014 injecting his personal opinion about Swiergosz\u2019s guilt during closing argument. We note that the phraseology of the questions asked on cross-examination did not recur in the prosecutor\u2019s closing statements. But even if we assume that there was error in allowing some questions, or assume that some were improper in their form, such error was cured when the trial court instructed the jury on the state\u2019s duty to prove all elements of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt and then gave the specific charge defining reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Lundgren, </em>73 Ohio St.3d 474, 484, 653 N.E.2d 304 (1995) (\u201cthe court\u2019s reasonable-doubt instructions negated any misconception by the jury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">{\u00b6 15} For another reason, however, that does not end the analysis. After leaving the stand following this cross-examination, Swiergosz complained to the court in chambers that his attorney\u2019s initial questioning was too limited. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>jury, he insisted, had not \u201cheard the whole story\u201d, about a litany of matters relevant to his defense, all occurring before his crimes at Sunset House. He prevailed on the court to allow him to retake the stand for yet more testimony. Predictably, the prosecutor had no objection. What then followed was a long and emotional monologue to the jury in which Swiergosz discussed his gambling addiction, his failed mortgage business, the couple\u2019s personal finances, the foreclosure of their home, his relationship with his children, his in-laws, the protection order against him, how Barb \u201cused sex as a weapon,\u201d and the effect of the pending divorce on his mental state. There were bitter recriminations involving the draining of bank accounts and Barb hiding cash she received at her baby shower. He claimed she was mentally abusing the children. The March 10 shooting, he told the jury, was prompted by Barb\u2019s desire to reclaim the family van from their home. The van was titled in his name, but she had always used it. With a pistol tucked inside his waistband for deterrence, he confronted Barb in the driveway. Immediate possession was disputed. He said, \u201cI\u2019m taking the van.\u201d She yelled, \u201cYou\u2019re not getting the van,\u201d and she then ran toward it. Shots were fired twice. Barb was neither fearful for her safety nor deterred, Swiergosz explained, for despite the gunfire and some shoving and kicking at the driver\u2019s side door, she got in the van anyway. Barb\u2019s kick to his face had \u201cloosened a tooth,\u201d so he punched hers in return. At that point, a standoff ensued \u2014 he holding the gun out, she in the driver\u2019s seat glaring back. As police arrived, he retreated into the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">{\u00b6 16} To this lengthy narrative there was, predictably, no objection. When it concluded, the prosecutor rose and asked but two innocuous questions. Neither repeated anything asked in the first cross-examination. On this record, the resolution suggests itself: whatever error might have occurred during Swiergosz\u2019s first visit to the witness stand was certainly remediated by his second visit. Moreover, having failed to identify any \u201cobvious error,\u201d Swiergosz cannot reach the final requirement for plain error, <em>i.e., </em>showing prejudice to a substantial right that is outcome determinative. <em>State v. Gardner, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 420, 2008-Ohio-2787, 889 N.E.2d 995, \u00b6 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">{\u00b6 17} Accordingly, the first assigned error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">{\u00b6 18} The second assigned error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">Mr. Swiergosz was denied the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">{\u00b6 19} In this assignment, Swiergosz argues, in two parts, that defense counsel\u2019s failure to file pretrial motions in limine against certain evidence in the state\u2019s case-in-chief demonstrates that counsel was ineffective. In the first part, he maintains that his counsel erred in not moving to exclude evidence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>March 10 incident. He argues that it was \u201cextrinsic to the operative facts of the underlying charge\u201d at trial and was purely \u201cother-acts evidence\u201d for which no exception applied under Evid.R. 404(B). In the second part, citing Evid.R. 403(A), he argues that counsel should have moved to exclude testimony about the school lockdowns and the call-out of the SWAT team to Sunset House. This testimony, he urges, was irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial. We find both arguments unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">{\u00b6 20} A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is evaluated under the deficiency standard set forth in <em>State v. Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989), paragraphs two and three of the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">2. Counsel\u2019s performance will not be deemed ineffective unless and until counsel\u2019s performance is proved to have fallen below an objective standard of reasonable representation and, in addition, prejudice arises from counsel\u2019s performance. <em>(State v. Lytle </em>[1976], 48 Ohio St.2d 391, 358 N.E.2d 623; <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>[1984], 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, followed.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">3. To show that a defendant has been prejudiced by counsel\u2019s deficient performance, the defendant must prove that there exists a reasonable probability that, were it not for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the trial would have been different.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">{\u00b6 21} In Ohio, a licensed attorney is presumed competent. <em>State v. Gondor, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, 860 N.E.2d 77, \u00b6 62. As an initial matter, defense counsel is not obligated to file every possible pretrial motion, nor to cross-examine every witness the prosecution calls, nor to object to every question asked the defendant if he testifies in his own defense. <em>State v. Otte, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 555, 565, 660 N.E.2d 711 (1996). All such decisions fall within the ambit of trial strategy, and even debatable tactics or maneuvers do not demonstrate ineffectiveness. <em>State v. Barnhart, </em>6th Dist. No. H-10-005, 2011-Ohio-2693, 2011 WL 2174989, \u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">{\u00b6 22} Second, a motion in limine functions as a precautionary device to avoid error, prejudice, and possibly a mistrial by prohibiting opposing counsel from raising or making reference to an evidentiary issue until the trial court is better able to rule upon its admissibility * * * once the trial has commenced. <em>State v. Grubb, </em>28 Ohio St.3d 199, 201, 503 N.E.2d 142 (1986). The propriety of moving in-limine is both issue and fact dependent and will necessarily differ from case to case. There can be no bright-line rule that signals when failing to file such a motion is per se ineffective lawyering. In the context of overall trial strategy, the decision is a matter committed to counsel\u2019s professional judgment. Counsel\u2019s only duty is to make his own appraisal of the case and then decide when \u2014 or <em>if </em>\u2014 such a motion is worth filing. <em>State v. Vires, </em>25 Ohio App.2d 70, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>266 N.E.2d 245 (1970). Given the tentative and interlocutory nature of all inlimine motions, an ineffective-assistance claim based on the decision not to file one bears a stringent burden of demonstrating prejudice. <em>State v. Toney, </em>9th Dist. No. 04CA0013, 2004-Ohio-4877, 2004 WL 2050502, \u00b6 13; <em>State v. Giddens, </em>3d Dist. No. 1-02-52, 2002-Ohio-6148, 2002 WL 31525379, \u00b6 29-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">{\u00b6 23} Swiergosz\u2019s claim that any reference to the March 10 shooting was excludable under Evid.R. 404(B) is plainly untenable. It was not offered \u201cto prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith.\u201d Typically, under this rule, the issue is whether the testimony is offered to show, or tends to show, motive, opportunity, plan, or intent. If so, it is admissible. But the enumerated purposes in Evid.R. 404(B) do not exhaust the reasons for admitting other-acts evidence. When the act comprising the other-act evidence is itself criminal conduct that is \u201cso blended or connected with the act on trial\u201d that proving the former is logically required \u201cto prove an element of the crime charged,\u201d it is admissible. <em>State v. Hernandez, </em>6th Dist. No. L-06-1388, 2009-Ohio-386, <em>2009 WL </em>223882, \u00b6 32, citing <em>State v. Roe, </em>41 Ohio St.3d 18, 23-24, 535 N.E.2d 1351 (1989); <em>State v. Smith, </em>49 Ohio St.3d 137, 139-140, 551 N.E.2d 190 (1990); <em>State v. Watson, 28 </em>Ohio St.2d 15, 21, 275 N.E.2d 153 (1971) (other-acts evidence may be used to establish possession of a weapon, when possession of a weapon is an element of the crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">{\u00b6 24} Given that Swiergosz was charged with the offense of having a weapon while under a disability in violation of R.C. 2923.13, the state had to prove the necessary \u201cdisability\u201d element. When Swiergosz armed himself with the Glock on April 28, 2009, before heading to Sunset House, that disability consisted of being under indictment for the felonious assault of March 10, 2009. <em>See </em>R.C. 2923.13(A)(2). Hence, proof of the disability did not constitute improper propensity evidence \u2014 notwithstanding that Swiergosz volunteered the minutiae of that incident in his own testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">{\u00b6 25} Under Evid.R. 403(A), Swiergosz claims prejudice from the testimony about the lockdowns and the SWAT team. Even a cursory analysis, however, would not suggest inadmissibility. Crime does not occur in a vacuum. All contextual testimony that the jury hears that explains the wider \u201cstory\u201d or circumstances beyond the immediate facts of the crime will invariably carry some prejudice \u2014 in the sense that this larger story -will rarely make the defendant look good. Such testimony is nonetheless relevant in helping the jury understand the defendant\u2019s alleged actions, whom they affected, and what issues they are there to decide.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>{\u00b626} And here there is little doubt that the jury\u2019s estimation of Swiergosz was not measurably improved by what it heard. The authorities reacted with extreme caution on learning that he was armed and barricaded, and they treated very seriously the implications of his assaultive behavior. That, however, did not make the testimony inadmissible. \u201cIncriminating\u201d does not equal \u201cunfair prejudice\u201d under Evid.R. 403(A). <em>State v. Turner, </em>9th Dist. No 24709, 2009-Ohio-6613, 2009 WL 4829881, \u00b6 14-16 (contextual testimony about barricaded suspect with felony warrants, possession of illegal weapons, and call-out of SWAT team not unfairly prejudicial). The gravity of Swiergosz\u2019s actions had rippling effects beyond Sunset House. They precipitated certain responses that the police witnesses described. The probative value of this testimony was not <em>substantially </em>outweighed by unfair prejudice, the calculus required under Evid.R. 403(A). We find no error in the jury\u2019s having heard it.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">{\u00b6 27} As Swiergosz has not met his burden of showing how he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to file an in-hmine motion as to either issue, his ineffective-assistance claim necessarily fails. <em>Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraphs two and three of the syllabus. Accordingly, the second assigned error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">{\u00b6 28} The third assigned error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">The trial court committed error when it failed to apply the appropriate allied-offenses test in determining whether Mr. Swiergosz\u2019s convictions merged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">{\u00b6 29} Swiergosz was sentenced on February 8, 2010. His notice of appeal was filed on February 22, 2010. When he was sentenced, <em>State v. Rance, </em>85 Ohio St.3d 632, 710 N.E.2d 699 (1999), governed the analysis for determining the merger of allied offenses of similar import under R.C. 2941.25(A). On December 29, 2010, the Ohio Supreme Court overruled <em>Ranee </em>and announced a new standard in <em>State v. Johnson, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 153, 2010-Ohio-6314, 942 N.E.2d 1061, \u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">{\u00b6 30} A review of both the sentencing transcript and the court\u2019s sentencing entry indicates that the court ordered concurrent prison terms for the convictions of aggravated burglary (count 1), kidnapping of Marilyn Sharkey (count 2), and weapons-disability (count 8). As well, the prison terms for the two kidnapping convictions involving Swiergosz\u2019s wife (counts 4 and 5) were made concurrent. Of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>the seven firearm specifications, the court explicitly merged all but two, imposing consecutive three-year terms on counts 2 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">{\u00b6 31} Swiergosz now asks us to remand this case for resentencing \u201cso the trial court can engage in the necessary analysis when imposing sentence.\u201d He asserts that \u201cthere is nothing in the record to suggest that the court\u201d used <em>Johnson </em>in determining which offenses to merge at sentencing. The state describes this argument as nonsensical given the timing, and it is true that without a crystal ball on February 8, the sentencing court could not have anticipated <em>Johnson. </em>Yet except for the firearms specifications, nothing in the sentencing transcript indicates that the court explicitly assessed any of the offenses for merger even under <em>Ranee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">{\u00b6 32} The state also contends that this issue has been \u201cwaived\u201d (or, more correctly, forfeited) because defense counsel did not challenge the court\u2019s failure to conduct a merger analysis. However, that only renders the issue reviewable for plain error under our discretionary power. <em>State v. Barnes, </em>94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240 (2002); <em>State v. Richcreek, </em>6th Dist. No. WD-09-072, 2011-Ohio-4686, 2011 WL 4344101, \u00b6 65. And it is now clearly established law that imposing multiple sentences for allied offenses constitutes plain error. <em>State v. Underwood, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 365, 2010-Ohio-1, 922 N.E.2d 923, \u00b6 31; <em>State v. Yarbrough, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 1, 2004-0hio-6087, 817 N.E.2d 845, \u00b6 96-102 (failure to merge allied offenses is plain error). Thus, on this issue, Swiergosz did not forfeit his right to assign error.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">{\u00b6 33} Although Swiergosz was sentenced ten months before <em>Johnson </em>was decided, his appeal was pending in this court. Because a new judicial ruling applies to a conviction that has not become final, Johnson\u2019s new analysis applies to his case. See <em>Ali v. State, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 328, 2004-Ohio-6592, 819 N.E.2d 687, \u00b6 7 (conviction becomes final when the defendant has exhausted all his appellate remedies); <em>see also State v. Greene, </em>6th Dist. No. S-03-045, 2004-Ohio-3456, 2004 WL 1468539, \u00b6 10 (where the defendant can no longer pursue any appellate remedy, his conviction is final, and \u201cany new case law cannot be applied retroactively even if it would be relevant to the facts of his case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">{\u00b6 34} Where multiple allied counts exist, the trial court\u2019s duty to merge these counts is mandatory, not discretionary. <em>Underwood, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 365, 2010-Ohio-1, 922 N.E.2d 923, \u00b6 26. Thus, \u201c[a] sentence that contains an allied-offenses error is contrary to law.\u201d <em>State v. Wilson, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 214, 2011-Ohio-2669, 951 N.E.2d 381, \u00b6 14. Under R.C. 2941.25, the sentencing court has a duty in the first instance \u201cto determine whether the offenses are allied, and if they are, to convict the defendant of only one offense.\u201d <em>Underwood </em>at \u00b6 29. This assessment must be made \u201cprior to sentencing.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>128 Ohio St.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>153, 2010-Ohio-6314, 942 N.E.2d 1061, \u00b6 47. The requirement to determine merger carries constitutional implications because the concept has its inception in the double-jeopardy protection against cumulative punishments grounded in those clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions. <em>Johnson </em>at \u00b6 45; <em>State v. Williams, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 381, 2010-Ohio-147, 922 N.E.2d 937, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">{\u00b6 35} R.C. 2941.25 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-6\">(A) Where the same conduct by defendant can be construed to constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be convicted of only one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">(B) Where the defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes two or more offenses of dissimilar import, or where his conduct results in two or more offenses of the same or similar kind committed separately or with a separate animus as to each, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, and the defendant may be convicted of all of them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">{\u00b6 36} In the syllabus of <em>Johnson, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cWhen determining whether two offenses are allied offenses of similar import subject to merger under R.C. 2941.25, the conduct of the accused must be considered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">{\u00b6 38} Although <em>Johnson </em>was a plurality opinion, its merger analysis requires, at a minimum, that two questions be answered. The first is \u201cwhether it is <em>possible </em>to commit one offense and commit the other with the same conduct, <em>not </em>whether it is possible to commit one without committing the other.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 48. This is a purely logical exercise. The inquiry is whether in the same conduct both offenses <em>could be </em>committed. <em>Johnson </em>emphasizes that it is not necessary that committing one offense will <em>always </em>result in committing the other. \u201cIt is a matter of possibility, rather than certainty.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>State v. Blankenship, </em>38 Ohio St.3d 116, 119, 526 N.E.2d 816 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">{\u00b6 39} Second, \u201c[i]f the multiple offenses <em>can be </em>committed by the same conduct, then the court must determine whether the offenses <em>were committed </em>by the same conduct, i.e., \u2018a single act, committed with a single state of mind.\u2019\u201d (Emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 49, quoting <em>State v. Brown, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 447, 2008-Ohio-4569, 895 N.E.2d 149, \u00b6 50. This second question is a fact-based inquiry into what the defendant intended to do (animus or immediate motive) and <em>did do, </em>in committing the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">{\u00b6 40} <em>Johnson </em>requires that \u201c[i]f the answer to both questions is yes, then the offenses are allied offenses of similar import and will be merged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, if the sentencing court \u201cdetermines that the commission of one offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>will <em>never </em>result in the commission of the other, or if the offenses are committed separately, or if the defendant has separate animus for each offense, then, according to R.C. 2941.25(B), the offenses will not merge.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 51. Although a defendant may have a single goal, if he commits multiple offenses, or even the same offense, against different victims during the same course of conduct, the offenses are not allied and could be separately punished. <em>See, e.g., State v. Mitchell, </em>6th Dist. No. E-09-064, 2011-Ohio-973, 2011 WL 766547, \u00b6 41; <em>State v. Snuffer, </em>8th Dist. No. 96480, 2011-Ohio-6430, 2011 WL 6245774, \u00b6 4. Yet where the defendant\u2019s conduct is such that a single act could lead to the commission of separately defined offenses, but those separate offenses were committed with a state of mind to commit only one act, the offenses are allied and must be merged for sentencing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">{\u00b6 41} The state argues that Swiergosz\u2019s receipt of concurrent sentences for certain offenses resulted in the \u201csame outcome\u201d as if they had been merged. But that argument simply begs the question. No merger analysis was done even under <em>Ranee, </em>and the \u201csame outcome\u201d may or may not obtain under <em>Johnson. </em>That determination remains to be made. But even if it did, the Supreme Court in <em>Underwood </em>rejected the argument that there is \u201cno practical or prejudicial effect\u201d in failing to determine merger if the defendant receives concurrent sentences. <em>Underwood, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 365, 2010-Ohio-1, 922 N.E.2d 923, \u00b6 31. There, the trial court had convicted the defendant of multiple counts of aggravated theft and theft, but ordered \u201call sentences to be served concurrently for an aggregate sentence of two years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 6. <em>Underwood </em>held that \u201ceven when the sentences are to be served concurrently, a defendant is prejudiced by having more convictions that are authorized by law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">{\u00b6 42} Imposing concurrent sentences does not cure the failure to determine merger, for the concept operates to preclude <em>multiple </em>sentences for conduct giving rise to allied offenses. That prohibition is found in R.C. 2941.25(A). \u201cBecause a defendant may be convicted of only one offense for such conduct, the defendant may be <em>sentenced for only one offense.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Underwood </em>at \u00b6 26. The statutory mandate that only one \u201cconviction\u201d result from allied offenses is a restriction \u201cagainst <em>sentencing </em>a defendant for more than one allied offense.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State v. Whitfield, </em>124 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>St.3d 319, 2010-Ohio-2, 922 N.E.2d 182, \u00b6 26; <em>see also State v. Gibson, </em>8th Dist. No. 92275, 2009-Ohio-4984, 2009 WL 3043980, \u00b629 (\u201cImposition of multiple sentences, even concurrent ones, for allied offenses of similar import is plain error\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">{\u00b6 43} Under R.C. 2941.25, a \u201cconviction\u201d consists of a guilty verdict <em>and </em>the imposition of a sentence or penalty. <em>Whitfield </em>at \u00b6 12. Because Swiergosz is entitled to a merger determination under <em>Johnson </em>for the offenses of which he was found guilty, this case will be remanded for that purpose, and following that, resentencing; however, the remand affects only the sentences, not the jury\u2019s guilt determinations. Those remain intact and are not subject to review. <em>Johnson, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 153, 2010-Ohio-6314, 942 N.E.2d 1061, \u00b6 15; <em>Whitfield </em>at \u00b6 26-27.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">{\u00b6 44} Additionally, while most of the firearms specifications were merged, this is of no consequence under R.C. 2941.25 to assessing the underlying <em>offenses. </em>A firearms specification is not \u201callied\u201d to the underlying crime because the specification is a <em>penalty enhancement, </em>not a criminal offense. <em>State v. Ford, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 398, 2011-Ohio-765, 945 N.E.2d 498, \u00b619 (\u201cPenalties for a specification and its predicate offense do not merge under R.C. 2941.25\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">{\u00b6 45} Accordingly, the third assigned error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">{\u00b6 46} The fourth assigned error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-9\">The trial court committed error in failing to specify whether the sentence on count six was to be served consecutively or concurrently.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">{\u00b6 47} Swiergosz attempts to base error on a <em>verbal </em>misstatement by the court during sentencing. While this assignment is technically moot due to the disposition of the preceding assignment, it alleges the kind of \u201cerror\u201d that is capable of repetition on remand, so we will address it now.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">{\u00b6 48} In pronouncing sentencing, the court failed to specify whether the prison time on count 6 was to be served concurrently or consecutively. The court inadvertently omitted count 6, stating, \u201c[t]he <em>remaining </em>counts, counts 3, 4, and 7, are to be served consecutively to all other counts and consecutively to each other.\u201d However, in the judgment entry of sentence, the court stated: \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>sentences imposed in count three, count six, and count seven are ordered to be served consecutively to each other and are ordered to be served consecutively to the sentences imposed in count one, count two, count four, count five, and count eight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">{\u00b6 49} Arguably, by saying \u201cthe <em>remaining </em>counts\u201d in its verbal rendition of sentence, the court did intend to include count 6. But as the state correctly notes, a sentencing court speaks only through its judgment entry of sentence, not its oral pronouncements. <em>State v. Brooke, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 199, 2007-Ohio-1533, 863 N.E.2d 1024, \u00b6 47. We have previously held that verbal miscues or misstatements in open court during sentencing are harmless. <em>State v. Woody, </em>6th Dist.

Following his indictment, a number of pretrial motions were filed, including a motion to suppress Swiergosz\u2019s statements to Toledo police officers. After a hearing, this motion was denied. Separate hearings were held to determine Swiergosz\u2019s mental competency and to assess the basis for his plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. After these hearings and a court-ordered evaluation, the trial court determined that he was competent to stand trial and failed to meet the legal criteria for insanity. None of these rulings are involved in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b82-11\">. On March 10, 2009, Swiergosz discharged a firearm twice at his wife during an altercation. On December 22, 2009, after pleading guilty to this offense, he was sentenced to a prison term of seven years. Separately, Swiergosz later pled guilty to burglary for the firearms taken from the Wood County residence. The common pleas court sentenced him to a one-year prison term.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b85-8\">. During cross-examination about the March incident, Swiergosz offered a nuanced distinction between shooting <em>\"at \u201d </em>his wife and shooting <em>\"in close proximity \u201d </em>to her. Whether this subtlety eluded the jury or was merely a distinction without a difference is not something the record reveals. But as counsel for Swiergosz concedes, \"his testimony was the most damning evidence against him.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b88-8\">. The Supreme Court of Ohio has expressed the same point this way: \"As a legal term, \u2018prejudice\u2019 is simply '[djamage or detriment to one\u2019s legal rights or claims.\u2019 Black\u2019s Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>Dictionary (8th Ed.1999) 1218. Thus, it is fair to say that all relevant evidence is prejudicial. That is, evidence that tends to disprove a party\u2019s rendition of the facts necessarily harms that party\u2019s case. Accordingly, the rules of evidence do not attempt to bar all prejudicial evidence \u2014 to do so would make reaching any result extremely difficult. Rather, only evidence that is <em>unfairly </em>prejudicial is excludable.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>State v. Crotts, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 432, 2004-Ohio-6550, 820 N.E.2d 302. \u00b6 23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b92-7\">. This was the result <em>in Johnson, 128 </em>Ohio St.3d 153, 2010-Ohio-6314, 942 N.E.2d 1061. The defendant had beaten the same seven-year-old victim twice, with the beatings only briefly separated in time. The court deemed the two beatings to be a single \"discreet act\u201d that resulted in both the commission of felony murder and child endangering. Noting that the endangering offense formed the predicate crime for the homicide, <em>Johnson </em>found that the state had relied on the same conduct to prove both offenses. Felony murder and child abuse were thus allied offenses and should have been merged. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 53-57.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b93-13\">. In this assignment, neither party has properly briefed or argued which of the eight offenses, if any, should be merged under <em>Johnson </em>for sentencing purposes. Notwithstanding that, the correct procedure is to vacate the sentences and remand for resentencing. <em>Wilson </em>at \u00b6 12-15; <em>Whitfield </em>at \u00b6 22-26; <em>State v.
