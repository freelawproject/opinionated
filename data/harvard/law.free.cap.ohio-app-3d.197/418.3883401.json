Stewart, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">{\u00b6 1} Plaintiff-appellant, Evelyn Grey, appeals from a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) dismissal of her class-action complaint for damages against defendant-appellee, Walgreen Company. Grey alleged that Walgreen\u2019s pharmacy engaged in a practice of charging workers\u2019 compensation claimants for prescription drugs in amounts that exceeded the express terms and conditions of regulations and guidelines established by the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation. She alleged that Walgreen\u2019s practice violated R.C. 4121.44(E), which states: \u201cNo health care provider, whether certified or not, shall charge, assess, or otherwise attempt to collect from an employee, employer, a managed care organization, or the bureau any amount for covered services or supplies that is in excess of the allowed amount paid by a managed care organization, the bureau, or a qualified health plan.\u201d Walgreen, citing <em>Patterson v. Rite Aid Corp. Headquarters </em>(N.D.Ohio E.D.2010), 752 F.Supp.2d 811, sought dismissal of the complaint on grounds that R.C. 4121.44(E) does not provide for a private cause of action. The court agreed, and relying on <em>Patterson </em>for the conclusion that Grey could not maintain a private action for any alleged overbilling by Walgreen, dismissed the entire complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">{\u00b6 2} Grey first argues that the court erred as a matter of law by finding that she had no private right of action under R.C. 4121.44(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">{\u00b6 3} We employ a de novo standard of review for motions to dismiss filed pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6), <em>Greeley v. Miami Valley Maintenance Contrs., Inc. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 228, 551 N.E.2d 981, and accept all factual allegations of the complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Byrd v. Faber </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 56, 565 N.E.2d 584. A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted can be granted only when it appears beyond doubt from the complaint that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts entitling her to relief. <em>LeRoy v. Allen, Yurasek &amp; Merklin, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 323, 2007-Ohio-3608, 872 N.E.2d 254, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">{\u00b6 4} Grey\u2019s complaint alleged that the bureau has an outpatient pharmacy-benefit program that covers drugs used to treat conditions related to an injured worker\u2019s occupational injury or disease. Under this program, pharmacies are required to submit drug bills directly to the bureau\u2019s pharmacy-benefits manager for all claims, including bills for new claims that have not yet been allowed by the bureau. In situations where a worker presents a prescription before a claim has been allowed (or even filed), a pharmacy may either (1) accept an assignment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>the claim, fill the prescription, and seek reimbursement from the bureau at a later date or (2) fill the prescription and charge the injured worker the scheduled amount established by the bureau, at which point the worker will be reimbursed by the bureau if the claim is later allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">{\u00b6 5} Grey alleged that she suffered a workplace injury and received medical treatment although she had yet to file a claim for workers\u2019 compensation. Her treating physician gave her a prescription for medicine, which she took to a Walgreen pharmacy. Walgreen charged her the full retail price for the prescription. Grey alleged that the bureau later allowed her claim for a workplace injury and that the bureau reimbursed Grey only for the scheduled amount of her prescription \u2014 an amount that was less than that charged by Walgreen.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">{\u00b6 6} When determining whether, in the absence of explicit language, a statute grants a private right of action, Ohio courts have used the test set forth in <em>Cort v. Ash </em>(1975), 422 U.S. 66, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 45 L.Ed.2d 26:</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c \u2018First, is the plaintiff \u201cone of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted,\u201d * * * \u2014 that is, does the statute create a federal right in favor of the plaintiff? Second, is there any indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create such a remedy or to deny one? * * * Third, is it consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff?\u2019 \u201d <em>Strack v. Westfield Cos. </em>(1986), 33 Ohio App.3d 336, 337, 515 N.E.2d 1005, quoting <em>Cort </em>at 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">{\u00b6 8} There is ample authority for the proposition that the <em>Cort </em>test is no longer valid. The United States Supreme Court has gradually focused on the single factor of whether there was a legislative intent to grant a private right of action. See Stabile, The Role of Congressional Intent in Determining the Existence of Implied Private Rights of Action (1996), 71 Notre Dame L.R. 861, 868-869. For example, in <em>Transamerica Mtge. Advisors, Inc. (TAMA) v. Lewis </em>(1979), 444 U.S. 11, 100 S.Ct. 242, 62 L.Ed.2d 146, the Supreme Court stated that its analysis of whether a private right of action existed under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Title 15, Section 80b-l et seq., U.S.Code, was \u201cbasically a matter of statutory construction.\u201d Id. at 15. It found no evidence in the legislative history of the act to suggest any intent by Congress to create a private cause of action. Id. at 18. And in <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. Redington </em>(1979), 442 U.S. 560, 99 S.Ct. 2479, 61 L.Ed.2d 82, the Supreme Court established that congressional intent is the exclusive factor used in the determination, declaring that the task of courts is \u201climited solely to determining whether Congress intended to create the private right of action.\u201d Id. at 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>{\u00b6 9} Most recently, in <em>Alexander v. Sandoval </em>(2001), 532 U.S. 275, 121 S.Ct. 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 517, the Supreme Court appeared to put to rest any question concerning the continuing validity of the <em>Cort </em>factors by reaffirming its focus on legislative intent, stating that \u201c[h]aving sworn off the habit of venturing beyond Congress\u2019s intent, we will not accept respondents\u2019 invitation to have one last drink.\u201d Id. at 287. The Supreme Court elaborated:</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cLike substantive federal law itself, private rights of action to enforce federal law must be created by Congress. The judicial task is to interpret the statute Congress has passed to determine whether it displays an intent to create not just a private right but also a private remedy. Statutory intent on this latter point is determinative. Without it, a cause of action does not exist and courts may not create one, no matter how desirable that might be as a policy matter, or how compatible with the statute.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. at 286-287.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">{\u00b6 11} In other words, \u201cthe relevant inquiry for determining whether a private right of action exists appears to have two steps: (1) Did Congress intend to create a personal right?; and (2) Did Congress intend to create a private remedy? Only if the answer to both of these questions is \u2018yes\u2019 may a court hold that an implied private right of action exists under a federal statute.\u201d <em>Wisniewski v. Rodale, Inc. </em>(C.A.3, 2007), 510 F.3d 294, 301. See also <em>Fawcett v. G.C. Murphy &amp; Co. </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St.2d 245, 348 N.E.2d 144 (the courts will not infer the existence of a private cause of action unless the Ohio General Assembly manifests a \u201cclear implication\u201d for private causes of action).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c[I]n cases of statutory construction, \u2018our paramount concern is the legislative intent in enacting the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Buehler, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 114, 2007-Ohio-1246, 863 N.E.2d 124, at \u00b6 29, quoting <em>State ex rel. Steele v. Morrissey, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 355, 2004-Ohio-4960, 815 N.E.2d 1107, \u00b6 21. The courts determine legislative intent by looking to the language of the statute and the purpose that is to be accomplished by the statute. <em>Rice v. CertainTeed Corp. </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 417, 419, 704 N.E.2d 1217. When the meaning of the statute is \u201cclear and unambiguous,\u201d the statute must be applied \u201cas written.\u201d <em>Cheap Escape Co., Inc. v. Haddox, L.L.C., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 493, 2008-Ohio-6323, 900 N.E.2d 601, \u00b69.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">{\u00b6 13} As earlier noted, R.C. 4121.44(E) provides that no health-care provider shall charge or attempt to collect from any employee any amount for covered services or supplies in excess of the allowed amount paid by the bureau or its benefits manager. In the event a health care provider does overcharge or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>attempt to collect an amount in excess of that allowed by the bureau, \u201c[t]he attorney general may bring an action on behalf of the state and a self-insuring employer may bring an action on its own behalf to enforce this section in any court of competent jurisdiction. The attorney general may settle or compromise any action brought under this section with the approval of the administrator.\u201d See R.C. 4121.444(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">{\u00b6 14} As the foregoing statutes make clear, the General Assembly not only failed to grant a private right of action to individual workers\u2019 compensation claimants for claims that they have been overcharged, it specifically gave a right of action to the attorney general and affected self-insured employers. R.C. Chapter 4121 could not be clearer in expressing the intent that enforcement of R.C. 4121.44(E) resides solely with the attorney general. The district court in <em>Patterson </em>reached this same conclusion:</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cWhile the Plaintiffs, as workers [sic] compensation claimants, are members of a class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted, there is no indication of any legislative intent to create a private remedy under \u00a7 4121.44(E), however there is indication of intent to deny such a remedy in that the statute provides for state governmental enforcement. See \u00a7 4121.444 generally providing penalties for obtaining or attempting to obtain payment by deception; termination of agreement or reimbursement; and \u00a7 4121.444(D) empowering the attorney general to bring an action on behalf of the state. * * * There is no indication that a private remedy is necessary to enforce the statute. Based upon this analysis, this Court will not be the first to imply a private right of action under \u00a7 4121.44(E).\u201d Id., 752 F.Supp.2d at 816-817.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">{\u00b6 16} Grey argues that <em>Patterson </em>is distinguishable on its facts because the medications prescribed in that case required preapproval from the benefits manager \u2014 preapprovals that had not been obtained by either plaintiff in that case, thus resulting in rejection of the claims for reimbursement of out-of-pocket prescription expenses. So Grey argues that the pharmacy in <em>Patterson </em>had the right to collect the full cash price of the prescriptions at the time they were filled and was being wrongfully asked to refund monies that it had the right to charge in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">{\u00b6 17} Grey\u2019s argument that <em>Patterson </em>is factually distinguishable is irrelevant because the distinguishing facts say nothing about the legislative intent behind R.C. 4121.44(E). R.C. Chapter 4121 is, at bottom, a statute that creates an administrative body and authorizes the promulgation of rules and procedures to govern that body. The right of the state to enforce the rules and regulations governing workers\u2019 compensation is explicitly reposed with the attorney general. It is a rule of statutory construction that \u201cthe General Assembly is presumed to have known that its designation of a remedy would be construed to exclude other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>remedies, consistent with the statutory construction maxim of expressio unius est exclusio alterius.\u201d <em>Hoops v. United Tel. Co. of Ohio </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 97, 101, 553 N.E.2d 252. We have no reason to conclude that the General Assembly intended, in the absence of express language, to grant a private right of action to affected claimants when it expressly granted that right to the attorney general.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">{\u00b6 18} The General Assembly did not create a personal right under R.C. 4121.44(K), nor did it create a private remedy, because it plainly gave a right of action only to the attorney general or self-insuring employers under the workers\u2019 compensation statutes. We hold, therefore, that there is no private right of action to seek redress for violations of R.C. 4121.44(K). With no right to bring a private action, Grey cannot as a matter of law prevail on her claim for damages under R.C. 4121.44(K).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">{\u00b6 19} In addition to her claim under R.C. 4121.44(K), Grey set forth a claim for unjust enrichment. In its motion to dismiss, Walgreen argued that these claims were based upon an alleged violation of the bureau\u2019s billing manual, but that Grey faded to establish as a predicate for liability that she submitted a claim for \u201ccovered services\u201d under R.C. 4121.44(K). It argued that Walgreen is not responsible for refunding the difference between the cash price for a prescription and the price set by the bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\"> {\u00b6 20} In the absence of a contractual relationship, a party may seek compensation when a person \u201chas and retains money or benefits which in justice and equity belong to another.\u201d <em>Hummel v. Hummel </em>(1938), 133 Ohio St. 520, 528, 14 N.E.2d 923. To establish a claim of unjust enrichment, the plaintiff must establish the following elements: (1) a benefit conferred by a plaintiff upon a defendant; (2) knowledge by the defendant of the benefit; and (3) retention of the benefit by the defendant under circumstances where it would be unjust to do so without payment. <em>L &amp; H Leasing Co. v. Dutton </em>(1992), 82 Ohio App.3d 528, 534, 612 N.E.2d 787, citing <em>Hambleton v. R.G. Barry Corp. </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 179, 183, 465 N.E.2d 1298.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">{\u00b6 21} Grey\u2019s unjust-enrichment claim rests on the premise that Walgreen was bound by the terms of the bureau\u2019s pharmacy benefits program to either provide the prescription without payment from the customer and await future reimbursement from the bureau or seek payment directly from the customer but accept in payment no more than the amount allowed by the bureau. She argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Walgreen retained an unjust benefit by charging her more than the amount allowed by the bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">{\u00b6 22} The same type of unjust enrichment claim was raised in <em>Patterson:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cWhile the Member Pharmacy Agreement covers reimbursement, the Plaintiffs are not a party, or at least in Defendant\u2019s view, third party beneficiaries to that contract, thus that express contract would not act to bar Plaintiffs\u2019 equitable claims. However, Plaintiffs in this case purchased prescription drugs from Rite Aid while they were not eligible injured workers under the Agreement. At that point, Rite Aid was not required by the Agreement or \u00a7 4121.44(K) to sell the prescription drugs to Plaintiffs at the amounts listed in the BWC fee schedule. Rather, Rite Aid and Plaintiffs were free to enter into separate, express contracts between Rite Aid and Plaintiffs as cash customers for the sale of the medications at the retail price and that is what they did. Thus, Plaintiffs\u2019 unjust enrichment and money had and received claims are dismissed because express contracts govern the subject matter.\u201d <em>Patterson, </em>752 F.Supp.2d at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">{\u00b6 24} The court, relying on <em>Patterson, </em>held that Grey purchased her prescription drugs before her claim had been allowed by the bureau, at which point Walgreen was free to charge Grey the full cash price and that Grey entered into a binding contract with Walgreen by paying that price. We find no fault with the court\u2019s analysis. Grey\u2019s arguments that there are insufficient facts to discern whether a contract arose for purposes of a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) are specious. Her complaint relies entirely on the premise that she was overcharged by Walgreen at the <em>point of sale, </em>so she cannot now argue that there were insufficient facts pleaded in the complaint to show that a transaction between her and Walgreen occurred. While a plaintiff is entitled to plead alternative legal theories when the facts are in doubt, Grey did not do so here. The complaint consistently alleges that she paid for and received prescription medicine from Walgreen, a transaction that bears all the hallmarks of a completed contract. Id. The court did not err by concluding that the facts, as stated, would not allow Grey to assert a claim for unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b459-8\">Jones and E. Gallagher, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b458-10\">. Our conclusion that there is no private right to enforce claimed violations of R.C. 4121.44(K) necessarily moots consideration of Grey's arguments relating to breach of contract, fraudulent misrepresentation, and fraud.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
