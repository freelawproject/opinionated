Fisher, appeals from his conviction and sentence for domestic violence, in violation of R.C. 2919.25(C), a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. Fisher contends both that the trial court erred when it denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal at the conclusion of the state\u2019s case-in-chief and that his conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">{\u00b6 2} We conclude that the evidence was insufficient to permit a reasonable finder of fact to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Fisher, by threat of force, knowingly caused a family member to believe that she was under threat of imminent physical harm. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and Fisher is discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">{\u00b6 3} The following evidence was submitted during the state\u2019s case-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">{\u00b6 4} One night in late November 2010, Shirley Fisher was asleep in her estranged husband\u2019s house. Ms. Fisher and Mr. Fisher were completing then-divorce at the time of the incident. At about 3:30 a.m., Ms. Fisher awoke to the sound of the bedroom door being pushed open. Ms. Fisher had placed a serving fork, or carving fork, into the door in order to keep it from opening and, additionally, had placed an armoire in front of the door to prevent it from opening. Located on top of the armoire was a potted plant, a house telephone, and a teddy bear. When Mr. Fisher forced the door open, the armoire and the items on top of the armoire were knocked over onto the floor. The potted plant broke.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">{\u00b6 5} After Mr. Fisher entered the room, he and Ms. Fisher exchanged words. It is unclear who began the verbal altercation or what exactly was said. Mr. Fisher picked up the now unpotted plant and threw it towards Ms. Fisher. The plant landed on the pillow where Ms. Fisher had been sleeping. Mr. Fisher also threw the telephone, which hit the side of the bed, which was located approximately four to five feet from the door. The telephone fell to the floor. Ms. Fisher testified that she was afraid, as evidenced by the barricaded and jammed door, but that she did not know whether Mr. Fisher was going to try to hurt her. Asked whether she thought it was possible that Mr. Fisher was going to try to hurt her, Ms. Fisher answered, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">{\u00b6 6} Ms. Fisher, up until either that day or shortly before that day, had been sleeping exclusively in a room downstairs. Mr. Fisher, who had not lived at the residence for over three weeks, had been to the house on several occasions and would regularly come into the bedroom where Ms. Fisher was located that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>evening in order to retrieve his clothes. Mr. Fisher had no knowledge that Ms. Fisher was going to be in that room that evening or that she had barricaded herself in that room with a sharp utensil and a piece of furniture. It is undisputed that Mr. Fisher had a right to be in the residence. After Mr. Fisher obtained a few clothing items, he left the residence. Ms. Fisher called the police to report the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">{\u00b6 7} In her account to Sergeant Mike Whaley of the Miami County Sheriffs Department, Ms. Fisher neglected to mention that she had barricaded and jammed the door, that Mr. Fisher had explained why he was there, and that she had not slept in that bedroom before that evening. She did, however, tell Sgt. Whaley that she was in \u201cfear for her safety\u201d and that Mr. Fisher seemed intoxicated because he had a lack of balance and \u201cby his action of coming into the room\u201d in that manner. Sgt. Whaley was not able to determine if Mr. Fisher was, in fact, intoxicated. Sgt. Whaley did, however, believe that by the placement of the plant and the location of the phone \u2014 between the bed, night stand, and doorway \u2014 Ms. Fisher was telling the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">{\u00b6 8} The following evidence was presented during Fisher\u2019s case-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">{\u00b6 9} Mr. Fisher had been living where the incident occurred since 1972 and had purchased the real property in 1993. The- real property contains Mr. Fisher\u2019s residence, his workshop, and a one-room schoolhouse on almost four acres. While both Mr. and Ms. Fisher had a legal right to be in the house, Mr. Fisher had not slept at the residence for quite some time, because he did not trust Ms. Fisher while he slept.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">{\u00b6 10} In the morning of the incident, Mr. Fisher had returned to the residence to \u201cget some clothes,\u201d because later that morning he was to be installing equipment at a construction site, and the clothes he needed were kept at the residence. Upon entering the house, Mr. Fisher had no intention of interacting with Ms. Fisher. To his knowledge, Ms. Fisher would be sleeping in the computer room located downstairs from the bedroom. Ms. Fisher had never indicated to Mr. Fisher that she was now sleeping in the bedroom. Upon entering the house, Mr. Fisher noticed that Ms. Fisher was not in the computer room; he believed that was because she was staying with her boyfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">{\u00b6 11} When Mr. Fisher reached the bedroom, he found the door to be wedged. Due to the age of the house and the fact that the door was frequently stuck during the fall and winter months, Mr. Fisher forced the door open. When that occurred, the door \u201cflung\u201d open, knocking over an armoire, a potted plant, and the telephone. After words were exchanged, Mr. Fisher retrieved the clothing items he had come for, walked out of the room, and left the house. Mr. Fisher denied ever throwing any item during .the incident. Mr. Fisher denied being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>intoxicated. Mr. Fisher denied ever believing that he put Ms. Fisher in any type of fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">{\u00b6 12} Mr. Fisher had been sleeping at the residence of Don Fisher, his father. That morning, Mr. Fisher arrived at his father\u2019s residence around 4:00 a.m., and seemed calm and collected. He told his father that he had just come from his house, where he had picked up a pair of jeans and his work boots. Mr. Fisher then proceeded to his bedroom. To his father, Mr. Fisher did not appear intoxicated. Shortly thereafter, a deputy sheriff arrived at Don Fisher\u2019s residence and arrested his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">{\u00b6 13} Mr. Fisher\u2019s first assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe trial court should have granted defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal at the conclusion of the case by the state of Ohio.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cIn reviewing the record for sufficiency, \u2018[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Smith </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 113, 684 N.E.2d 668, quoting <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c[I]n order to show that a person violated R..C. 2919.25(C), \u2018[i]t must be shown by the prosecution that the victim believed that the offender would cause her imminent physical harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hamilton v. Cameron </em>(1997), 121 Ohio App.3d 445, 449, 700 N.E.2d 336, quoting <em>State v. Sayres </em>(Mar. 26, 1997), Washington App. No. 95CA30, 1997 WL 142361. The state of mind of the victim is an essential element of this crime. <em>Id. </em>In the case before us, Mr. Fisher argues that the state failed to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that Ms. Fisher believed that he would have caused her imminent physical harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cImminent\u201d has been defined by Ohio courts as near at hand or impending. <em>Cincinnati v. Baarlaer </em>(1996), 115 Ohio App.3d 521, 526-527, 685 N.E.2d 836. It has also been defined as requiring the belief of the victim that harm would occur immediately or, in the alternative, that the defendant will cause immediate physical harm. <em>State v. Taylor </em>(1996), 79 Ohio Misc.2d 82, 85, 671 N.E.2d 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">{\u00b6 18} Mr. Fisher entered his household early in the morning with the belief that Ms. Fisher was not in the bedroom they had shared during their marriage. Ms. Fisher had, without any attempt at providing direct or constructive notice, moved into the bedroom. Both of them knew that Mr. Fisher would need access to that room in order to retrieve personal items. Ms. Fisher had not only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>jammed the door shut, with either a serving or carving fork, she had also placed furniture in front of the door. When Mr. Fisher ultimately opened the door with a reasonable amount of force needed to gain entry and collect the clothing items he came to retrieve, the furniture and items on top of that furniture were knocked off and broken. Regardless of the words that were exchanged or items thrown in the general direction of Ms. Fisher, by her own admission, she <em>did not know </em>whether Mr. Fisher was going to try to hurt her:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cQ. Okay. Did you think that he was going to try to \u2014 try to hurt you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cA. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cQ. Did you think that was possible?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-8\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cA. Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-9\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cQ. Is that part of the reason you were afraid?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-10\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cA. I wanted to not \u2014 I wanted to wake up at least if he came in there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-11\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cQ. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-12\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cA. And those \u2014 by him \u2014 by what he did, woke me up.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-13\">{\u00b6 27} We find that her belief that it was \u201cabsolutely\u201d possible does not meet the criterion of a belief that Mr. Fisher would cause her imminent harm. At most, her testimony may have established that she was in fear that Mr. Fisher might hurt her, but R.C. 2919.25(C), \u201cstrictly construed against the state and liberally construed in favor of the accused,\u201d as required by R.C. 2901.04(A), requires the victim \u201cto believe that the offender will cause imminent physical harm.\u201d By her own admission, Ms. Fisher did not know that he would try to hurt her.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-14\">{\u00b6 28} R.C. 2919.25(C) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-15\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cNo person, by threat of force, shall knowingly cause a family or household member to believe that the offender will cause imminent physical harm to the family or household member.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-16\">{\u00b6 30} Use of the word \u201cwill\u201d in a conditional sentence expresses an intention to act in a particular way to accomplish a desired object. As it is used in R.C. 2919.25(C), \u201cwill\u201d denotes an intention on the part of the offender to cause the victim imminent physical harm. The conduct the section prohibits is knowingly causing the victim to believe that the offender intends to act on that desire. It is not necessary that the victim must know that the offender will accomplish his desired object, which remains conditioned on his action. All that R.C. 2919.25(C) requires is that the offender has caused the victim to believe that the offender will take the action his desired object requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>{\u00b6 31} It was not the state\u2019s burden to show that the victim believed she would suffer imminent physical harm. The state\u2019s burden was merely to show that the victim believed that the defendant desired to harm her and that he intended to act on that desire. But the victim\u2019s testimony disclaims a belief that defendant intended to so act.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">{\u00b6 32} The state may rely on evidence other than the victim\u2019s testimony to prove the offense. In particular, the state may offer evidence of the victim\u2019s conduct to prove her state of mind. \u2019 But absent some sound reason to discount the victim\u2019s declaration, it should be given greater weight than contrary inferences derived from her conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">{\u00b6 33} Mr. Fisher\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">{\u00b6 34} Mr. Fisher\u2019s second assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-8\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cThe trial court decision finding defendant guilty is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">{\u00b6 36} In view of our disposition of Mr. Fisher\u2019s first assignment of error, this assignment of error is overruled as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">{\u00b6 37} Mr. Fisher\u2019s first assignment of error having been sustained, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and Mr. Fisher is discharged as to the offense of which he was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-12\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b630-13\">Grady, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b630-14\">Kline, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b630-15\">Roger L. Kline, J., of the Fourth Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b630-16\">Kline, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AfB\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-17\">{\u00b6 38} I respectfully dissent as to the first assignment of error. I agree with the majority that the victim\u2019s \u201cbelief that it was \u2018absolutely\u2019 possible does not cross the threshold of being a belief that Mr. Fisher would cause her imminent harm.\u201d Thus, this evidence favors the defendant-appellant, not the prosecution. Under our standard of review, however, we are required to review the evidence in a light that favors the prosecution. That is, \u201c[i]n reviewing the record for sufficiency, \u2018[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Smith </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 113, 684 N.E.2d 668, quoting <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">{\u00b6 39} Further, I agree with the law as stated in <em>Hamilton v. Cameron </em>(1997), 121 Ohio App.3d 445, 700 N.E.2d 336, which held that in order to show a violation of R.C. 2919.25(C), the state must prove that the victim believed that the offender would cause her imminent physical harm. The state of mind of the victim is an essential element of this offense. \u201cWhile it is true that victims may change their testimony to protect a spouse, there must be some evidence that the victim thought that the accused would cause imminent physical harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 449, 700 N.E.2d 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">{\u00b6 40} As I stated earlier, I agree with the majority that the victim\u2019s \u201cbelief that it was \u2018absolutely\u2019 possible does not cross the threshold of being a belief that Mr. Fisher would cause her imminent harm.\u201d But the prosecution is not limited to the victim\u2019s testimony. Instead, as <em>Hamilton </em>notes, the prosecution may use \u201cother evidence [from which] it could be inferred, that the victim thought that the accused would cause imminent physical harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Circumstantial evidence and direct evidence \u201cpossess the same probative value.\u201d <em>Jenks, </em>paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">{\u00b6 41} Here, in reviewing the other evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, I think one could infer, based on the circumstances, that the victim wife thought her husband would cause her imminent physical harm \u2014 barricading the door, calling the police, testimony about thrown objects.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">{\u00b6 42} In conclusion, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, I would find that any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of domestic violence under R.C. 2919.25(C) proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Consequently, I would overrule the first assignment of error and proceed to address the second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">{\u00b6 43} Thus, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
