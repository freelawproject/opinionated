The land was part of a 149-acre tract that was subject to an oil and gas lease held by Phillip and Sandra Caldwell. Under the terms of the lease, the Kocsises were entitled to free gas for domestic purposes. At the time of the sale, the Kocsises and Caldwells amended the lease to allow the Kramers to use 250,000 cubic feet of gas per year without charge. While the Kocsises had always received their gas by connecting to a gathering line that ran along their property, a couple of years after the Kramers bought the 14 acres, they experienced disruptions in the flow of gas. The Kramers, therefore, ran a new gas line directly to one of the wellheads on the 149 acres. By this time, the Caldwells had assigned the oil and gas lease to a family business called PAC Drilling Oil &amp; Gas, L.L.C. When a dispute arose between PAC and the Kramers regarding whether the Kramers were allowed to connect directly to a wellhead, PAC attempted to terminate the Kramers\u2019 right to free gas by surrendering the lease to the extent that it covered their 14 acres. The Kramers sued PAC, the Caldwells, and the Kocsises, seeking a declaratory judgment regarding their right to free gas and a share of the royalties of the gas produced since they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>acquired the 14 acres. The trial court granted summary judgment to PAC and the Caldwells, concluding that PAC\u2019s surrender of the lease to the Kramers\u2019 14 acres terminated their right to free gas. The Kramers have appealed, assigning as error that the trial court incorrectly granted summary judgment to PAC and the Caldwells. We reverse, because PAC\u2019s surrender of its lease of the Kramers\u2019 oil and gas estates did not terminate the free-gas covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">{\u00b6 2} In 1978, the Kocsises leased their oil and gas rights to the 149 acres to the McClanahan Oil Company. Under the terms of the lease, McClanahan Oil agreed to pay the Kocsises one-eighth of the revenue it generated from selling gas produced on the property. It also agreed that if it did not begin drilling wells by the end of January 1979, it would pay the Kocsises four dollars per acre for each year that it delayed drilling. It further agreed that if it decided not to sell the gas produced by a well because of market conditions, it would pay the Kocsises 50 dollars per year for each such well. The lease reserved to the Kocsises the right to take an unlimited amount of gas from any producing well for domestic purposes, as long as they used their own resources to make the connection and assumed any risks. The lease further provided that \u201c[a]t any time, Lessee, its successors or assigns, shall have the right to surrender this lease or any part thereof for cancelation, after which all payments and liabilities hereunder thereafter shall cease and determine, and if the whole is surrendered, then this lease shall become absolutely null and void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">{\u00b6 3} McClanahan Oil and its successors drilled two wells on the Kocsises\u2019 property, one on the north side of the property and one on the south side. Gas from the two wells, along with gas from wells drilled on some of the Kocsises\u2019 neighbors\u2019 properties, feeds into a main \u201cgathering\u201d line that connects to Dominion East Ohio Gas\u2019s central line.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">{\u00b6 4} At the time they entered the lease, the Kocsises lived on the 149 acres in a farmhouse that was closer to the well on the north side of their property than to the well on the south side. The farmhouse, however, was on the opposite side of the gathering line from the well. Accordingly, instead of running a gas line all the way to the wellhead, the Kocsises just connected the farmhouse to the gathering line in order to obtain their free gas.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">{\u00b6 5} In the mid-2000s, the Kocsises decided to sell the farmhouse. After unsuccessfully attempting to sell it to relatives, the Kocsises asked the Kramers whether they would be interested in buying it. The Kramers, thinking that the farmhouse and its attendant agricultural buildings would be a good place to board and train horses, negotiated a purchase agreement under which they would buy 14 of the Kocsises\u2019 149 acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>{\u00b6 6} Neither of the wells on the Kocsises\u2019 property was on the 14 acres they intended to sell to the Kramers, but to facilitate the sale, the Kocsises wanted to ensure that the Kramers could receive free gas. The Caldwells, who had acquired the oil and gas rights after a series of conveyances, agreed to amend the lease to allow the Kramers to use up to 250,000 cubic feet of gas per year. According to one of the Caldwells\u2019 sons, it is unusual for a well to last more than 15 to 20 years like the wells on the Kocsises\u2019 land. Therefore, it was advantageous for their family to cap the amount of free gas that the farmhouse used, in order to prolong the commercial viability of the wells. The Kocsises and Caldwells executed an amendment to the lease, under which the free-gas paragraph was amended by adding the following: \u201cOccupants of the [farmhouse] shall be entitled to 250,000 cubic feet per annum of free gas for domestic use plus heating of the garage and the hot water tank. Gas used in excess of 250,000 cubic feet per annum shall be billed to the occupant of said residence at well head price. In addition, an unlimited quantity of free gas shall be supplied to Joseph Kocsis, Jr. and Sherri A. Kocsis, husband and wife, at their residence * * * for domestic and garage use. These modifications supersede the original provisions which may be in conflict with this amendment and this amendment shall be integrated in paragraph six as if originally adopted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">{\u00b6 7} After operating their horse business for a couple of years without problems, the Kramers began experiencing disruptions in the supply of gas coming to the farmhouse from the gathering line. Each time there was a disruption, they would notify PAC, which would send someone out to investigate. A leak in the line was usually discovered. The Kramers eventually grew tired of the disruptions and ran a new gas line directly to the well on the north side of the Kocsises\u2019 property. According to PAC, the extra connection caused the pressure in the well to drop, causing brine to accumulate in the wellhead. This made it more difficult to produce gas <em>from </em>the well. When negotiations with the Kramers failed, PAC shut in the well on the north side, cutting off the Kramers\u2019 access to free gas. PAC also sent the Kramers a notice of cancellation, surrendering the oil and gas lease to the extent of their 14 acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">{\u00b6 8} The Kramers sued PAC and the Caldwells, requesting a declaratory judgment that they are entitled to 250,000 cubic feet of free gas per year and an injunction to prevent the well to which they had connected from being shut in. They also filed breach-of-contract, conversion, and unjust-enrichment claims, seeking to recover a share of the gas royalties. They further sought to eject PAC from operating the Kocsises\u2019 wells and quiet title regarding the oil and gas rights to their 14 acres. They later amended their complaint to assert breach-of-contract and fraudulent-misrepresentation claims against the Kocsises. PAC and the Caldwells counterclaimed, seeking a declaration that the Kramers\u2019 right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>free gas has been terminated and to recover for the harm the Kramers did when they connected directly to the well. The Kocsises also counterclaimed for trespass, seeking damages for the pipeline the Kramers placed across their land.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">{\u00b6 9} PAC and the Caldwells moved for summary judgment on the Kramers\u2019 claims, and the Kramers filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment to PAC and the Caldwells, concluding that PAC\u2019s surrender of the oil and gas lease regarding the Kramers\u2019 14 acres terminated the Kramers\u2019 entitlement to free gas. It concluded that in light of that decision, the Kramers\u2019 other claims were moot. The Kramers subsequently dismissed their claims against the Kocsises, and the trial court dismissed PAC\u2019s, the Caldwells\u2019, and the Kocsises\u2019 counterclaims. The Kramers have appealed the trial court\u2019s summary-judgment ruling, assigning as error that it incorrectly granted summary judgment to PAC and the Caldwells.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">OIL AND GAS LEASES</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe rights and remedies of the parties to an oil or gas lease must be determined by the terms of the written instrument[.]\u201d <em>Harris v. Ohio Oil Co., </em>57 Ohio St. 118, 129, 48 N.E. 502 (1897). \u201cSuch leases are contracts, and the terms of the contract with the law applicable to such terms must govern the rights and remedies of the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The construction of written contracts and instruments of conveyance is a matter of law that this court reviews de novo. <em>Bath Twp. v. Raymond C. Firestone Co., </em>140 Ohio App.3d 252, 256, 747 N.E.2d 262 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">{\u00b6 11} Under the terms of the oil and gas lease at issue in this case, the Kocsises \u201cgrantfed] unto [McClanahan Oil] all of the oil and gas and all of the constituents of either in and under [the 149 acres] together with the exclusive right to drill for, produce and market oil and gas and their constituents[.]\u201d The Ohio Supreme Court has .recognized that language like the language used in this lease operates as \u201cmore than a mere license.\u201d <em>Harris v. Ohio Oil Co. </em>Rather, it conveys \u201ca vested, though limited, estate in the lands for the purposes named in the lease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130. The lease separated the surface estate of the Kocsises\u2019 land from its oil and gas estates and conveyed ownership of the oil and gas estates to McClanahan Oil. See <em>Bath Twp. v. Raymond C. Firestone Co. </em>at 256 (\u201c[I]t is possible for the total interest in real property to be divided in such a way that the surface estate is severed from the mineral estate\u201d); see also <em>Moore v. Indian Camp Coal Co., </em>75 Ohio St. 493, 499, 80 N.E. 6 (1907) (recognizing that a lease may sever the ownership of the surface of land from the mineral rights to that land). McClanahan Oil became the fee-simple owner of the conveyed oil and gas estates while the Kocsises retained a possibility of reverter as provided in the lease. Because of the possibility of reverter, McClanahan Oil\u2019s fee-simple estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>in the oil and gas was a fee-simple determinable rather than a fee-simple absolute. <em>Harris v. Ohio Oil Co. </em>at 130-131 (noting that when an oil and gas lease ends, \u201cwhether caused by the exhausting of the oil and gas, or by the permanent abandonment of production, the lease will cease, and the whole estate in the premises will become the property of the owner of the fee, not by forfeiture, but by virtue of the terms of the lease\u201d); see <em>Moore v. Indian Camp Coal Co. </em>at 499 (recognizing that fee-simple mineral estate is determinable upon the exhaustion of the minerals); <em>see also Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of Am. v. Pool, </em>124 S.W.3d 188, 192 (Tex.2003) (\u201c[A]n oil and gas lease is not a \u2018lease\u2019 in the traditional sense of a lease of the surface of real property. In a typical oil or gas lease, the lessor is a grantor and grants a fee simple determinable interest to the lessee, who is actually a grantee. Consequently, the lessee/grantee acquires ownership of all the minerals in place that the lessor/grantor owned and purported to lease, subject to the possibility of reverter in the lessor/grantor. The lessee\u2019s/grantee\u2019s interest is \u2018determinable\u2019 because it may terminate and revert entirely to the lessor/grantor upon the occurrence of events that the lease specifies will cause termination of the estate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">{\u00b6 12} According to the lease, it could end for a number of reasons, including the lessee\u2019s decision to surrender it. The question in this case is whether PAC\u2019s partial surrender of the lease terminated the Kramers\u2019 right to free gas. PAC has argued that it did, pointing to language in the surrender clause providing that after surrender, \u201call payments and liabilities hereunder thereafter shall cease and determine^]\u201d The question is whether the Kramers\u2019 free-gas entitlement is a payment or liability regarding the 14 surrendered acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cUnder Ohio law, a free gas clause is construed as a covenant running with the surface ownership of the leasehold tract unless a contrary intention appears in the wording of the instrument.\u201d <em>Oxford Oil Co. v. Wills, </em>5th Dist. No. 1999 AP 11 0067, 2000 WL 1901451, at *3 (Dec. 21, 2000). \u201cThe theory upon which the covenant is held to run with the surface and not the mineral, gas and oil estate is that the surface owner of the house, or other building located thereon and entitled to free gas, is presumptively the one intended to be benefited.\u201d <em>Stapleton v. Columbia Gas Transm. Corp., </em>2 Ohio App.3d 15, 18, 440 N.E.2d 575 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">{\u00b6 14} Under the initial terms of the lease, the Kocsises reserved free gas for domestic use wherever they lived on the 149 acres. They also had the right to build additional dwellings for their children, and those children who lived on the 149 acres were also entitled to free gas. The Kocsises could also assign their rights under the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>{\u00b6 15} Although the Kocsises wanted to sell some of their property to the Kramers, they wanted to ensure that their son, who lived on the 149 acres, continued receiving free gas. Under the terms of the initial lease, only the \u201clessor\u2019s\u201d children had a right to free gas. The Kocsises wanted to amend the lease to clarify that their son could continue receiving free gas even if they sold some of their property. As previously mentioned, the Caldwells were also interested in amending the lease to cap the amount of free gas that could be used by the farmhouse. The terms that the Kocsises and Caldwells agreed to were that the \u201c[o]ccupants of the [farmhouse] shall be entitled to 250,000 cubic feet per annum of free gas for domestic use plus heating of the garage and hot water tank. * * * In addition, an unlimited quantity of free gas shall be supplied to [the Kocsises\u2019 son] at [his] residence * * * for domestic and garage use.\u201d The Kocsises and Caldwells agreed that \u201c[t]hese modifications supersede the original provisions which may be in conflict with this amendment}.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">{\u00b6 16} Because the right to free gas benefits the occupants of the farmhouse regardless of who they are, we conclude that the free-gas clause created a covenant that runs with the surface estate of the land. <em>Stapleton v. Columbia Gas Transm. Corp., 2 </em>Ohio App.3d at 18, 440 N.E.2d 575. The lease conveyed only the Kocsises\u2019 oil and gas estates to McClanahan Oil. Accordingly, when PAC surrendered the lease as to the 14 acres, it terminated only the \u201cpayments and liabilities\u201d related to the oil and gas estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">{\u00b6 17} Under the terms of the lease, there are payments and liabilities that relate exclusively to the oil and gas estates. First, if the lessee did not begin operating a well on the land by the end of January 1979, it owed four dollars per acre for every 12 months that it delayed operations. Second, the lessee must pay the lessor a royalty of one-eighth of all the gas and casing-head gas that it sells from the oil and gas estates. Third, if the lessee stops selling gas from a well because of market conditions, it must pay the lessor $50 per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">{\u00b6 18} PAC\u2019s surrender of its oil and gas estates for the Kramers\u2019 14 acres did not extinguish the Kramers\u2019 right to use 250,000 cubic feet of gas without charge per year because the entitlement to free gas is a covenant running with the surface estate of the land, which is not affected by the surrender of oil and gas rights. This conclusion is consistent with the purpose of surrender clauses, which is to avoid paying rents or royalties on unproductive land. <em>Kennecott Corp. v. Union Oil Co., </em>196 Cal.App.3d 1179, 1187, 242 Cal.Rptr. 403 (1987); <em>Superior Oil Co. v. Dabney, </em>147 Tex. 51, 211 S.W.2d 563, 565 (1948) (noting that purpose of surrender clause was to relieve the lessee of the duty to drill on the surrendered acreage). To terminate the free-gas covenant by surrender, PAC would have to surrender the entire contract, at which time the entire \u201clease shall become absolutely null and void.\u201d We, therefore, conclude that the trial court incorrectly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>granted summary judgment to PAC. The Kramers\u2019 assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">{\u00b6 19} PAC\u2019s partial surrender of its lease of oil and gas estates did not terminate the Kramers\u2019 right to free gas, because the free-gas clause created a covenant running with the surface estate of the land. The judgment of the Wayne County Common Pleas Court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b595-7\">Belfance, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b595-8\">Carr, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b595-9\">Carr, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Apc\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">{\u00b6 20} I respectfully dissent. \u201c \u2018When a trial court enters a judgment in a declaratory judgment action, the order must declare all of the parties\u2019 rights and obligations in order to constitute a final, appealable order.\u2019 \u201d <em>No-Burn, Inc. v.
