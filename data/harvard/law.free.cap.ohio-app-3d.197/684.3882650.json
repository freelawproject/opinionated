Cook pled guilty in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas to failure to notify a sheriff of a change of address, in violation of R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>2950.05, a third-degree felony. The trial court sentenced him to community control. The state appeals from Cook\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">{\u00b6 2} In 1991, Billy L. Cook was convicted of rape, and in 1997, he was classified as a sexually oriented offender under Ohio\u2019s version of Megan\u2019s Law. While Cook was still in prison, the attorney general notified him that he would be reclassified as a Tier III sex offender. That reclassification was unconstitutional under <em>State v. Bodyke, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 266, 2010-Ohio-2424, 933 N.E.2d 753. In accordance with <em>Bodyke, </em>Cook\u2019s original classification as a sexually oriented offender and the registration requirements attendant thereto were reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">{\u00b6 3} In January 2011, Cook was charged by complaint with failing to notify the sheriff of a change of address, in violation of R.C. 2950.05. Cook pled guilty to the offense with the understanding that the offense constituted a third-degree felony, pursuant to former R.C. 2950.99, 130 Ohio Laws 669, 671-672, and <em>State v. Milby, </em>2d Dist. Montgomery No. 23798, 2010-Ohio-6344, 2010 WL 5480656. At the plea hearing, the trial court informed Cook that it would not impose a sentence greater than two years in prison. After a presentence investigation, the court sentenced Cook to community control. The state maintained throughout the case that Cook\u2019s offense constituted a first-degree felony, and the prosecutor stated at both the plea and sentencing hearings that the state intended to appeal the trial court\u2019s treatment of the offense as a third-degree felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">{\u00b6 4} The state timely appealed from Cook\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">{\u00b6 5} The state\u2019s sole assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-11\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe felony sentencing statute R.C. 2950.99 is not applied retroactively when the conduct for which a defendant is convicted and sentenced occurred after the effective date of the statute or January 1, 2008.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-12\">{\u00b6 7} The state claims that the trial court erred in treating Cook\u2019s violation of R.C. 2950.05 as a third-degree felony under Megan\u2019s Law and in accordance with <em>Milby, </em>2010-Ohio-6344, 2010 WL 5480656. The state submits that \u201cthe sentencing provisions of R.C. 2950.99, which were not amended through S.B. 10 [Ohio\u2019s version of the federal Adam Walsh Act (\u201cAWA\u201d) ], are not among the classification, community-notification or registration duties that were reinstated under <em>Bodyke.\u201d </em>The state asks that we reconsider <em>Milby </em>and hold that the enhanced penalty provisions in R.C. 2950.99 apply when the violation of the registration requirements occurred after January 1, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>{\u00b6 8} In <em>Milby, </em>the defendant challenged his conviction for failure to notify, arguing, among other things, that his reclassification from a sexual predator to a Tier III sex offender was unconstitutional. Following <em>Bodyke, </em>we agreed with Milby that his original sexual-predator classification and the community-notification and registration orders attending that classification must be reinstated. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 30. We found, however, that his failure-to-notify conviction was \u201cnot offended,\u201d but held that the enhanced penalty for the failure to notify offense may be not applied. Specifically, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-5\">When Milby\u2019s original sexual predator classification and registration requirements are applied to the facts of his case, his failure to notify conviction is not offended. Under former law, Milby was required to provide notice of an address change twenty days prior to the change. R.C. 2950.05(A). This requirement did not change with the enactment of S.B. 10. Therefore, because Milby had an ongoing duty since his release from prison to notify MCSO of any change of his registered address, neither S.B. 10 nor <em>Bodyke </em>changed this requirement or his duty. See <em>State v. Huffman, </em>Mont.App. No. 23610, 2010-Ohio-4755 [2010 WL 3821707]. AWA did increase the penalty for failure to notify to a first-degree felony. That penalty may not be applied to Milby. Under the former law, violation of the reporting requirement was a felony of the third degree. See former R.C. 2950.99(A)(1)(a)(i). Since the trial court improperly treated Milby\u2019s conviction as a first-degree felony, we will remand this matter to the trial court for resentencing as a third-degree felony conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-6\"><em>Milby, </em>2010-Ohio-6344, 2010 WL 5480656, at \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">{\u00b6 9} We have had several opportunities to reconsider <em>Milby. See State v. Johnson, </em>2d Dist. No. 24029, 2011-Ohio-2069, 2011 WL 1661497 (following <em>Milby </em>); <em>State v. Alexander, </em>2d Dist. No. 24119, 2011-Ohio-4015, 2011 WL 3557880 (following <em>Johnson); State v. Alltop, </em>2d Dist. No. 24324, 2011-Ohio-5541, 2011 WL 5137194; <em>State v. Howard, </em>195 Ohio App.3d 802, 2011-Ohio-5693, 961 N.E.2d 1196; <em>State v. Pritchett, </em>2d Dist. No. 24183, 2011-Ohio-5978, 2011 WL 5825626; <em>State v. Harrison, </em>2d Dist. No. 24471, 2011-Ohio-6803, 2011 WL 6927644.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">{\u00b6 10} In <em>Alltop, </em>we discussed the changes to the registration requirements occasioned by 2007 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 10, as well as the changes to the penalty structure for violations of R.C. 2950.05, which were enacted in 2007 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 97 without reference to the Adam Walsh Act. After setting forth the statutory changes in detail, we held that Alltop\u2019s \u201creliance on <em>Milby </em>in the matter at bar is appropriate,\u201d vacated his sentence, and \u201cremanded to the trial court for resentencing as a third degree felony, consistent with the penalty for notification violations in force in Ohio at the time [Alltop] was convicted of the underlying offense.\u201d <em>AUtop </em>at \u00b6 14-15. Similarly, in <em>Howard, </em>we expressly rejected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>state\u2019s request that we reconsider <em>Milby. </em>We stated that \u201cthe fact that Howard had committed his offense of failure to notify after the effective date of S.B. 97 does not affect the outcome herein as the state asserts. Pursuant to <em>Milby, </em>we find that the trial court erred when it convicted Howard of a first-degree felony * * <em>Howard </em>at \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">{\u00b6 11} In <em>Pritchett, </em>2011-Ohio-5978, 2011 WL 5825626, the issue arose in the context of the defendant\u2019s appeal from the denial of his motion to withdraw his plea to failure to notify. We rejected Pritchett\u2019s argument that the trial court had erred in denying his motion to withdraw his plea, noting that <em>\u201cBodyke </em>did not change the fact that Pritchett had a duty to notify the sheriff of a change in his address of residence, and Pritchett\u2019s defenses were the same, whether he were a Tier III sex offender or a sexually oriented offender.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">{\u00b6 12} Addressing Pritchett\u2019s sentence, however, we discussed our decisions in <em>Milby, Johnson, </em>and <em>Alexander </em>requiring resentencing under the former version of R.C. 2950.99. We further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-7\">Very recently, in <em>State v. Williams, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 344, 2011-Ohio-3374, 952 N.E.2d 1108, the Supreme Court of Ohio held that the provision of 2007 Am.Sub. S.B. 10, which imposes greater penalties on sexual offenders, such as Pritchett, for violations of notification and registration requirements than applied when they were convicted of their underlying sexual offense, violates the prohibition against retroactive laws in Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. That section provides, in pertinent part: \u201cThe general assembly shall have no power to pass retroactive laws.\u201d Any law \u201cpassed\u201d in violation of that section is therefore void. Further, because such a law purports to apply retroactively, a holding that the law violates Section 28, Article II likewise applies retroactively to any person to whom the law was retroactively applied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-8\">Under Megan\u2019s law (which had been applied to Pritchett in 2005), Pritchett with the 2005 prior failure to notify conviction was subject to sentencing for a felony of the third degree. As a result of a subsequent amendment of the law, Pritchett was instead sentenced for a second degree felony offense. That amendment of the law is void, per <em>Williams. </em>The sentence the court imposed pursuant to that law is likewise void. It would be a manifest injustice to continue Pritchett\u2019s incarceration on a void sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-9\"><em>Pritchett </em>at \u00b6 26, 28. We vacated Pritchett\u2019s sentence and remanded for a new sentencing hearing. We recently applied <em>Pritchett </em>to a defendant who appealed the denial of his petition for postconviction relief following his guilty plea to failure to register in violation of R.C. 2950.05(B)(F)(2). <em>State v. Harrison, </em>2d Dist. No. 24471, 2011-Ohio-6803, 2011 WL 6927644. We concluded that Harrison was \u201centitled to have his sentence vacated since, subsequent to the Adam Walsh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>Act, the penalty for failure to register for an offender like Harrison with prior convictions was increased to a mandatory three-year term as a felony of the first degree. R.C. 2950.99.\u201d <em>Harrison, </em>2011-Ohio-6803, 2011 WL 6927644, at \u00b6 19. We held that Harrison\u2019s sentence was void, vacated the sentence, and remanded the case to the trial court for resentencing. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">{\u00b6 13} We decline to depart from <em>Milby </em>and our cases following it and, instead, find <em>Milby </em>to be controlling in the circumstances before us. Cook was convicted of rape in 1991 and classified as a sexually oriented offender under Ohio\u2019s version of Megan\u2019s Law. The trial court did not err in following Milby and applying the prior version of R.C. 2950.99, rather than the version enacted under S.B. 97, in sentencing Cook for failure to notify in violation of R.C. 2950.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">{\u00b6 14} The state\u2019s assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">{\u00b6 15} The trial court\u2019s judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b722-10\">Fain and Donovan, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b722-11\">Fain, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Auh\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-12\">{\u00b6 16} If this were a case of first impression, I would reverse, for the reason set forth in Judge Hall\u2019s separate opinion in <em>State v. Howard, </em>195 Ohio App.3d 802, 2011-Ohio-5693, 961 N.E.2d 1196. On January 1, 2008, long before Cook committed the offense to which he pled guilty \u2014 failure to notify \u2014 the penalty for that offense was increased from a third-degree felony to a first-degree felony. In my view, it is neither a violation of Ohio\u2019s retroactive-laws prohibition (Article II, Section 28 of the Ohio Constitution) nor a violation of the federal Ex Post Facto Clause (Article I, Section 10 of the United States Constitution) to apply a statute increasing a penalty for an offense to an offense that is committed after the effective date of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-13\">{\u00b6 17} But this is hardly a case of first impression. Therefore, I will follow stare decisis and join in the opinion and judgment of this court in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
