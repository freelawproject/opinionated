(\u201cRMB\u201d), Bowling Transportation, Inc. (\u201cBTI\u201d), Diamond Trailers, Inc. (\u201cDTI\u201d), Dempster Tire Sales, Inc. (\u201cDTS\u201d), AK Steel Corp., Bill and Don Bowling, and Bryan Davis. Davis cross-appeals from the same decision. For the reasons outlined below, we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">{\u00b6 2} RMB, a business that is owned by Bill and Don Bowling and that incorporated in 1994 to operate a steel storage warehouse, contracted with AK Steel to provide it with intraplant hauling services at its Middletown facility. BTI, incorporated in 1986 to operate as an over-the-road steel hauler, is also owned by Bill and Don Bowling. BTI leases employees to RMB, its sister corporation, to provide the intraplant hauling services on behalf of RMB at the AK Steel facility. Appellants\u2019 decedents, Jonathan Roberts and Rudolfo Guzman, were BTI employees leased to RMB to provide services at the AK Steel facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">{\u00b6 3} On the morning of March 3, 2007, Bryan Davis, the lead mechanic providing services for RMB, received word that one of RMB\u2019s trailers, a trailer that was designed by DTI and equipped with tires supplied by DTS, had several broken wheel bolts in need of repair. Upon moving the trailer to the warehouse, Guzman, an experienced tire mechanic, and Roberts, a mechanic\u2019s helper, attempted to remove the two-piece wheel-assembly unit so that they could fix the broken wheel bolts. However, because Guzman and Roberts failed to deflate the tire before removing the interior bolts securing the two-piece wheel-assembly unit to the axle hub, something which Davis explicitly told Guzman to do, the unit exploded, killing Guzman instantly and causing Roberts to suffer significant injuries.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a result of this incident, appellants received workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">{\u00b6 4} Appellants filed suit against appellees, raising a number of claims, including, but not limited to, wrongful death and personal injury based on intentional tort and negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and products liability. Appellants also sought to recover punitive damages. Appellees moved for summary judgment on all claims, which, after holding a hearing on the matter, the trial court granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">{\u00b6 5} Appellants now appeal from the trial court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment to appellees, raising nine assignments of error for review. In addition, Bryan Davis, the lead mechanic, cross-appeals from the same decision, raising one assignment of error for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Summary-Judgment Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">{\u00b6 6} Summary judgment is a procedural device used to terminate litigation when there are no issues in a case requiring a formal trial. <em>Forste v. Oakview Const., Inc., </em>Warren App. No. CA2009-05-054, 2009-Ohio-5516, 2009 WL 3350450, \u00b6 7. On appeal, a trial court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment is reviewed de novo. <em>Touhey v. Ed\u2019s Tree &amp; Turf, L.L.C., </em>194 Ohio App.3d 800, 2011-Ohio-3432, 958 N.E.2d 212, \u00b6 7; <em>Creech v. Brock &amp; </em>Assoc. <em>Constr., </em>183 Ohio App.3d 711, 2009-Ohio-3930, 918 N.E.2d 541, \u00b6 9. In applying the de novo standard, a reviewing court is required to \u201cus[e] the same standard that the trial court should have used, and * *' * examine the evidence to determine whether as a matter of law no genuine issues exist for trial.\u201d <em>Bravard v. Curran, </em>155 Ohio App.3d 713, 2004-Ohio-181, 803 N.E.2d 846, \u00b6 9, quoting <em>Brewer v. Cleveland Bd. of Edn. </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 378, 383, 701 N.E.2d 1023.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">{\u00b6 7} A trial court may grant summary judgment only when (1) there is no genuine issue of any material fact, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) the evidence submitted can only lead reasonable minds to a conclusion that is adverse to the nonmoving party. See Civ.R. 56(C); <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 375 N.E.2d 46. The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of demonstrating that no genuine issue of material fact exists. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 292-293, 662 N.E.2d 264. Once this burden is met, the nonmoving party must then present evidence to show that there is some issue of material fact yet remaining for the trial court to resolve. <em>Smedley v. Discount Drug Mart, Inc., </em>190 Ohio App.3d 684, 2010-Ohio-5665, 943 N.E.2d 1078, \u00b6 11. In order to meet this burden, the nonmoving party \u201cmay not rest on the mere allegations of his pleading, but [its] response, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in Civ.R. 56, must set forth specific facts showing the existence of a genuine triable issue.\u201d <em>Golden v. Milford Exempted Village School Dist. Bd. of Edn., </em>Clermont App. No. CA2010-11-092, 2011-Ohio-5355, 2011 WL 4916588, \u00b6 20, quoting <em>Mootispaw v. Eckstein </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 383, 385, 667 N.E.2d 1197. In determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the evidence must be construed in the nonmoving party\u2019s favor. <em>Walters v. Middletown Properties Co., </em>Butler App. No. CA2001-10-249, 2002-Ohio-3730, 2002 WL 1625682, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">{\u00b6 8} We are mindful of this standard while addressing the following assignments of error.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">Assignment of Error No. 1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of appellants by granting the motion for summary judgment in favor of appellees RMB and BTI by misinter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>preting statutory and administrative laws governing professional employer organizations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">{\u00b6 10} In their first assignment of error, appellants argue that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to RMB and BTI as it relates to their wrongful-death and personal-injury negligence claims. In support of their argument, appellants claim that the trial court \u201ctook an impermissible short cut through this case by finding the [professional employer-organization] laws are only applicable to companies that \u2018specialize\u2019 in the leasing of employees.\u201d According to appellants, had the trial court properly applied the statutory and administrative laws governing professional-employer organizations to the case at bar, RMB and BTI would not be entitled to workers\u2019 compensation immunity under R.C. 4123.74. This argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cWhen construing a statute, the paramount concern is the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the statute.\u201d <em>Wilmington City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Clinton Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(2000), 141 Ohio App.3d 232, 239, 750 N.E.2d 1141, citing <em>State ex rel. Purdy v. Clermont Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 338, 340, 673 N.E.2d 1351. In order to determine the legislature\u2019s intent, the court must look to the statute itself, and \u201cif such intent is clearly expressed therein, the statute may not be restricted, constricted, qualified, narrowed, enlarged or abridged.\u201d <em>State ex rel. McGraw v. Gorman </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 147, 149, 478 N.E.2d 770, quoting <em>Wachendorf v. Shaver </em>(1948), 149 Ohio St. 231, 78 N.E.2d 370, paragraph five of the syllabus. In turn, a court must \u201cread words and phrases in context and construe them in accordance with rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d <em>Winkle v. Zettler Funeral Homes, Inc., </em>182 Ohio App.3d 195, 2009-Ohio-1724, 912 N.E.2d 151, \u00b6 53, quoting <em>State ex rel. Russell v. Thornton, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 409, 2006-Ohio-5858, 856 N.E.2d 966, \u00b6 11. A court, however, \u201cmust keep in mind that a strong presumption exists against any construction which produces unreasonable or absurd consequences.\u201d <em>Burdge v. Kerasotes Showplace Theatres, L.L.C., </em>Butler App. No. CA2006-02-023, 2006-Ohio-4560, 2006 WL 2535762, \u00b6 34, citing <em>State ex rel. Belknap v. Lavelle </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 180, 181-182, 480 N.E.2d 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">{\u00b6 12} The Ohio General Assembly passed Am.Sub.H.B. No. 183, 150 Ohio Laws, Part III,\u2019 4949, enacting R.C. Chapter 4125, effective November 5, 2004, requiring all \u201cprofessional employer organizations,\u201d organizations that provide human-resources management, employee benefits, payroll', and workers\u2019 compensation services, to, among other things, register with the administrator of workers\u2019 compensation and comply with workers\u2019 compensation laws. See 94 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (2011), Workers\u2019 Compensation, Section 75. \u201cProfessional employer organization,\u201d as defined by R.C. 4125.01(C), \u201cmeans a sole proprietor, partnership, association, limited liability company, or corporation that enters into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>an agreement with one or more client employers for the purpose of co-employing all or part of the client employer\u2019s workforce at the client employer\u2019s work site.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">{\u00b6 13} As a review of the statutory language found in R.C. Chapter 4125 reveals, the word \u201cprofessional,\u201d while defined in the context of the phrase \u201cprofessional employer organization,\u201d is not independently defined by the Revised Code. Without the benefit of further clarification, we find ambiguity as it relates to what may constitute a <em>\u201cprofessional </em>employer organization\u201d as defined by R.C. 4125.01(C). For example, do these provisions apply to all employer organizations that enter into coemployment agreements regardless of their core business services, or only those that otherwise provide human-resource services? In turn, having found ambiguity as to the meaning of \u201cprofessional,\u201d we must give the term its common and ordinary meaning unless the General Assembly has manifested a contrary legislative intent. See <em>Moore Personnel Serv., Inc. v. Zaino, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 337, 2003-Ohio-1089, 784 N.E.2d 1178, \u00b6 15 (when words are not defined in a statute, they are to be given their common and ordinary meaning, absent a contrary legislative intent).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cProfessional,\u201d as defined by Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, means, among other things, one who belongs to an \u201coccupation requiring a high level of training and proficiency.\u201d The common and ordinary meaning of the word \u201cprofession,\u201d the root of \u201cprofessional,\u201d is \u201ca calling requiring specialized knowledge and often long and intensive preparation.\u201d It follows, then, that in order to be considered a <em>\u201cprofessional </em>employer organization,\u201d the employer organization must specialize in coemploying all or part of its client employer\u2019s workforce at the client employer\u2019s work site. Our interpretation of \u201cprofessional,\u201d at least as it relates to the term \u201cprofessional employer organization,\u201d is confirmed when one consults with the final bill analysis of Am.Sub.H.B. No. 183 as promulgated by the Legislative Service Commission, which states that the General Assembly merely intended for the provisions found in R.C. Chapter 4125 to apply to those \u201cemployers that <em>specialize </em>in \u2018leasing\u2019 employees to other employers.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) As noted above, when construing a statute, the paramount concern is the legislature\u2019s intent. Therefore, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s decision finding R.C. Chapter 4125 \u201cwas intended to apply to those agencies and companies that \u2018specialize\u2019 in the leasing of employees to \u2018client\u2019 re-employers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>{\u00b6 15} It is undisputed that the sole purpose of BTI is to act as an over-the-road steel hauler. BTI has never held itself out as an expert in human-resource management, employee benefits, payroll, or workers\u2019 compensation services, nor has it otherwise specialized in leasing its employees to client employers. BTI was, and always has been, a corporation involved in the hauling of steel. In turn, while it may be true that BTI did lease its employees to RMB, its sister corporation, to provide its services at the AK Steel facility, the record is clear that this arrangement was created solely for the purpose of convenience and consolidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">{\u00b6 16} The trial court found, and we agree, that \u201cit was not the intent of the legislature, when it passed HB 183, to make the statute applicable to a sister corporation, who does not specialize in leasing employees to other employers, and who, for purpose of convenience and consolidation of human resources functions, performs the human resource function of the sister company.\u201d In turn, we find that BTI simply cannot be classified as a \u201cprofessional employer organization\u201d subject to the provisions found in R.C. Chapter 4125. To hold otherwise would be contrary to the legislature\u2019s true intent and would produce unreasonable and absurd consequences under the facts and circumstances of this case. This is particularly true considering that appellants had already received workers\u2019 compensation benefits resulting from this incident. Therefore, because this court\u2019s paramount concern is the legislature\u2019s intent, the trial court did not err by granting summary judgment in favor of RMB and BTI as it relates to appellants\u2019 wrongful-death and personal-injury negligence claims, for both RMB and BTI were entitled to workers\u2019 compensation immunity under R.C. 4123.74. Accordingly, appellants\u2019 first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Assignment of Error No. 2</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of appellants by granting the motion for summary judgment in favor of appellees RMB and BTI as a genuine issue of material fact exists precluding summary judgment on appellants\u2019 claims for intentional tort.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">{\u00b6 18} In their second assignment of error, appellants argue that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to RMB and BTI as it relates to their wrongful-death and personal-injury intentional-tort claims. Appellants also argue that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to RMB and BTI as it relates to their claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress. We address each of appellants\u2019 claims separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">Wrongful-Death and Personal-Injury Intentional-Tort Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">{\u00b6 19} As it relates to their wrongful-death and personal-injury intentional-tort claims, appellants argue that the trial court erred by granting summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>ment to RMB and BTI, because a genuine issue of material fact remains as to their \u201cactual and deliberate intent to cause injury.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">{\u00b6 20} Generally, \u201cactions for injuries sustained in the course of employment must be addressed within the framework of Ohio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation statutes.\u201d <em>Rijo v. Reading Rock, Inc., </em>Butler App. No. CA2007-09-223, 2008-Ohio-3385, 2008 WL 2635523, \u00b6 13, citing <em>Blankenship v. Cincinnati Milacron Chems., Inc. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 608, 614, 433 N.E.2d 572. However, in limited circumstances, when an employer\u2019s conduct is sufficiently egregious to rise to the level of an intentional tort, an employee may institute an intentional-tort claim against his employer under R.C. 2745.01, Ohio\u2019s Employer Intentional Tort statute. See <em>Barton v. G.E. Baker Constr., Inc., </em>Lorain App. No. 10CA009929, 2011-Ohio-5704, 2011 WL 5345400, \u00b6 7; see also <em>Ferryman v. Conduit Pipe Prods.

Instead, one may recover \u201cfor employer intentional torts only when an employer acts with specific intent to cause an injury.\u201d <em>Kaminski v. Metal Wire Prods.

Conversion Technologies Internatl., Inc., </em>Williams App. No. WM-10-016, 2011-Ohio-2960, 2011 WL 2436750, \u00b6 32. In addition, \u201cequipment safety guard,\u201d another term not defined by the Revised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Code, has been interpreted to encompass \u201csomething more than an actual physical structure or barrier erected between the employee and the danger\u201d as \u201ca device that is designed to shield the operator from exposure to or injury by a dangerous aspect of the equipment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 39-43; <em>Beary v.

Pease Co. </em>(July 9, 1990), Butler App. No. CA89-11-156, 1990 WL 94240, at fn. 2 (holding \u201cguard\u201d as defined by Ohio Administrative Code to mean \u201cthe covering, fencing, railing, or enclosure which shields an object from accidental contact\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">{\u00b6 23} Appellants initially argue that they are \u201centitled to a statutory presumption of intent under R.C. 2745.01(C) due to the removal of a safety guard.\u201d In support of their claim, appellants argue that because \u201cthe tire bead and bead taper on the rim were removed, directly contributing to the failure of the wheel assembly resulting in the explosion,\u201d a genuine issue of material fact remains whether RMB and BTI acted with the intent necessary to support their wrongful-death and personal-injury intentional-tort claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">{\u00b6 24} However, after a thorough review of the record, not only do we find that the tire bead and bead taper do not constitute \u201cequipment safety guards,\u201d we find the record devoid of any evidence indicating that RMB or BTI deliberately removed these alleged \u201csafety features\u201d from the wheel-assembly units. In fact, the trial court found, and we agree, that there is simply no evidence that RMB or BTI altered or modified the wheel-assembly unit in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">{\u00b6 25} Furthermore, while appellants claim that the removal of the tire bead and bead taper caused their injuries, the record clearly indicates that the direct and proximate cause of the explosion was not a result of the tire-bead and bead-taper removal, but instead was due solely to Guzman\u2019s and Roberts\u2019s failure to deflate the tire prior to servicing the wheel-assembly unit. In fact, as appellants\u2019 own expert witness testified, the \u201cexplosion doesn\u2019t occur\u201d if the air had been let out of the tire. Therefore, the presumption of intent to injure as provided by R.C. 2745.01(C) is simply not applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">{\u00b6 26} Despite this, appellants argue that the trial court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment to RMB and BTI was still improper because they provided \u201cno safety equipment\u201d and \u201cabsolutely no verifiable or consistent source of training, safety procedures, instructions, or warnings\u201d regarding the apparent dangers involved when servicing the wheel-assembly unit. However, even if we were to agree with appellants\u2019 reading of the record, none of these alleged deficiencies creates a genuine issue of material fact whether RMB and BTI acted with a deliberate intent to injure. Instead, these alleged failures constitute, at best, recklessness, a standard that falls well short of that which is required to maintain appellants\u2019 wrongful-death and personal-injury intentional-tort claims. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>See <em>Fickle, </em>2011-Ohio-2960, 2011 WL 2436750, at \u00b6 48 (finding failure to provide adequate training and safety devices not sufficient to establish deliberate intent to injure); <em>Jefferson v. Benjamin Steel Co., Inc., </em>Richland App. Nos. 09 CA 62, 09 CA 75, 2010-Ohio-50, 2010 WL 60121, \u00b6 112 (an employer\u2019s failure to follow proper safety procedures does not constitute intentional tort); see also <em>Davis v.

Therefore, because appellants cannot show that RMB or BTI acted with a deliberate intent to injure, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment to RMB and BTI as it relates to appellants\u2019 wrongful-death and personal-injury intentional-tort claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">{\u00b6 27} Regarding their intentional-infliction-of-emotional-distress claims, appellants argue that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to RMB and BTI, by \u201cmisapplying the standard set forth in R.C. 2745.01[D]\u201d and by finding that no genuine issue of material fact remained as to whether they \u201cengaged in extreme and outrageous conduct\u201d by \u201cordering\u201d appellants to service the wheel-assembly unit without \u201cproper training, procedures, equipment or supervision.\u201d However, even assuming that appellants are correct in their claim that the trial court misapplied R.C. 2745.01(D), their intentional-infliction-of-emotional-distress claims still fail, for the record is simply devoid of any evidence even remotely indicating that RMB and BTI acted in an extreme and outrageous manner intending to cause emotional distress. <em>Curry v. Blanchester, </em>Clinton App. Nos. CA2009-08-010, CA2009-08-012, 2010-Ohio-3368, 2010 WL 2807948, \u00b6 52, citing <em>Garrison v. Bobbitt </em>(1999), 134 Ohio App.3d 373, 378-379, 731 N.E.2d 216 (reiterating that intentional-infliction-of-emotional-distress claim requires showing of \u201cextreme and outrageous\u201d conduct). In fact, as the trial court found, and with which we certainly agree, \u201c[t]here are no facts supplied by [appellants] from which a reasonable trier of facts could conclude that [RMB and BTI\u2019s] conduct was \u2018extreme and outrageous,\u2019 much less that it transcended \u2018all possible bounds of decency.\u2019 \u201d Therefore, because appellants cannot show that RMB and BTI acted in an extreme and outrageous manner as a matter of law, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s decision granting RMB and BTI summary judgment on appellants\u2019 intentional-infliction-of-emotional-distress claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">{\u00b6 28} In light of the foregoing, because we find that no genuine issue of material fact remains as it relates to appellants\u2019 wrongful-death and personal-injury intentional-tort claims against RMB and BTI, nor any genuine issue of material fact as it relates to their claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Assignment of Error No. 3</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of appellants by granting the motion for summary judgment in favor of appellee Davis as a genuine issue of material fact exists as to his negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">{\u00b6 30} In their third assignment of error, appellants argue that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to Bryan Davis, Guzman\u2019s and Roberts\u2019s alleged supervisor, as it relates to their claims of negligence. In support of this claim, appellants argue that a \u201cjury should hear and decide for themselves whether the lack of training, lack of warnings, lack of instruction, lack of supervision and lack of safety were a proximate cause\u201d of their injuries. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">{\u00b6 31} Generally, in order to avoid summary judgment as it relates to their claim of negligence, appellants must show that (1) Davis owed Guzman and Roberts a duty of care, (2) Davis breached that duty of care, and (3) as a direct and proximate result of Davis\u2019s breach, they suffered injury. <em>Rigdon v. Great Miami Valley YMCA, </em>Butler App. No. CA2006-06-155, 2007-Ohio-1648, 2007 WL 1041432, \u00b6 11; <em>Ahmad v.

Estate of Carr </em>(Sept. 17, 2001), Butler App. No. CA2000-11-219, at 20, 2001 WL 1078980, quoting <em>Kemerer v. Antwerp Bd. of Edn. </em>(1995), 105 Ohio App.3d 792, 796, 664 N.E.2d 1380. Appellants\u2019 failure to prove any one of these elements would be fatal to their claim of negligence. <em>Whiting v. Ohio Dept. of Mental Health </em>(2001), 141 Ohio App.3d 198, 202, 750 N.E.2d 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">{\u00b6 32} In this case, it is undisputed that Davis told Guzman to deflate the tire before he and Roberts began servicing the wheel-assembly unit. As Davis testified, \u201c[T]he last thing I told [Guzman] before I walked out was to let the about of the tire.\u201d It is also undisputed that Guzman had worked on this type of wheel-assembly unit in the past and had even instructed other employees to deflate the tires before beginning any repairs. In addition, the record is clear that the explosion was due solely to Guzman\u2019s and Roberts\u2019s failure to deflate the tire before servicing the wheel-assembly unit. In fact, as noted previously, appellants\u2019 own expert witness testified that the \u201cexplosion doesn\u2019t occur\u201d if the air had been let out of the tire. In turn, even when construing the evidence in appellants\u2019 favor, we find no genuine issue of material fact to support appellants\u2019 claims that Davis\u2019s alleged negligence was the direct and proximate cause of their injuries. Therefore, because we find that no genuine issue of material fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>remains as it relates to appellants\u2019 claims of negligence levied against Davis, appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Assignment of Error No. 4</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of appellants by granting the motion for summary judgment in favor of appellees Bill Bowling and Don Bowling as a genuine issue of material fact exists as to their personal liability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">{\u00b6 34} In their fourth assignment of error, appellants argue that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to Bill and Don Bowling, the president and vice-president of RMB and BTI, as it relates to their claims of negligence. In support of this claim, appellants argue that granting summary judgment to Bill and Don Bowling was improper because a genuine issue of material fact remains as to whether they can be held personally liable for their injuries because of the \u201cutter failure to provide training on these wheel assemblies.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">{\u00b6 35} As this court has stated previously, \u201ca corporate officer can be held personally liable for tortious acts he or she has committed and, under such circumstances, a plaintiff need not pierce the corporate veil to hold individuals liable who have personally committed such acts.\u201d <em>Mohme v.

A corporate officer, however, \u201cmay not be held liable merely by virtue of his status as a corporate officer.\u201d <em>Mohme </em>at \u00b6 28. Rather, \u201c[t]he true basis of liability is the officer\u2019s violation of some duty owed to the third person which injures such third person.\u201d <em>Krieger Ford, Inc. v. Chase Motors, Inc. </em>(Aug. 3, 1999), Franklin App. No. 98AP-982, 1999 WL 561693, at *8. In other words, the evidence presented must indicate that the corporate officer \u201cspecifically directed the particular act to be done, or participated, or co-operated therein.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) <em>Young v. Featherstone Motors, Inc. </em>(1954), 97 Ohio App. 158, 171, 124 N.E.2d 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">{\u00b6 36} In this case, after a thorough review of the record, we agree with the trial court\u2019s decision finding the record devoid of any evidence indicating that Bill and Don Bowling \u201ctook part in the commission of the act which caused the accident, nor did they specifically direct the particular act to be done.\u201d Furthermore, even if we were to agree with appellants\u2019 claim that Bill and Don Bowling failed to provide proper training regarding the wheel-assembly units, the record clearly indicates that Davis, the decedents\u2019 alleged supervisor, told Guzman, an experienced tire mechanic who had worked on this type of wheel-assembly unit in the past, to deflate the tire before beginning the repairs. As noted previously, it was Guzman\u2019s and Roberts\u2019s failure to deflate the tire prior to servicing the wheel-assembly unit that caused the explosion. Therefore, we find no error in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>the trial court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment to Bill and Don Bowling as it relates to appellants\u2019 negligence claims. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Assignment of Error No. 5</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of appellants by granting the motion for summary judgment of [DTI] as genuine issues of material fact exists on all of appellants\u2019 product liability claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">{\u00b6 38} In their fifth assignment of error, appellants argue that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to DTI as it relates to their product-liability claims. In support of their claim, appellants argue that the wheel-assembly units found on the trailer designed by DTI contained a design defect \u201cand the defective design was a proximate cause of the explosion.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">{\u00b6 39} In any product-liability case, whether based in common law or statute, a plaintiff must prove that the alleged defective product proximately caused his injury. <em>Eastman v.

As noted above, proximate cause is \u201c \u2018that which in a natural and continued sequence contributes to produce the result, without which it would not have happened.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boettcher v.

While cause is ordinarily a question of fact for the jury, \u201c \u2018where no facts are alleged justifying any reasonable inference that the acts or failure of the defendant constitute the proximate cause of the injury, there is nothing for the jury [to decide], and, as a matter of law, judgment must be given for the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Aldridge v.

Miami Chevrolet Co. </em>(1930), 38 Ohio App. 41, 45-46, 175 N.E. 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">{\u00b6 40} In this case, just as the trial court found, and with which we agree, the record is \u201ctotally devoid of any evidence that any defect may have existed in the trailers when they were manufactured by [DTI] or that any breach of duties committed by [DTI], under the Ohio Products Liability Act, was the proximate cause\u201d of appellants\u2019 injuries. Instead, as we have previously stated, all the evidence presented in this matter makes it clear that the explosion occurred solely because Guzman and Roberts failed to deflate the tire before they began servicing the wheel-assembly unit. Therefore, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment to DTI as it relates to appellants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>product-liability claims. Accordingly, appellants\u2019 fifth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">Assignment of Error No. 6</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of appellants by granting the motion for summary judgment in favor of appellee Dempster by failing to recognize the duty Dempster owed to appellants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">{\u00b6 42} In their sixth assignment of error, appellants argue that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to DTS as it relates to their product-liability and negligence claims. However, as we have repeatedly stated, all the evidence presented in this matter makes it clear that the explosion occurred solely because Guzman and Roberts failed to deflate the tire before they began servicing the wheel-assembly unit. Furthermore, there is no evidence that DTS designed, manufactured, sold, or distributed the wheel-assembly unit or any evidence that the tires supplied to RMB used on the wheel-assembly unit were defective. Therefore, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment to DTS as it relates to appellants\u2019 product-liability and negligence claims. Accordingly, appellants\u2019 sixth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Assignment of Error No. 7</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of appellants by granting the motion for summary judgment in favor of appellee AK Steel as a genuine issue of material fact exists as to AK Steel\u2019s duty to Guzman and Roberts and breach thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">{\u00b6 44} In their seventh assignment of error, appellants argue that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to AK Steel as it relates to their premises-liability negligence claims. In support of this claim, appellants argue that AK Steel owed them a heightened duty based on its \u201csuperior knowledge\u201d and \u201cactive participation\u201d in RMB\u2019s activities within its facility. However, regardless of the duty owed, appellants were still required to show AK Steel\u2019s alleged negligence was the proximate cause of their injuries. See <em>Moore v. Eastgate Seafood, Inc. </em>(May 10, 1999), Clermont App. No. CA98-11-102, at 8, 1999 WL 296775, citing <em>Jeffers v. Olexo </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 140, 142, 539 N.E.2d 614 (finding it well settled that in order to establish a premises-liability negligence claim, one must show \u201cthe existence of a duty, a breach of that duty, causation, and damages\u201d). Again, all the evidence presented in this matter makes it clear that the explosion occurred solely because Guzman and Roberts failed to deflate the tire before they began servicing the wheel-assembly unit. Therefore, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s decision granting summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>judgment to AK Steel as it relates to appellants\u2019 premises-liability negligence claims. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s seventh assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Assignment of Error No. 8</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of appellants by finding Rodolfo Guzman\u2019s actions were the sole proximate cause of the explosion and thereby granting the motions for summary judgment in favor of appellees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">{\u00b6 46} In their eighth assignment of error, appellants argue that the trial court \u201cerroneously weighed evidence\u201d by finding the explosion occurred solely because Guzman and Roberts failed to deflate the tire before they began servicing the wheel-assembly unit. However, as we previously stated in appellants\u2019 third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh assignments of error, all the evidence presented in this matter makes it clear that the explosion occurred solely because Guzman and Roberts failed to deflate the tire before they began servicing the wheel-assembly unit. While appellants claim otherwise, we find that the trial court did not erroneously weigh the evidence to reach this conclusion. This is particularly true when reviewing appellants\u2019 own expert testimony, which, as noted above, indicates that the \u201cexplosion doesn\u2019t occur\u201d if the air had been let out of the tire. Therefore, appellants\u2019 eighth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">Assignment of Error No. 9</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-9\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of appellants by granting appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment on appellants\u2019 claims for punitive damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">{\u00b6 48} In their ninth assignment of error, appellants argue that the trial court erred by dismissing their claims for punitive damages. However, \u201c[i]t is well established that a claim for punitive damages cannot exist independently of the underlying cause of action for which it is sought.\u201d <em>Kill v. CSX Transp., </em>185 Ohio App.3d 291, 2009-Ohio-6871, 923 N.E.2d 1199, \u00b6 44; <em>Moskovitz v. Mt. Sinai Med. Ctr. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 638, 649, 635 N.E.2d 331. Therefore, because the trial court properly dismissed all claims advanced by appellants, their additional claim seeking punitive damages also fails. See, e.g., <em>Watson v. Ford Motor Co., </em>Erie App. No. E-06-074, 2007-Ohio-6374, 2007 WL 4216975, \u00b6 74.
