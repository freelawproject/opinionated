Grendell, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b634-16\">{\u00b6 1} Plaintiff-appellant and cross-appellee, Arrow Machine Co., Ltd., appeals the judgment entry of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas, denying its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, a motion for new trial. The issues before this court are as follows: (1) whether the jury\u2019s verdicts ought to have been set aside as mutually inconsistent, (2) whether Arrow Machine was entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) whether the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>court erred by instructing the jury, in the course of its deliberations, that certain conduct did not constitute a breach of contract. For the reasons that follow, we answer these propositions in the negative and, thus, affirm the judgment of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">{\u00b6 2} On July 31, 2008, Arrow Machine filed suit against defendant-appellee and cross-appellant, Array Connector Corp., for breach of contract. The complaint alleged that Arrow Machine is an Ohio limited-liability company with its principal place of business in Mentor, Ohio, and Array Connector is a Florida corporation, with its principal place of business in Miami, Florida. It was further alleged that in September 2007, Arrow Machine entered into a purehase-andsupply agreement with Array Connector, \u201cin the city of Mentor, Ohio,\u201d whereby \u201c[Arrow Machine] was to manufacture and sell to [Array Connector] certain goods; and [Array Connector] agreed to purchase from [Arrow Machine] minimum quantities of such goods at specified prices during the three (3) year term of the Agreement.\u201d Arrow Machine claimed that Array Connector breached the agreement by failing \u201cto purchase the minimum quantities of goods\u201d and by attempting \u201cto unilaterally terminate the Agreement, without cause.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">{\u00b6 3} On April 29, 2009, Array Connector filed its answer, affirmative defenses, and counterclaim. As the basis for its counterclaim, Array Connector alleged that Arrow Machine was in breach of contract \u201cby failing to fulfill the delivery requirements set forth within * * * the Agreement and by producing parts that were defective and/or non-conforming with the purchase order requirements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">{\u00b6 4} The case was tried before a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">{\u00b6 5} The following testimony and evidence was presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">{\u00b6 6} On September 14, 2007, John Habe IV, as president of Arrow Machine, and Robert Correa, as materials director for Array Connector, signed a purchase and supply agreement. The purpose of the agreement was to establish a \u201cbuy/sell business relationship\u201d between the parties. The agreement began on September 12, 2007, and was to continue in effect until December 31, 2010. An attachment to the agreement provided the pricing for four sizes of machine parts in quantities of 500 to 12,000 and for a \u201cproduction lead time\u201d of 12 weeks. There was a specified \u201cminimum quarterly quantity\u201d of 500 pieces of each of the four sizes. The agreement contained the following relevant provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>{\u00b6 7} \u201cThis agreement in no way guarantees the purchase of specific volumes of all or any item listed but does guarantee that the volume will be between the minimum and maximum listed on Attachment A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-4\">* * <em>%</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-5\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cSeller [Arrow Machine] agrees to an on time shipping performance of 98% defined as no more than 5 days early and 0 days late to the agreed schedule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">\u00ab * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cFailure to meet the requirements of this agreement will subject the agreement to possible termination at the discretion of the buyer [Array Connector]. This contract may be terminated by the buyer without liability to the buyer for failure by the seller to fulfill any or all agreement requirements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">{\u00b6 10} On December 3, 2007, Array Connector placed a purchase order for 12,000 pieces of each part. According to the terms of the agreement and the 12-week lead time set forth in the attachment, the parts were to be delivered between February 20, and 25, 2008. The purchase order specified that certain quantities of each part were needed \u201cASAP.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">{\u00b6 11} Periodic shipments of parts were made by Arrow Machine beginning in December 2007 and continuing through March 28, 2008. Arrow Machine\u2019s president, Habe, testified that Arrow Machine shipped parts as requested by Array Connector, through a senior buyer, Alexis Rone. Habe testified that Rone would contact Arrow Machine with a request for a given number of parts, typically for immediate shipment. These requests were made periodically and at varying intervals, both before and after the period between February 20 and 25. Correa, testifying on behalf of Array Connector, admitted that it was \u201cstandard practice\u201d for Rone to contact Arrow Machine and request parts, as needed, on a periodic basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">{\u00b6 12} Between December 2007 and March 2008, there were several occasions when Array Connector returned parts to Arrow Machine as defective. Some of these parts were determined to be conforming and some of these parts were corrected by Arrow Machine and reshipped to Array Connector. Ultimately, all parts were accepted by Array Connector.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">{\u00b6 13} Array Connector did not make a purchase order for the second quarter (April to June) of 2008. During this time, Habe advised Array Connector that pursuant to the agreement, a minimum quantity of parts had to be ordered each quarter. There was also some discussion between the parties about reducing the rate to be charged for orders of smaller quantities.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">{\u00b6 14} On June 23, 2008, Correa sent Habe the following e-mail: \u201cAfter a considerable amount of time and effort trying to figure out a solution to your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>price increase; we have no choice but to terminate our agreement dated 9/14/0[7] due to Array and Arrow\u2019s failure to agree on unit pricing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">{\u00b6 15} Correa testified that his primary reason for terminating the agreement was Arrow Machine\u2019s failure to deliver parts by February 25, 2008, as required by the agreement. In particular, there were two shipments of parts after February 25, 2008. In addition to late shipments, problems with quality were a significant issue. Correa testified that he attempted to negotiate for reduced pricing of small quantities as a way to continue with the agreement despite the quality and delivery issues. Correa admitted that he never advised Habe that he would terminate the agreement due to delivery or quality issues, although he did express his displeasure at the two late deliveries.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">{\u00b6 16} Habe testified that he was under the impression, from speaking with Rone, that Array Connector was not ordering parts because it did not need them. Habe confirmed that he was not made aware of Array Connector\u2019s claims regarding late deliveries and quality until about a year after filing suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">{\u00b6 17} On June 9, 2010, the jury returned a verdict against both parties with respect to their breach-of-contract claims, i.e., neither party had proven the other party to be in breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">{\u00b6 18} Following the delivery of the verdict, the trial court put the following on the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-8\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cFor the record, I wanted to put on the record that the jurors had a question during their deliberations. They initially sent one question back to the Court. I wasn\u2019t clear what it was they were asking so I did send Mr. Roberts back in to ask them to clarify that question. And they sent this question out, I will read it at this time for the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-9\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cThe question was: \u2018If Array accepts shipments early, is this a breach of contract?\u2019 The Court brought the parties in after I got the question.. It wasn\u2019t clear to the Court for certain which party the jurors were asking would be possibly in breach by accepting shipments early.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-10\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cSo the Court sent the question back to them, \u2018Is this a breach of contract by which party?\u2019 The jurors responded saying, \u2018By, Array.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">{\u00b6 22} The Court, after discussing with counsel for the parties said, \u2018No.\u2019 That it would not be a breach by Array if they accepted the shipments early. I don\u2019t know if either party wants to be heard, put anything on the record in that regard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">{\u00b6 23} Counsel for Arrow Machine responded that he was \u201ca little concerned about responding to it at all upon reflection.\u201d He added, \u201cOne of my concerns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>was that it creates a negative implication that if the answer is no as to Array, the answer would be yes as to Plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">{\u00b6 24} On June 24, 2010, Arrow Machine filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or in the alternative, a motion for a new trial. The basis for the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, pursuant to Civ.R. 50, was that reasonable minds, based on the evidence presented at trial, could only conclude that Array Connector had failed to perform its obligations under the agreement without justification and that, as a result, Arrow Machine had suffered damages. The basis for the motion for new trial, pursuant to Civ.R. 59(A)(6) and (7), was that the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence and contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">{\u00b6 25} On September 7, 2010, the trial court entered a judgment entry denying Arrow Machine\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">{\u00b6 26} On September 30, 2010, Arrow Machine filed a notice of appeal. On appeal, Arrow Machine raises the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-8\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c[1.] The trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-9\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c[2.] The trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s Alternate Motion for New Trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-10\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c[3.] The trial court erred by instructing the jury during jury deliberations that defendant\u2019s actions were not a breach of the agreement during jury deliberations [sic].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-11\">{\u00b6 30} On October 7, 2010, Array Connector filed a notice of cross-appeal. On cross-appeal, Array Connector raises the following assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-12\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c[1.] If this court determines that any error by the trial court resulted in an inconsistent verdict which merits the granting of any of Arrow\u2019s assignments of error, th[e]n the court should remand both Arrow\u2019s Complaint and Array\u2019s Counterclaim to the trial court for a new trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-13\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c[N]ot later than fourteen days after entry of judgment [following a jury trial], a party may move to have the verdict and any judgment entered thereon set aside and to have judgment entered in accordance with his motion; or if a verdict was not returned[,] such party, within fourteen days after the jury has been discharged, may move for judgment in accordance with his motion.\u201d Civ.R. 50(B); <em>Freeman v. Wilkinson </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 307, 309, 603 N.E.2d 993 (Civ.R.50(B) \u201conly applies in cases tried by jury\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-14\">{\u00b6 33} When considering a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, \u201c[t]he evidence adduced at trial and the facts established by admissions in the pleadings and in the record must be construed most strongly in favor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>party against whom the motion is made, and, where there is substantial evidence to support his side of the case, upon which reasonable minds may reach different conclusions, the motion must be denied.\u201d <em>Posin v. A.B.C. Motor Court Hotel, Inc. </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St.2d 271, 275, 344 N.E.2d 334. \u201cIn considering a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, a court does not weigh the evidence or test the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>Osler v. Lorain </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 345, 504 N.E.2d 19, syllabus; <em>Posin </em>at 275 (\u201c[njeither the weight of the evidence nor the credibility of the witnesses is for the court\u2019s determination\u201d). Thus, the question is whether there is sufficient evidence regarding a particular issue for the trial court to submit the issue to the jury for determination. <em>O\u2019Day v. Webb </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St.2d 215, 280 N.E.2d 896, paragraph four of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">{\u00b6 34} The question of whether a party is entitled to judgment notwithstanding the verdict is a question of law and, thus, requires a de novo review. <em>Environmental Network Corp. v. Goodman Weiss Miller, L.L.P., </em>119 Ohio St.3d 209, 2008-Ohio-3833, 893 N.E.2d 173, at \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">{\u00b6 35} Arrow Machine contends that it proved all the affirmative elements of a claim for breach of contract and that there was no evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">{\u00b6 36} As instructed by the trial court, the jury, in order to find for Arrow Machine, was required to find \u201cby the greater weight of the evidence that the parties entered into a contract, that [Array Connector] breached the contract by either failing to purchase the minimum quantities of goods after March 2008, or by terminating the agreement without reason allowed in the contract, and that [Arrow Machine] was not in material breach of the contract at the time of [Array Connector\u2019s] breach and had substantially performed its duties due under the contract at the time of [Array Connector\u2019s] breach.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">{\u00b6 37} It is undisputed that the parties entered into a contract and that Array Connector terminated that agreement in June 2008. It is also undisputed that Arrow Machine did not comply with the agreement\u2019s requirement of 98 percent on-time shipping in accordance with the 12-week lead time. Under the terms of the agreement, this failure provides Array Connector with the discretion to terminate the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">{\u00b6 38} Arrow Machine contends that it was not in material breach and/or had substantially performed its duties under the agreement on the grounds that (1) Array Connector accepted the purportedly untimely shipments and (2) the parties\u2019 course of conduct modified the agreement with respect to delivery. Contrary to Arrow Machine\u2019s position, the evidence presented at trial was not so overwhelming as to preclude reasonable minds from reaching different conclusions on the issues of the parties\u2019 course of conduct and Array Connector\u2019s acceptance of nonconforming goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>{\u00b6 39} According to Ohio\u2019s version of the Uniform Commercial Code, Array connector would be barred from \u201cany remedy,\u201d which includes repudiation of the Agreement, if it failed to notify Arrow Machine of the breach \u201cwithin a reasonable time.\u201d R.C. 1302.65(C)(1). The Section Notes to R.C. 1302.65 provide, \u201cThe content of the notification need merely be sufficient to let the seller know that the transaction is still troublesome and must be watched\u201d and need not \u201cinclude a clear statement of all the objections that will be relied on by the buyer.\u201d Moreover, the notification necessary to preserve the buyer\u2019s remedies \u201cneed only be such as informs the seller that the transaction is claimed to involve a breach, and thus [open] the way for normal settlement through negotiation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">{\u00b6 40} Likewise, the provisions governing installment contracts provide that when the nonconformity constitutes a breach of the whole agreement, \u201cthe aggrieved party reinstates the contract if he accepts a non-conforming installment without seasonably notifying of cancellation.\u201d R.C. 1302.70(C). The Section Notes here explain that \u201ca buyer who accepts a non-conforming installment which substantially impairs the value of the entire contract should properly be permitted to withhold his decision as to whether or not to cancel pending a response from the seller as to his claim for cure or adjustment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">{\u00b6 41} In the present case, Arrow Machine made two untimely deliveries of parts to Array Connector, on February 28 and March 28, 2008. Thereafter, Array Connector did not place any further purchase orders with Arrow Machine. While Array Connector never expressly notified Arrow Machine that it would terminate the agreement due to these breaches, it did express its dissatisfaction with Arrow Machine\u2019s failure to deliver in accord with the Agreement\u2019s 12-week lead time.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">{\u00b6 42} Correa testified that he had \u201cmultiple phone calls\u201d with Arrow Machine regarding delivery times in which he had expressed his displeasure with the late deliveries. Correa described the following conversation, as occurring with Habe:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-7\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cBased on Arrow\u2019s inability to meet the shipment schedule of 12,000 per quarter, we agreed \u2014 if we could, rather than order 12,000 from John Habe or Arrow Machine of each part number, can we order a smaller quantity to satisfy our customer\u2019s needs. And his response was, \u2018No. If you order a smaller quantity your pricing is going to go up.\u2019 So my response to that was, \u2018But really not my fault if you guys aren\u2019t making the date, everything is late. I want to kind of help out in this situation here, order smaller quantities, which you\u2019re able to supply us during the first contract.\u2019 Why would I pay a penalty or higher price for them not being able to produce the material?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">{\u00b6 44} In light of this testimony and the fact that Array Connector ceased issuing purchase orders, reasonable minds could conclude that Arrow Machine had been put on notice that it was in breach of the agreement\u2019s terms, and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>despite the acceptance of the nonconforming shipments, Array Connector preserved its right to terminate the contract. Cf. <em>Chemtrol Adhesives, Inc. v. Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 40, 54, 537 N.E.2d 624 (notice may be inferred and that \u201cnotice may be sufficient under the statute despite the fact that the notice does not specifically allege a breach of the contract\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">{\u00b6 45} Similarly, the evidence that Correa attempted to accommodate late deliveries by negotiating for reduced pricing while not issuing further purchase orders precludes the granting of a directed verdict in Arrow Machine\u2019s favor based on a course of performance and/or waiver of the contractual delivery time.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">{\u00b6 46} Regarding course of performance, the relevant provisions of the Revised Code provide: \u201cWhere the contract for sale involves repeated occasions for performance by either party with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it by the other, any course of performance accepted or acquiesced in without objection shall be relevant to determine the meaning of the agreement. * * * [S]uch course of performance shall be relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with such course of performance.\u201d R.C. 1302.11(A) and (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">{\u00b6 47} The evidence that Arrow Machine shipped the untimely orders at Array Connector\u2019s request and that these orders were accepted are \u201crelevant\u201d to the meaning of the agreement and the issues of waiver and/or modification; they are not determinative of these issues. Correa testified that he did not know whether Rone had actually requested shipments after February 25, 2008, but if she had, she was without authority to do so. Moreover, Correa affirmed that he expected Arrow Machine to comply with the agreement by delivering all the parts within the 12-week lead time provided therein. Finally, as noted above, Correa complained of the late deliveries directly to Habe. Given this record, the question of whether Array Connector acquiesced in late deliveries and/or a modification of the agreement to accommodate such deliveries was a disputed factual issue about which reasonable minds could differ. Thus, Arrow Machine was not entitled to a directed verdict on the basis of course of performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">{\u00b6 48} The first assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">{\u00b6 49} In the second assignment of error, Arrow Machine argues that the trial court erred by denying its motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">{\u00b6 50} As with a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, a motion for a new trial \u201cshall be served not later than fourteen days after the entry of the judgment.\u201d Civ.R. 59(B). A new trial may be granted where \u201c[t]he judgment is not sustained by the weight of the evidence\u201d and/or \u201c[t]he judgment is contrary to law.\u201d Civ.R. 59(A)(6) and (7).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-10\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cWhere a trial court is authorized to grant a new trial for a reason which requires the exercise of a sound discretion, the order granting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>new trial may be reversed only upon a showing of abuse of discretion by the trial court.\u201d <em>Rohde v. Fanner </em>(1970), 23 Ohio St.2d 82, 262 N.E.2d 685, paragraph one of the syllabus. However, \u201c[w]here a new trial is granted by a trial court, for reasons which involve * * * a decision on a question of law, the order granting a new trial may be reversed upon the basis of a showing that the decision was erroneous as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id., </em>paragraph two of the syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">{\u00b6 52} The basis of Arrow Machine\u2019s argument that the judgment is against the weight of the evidence and the law is the alleged inconsistency of the jury\u2019s verdict. Because the evidence that the parties had a binding contract is undisputed, Arrow Machine contends that Array Connector\u2019s failure to perform its obligations under the contract constitutes a breach, excusable only if Arrow Machine were already in material breach. The jury, however, found neither party to be in breach, which, according to Arrow Machine, is inconsistent with the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">{\u00b6 53} It has been held that \u201cOhio courts generally have intimated that material inconsistency within a general verdict in a civil action requires a reversal on appeal of the judgment, entered upon the verdict.\u201d (Citations omitted.). <em>Kaye Bros. Pet Supply Co. v. Calvon Corp., </em>8th Dist. No. 42083, 1980 WL 355381, at <em>*2; Kenney v. Fealko </em>(1991), 75 Ohio.App.3d 47, 53, 598 N.E.2d 861 (\u201ca trial court can order either a new trial or judgment notwithstanding the verdict when the jury renders conflicting verdicts on multiple claims or causes of action\u201d). \u201cHowever, relief from the verdicts will only be granted in this type of situation when the claims are so interrelated that the conflicting verdicts are illogical, given the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Kenney </em>at 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">{\u00b6 54} Arrow Machine\u2019s argument fails, in the first instance, because a party claiming that jury verdicts are legally inconsistent is \u201crequired * * * to raise the issue of inconsistencies before the jury is discharged, or to waive the objection.\u201d <em>Romp v. Haig </em>(1995), 110 Ohio App.3d 643, 647, 675 N.E.2d 10; <em>Kenney </em>at 54-55 (\u201c[t]he critical point is that the inconsistent verdicts constituted an error which could have been corrected if the issue had been properly brought to the trial court\u2019s attention\u201d). Here, there is no indication that Arrow Machine raised the argument that the verdicts were logically inconsistent prior to the jury\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">{\u00b6 55} Moreover, the allegedly conflicting verdicts are not illogical, per se. The jury\u2019s verdicts reflect the logical conclusion that neither party satisfied its burden of proving, \u201cby the greater weight of the evidence,\u201d that the other party was in breach.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the absence of jury interrogatories, Arrow Machine cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>demonstrate with certainty that the verdicts are logically inconsistent. Cf. <em>Redmond v. Socha </em>(2005), 216 Ill.2d 622, 646, 297 Ill.Dec. 432, 837 N.E.2d 883 (\u201cbecause the law demands that a plaintiff meet the burden of proving every necessary element of his claim by a preponderance of the evidence, a jury may find against both the plaintiff and the counterplaintiff in a negligence action, even when the evidence suggests that the sole cause of the accident was the negligence of either or both parties\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">{\u00b6 56} The second assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">{\u00b6 57} In the third and final assignment of error, Arrow Machine argues that the trial court erred by responding to the question raised by the jury during its deliberations, i.e., \u201cif Array accepts shipments early, is this a breach of contract?\u201d The trial court responded, \u201c[N]o * * * it would not be a breach by Array if they accepted the shipments early.\u201d Arrow Machine contends that by responding to this query, the trial court invaded the jury\u2019s province to decide the ultimate issues of the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">{\u00b6 58} The Ohio Supreme Court has often held that a trial court\u2019s charge to the jury \u201cought not only to be correct, but to be so adapted to the case and so explicit as not to be misconstrued or misunderstood by the jury in the application of the law to the facts as they may find them from the evidence.\u201d <em>Little Miami RR. Co. v. Wetmore </em>(1869), 19 Ohio St. 110, paragraph three of the syllabus; <em>Marshall v. Gibson </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 10, 12, 482 N.E.2d 583. This injunction has been similarly applied to a trial court\u2019s responses to questions posed by the jury. <em>Gallagher v. Cooper </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 41, 43-44, 471 N.E.2d 468. A party, however, waives the right to challenge a trial court\u2019s response by failing to object. <em>Id. </em>at 44; <em>State v. Carter </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 545, 553, 651 N.E.2d 965 (\u201cdefense counsel raised no objection to the trial court\u2019s response to the jury question, and the court acted within the scope of its discretion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">{\u00b6 59} In the present case, there is no evidence in the record that counsel for Arrow Machine objected to the trial court\u2019s response to the jury. Following the discharge of the jury, the trial court gave the parties the opportunity to \u201cput anything on the record\u201d regarding the response given to the jury. Counsel for Arrow Machine stated that he was \u201ca little concerned about responding to it at all upon reflection,\u201d since \u201cit creates a negative implication that if the answer is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>as to Array, the answer would be yes as to Plaintiff.\u201d Counsel offered nothing further with respect to the issue of the trial court\u2019s response.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">{\u00b6 60} Arrow Machine claims that this exchange \u201csuggests\u201d that counsel had protested responding to the jury\u2019s question when posed. We disagree. The trial court stated that it had discussed the matter with the parties prior to responding. If counsel for Arrow Machine had objected to or argued against responding, it was incumbent upon counsel to make a record of his opposition when given the opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">{\u00b6 61} The third assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">{\u00b6 62} In its sole assignment of error on cross-appeal, Array Connector argues that if this court were to reverse the judgment and remand for a new trial, it was entitled to a new trial as well on its counterclaim. As we are affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment, this assignment of error is rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">{\u00b6 63} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas denying Arrow Machine\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or in the alternative, a motion for a new trial, is affirmed. Costs are taxed against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b644-10\">Trapp and Wright, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-10\">. On October 22, 2008, the trial court dismissed the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction under Ohio's long-arm statute. That decision was subsequently reversed by this court in <em>Arrow Machine Co., Ltd. v. Array Connector Corp., </em>11th Dist. No. 2008-L-161, 2009-Ohio-1439, 2009 WL 806917.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b642-8\">. In this respect, the present case is distinguishable from those situations in which the verdicts were found to be legally inconsistent. See, e.g., <em>Kaye Bros., </em>1980 WL 355381, at *3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>(\"where, in a joint action by an insured and his subrogated insurer for damages, the jury returns a verdict for one plaintiff but not the other, and this finding is inconsistent with the evidence, * * * the verdict is invalid and must be set aside on appeal\u201d); <em>Miller v. Scott </em>(1952), 66 Ohio Law Abs. 308, 117 N.E.2d 179 (jury found in favor of both parties where the sole contested issue was whether the contract was performed \"in a workmanlike manner\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
