Roseberry, appeals his convictions. For the reasons that follow, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">{\u00b6 2} In August 2010, Roseberry was charged with one count each of aggravated burglary and kidnapping, each containing firearm and forfeiture specifications; one count of having weapons while under disability, with a forfeiture specification; and one count each of burglary, theft, and receiving stolen property. Roseberry waived his right to a jury trial, and the case was tried to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">{\u00b6 3} The victim, Danielle Adams, testified that Roseberry was her ex-boyfriend and that when they were dating, he stayed at her residence every night, kept personal belongings there, and had a house key. In the spring of 2010, they ended their relationship, but Roseberry still visited Adams at her home even though she had taken her key from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">{\u00b6 4} During the late hours of July 24 and early morning hours of July 25, while she was at work, Adams exchanged text messages with Roseberry. Over objection, Adams read out loud on direct examination her handwritten transcription of the exchanged text messages. Adams testified that the exchange between her and Roseberry was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-9\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cRoseberry: Man u did smething ill brak da window.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-10\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-11\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cAdams: Wht?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-12\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cRoseberry: I dnt wnt to brake nothing to get n and u blocked da door so I cant get n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-13\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-14\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cAdams: So you got my key huh</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-15\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-16\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cRoseberry: OK can u un block da door I dnt have no where to go</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-17\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cAdams: Y u say u didn\u2019t have the key</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-18\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cRoseberry: Cuz who wnt ti be left n da streets</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-19\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cRoseberry: Man pease dnt make me do smething I dnt wnt please open dat door</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-20\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cRoseberry: Man ima get n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-21\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cAdams: I hope u aint breakin no window</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>{\u00b6 18} \u201cAdams: Im at work go wit your best friend, he always got ur bck remember</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cRoseberry: I neva said that im tryna get away I don\u2019t wnt to do sht stupid so please let me n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cAdams: I said i\u2019m at work</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cRoseberry: Ok how do i get in\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">{\u00b6 22} Around noon on July 25, after receiving a call from her neighbor, Adams left work. When she arrived at her home, she saw that her front window had been broken, and she contacted the police. When the police arrived, Adams discovered that two televisions, two DVD players, a gaming system, and a window air conditioner had been stolen from her residence. Although she could not assess the value of the televisions, DVD players, or air conditioner, Adams testified that the value of the gaming system was $200.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">{\u00b6 23} Later on the evening of July 25, Roseberry used a key to gain access to Adams\u2019s home. Adams testified that she did not give Roseberry permission to use the key or enter her residence. According to Adams, when Roseberry entered her residence, he was holding a silver gun in his hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">{\u00b6 24} After a period of time, Adams drove Roseberry to get something to eat. Adams testified that she went with him because he had a gun, but she could not recall whether he took the gun with him when they left the residence. About 15 minutes later, when they returned to her residence, Adams sent a text message to her neighbor, telling him Roseberry was in her home with a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">{\u00b6 25} An East Cleveland police officer contacted Adams, and she discreetly informed the officer that Roseberry had a gun. The police arrived approximately five minutes later. According to Adams, when Roseberry realized that the police were outside the residence, he walked toward the back of the house. When he returned to the living room, he no longer had the gun in his hand. Roseberry then voluntarily exited the front door of the residence, was detained, and was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">{\u00b6 26} Officer Steve Kaleal testified that he responded to the breaking-and-entering call at approximately 12:40 p.m. on July 25. When he and his partner arrived at the residence, he observed that a front window had been pushed out. After taking an inventory of the property missing from the residence, he interviewed neighbors. Based on a conversation with the next-door neighbor, Roseberry was a named suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-12\">{\u00b6 27} Officer Robert Bailey testified that he responded to Adams\u2019s address on July 25 at 10:00 p.m. for a possible hostage situation. After Roseberry was detained, Officer Bailey entered the residence, spoke with Adams regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>weapon involved, and located a silver handgun in the toilet reservoir of the first-floor bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">{\u00b6 28} Lieutenant Matthew Balli testified that he made the initial contact with Adams and confirmed that she was being held at gunpoint by Roseberry. He testified that once the weapon was found, he ran the firearm\u2019s serial numbers through the National Crime Information System and the Law Enforcement Automatic Data System and learned that the firearm had been reported stolen out of the city of Strongsville.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">{\u00b6 29} Michael Shymske testified that he was the owner of the firearm that was recovered but that he had reported it stolen by an acquaintance in 2008. He testified that he did not know Roseberry and did not give Roseberry permission to possess or use the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">{\u00b6 30} The state\u2019s final witness was Detective Michael Delisle, who testified that he conducted an interview with Adams, during which she provided him with a written statement. Included with the written statement was a handwritten compilation of the text messages that Adams and Roseberry had exchanged on July 24 and 25. Detective Delisle testified that he viewed Adams\u2019s cell phone and took a series of photographs of the phone that had captured the text messages Adams indicated that she had exchanged with Roseberry. Detective Delisle said he took the photographs because he knew certain cell-phone companies saved text messages only for a limited period of time. The trial court, over objection, received the photographs of the text messages into evidence as state\u2019s exhibits 4 through 14. The photographs of the text messages included the content that Adams had previously testified to and read out loud in her direct testimony and additional text messages that had the following content:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-8\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cDid u break my window yet crazy</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-9\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cNot yet</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-10\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cU better not</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-11\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cHow do I get n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-12\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cIdk</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-13\">{\u00b6 36} 'Tea u do</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-14\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cWht time do u get off</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-15\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cI think 7</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-16\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cMan I hpe I dnt go to jail</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-17\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cJail 4 wht</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-18\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cDoin smething dumb\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>{\u00b6 42} At the close of testimony and evidence, the trial court found Roseberry not guilty of Count 1 \u2014 aggravated burglary, Count 2 \u2014 kidnapping, and Count 4\u2014 burglary, but guilty of the lesser included charge of breaking and entering, Count 3 \u2014 having weapons under disability, including the forfeiture specification, Count 6 \u2014 -receiving stolen property, and Count 7 \u2014 an amended count of misdemeanor theft. Roseberry was sentenced to an aggregate term of two years in prison. He appeals, raising three assignments of error, which will be addressed out of order.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">{\u00b6 43} In his first assignment of error, Roseberry contends that his convictions are not supported by sufficient evidence. The test for sufficiency requires a determination of whether the prosecution met its burden of production at trial. <em>State v. Bowden, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 92266, 2009-Ohio-3598, 2009 WL 2186608, \u00b6 12. The relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime(s) proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus. The Supreme Court of Ohio has held that when reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, an appellate court is to consider all the evidence admitted at trial, even if the evidence was improperly admitted. <em>State v. Brewer, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 202, 2009-Ohio-593, 903 N.E.2d 284, \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">{\u00b6 44} Roseberry was found not guilty of burglary, but guilty of the lesser included charge of breaking and entering in violation of R.C. 2911.13. This section provides, \u201cNo person by force, stealth, or deception, shall trespass in an unoccupied structure, with purpose to commit therein any theft offense * * * or any felony,\u201d and \u201cNo person shall trespass on the land or premises of another, with purpose to commit a felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">{\u00b6 45} The offense of breaking and entering requires that a defendant have the specific intent of trespassing with the purpose to commit a felony. See <em>State v. Copeland </em>(Jan. 18, 2002), Montgomery App. No. 18711, 2002 WL 63161 The purpose to commit a felony may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence. Furthermore, it is not necessary that the purpose to commit a felony be formed before or at the time the initial trespass or entry is achieved. <em>State v. Bowling </em>(Aug. 12, 1985), Clermont App. No. CA85-01-001, 1985 WL 7703, citing <em>State v. Jones </em>(1981), 2 Ohio App.3d 20, 440 N.E.2d 580 (the \u201cpurpose to commit a felony\u201d element in R.C. 2911.13(B) may be formed while the trespass is in progress, and the plan need not be formulated prior to the trespass).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">{\u00b6 46} It is well established that \u201c \u2018circumstantial evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction if that evidence would convince the average mind of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. McKnight, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 101, 2005-Ohio-6046, 837 N.E.2d 315, \u00b6 75, quoting <em>State v. Heinish </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 231, 238, 553 N.E.2d 1026. Circumstantial evidence carries the same weight as direct evidence. <em>Jenks, </em>61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492. Circumstantial evidence is proof of facts or circumstances by direct evidence from which the trier of fact may reasonably infer other related or connected facts that naturally or logically follow. <em>State v. Beynum </em>(May 23, 1996), Cuyahoga App. No. 69206, 1996 WL 273777.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">{\u00b6 47} From the facts of this case, it can be inferred that Roseberry\u2019s purpose in trespassing on Adams\u2019s residence was to commit a theft offense or a felony. Circumstantial evidence was presented that Roseberry had forcefully trespassed on the premises by breaking Adams\u2019s window to gain entrance' into the residence. In <em>State v. Flowers </em>(1984), 16 Ohio App.3d 313, 315, 475 N.E.2d 790, the court stated, \u201c[T]here is a reasonable inference that one who forcibly enters a dwelling * * * does so with the intent to commit a theft offense in the absence of circumstances giving rise to a different inference.\u201d In this case, it is reasonable, when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, to infer that Roseberry\u2019s purpose, either prior to or during the commission of breaking into Adams\u2019s residence, was to commit a theft offense. The text messages established that Roseberry had threatened to break Adams\u2019s window, had wanted to get inside her residence, and was concerned that he was going to go to jail for doing something \u201cdumb.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">{\u00b6 48} The text messages circumstantially prove that Roseberry gained entrance into the house, and an inference can be made that he subsequently removed the property. Moreover, Officer Kaleal testified that after speaking with Adams\u2019s neighbor, Roseberry was named a suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">{\u00b6 49} Viewing the evidence, whether properly admitted or not, in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we find that sufficient evidence was presented supporting Roseberry\u2019s conviction for breaking and entering.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">{\u00b6 50} Additionally, we find that sufficient evidence was presented to support Roseberry\u2019s conviction for theft. Pursuant to R.C. 2913.02(A)(1), regarding theft, \u201c[n]o person, with purpose to deprive the owner of property * * *, shall knowingly obtain or exert control over * * * property * * * [wjithout the consent of the owner or person authorized to give consent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">{\u00b6 51} Adams testified that when she left for work, the property that was subsequently removed was in her residence. When she returned home, the window was broken, and the property was missing. Officer Kaleal testified that he and his partner responded to Adams\u2019s residence and observed that her front window had been pushed out. As part of his investigation, he spoke to neighbors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>to see if anyone had observed anything. After interviewing the next-door neighbor, Roseberry became a suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">{\u00b6 52} This information obtained by Officer Kaleal, coupled with the text messages exchanged between Adams and Roseberry, provides enough circumstantial evidence to create an inference that Roseberry committed a theft offense inside Adams\u2019s residence. Accordingly, sufficient evidence was presented going to all the elements of the theft offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">{\u00b6 53} Roseberry was also convicted of having weapons while under disability, in violation of R.C. 2923.13(A)(3). This section provides: \u201c[UJnless relieved from disability * * *, no person shall knowingly acquire, have, carry, or use any firearm or dangerous ordnance, if * * * [t]he person is under indictment for or has been convicted of any offense involving the illegal possession, use, sale, administration, distribution, or trafficking in any drug of abuse * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">{\u00b6 54} In this case, Roseberry stipulated to a 2010 drug-trafficking conviction. Adams testified that Roseberry entered her apartment carrying a silver gun in his hand. When the police arrived at her residence, Adams observed Roseberry walk toward the back of the residence with the gun, and when he returned to the living room, he did not have the gun. Officer Bailey found a silver handgun in the toilet reservoir of the first-floor bathroom. The gun recovered was admitted into evidence, and Adams testified that she thought it was the gun Roseberry had \u2014 the gun was the same size and color. Adams also testified that she did not own the gun that was found in her home. This evidence was sufficient to establish that Roseberry had the firearm in violation of R.C. 2923.13(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">{\u00b6 55} Roseberry was also convicted of receiving stolen property in violation of R.C. 2913.51, which provides, \u201cNo person shall receive, retain, or dispose of property of another knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that the property has been obtained through commission of a theft offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">{\u00b6 56} In this case, sufficient evidence demonstrated that Roseberry received or retained the firearm and had reasonable cause to believe that the firearm was obtained through a theft offense. Lieutenant Balli testified that the gun found in Adams\u2019s residence was reported stolen in 2008 by Michael Shymske. Although Roseberry had no involvement with the theft of Shymske\u2019s gun, his conviction is supported by sufficient evidence because Roseberry\u2019s previous drug conviction prevented him from legally purchasing or obtaining a gun and therefore he would have reasonable cause to believe that the gun he possessed was stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">{\u00b6 57} Accordingly, Roseberry\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>\n<em>Evid.R. 803(5) and 901: Text Messages and Photographs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">{\u00b6 58} In his third assignment of error, Roseberry argues that the trial court erred by allowing testimony and admitting and receiving evidence of the alleged text messages between Adams and himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">{\u00b6 59} Evidentiary rulings made at trial rest within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Lundy </em>(1987), 41 Ohio App.3d 163, 535 N.E.2d 664; <em>State v. Graham </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 350, 390 N.E.2d 805. \u201cThe term \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 connotes more than an error of law or judgment. It implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d <em>Nielsen v. Meeker </em>(1996), 112 Ohio App.3d 448, 679 N.E.2d 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">{\u00b6 60} Roseberry first contends that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing Adams to read her handwritten transcription of the text messages out loud in open court on direct examination. The state argues that the trial court\u2019s ruling was proper pursuant to Evid.R. 803(5), but recognizes that the handwritten transcription could not be received as an exhibit into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">{\u00b6 61} Under Evid.R. 803(5) regarding hearsay exceptions, a recorded recollection is \u201c[a] memorandum or record concerning a matter about which a witness once had knowledge but now has insufficient recollection to enable him to testify fully and accurately, shown by the testimony of the witness to have been made or adopted when the matter was fresh in his memory and to reflect that knowledge correctly. If admitted, the memorandum or record may be read into evidence but may not itself be received as an exhibit unless offered by an adverse party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">{\u00b6 62} In order to admit a statement into evidence pursuant to Evid.R. 803(5), \u201ca party must establish that (1) the witness has a lack of present recollection of the recorded matter; (2) the recorded recollection was made at a time when the matter was fresh in the witness\u2019s memory; (3) the recorded recollection was made or adopted by the witness; and (4) the recorded recollection correctly reflects the prior knowledge of the witness.\u201d <em>Dayton v. Combs </em>(1993), 94 Ohio App.3d 291, 300, 640 N.E.2d 863.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">{\u00b6 63} In this case, Adams testified that when she went to the police station, she took her cell phone and wrote down the text messages exchanged between her and Roseberry the night of July 24 through July 25. On direct examination, Adams stated that she could not recall the exact content of the messages she received, but when she wrote down the text messages, her recollection of the content of the text messages was fresh in her mind. When presented with the handwritten list, Adams also positively identified it as her transcribed compilation of the text messages exchanged between her and Roseberry. She testified that she knew the text messages were coming from Roseberry\u2019s phone because she knew his cell number at the time, although she admitted that she currently could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>not recall the number. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing Adams to read the series of text messages out loud pursuant to Evid.R. 803(5), and the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the handwritten compilation as an exhibit was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">{\u00b6 64} Roseberry also contends that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing Adams to read the handwritten list of compiled text messages because the list was not properly authenticated.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">{\u00b6 65} Under Evid.R. 901(A), \u201c[t]he requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\u201d This rule invokes a very low threshold standard, requiring only sufficient foundational evidence for the trier of fact to conclude that the item is what the proponent claims it to be. <em>State v. Craycraft, </em>Clermont App. Nos. CA200902-013 and CA2009-02-014, 2010-Ohio-596, 2010 WL 610601, \u00b6 35. This standard is less demanding than preponderance of the evidence. Id., citing <em>State v. Winfield </em>(Feb. 7, 1991), Ross App. No. 1641, 1991 WL 28291. The proponent must demonstrate only a \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d that the evidence is authentic, which may be supplied by the testimony of a witness with knowledge. Evid.R. 901(B); <em>State v. Bell, </em>Clermont App. No. CA2008-05-044, 2009-Ohio-2335, 2009 WL 1395857, \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">{\u00b6 66} We find that the handwritten list was properly authenticated by Adams because she was the person who created the list, and she testified that the list was, in fact, her handwritten list of the text messages exchanged between Roseberry and herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">{\u00b6 67} Roseberry\u2019s final challenge to the text messages is that the trial court abused its discretion in (1) allowing Detective Delisle to testify regarding the photographs he took of Adams\u2019s cell phone and (2) ultimately admitting and receiving the photographs and their written content into evidence. The state argues that the photographs were properly admitted and received into evidence as photographs and were properly authenticated under Evid.R. 901.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">{\u00b6 68} Again, evidence is properly authenticated under Evid.R. 901 when the evidence is sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what the proponent claims it to be. Evid.R. 901(A); <em>Craycraft, </em>2010-Ohio-596, 2010 WL 610601. For photographs, a witness with personal knowledge of the subject of the photographs may authenticate them- by testifying that the photographs fairly and accurately depict the subject at the time they were taken. <em>State v. Hannah </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 84, 88, 374 N.E.2d 1359.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>{\u00b6 69} In this case, Detective Delisle testified that he viewed Adams\u2019s cell phone and text messages and took photographs of those text messages. At trial, when the prosecutor showed him the photographs, state\u2019s exhibits 4-14, Detective Delisle agreed that the photographs appeared \u201cto be a fair and accurate copy of the text messages from Miss Adams\u2019[s] phone on the date that [he] took those photos.\u201d Accordingly, we find that the photographs were properly authenticated by Detective Delisle.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">{\u00b6 70} However, we find that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the photographs of the text messages that Adams did not testify to, i.e., state\u2019s exhibits 11 through 14, because the content contained in the photographs is inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">{\u00b6 71} Hearsay \u201cis a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Evid.R. 801(C). A statement can be a written assertion. Evid.R. 801(A). Statements made outside the courtroom, offered at trial to prove the truth of what they assert, are generally inadmissible as hearsay unless an exception applies. Evid.R. 801(C); Evid.R. 802; <em>State v. DeMarco </em>(1987), 81 Ohio St.3d 191, 195, 509 N.E.2d 1256.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">{\u00b6 72} In this case, the photographs contained out-of-court written statements. The state was not using the photographs to show that Adams had a cell phone that received text messages, but to show the written content of the text messages allegedly exchanged between Adams and Roseberry to prove that Roseberry had committed the offenses of breaking and entering and theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">{\u00b6 73} The photographs, state\u2019s exhibits 4 through 14, showed the content of the text messages between Adams and Roseberry. Adams testified and recited the content of the text messages contained in exhibits 4 through 10, identifying which text messages she sent and which were sent by Roseberry. Therefore, the text messages sent by Roseberry rendered the content of conversation not hearsay pursuant to Evid.R. 801(D)(2), which provides that statements that are offered against a party and are the party\u2019s own statements are not hearsay. Therefore, Roseberry\u2019s statements in the text messages that Adams testified to were admissible as admissions by a party-opponent under Evid.R. 801(D)(2)(a). Accordingly, state\u2019s exhibits 4-10, the photographs containing content of what Adams previously testified to were properly authenticated and not hearsay; thus admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">{\u00b6 74} However, the content of the text messages contained in other exhibits 11 through 14 are hearsay because they contain out-of-court statements used to prove the truth of the matter asserted, specifically that Roseberry had committed the acts of breaking and entering and theft. Unlike the photographs that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>contained the content that Adams had previously testified to, Detective Delisle did not have knowledge of the content of the text messages. He did not testify that he knew Roseberry\u2019s cell phone or that he could determine from the cell phone which messages were sent or received and by whom. The only method of identifying the \u201cspeakers\u201d and deciphering the content of those text messages was through what Adams told Detective Delisle because nothing within the text messages independently indicated the senders or speakers of the text messages. Therefore, the hearsay exception under Evid.R. 801(D)(2)(a) cannot be used for these exhibits to be received into evidence. Accordingly, we find that the trial court abused its discretion in receiving these photographs of the text messages, state\u2019s exhibits 11 through 14, into evidence through Detective Delisle\u2019s testimony alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">{\u00b6 75} We note that in most cases involving electronic print media, i.e., texts, instant messaging, and e-mails, the photographs taken of the print media or the printouts of those conversations are authenticated, introduced, and received into evidence through the testimony of the recipient of the messages. See <em>Bell, </em>2009-Ohio-2335, 2009 WL 1395857, and <em>Craycraft, </em>2010-Ohio-596, 2010 WL 610601. Thus, the state could have properly admitted the photographs through Adams\u2019s testimony because she was the recipient of the text messages, had personal knowledge of the content, and could identity of the sender of the messages.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">{\u00b6 76} We also find that the admission of these exhibits was not harmless error and contributed to Roseberry\u2019s conviction for breaking and entering and theft. Pursuant to Crim.R. 52(A), \u201c[a]ny error, defect, irregularity, or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.\u201d To find an error harmless, a reviewing court must be able to declare a belief that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Lytle </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 391, 403, 358 N.E.2d 623. A reviewing court may overlook an error where the remaining admissible evidence, standing alone, constitutes \u201coverwhelming\u201d proof of a defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 281, 290, 452 N.E.2d 1323. \u201cWhere there is no reasonable possibility that unlawful testimony contributed to a conviction, the error is harmless and therefore will not be grounds for reversal.\u201d <em>State v. Brown </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 483, 485, 605 N.E.2d 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">{\u00b6 77} In this case, the state needed to prove that Roseberry had forcefully trespassed on Adams\u2019s property to commit a theft offense or felony and that he had subsequently committed an act of theft. Reviewing all the testimony given at trial and the content of text messages sent, the content in state\u2019s exhibits 11 through 14 was necessary to establish the state\u2019s case. Within those exhibits, the following texts were exchanged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-8\">{\u00b6 78} \u201cDid u break my window yet crazy</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>{\u00b6 79} \u201cNot yet</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">{\u00b6 80} \u201cU better not</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-6\">{\u00b6 81} \u201cHow do I get n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">{\u00b6 82} \u201cIdk</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-8\">{\u00b6 83} \u2018Yea u do</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-9\">{\u00b6 84} \u201cWht time do u get off</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-10\">{\u00b6 85} \u201cI think 7</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-11\">{\u00b6 86} \u201cMan I hpe I dnt go to jail</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-12\">{\u00b6 87} \u201cJail 4 wht</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-13\">{\u00b6 88} \u201cDoin smething dumb\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-14\">{\u00b6 89} Prior to the admission of the text-message photographs, Adams\u2019s testimony established only that Roseberry had threatened to break her window to gain entrance, but did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that his purpose for breaking the window was to take any property or commit any felony offense, and no evidence was presented linking him to the removal of Adams\u2019s property. From Adams\u2019s testimony, an inference could be drawn that Roseberry\u2019s purpose in breaking the window was merely to find a place to stay (\u201cOK can u un block da door I dnt have no where to go,\u201d \u201cCuz who wnt ti be left n da streets\u201d). The subsequent inadmissible text messages established that Roseberry was going to break the window (\u201cNot yet\u201d) and was concerned about going to jail (\u201cMan I hpe I dnt go to jail\u201d [for] \u201cDoin smething dumb\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-15\">{\u00b6 90} Moreover, Adams\u2019s testimony alone does not establish that Roseberry took the property from her residence. It cannot be inferred that Roseberry was the person who removed the items from Adams\u2019s residence merely because he threatened to break the window. It is the subsequent inadmissible text messages that create the inference that he was going to break the window and was concerned about going to jail for doing something \u201cdumb.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-16\">{\u00b6 91} We cannot say that the trial court\u2019s decision in receiving the inadmissible text messages was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt or that absent the inadmissible text messages, the remaining evidence constitutes overwhelming proof of Roseberry\u2019s guilt supporting his convictions for breaking and entering and theft. Therefore, the error was not harmless, but prejudicial, and it deprived Roseberry of a fair trial. Thus, we find that the trial court abused its discretion in receiving those exhibits into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-17\">{\u00b6 92} Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing Adams to read her handwritten compilation of text messages under Evid.R. 803(5) or in receiving state\u2019s exhibits 4 through 10 into evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>However, we find that state\u2019s exhibits 11 through 14 were improperly admitted, and the error deprived Roseberry of a fair trial on the breaking-and-entering and theft charges; thus, a new trial on those charges is warranted. Roseberry\u2019s third assignment of error is sustained in part and overruled in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\n<em>Manifest Weight of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">{\u00b6 93} In his second assignment of error, Roseberry argues that his convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence. Having concluded that Roseberry was deprived of a fair trial regarding his convictions for breaking and entering and theft, thus warranting a new trial, we will address this assignment of error only as it pertains to his convictions for having weapons while under disability and receiving stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">{\u00b6 94} A manifest-weight challenge questions whether the prosecution met its burden of persuasion. <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 79, 80, 434 N.E.2d 1356. A reviewing court may reverse the judgment of conviction if it appears that the trier of fact \u201c \u2018clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541, quoting <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 485 N.E.2d 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">{\u00b6 95} Based on the record before us, the trial judge did not lose his way in convicting Roseberry for having weapons while under disability and receiving stolen property. The weight of the evidence demonstrated that Roseberry had a firearm in his possession on the evening of July 25. Adams testified that when Roseberry realized the police were at her residence, he walked to the back of the house. The officers searched the house and recovered a stolen firearm from the toilet reservoir, which Adams identified as the gun that Roseberry had had in his possession when he entered her residence. Furthermore, the legal owner of the firearm testified that he did not give Roseberry permission to use or possess his firearm, which was stolen in 2008. Because Roseberry had been previously convicted of a drug offense, he could not obtain a firearm legally; therefore, he had reasonable cause to believe the firearm was stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">{\u00b6 96} Accordingly, Roseberry\u2019s remaining convictions are not against the manifest weight of the evidence. His second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">{\u00b6 97} The judgment is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for a new trial on the breaking-and-entering and theft charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">Judgment affirmed in part, and reversed in part and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b306-12\">S.
