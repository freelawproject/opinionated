Hoskins Jr.\u2019s, motion to suppress, filed on March 8, 2011. A hearing was held on the motion on April 28, 2011. On June 22, 2011, the trial court issued a written decision sustaining the motion. The state filed a timely notice of appeal with this court on June 29, 2011. For the following reasons, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">{\u00b6 2} The incident that forms the basis for the instant appeal occurred on January 14, 2011, at approximately 7:25 p.m., when Detective Chad Knight of the Dayton Police Department observed a small four-door sedan drive past him in the parking lot of a Taco Bell restaurant located on Salem Avenue in Dayton, Ohio. Detective Knight was performing \u201cunmarked reconnaissance\u201d of the area as part of his assignment as a member of the Community Initiative to Reduce Gun Violence Task Force (\u201cCIRGV\u201d). The CIRGV Task Force is a multijurisdictional unit consisting of deputies from the Montgomery County Sheriffs Office, the Dayton Police Department, the Trotwood Police Department, the Montgomery County Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s Office, and the FBI Street Task Force to help reduce gun, gang, and drug violence in Montgomery County. Detective Knight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>testified that he was initially parked in the Taco Bell lot in order to observe a nearby business named Gina\u2019s Liquor, known for being a local gang hangout and a high-crime area where violence was prevalent.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">{\u00b6 3} As the sedan backed out in front of him and headed out of the Taco Bell parking lot, Knight observed that the driver of the vehicle pulled out of the lot very quickly and did not signal his turn onto the street. Knight also testified that the small sedan was loaded down with several passengers. He began following the sedan. Because his unmarked vehicle was not equipped with a police computer, Knight radioed the sedan\u2019s license-plate number to nearby uniformed officers for identification. Dayton Police Officers Alex MacGill and Dustin Phillips entered the license-plate number into their police computer. Officer Phillips testified that a check of the license-plate number revealed that the sedan had been reported as stolen, and he immediately so informed Detective Knight.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">{\u00b6 4} Moments later, the sedan was stopped and surrounded by several police cruisers. Multiple officers approached the sedan and removed the five occupants of the vehicle. At the time he was removed from the sedan, defendant-appellee Hoskins was located in the rear passenger seat directly behind the driver. Officer Phillips testified that he removed Hoskins from the sedan and laid him facedown on the ground with his feet pointed towards the vehicle. All four doors of the sedan were open at this point. While Hoskins was lying on the ground, Officer MacGill removed the front-seat passenger from the sedan on the opposite side of the vehicle. Officer MacGill testified that before he patted the passenger down, he stated in a \u201cloud, controlling voice,\u201d \u201c[D]o you have guns or knives on you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">{\u00b6 5} Officer MacGill\u2019s inquiry prompted Hoskins to roll over, look up at Officer Phillips, and acknowledge that he had a handgun in his pocket. Officer Phillips testified that he removed a .38-caliber handgun from Hoskins\u2019s front pants pocket. Hoskins had not been Mirandized when he informed Officer Phillips that he had a handgun in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">{\u00b6 6} Hoskins was subsequently arrested and charged with carrying a concealed weapon and improperly handling a firearm in a motor vehicle. At his arraignment on March 17, 2011, Hoskins stood mute, and the trial court entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf. Hoskins filed a motion to suppress on March 8, 2011. After a hearing held on April 28, 2011, the trial court ordered the parties to submit posthearing briefs. On June 22, 2011, the trial court issued a decision sustaining Hoskins\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">{\u00b6 7} It is from this decision that the state now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">{\u00b6 8} The state\u2019s sole assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-6\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cHoskins\u2019 statement to police about having a gun was admissible in the absence of <em>Miranda </em>warnings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">{\u00b6 10} In its sole assignment, the state contends that the trial court erred by sustaining Hoskins\u2019s motion to suppress and finding that he was subjected to a custodial interrogation without the benefit of <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Specifically, the state argues that the trial court erred when it found that Officer MacGill should have known that his question to the front-seat passenger regarding weapons was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from Hoskins.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">{\u00b6 11} In regard to a motion to suppress, \u201c \u2018the trial court assumes the role of trier of facts and is in the best position to resolve questions of fact and evaluate the credibility of witnesses.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Hopfer </em>(1996), 112 Ohio App.3d 521, 548, 679 N.E.2d 321, quoting <em>State v. Venham </em>(1994), 96 Ohio App.3d 649, 653, 645 N.E.2d 831. The court of appeals must accept the trial court\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by competent, credible evidence in the record. <em>State v. Isaac, </em>Montgomery App. No. 20662, 2005-Ohio-3733, 2005 WL 1707019, citing <em>State v. Retherford </em>(1994), 93 Ohio App.3d 586, 639 N.E.2d 498. Accepting those facts as true, the appellate court must then determine, as a matter of law and without deference to the trial court\u2019s legal conclusion, whether the applicable legal standard is satisfied. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\"> {\u00b6 12} The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o person * * * shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d \u201cThe Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination \u2018protects against any disclosures that the witness reasonably believes could be used in a criminal prosecution or could lead to other evidence that might be so used.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist. Court of Nevada, Humboldt Cty. </em>(2004), 542 U.S. 177, 190, 124 S.Ct. 2451, 159 L.Ed.2d 292, quoting <em>Kastigar v. United States </em>(1972), 406 U.S. 441, 445, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 32 L.Ed.2d 212; <em>Ohio v. Reiner </em>(2001), 532 U.S. 17, 20, 121 S.Ct. 1252, 149 L.Ed.2d 158. \u201cThe right to <em>Miranda </em>warnings is grounded in the Fifth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against compelled self-incrimination.\u201d <em>State v. Strozier, </em>172 Ohio App.3d 780, 2007-Ohio-4575, 876 N.E.2d 1304, \u00b6 16, citing <em>Moran v. Burbine </em>(1986), 475 U.S. 412, 420, 106 S.Ct. 1135, 89 L.Ed.2d 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>{\u00b6 13} A suspect who volunteers information, and who is not even asked any questions, is not subject to a custodial interrogation and is not entitled to <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>State v. McGuire </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 390, 401, 686 N.E.2d 1112, citing <em>State v. Roe </em>(1989), 41 Ohio St.3d 18, 22, 535 N.E.2d 1351. In other words, <em>\u201cMiranda </em>does not affect the admissibility of \u2018[vjolunteered statements of any kind.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 436, 478, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694; <em>State v. Montgomery, </em>Montgomery App. No. 23870, 2010-Ohio-5047, 2010 WL 4132213, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">{\u00b6 14} Conversely, Hoskins had been removed from the sedan and placed, facedown, on the ground with his hands behind his back by Officer Phillips. Under these circumstances, a reasonable person would not have felt free to leave. Additionally, it is very doubtful that any of the police officers present would have allowed Hoskins to leave. Accordingly, Hoskins was in custody for the purposes of <em>Miranda. </em>Thus, any police interrogation should have been preceded by <em>Miranda </em>warnings and the subject\u2019s waiver of the rights those warnings involve. The issue presented is whether Officer MacGill\u2019s question regarding the presence of weapons constituted a form of police interrogation that he should have known was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from Hoskins, who was located nearby on the other side of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\"> {\u00b6 15} \u201c \u2018Interrogation\u2019 includes express questioning as well as \u2018any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Strozier, </em>172 Ohio App.3d 780, 2007-Ohio-4575, 876 N.E.2d 1304, at \u00b6 20, quoting <em>Rhode Island v. Innis </em>(1980), 446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297. \u201cInterrogation\u201d must reflect \u201ca measure of compulsion above and beyond that inherent in custody itself.\u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 300, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297. \u201cPolice officers are not responsible for unforeseeable incriminating responses.\u201d <em>State v. Waggoner, </em>Montgomery App. No. 21245, 2006-Ohio-844, 2006 WL 441622, \u00b6 14; <em>Strozier </em>at \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cIn <em>Innis, </em>the defendant was arrested for an armed robbery involving a shotgun; at the time of his arrest, Innis was unarmed. Innis was given <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and he invoked his right to speak with a lawyer. While three officers transported Innis to the police station, one of the officers began talking to another officer regarding the missing shotgun. One of the officers stated that there were \u2018a lot of handicapped children running around in this area\u2019 because a school for such children was nearby, and \u2018God forbid one of them might find a weapon with shells and they might hurt themselves.\u2019 With that, Innis insisted on showing the officers where he had concealed the shotgun. He subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>moved to suppress that evidence. The trial and appellate courts denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cOn review, the United States Supreme Court held that the statements the officers made were not ones which they should have known were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. There was no express questioning, and nothing in the record indicated that the officers were aware that the defendant was \u2018particularly susceptible to an appeal to his conscience concerning the safety of handicapped children,\u2019 or that he was \u2018unusually disoriented or upset\u2019 when the statements were made. Though some \u2018subtle compulsion\u2019 was present, the Court concluded that the officers\u2019 words did not constitute interrogation.\u201d <em>State v. Fair, </em>Montgomery App. No. 24120, 2011-Ohio-3330, 2011 WL 2584234.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">{\u00b6 18} In <em>State v. Waggoner, </em>Montgomery App. No. 21245, 2006-Ohio-844, 2006 WL 441622, the defendant and his companions had been ordered out of the vehicle, and the defendant had been arrested on an outstanding warrant. Under those circumstances, we found that the record did not support a finding that the arresting officer should have known that when he asked the defendant whether there was \u201cany other property of his in the vehicle,\u201d he would have elicited an incriminating response from the defendant. Thus, we held that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not required before the officer questioned the defendant regarding any objects left in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">{\u00b6 19} <em>Innis </em>and <em>Waggoner, </em>however, are clearly distinguishable from the facts present in the instant case. After the sedan had been stopped and the occupants removed from the vehicle, Hoskins was placed by Officer Phillips face down on the ground with his feet pointing towards the vehicle. All of the vehicle\u2019s doors were open as well. The officers had no particularized basis upon which to suspect that any of the occupants of the vehicle were armed. When he began questioning the suspect that he removed from the front passenger seat, Officer MacGill inquired in a \u201cloud, controlling voice\u201d about weapons. At that point, Officer Phillips testified that he had not spoken to Hoskins, who was lying face down on the ground. Officer Phillips, however, admitted that he could clearly hear Officer MacGill\u2019s question on the other side of the vehicle. It is reasonable to find that under these circumstances, as the trial court concluded, Hoskins thought that he was being asked a question by Officer MacGill, and he felt compelled to answer. We also accept the trial court\u2019s finding that Officer MacGill should have been aware that his question was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from Hoskins who was in such close proximity face-down. Thus, Hoskins\u2019s statement regarding the handgun in his possession was obtained in violation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Accordingly, the trial court did not err when it sustained Hoskins\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">{\u00b6 20} The state\u2019s sole assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>hi</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">(\u00b6 21} The state\u2019s sole assignment of error having been overruled, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b676-7\">Froelich, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b676-8\">Hall, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-10\">. We note that the state does not contest the trial court's conclusion that the \"public safety exception\u201d to <em>Miranda </em>was inapplicable to the instant case. We also note that the state essentially conceded during oral arguments on November 29, 2011, that the police officers did not have a reasonable, articulable suspicion that the occupants of the sedan were armed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b676-9\">Froelich, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A7o\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">{\u00b6 22} I concur in the judgment to affirm the decision of the trial court, all the while not disagreeing with some of the statements in the dissent. This was an extremely fact-sensitive situation and the trial court made specific findings that I cannot say are, as a matter of law, not supported by the record.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b676-11\">Hall, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A3-\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-12\">{\u00b6 23} When several occupants are removed from a confirmed stolen automobile, I fail to see how an officer\u2019s loud question \u201cDo you have any knives, weapons, guns or anything like that in your possession?\u201d directed to a removed front-seat passenger on one side of the vehicle, which was apparently overheard by a rear driver\u2019s side passenger, on the other side of the vehicle, constitutes custodial interrogation of the rear driver\u2019s side passenger. I would reverse the trial court\u2019s granting of the motion to suppress Hoskins\u2019s statement that he had a firearm in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-13\">{\u00b6 24} In determining whether Hoskins was \u201cinterrogated,\u201d the trial court indicated that \u201cthe focus must be primarily upon the perceptions of Hoskins.\u201d The trial court then concluded that \u201cHoskins reasonably believed the question had been posed to him * * <em>Id. </em>The problem with this conclusion is that it is speculation. Hoskins did not testify at the motion hearing. What he \u201creasonably believed\u201d is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-14\">{\u00b6 25} I am also of the opinion that the testimony of the officers that they were stopping a confirmed stolen vehicle, after dark and in an area where officers deal with violent gang members and where \u201c[s]tolen vehicles, lot of times, have people that are armed or with any various types of weapons,\u201d supports the notion that the officers could constitutionally pat down each of the occupants of the vehicle. Stopping a stolen vehicle is not an ordinary traffic stop. It is not the time for hesitation or polite discourse. The great likelihood is that a felony is being committed by one, and perhaps all, of the occupants. The stop is fraught with danger with great potential for flight and risk of injury or even death. However, in this case, the state, erroneously in my opinion, conceded that the officers did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>not have the right to pat down the occupants of the car. Thus, I do not include the public-safety exception to <em>Miranda </em>as part of the basis of my disagreement.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
