We affirm the juvenile court\u2019s visitation decision, finding that the juvenile court had jurisdiction to consider the visitation request and that the father waived his other arguments when he failed to object to the magistrate\u2019s decision, but vacate the juvenile court\u2019s property order as being without jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-18\">{\u00b6 2} K.P.R. lived with his mother and stepfather, and the father exercised parenting time. The boy\u2019s parents were never married, and the stepfather was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>part of the child\u2019s life for 13 years and was married to the child\u2019s mother for 11 years. The mother died suddenly in August 2010, while K.P.R. was visiting with the father. The boy remained in the father\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">{\u00b6 3} In September 2010, the stepfather filed a motion in juvenile court for custody or for visitation. The juvenile court magistrate issued a 14-page decision that indicated that the stepfather was not seeking custody at that time but wanted a set schedule for visitation. The magistrate noted that the father said he did not oppose visitation but didn\u2019t want a set schedule and wanted to control the amount of visitation. The magistrate awarded visitation for the stepfather in conformance with the juvenile court\u2019s \u201cBasic Parenting Schedule, Basic I.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">{\u00b6 4} While no order is part of the record provided to this court, it appears that the court permitted the father to take some of KJP.R.\u2019s belongings from the stepfather\u2019s home after the mother\u2019s death. The father also removed furniture from KP.R.\u2019s room at the same time. The magistrate ordered the father to return to the stepfather the bed, mattress, box springs, dresser with mirror, and nightstand.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">{\u00b6 5} The juvenile court adopted the decision on the same day it was filed. Neither party objected to the magistrate\u2019s decision. This appeal was taken by the father, raising six assignments of error for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">{\u00b6 6} The first question that this court must address is the consequence of the father\u2019s failure to file objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. The father\u2019s appellate counsel argues that the father was precluded from filing objections with the juvenile court because the juvenile court adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision. The juvenile rules, as outlined below, clearly indicate otherwise. Moreover, the magistrate\u2019s decision contained a number of paragraphs at the end of the decision that outlined the procedures under Juv.R. 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">{\u00b6 7} A party may file written objections to a magistrate\u2019s decision within 14 days of the filing of the decision, whether or not the court has adopted the decision during that 14-day period as permitted by Juv.R. 40(D)(4)(e)(i). Juv.R. 40(D)(3)(b)\u00ae; see comparable rules of Civ.R. 53 and Crim.R. 19. A magistrate\u2019s decision is not effective unless adopted by the court. Juv.R. 40(D)(4)(a). If no timely objections are filed, the court may adopt a magistrate\u2019s decision, unless it determines that there is an error of law or other defect evident on the face of the magistrate\u2019s decision. Juv.R. 40(D)(4)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">{\u00b6 8} The court may enter a judgment either during the 14 days permitted by Juv.R. 40(D)(3)(b)\u00ae for the filing of objections to a magistrate\u2019s decision or after the 14 days have expired. Juv.R. 40(D)(4)(e)\u00ae. If the court enters a judgment during the 14 days permitted by Juv.R. 40(D)(3)(b)\u00ae for the filing of objections, the timely filing of objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision operates as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>automatic stay of execution of the judgment until the court disposes of those objections and vacates, modifies, or adheres to the judgment previously entered. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">{\u00b6 9} Juv.R. 40(D)(3)(b)(iv) provides: \u201cExcept for a claim of plain error, a party shall not assign as error on appeal the court\u2019s adoption of any factual finding or legal conclusion * * * unless the party has objected to that finding * * * as required by Juv.R. 40(D)(3)(b).\u201d This waiver under the rule embodies the long-recognized principle that the failure to draw the trial court\u2019s attention to possible error when the error could have been corrected results in a waiver of the issue for purposes of appeal. <em>In re C.P., </em>Brown App. No. CA2010-12-025, 2011-Ohio-4563, 2011 WL 4012400.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">{\u00b6 10} This court previously ruled that unless the appellant argues a \u201cclaim of plain error,\u201d the appellant has waived the claimed errors not objected to below. See <em>State v. Shie, </em>Butler App. No. CA2007-02-038, 2008-Ohio-350, 2008 WL 296395, \u00b6 45 (this court has construed a similar provision in Civ.R. 53 literally and found that where a party fails to expressly raise a claim of plain error on appeal, we need not consider whether plain error exists); <em>In re D.R., </em>Butler App. No. CA2009-01-018, 2009-Ohio-2805, 2009 WL 1655409, \u00b6 30 (appellant did not specifically object to the magistrate\u2019s foregoing finding and does not claim plain error here and is thereby precluded from raising this issue on appeal); <em>Allgeier v. Allgeier, </em>Clinton App. No. CA2009-12-019, 2010-Ohio-5313, 2010 WL 4340650, \u00b6 22-23 (by failing to raise the issue in his objection, or argue plain error in his brief, appellant is prohibited from challenging the court\u2019s custody determination for the first time on appeal); <em>In re C.P., </em>2011-Ohio-4563, 2011 WL 4012400, at \u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">{\u00b6 11} Accordingly, the father has waived most, but not all, of his assignments of error by failing to object to the magistrate\u2019s decision. Two of the father\u2019s assignments of error \u2014 the first and sixth \u2014 challenge the subject-matter jurisdiction of the juvenile court, and the fifth assignment of error will be incorporated into the first assignment of error. The issues raised in those assignments will be discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">{\u00b6 12} Assignment of Error No. 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-9\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe trial court erred in not dismissing the stepfather\u2019s motion for custody.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">{\u00b6 14} In this assignment of error, the father argues that the juvenile court did not have jurisdiction over a case filed under the nonparent-visitation statute of R.C. 3109.11 and because the stepfather originally requested custody, jurisdiction did not extend to issues of visitation only.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>{\u00b6 15} It is axiomatic that subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be waived, cannot be conferred upon a court by agreement of the parties, and may be the basis for sua sponte dismissal. <em>Carroll Cty. Bur. of Support v. Brown </em>(Nov. 6, 2001), Carroll App. No. 00AP0742. Lack of subject-matter jurisdiction is not a waivable defense and may be raised for the first time on appeal. Id. Subject-matter jurisdiction focuses on the court as a forum and on the case as one of a class of cases, not on the particular facts of a case or the particular tribunal that hears the case. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">{\u00b6 16} The stepfather filed a motion for custody or for parenting time. The father argues that the juvenile court is a court of limited jurisdiction, possessing only those powers the Ohio General Assembly conferred upon it. Section 4(B), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution. The father\u2019s argument principally relies on a statute and an Ohio Supreme Court case.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">{\u00b6 17} Specifically, the father cites R.C. 2151.23, which states that a juvenile court has jurisdiction to determine the custody of any child not a ward of another court of this state. He also relies on the Ohio Supreme Court case of <em>In re Gibson </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 168, 573 N.E.2d 1074. In <em>Gibson, </em>a grandfather sought visitation with a child whose married parents were living but had denied him visits. The <em>Gibson </em>grandfather tried unsuccessfully to argue that R.C. 2151.23 permitted a request for visitation to be addressed under the umbrella of custody matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">{\u00b6 18} The <em>Gibson </em>court said that visitation and custody are related but distinct concepts. The <em>Gibson </em>court found that in a case in which a nonparent (grandparent) sought only visitation, a juvenile court may not determine that issue pursuant to its authority to determine custody of children under R.C. 2151.23(A)(2). Id. at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">{\u00b6 19} The <em>Gibson </em>court further noted three statutes that permit nonparental visitation: R.C. 3109.051 (nonparent visits may be granted in cases involving divorce, dissolution of marriage, legal separation, annulment, or child-support proceedings that involve a child) and 3109.11 (nonparent visits may be granted in cases involving persons related to a child\u2019s deceased parent); and \u201c[i]n one departure from the \u2018disruptive precipitating event\u2019 principle, R.C. 3109.12 has been added to allow grandparental visitation in the case of \u2018a child * * * born to an unmarried woman.\u2019 \u201d Id., 61 Ohio St.3d at 170, 573 N.E.2d 1074.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">{\u00b6 20} The <em>Gibson </em>court found that the circumstances in its case did not meet the criteria of R.C. 3109.12 and that no disruptive precipitating event had occurred in its case to fall under 3109.11 or 3109.051.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">{\u00b6 21} In the case at bar, <em>Gibson </em>does not preclude the juvenile court from hearing the stepfather\u2019s motion for visitation, because this case involves a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>disruptive precipitating event, namely, the mother\u2019s death. The juvenile court recognized that R.C. 3109.11 gave it the authority to consider the stepfather\u2019s request for visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">{\u00b6 22} R.C. 3109.11 states: \u201cIf either the father or mother of an unmarried minor child is deceased, the court of common pleas of the county in which the minor child resides may grant the parents and other relatives of the deceased father or mother reasonable companionship or visitation rights with respect to the minor child during the child\u2019s minority if the parent or other relative files a complaint requesting reasonable companionship or visitation rights and if the court determines that the granting of the companionship or visitation rights is in the best interest of the minor child. In determining whether to grant any person reasonable companionship or visitation rights with respect to any child, the court shall consider all relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the factors set forth in division (D) of section 3109.051 of the Revised Code. Divisions (C), (K), and (L) of section 3109.051 of the Revised Code apply to the determination of reasonable companionship or visitation rights under this section and to any order granting any such rights that is issued under this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">{\u00b6 23} If the stepfather qualifies as a \u201crelative\u201d under R.C. 3109.11, he could ask the juvenile court in this case to entertain his request for visitation. The father challenges in his fifth assignment of error whether the stepfather has standing as a relative under R.C. 3109.11. Since the issue of whether the stepfather is a relative capable of using R.C. 3109.11 to invoke the jurisdiction of juvenile court, we will address the issue of whether the stepfather is a relative for purposes of the statute. See <em>State ex rel. Jones v. Suster </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 70, 77, 701 N.E.2d 1002, fn. 4 (the term \u201cjurisdiction\u201d has different meanings depending upon the context in which it is used and the subject matter to which it is directed; standing is jurisdictional only in limited cases involving administrative appeals, where parties must meet strict standing requirements in order to satisfy the threshold requirement for the administrative tribunal to obtain jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">{\u00b6 24} The Ninth Appellate District in <em>Goeller v. Lorence, </em>Lorain App. No. 06CA008883, 2006-Ohio-5807, 2006 WL 3159406, found that by using the term \u201crelative,\u201d the legislature in R.C. 3109.11 had not differentiated between relationships by consanguinity and relationships by affinity. Id. at \u00b6 16; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004) 63, 322 (\u201caffinity,\u201d in part, is a relationship by marriage, and \u201cconsanguinity,\u201d in part, is relationship of persons of the same blood or origin); see <em>McFall v. Watson, </em>178 Ohio App.3d 540, 2008-Ohio-5204, 899 N.E.2d 158; <em>In re R.V., </em>190 Ohio App.3d 313, 2010-Ohio-5050, 941 N.E.2d 1216, \u00b6 13-15 (paternal grandmother was relative of grandchildren\u2019s deceased mother by affinity and could seek visitation under visitation statute); <em>In re LaPiana, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Cuyahoga App. Nos. 93691 and 93692, 2010-Ohio-3606, 2010 WL 3042394 (\u201crelative\u201d includes persons related by consanguinity and persons related by affinity, and relationships by affinity are generally those created by marriage, such as father-in-law or mother-in-law, or stepparent [Rocco, P.J., dissenting on a separate issue]); see <em>In re Sadie Elizabeth S., </em>Fulton App. No. F-05-028, 2006-Ohio-2928, 2006 WL 1580041, \u00b6 78 (standing issue did not arise when stepgrandparent moved for visitation).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">{\u00b6 25} The stepfather here is related by affinity, as the spouse of the child\u2019s mother. The father now argues that the stepfather is a former relative because the stepfather\u2019s wife is deceased. This argument is rejected on the basis of <em>Goeller, </em>which indicated that the widow of the child\u2019s parent who remarried was still related by affinity, since that person was still the deceased parent\u2019s widow. See id. at \u00b6 12, 13, (death did not sever relationship by affinity with spouse; stepparent had standing as a relative to request visitation even though he remarried after the death of his spouse, the child\u2019s mother). In this case, the stepfather is the deceased parent\u2019s widow. Therefore, the stepfather had standing to move for visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">{\u00b6 26} Accordingly, the stepfather is a relative who could request visitation under R.C. 3109.11, and the juvenile court had jurisdiction to consider the motion. The father\u2019s first and fifth assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">{\u00b6 27} Assignment of Error No. 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cThe trial court erred in granting parenting time pursuant to Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 3109.51(d).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">{\u00b6 29} Assignment of Error No. 3:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-10\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cThe court did not give the parent\u2019s wishes sufficient weight in allowing parenting time with a stepfather.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">{\u00b6 31} Assignment of Error No. 4:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-12\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cThe court erred in the amount of parenting time it awarded to the stepfather.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-13\">{\u00b6 33} Based on the father\u2019s failure to raise these issues in objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision and his failure to claim plain error on appeal, the father waives any error for his second, third, and fourth assignments of error, and those assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-14\">{\u00b6 34} Assignment of Error No. 6:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-15\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cThe juvenile court erred in deciding property issues.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-16\">{\u00b6 36} The father argues that the juvenile court had no jurisdiction to determine \u201cproperty settlements\u201d in this visitation case. This assignment of error is based on the juvenile court\u2019s order that the father return furniture he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>had removed from the child\u2019s room at the mother and stepfather\u2019s home after the death of the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">{\u00b6 37} The father again cites R.C. 2151.23, which defines juvenile court jurisdiction, for his argument that the court had no authority to order that property be turned over to him in the first place and also did not have jurisdiction to order that the furniture be returned to the stepfather.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">{\u00b6 38} The original order is not part of the record provided to this court. However, we rely on two cases to assist this court in finding that the juvenile court did not have jurisdiction over the property at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">(\u00b6 39} In <em>Miller ex rel. Lafountain v. McMichael, </em>Paulding App. No. 11-03-08, 2003-Ohio-6713, 2003 WL 22939494, \u00b6 11, the appellant asked the juvenile court to determine whether compensation for the use of decedent\u2019s furniture was an asset of decedent\u2019s estate. The Third Appellate District found that the probate court had exclusive jurisdiction to decide questions of title to claimed assets of the estate and that the appellant\u2019s additional requests had \u201cto do with the disposition of [deceased\u2019s] property, and, thus, [were] matters for the probate court to determine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">{\u00b6 40} The appellate court said that there was no authority granting a juvenile court jurisdiction to determine matters of a decedent\u2019s estate. \u201cThus, while the Paulding County Probate Court would have had jurisdiction to determine whether Appellee\u2019s support arrearages were an asset of Miller\u2019s estate, the Paulding County Juvenile Court lacked such jurisdiction. Accordingly, the judgment in this case must be vacated.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) Id. at \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">{\u00b6 41} <em>In re Gerken </em>(Nov. 9, 1990), Wood App. No. WD-90-9, 1990 WL 174324, the Sixth Appellate District did not find that it was \u201cwithin a juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction to order that the personal property of an abused child, held by another, be returned to such child. A cause of action for wrongfully held property, while certainly recognized as a valid claim for which relief can be granted in this state, must be brought in the court having jurisdiction over such action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">{\u00b6 42} In the case at bar, we cannot locate any authority giving the juvenile court jurisdiction to order the disposition of property from the mother and stepfather\u2019s home. The father\u2019s sixth assignment of error is sustained, and the juvenile court\u2019s order to return the furniture to the stepfather is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">{\u00b6 43} The judgment is affirmed as to the juvenile court\u2019s visitation order and vacated as to the order requiring the father to return furniture to the stepfather.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">Judgment affirmed in part and vacated in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b234-13\">Ringland and Hendrickson, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
