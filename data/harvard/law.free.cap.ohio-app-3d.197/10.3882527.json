On appeal, appellant contends that he was deprived of his right to due process when his trial attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, appellant contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at his sentencing when his counsel failed to move the trial court to waive the payment of court costs based upon his indigency and that that deficiency prejudiced him.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">{\u00b6 2} In light of our determination that trial counsel\u2019s performance was both deficient and prejudicial with respect to the failure to move the trial court to waive the payment of court costs, we sustain appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error. Accordingly, we remand this matter to the trial court for resentencing as to court costs, at which time counsel may then make a proper motion for waiver of those costs based upon appellant\u2019s indigency.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">{\u00b6 3} An indictment was filed on March 23, 2009, charging appellant with one count of aggravated vehicular homicide, a second-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2903.06(A)(1)(a). After determining appellant to be indigent, the trial court appointed counsel to represent appellant on June 25, 2009. On November 10, 2010, a jury convicted appellant of the charged offense, and a sentencing hearing was held on November 23, 2010. The trial court sentenced appellant to a five-year prison term, a lifetime driver\u2019s license suspension, a mandatory three-year period of postrelease control, and court costs. The trial court did not impose a fine upon appellant based upon \u201cthe Court\u2019s assessment of [appellant\u2019s] ability to pay a fine.\u201d It is from the trial court\u2019s December 8, 2010, judgment entry of sentence that appellant now brings his timely appeal, setting forth a single assignment of error for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">Assignment of Error</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-11\">\u201cI. Bennie Rowe was deprived of his right to due process when his trial attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>LEGAL ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">{\u00b6 4} In his first assignment of error, appellant contends that he was deprived of his right to due process when his trial attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, appellant questions whether trial counsel is ineffective when he or she fails to move the trial court to waive the imposition of court costs and the mandatory minimum fine on behalf of an indigent defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">{\u00b6 5} To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an appellant must show that (1) his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced his defense so as to deprive him of a fair trial. <em>State v. Drummond, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.2d 1038, at \u00b6 205, citing <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. To establish deficient performance, an appellant must show that trial counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective level of reasonable representation. <em>State v. </em>Conway, 109 Ohio St.3d 412, 2006-Ohio-2815, 848 N.E.2d 810, at \u00b6 95. To establish prejudice, an appellant must show that a reasonable probability exists that but for the alleged errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Id. </em>The appellant has the burden of proof on the issue of counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness because a properly licensed attorney is presumed competent. <em>State v. Gondor, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, 860 N.E.2d 77, at \u00b6 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">{\u00b6 6} R.C. 2947.23(A)(1) states: \u201cIn all criminal cases, including violations of ordinances, the judge or magistrate shall include in the sentence the costs of prosecution and render a judgment against the defendant for such costs.\u201d Court costs may, however, be waived in the discretion of the court if the court first determines that the defendant is indigent. See R.C. 2949.092; <em>State v. White, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 580, 2004-Ohio-5989, 817 N.E.2d 393, fn. 1. The court may grant a waiver of court costs only if the defendant makes a motion at the time of sentencing. <em>State v. Clevenger, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 258, 2007-Ohio-4006, 871 N.E.2d 589, at \u00b6 5, citing <em>State v. Threatt, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 277, 2006-Ohio-905, 843 N.E.2d 164, paragraph two of the syllabus. If the defendant fails to make a motion to waive court costs at the time of sentencing, \u201cthe issue is waived and [the matter of] costs [is] res judicata.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">{\u00b6 7} In <em>State v. Blade, </em>Cuyahoga App. Nos. 88703, 88704 and 88705, 2007-Ohio-5323, 2007 WL 2875133, the trial court held that trial counsel \u201chad an essential duty to seek a waiver of court costs at the time of sentencing.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 12, citing <em>In re Carter, </em>Jackson App. Nos. 04CA15 and 04CA16, 2004-Ohio-7285, 2004 WL 3090250 (finding ineffective assistance of counsel and remanding for re-sentencing as to court costs where trial counsel failed to move the court for waiver of court costs for indigent defendant). In <em>Blade, </em>the record indicated that the court \u201chad previously waived the imposition of court costs against Blade\u201d and that there was \u201cnothing in the record of the resentencing to show a change in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Blade\u2019s circumstances from the earlier waiver of costs.\u201d <em>Blade </em>at \u00b6 12. Thus, based upon those facts, <em>Blade </em>held that the prior waiver of court costs showed a reasonable probability that it would have again waived costs had counsel made a timely motion. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 13. Thus, the trial court sustained Blade\u2019s argument and vacated the trial court\u2019s assessment of court costs. <em>Id. </em>In <em>In re Carter </em>at \u00b6 44, this court determined that trial counsel\u2019s failure to move the trial court for waiver of court costs was both deficient and prejudicial, and therefore, the appellant\u2019s assignment of error was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">{\u00b6 8} More recently, in <em>State v. Smith, </em>Warren App. No. CA2010-06-057, 2011-Ohio-1188, 2011 WL 882182, however, the Twelfth District Court of Appeals rejected an identical argument. In reaching its conclusion, the court reasoned, based upon the facts before it, that Smith had \u201cfailed to show that there is a reasonable probability that the trial court would have waived those costs even if his counsel had asked the court to do so, since the trial court found that while Smith was currently unable to pay the court costs and the cost of his court-appointed counsel, he was young and healthy enough to work and thus would be able to pay those costs in the future.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 64, citing <em>State v. Hayden, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 90474, 2008-Ohio-6279, 2008 WL 5084716, \u00b6 18-19. Thus, the facts in <em>Smith </em>differed from the facts in <em>Blade </em>with regard to the appellant\u2019s ability to pay and the probability that the trial court would have waived court costs if a motion to do so had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">{\u00b6 9} We conclude that the facts sub judice are more similar to facts in <em>Blade </em>than to those in <em>Smith. </em>First, appellant was determined to be indigent and was appointed counsel for trial, and there is nothing in the record to indicate that appellant\u2019s circumstances had changed at the time of sentencing. Further, as argued by appellant, the trial court did not impose a fine at sentencing, based upon its \u201cassessment of [appellant\u2019s] ability to pay a fine.\u201d Additionally, at the sentencing hearing, appellant\u2019s trial counsel represented to the trial court that appellant was without funds to pursue an appeal. In light of the foregoing, there was a good probability that if moved to do so, the trial court would have waived the payment of the court costs. Further, based upon these facts, we find trial counsel\u2019s performance both deficient and prejudicial. Consequently, we sustain appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error and remand this matter to the trial court for resentencing as to court costs. <em>In re Carter, </em>2004-Ohio-7285, 2004 WL 3090250, at \u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b47-8\">Harsha, P.J., and Abele, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
