(Tracy Wood is the child\u2019s paternal grandmother, and Randy Wood is married to Tracy, making him the child\u2019s step-grandfather.) Trinkle contends that the juvenile court\u2019s finding that she is an unsuitable parent is against the manifest weight of the evidence. She further contends that the court denied her right to due process and that the trial court made several procedural errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">{\u00b6 2} We conclude that the juvenile court\u2019s finding that Trinkle is an unsuitable parent is against the manifest weight of the evidence. When we weigh the evidence in this record, as permitted by App.R. 12(C), we conclude that Trinkle is not an unsuitable parent, and we accordingly reverse the judgment of the juvenile court. Trinkle\u2019s claims of procedural errors and the denial of her due-process rights are thereby rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">{\u00b6 3} Timothy Cantrell and Erica Trinkle were never married, but had a child, C.C., together on September 21, 2007. The couple lived with the child in a mobile home purchased by Cantrell\u2019s mother, Tracy Wood.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">{\u00b6 4} While the couple were still living together, in March 2008, the child was left with Trinkle\u2019s parents on one occasion while Trinkle was at work. Trinkle\u2019s father took the child out in a vehicle and ran into a pole. The child was in a safety seat and was not hurt. It is suggested that Trinkle\u2019s father was intoxicated at the time, but there is no proof of that fact in this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">{\u00b6 5} A referral was made to Clark County Children\u2019s Services (\u201cCCCS\u201d), which opened a case but filed no legal action. In October 2008, Trinkle and Cantrell entered into a voluntary case plan with CCCS wherein they agreed to undergo mental-health assessments (along with any recommended follow-up counseling), complete parenting classes, complete the Help Me Grow program, and refrain from leaving the child alone with anyone who might be intoxicated by drugs or alcohol. Neither Trinkle nor Cantrell complied with all of these requirements. CCCS closed the case in December 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">{\u00b6 6} During the intervention by CCCS, Trinkle and Cantrell ended their relationship in June 2008. Thereafter, Trinkle and C.C. moved into the residence of Trinkle\u2019s aunt, Michelle Jacobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">{\u00b6 7} On June 27, 2008, Cantrell filed a complaint for custody of the child in the Juvenile Section of the Domestic Relations Division of the Clark County Common Pleas Court. Cantrell alleged that Trinkle used illicit drugs, left the child with unsuitable persons, and failed to take the child to health appointments. An ex parte order was entered granting temporary custody to Cantrell. But this ex parte order was dissolved on July 16, 2008, following a review hearing, and custody was restored to Trinkle.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">{\u00b6 8} The custody matter was set for hearing. In August 2008, Trinkle moved into subsidized housing with the child. In October 2008, Trinkle and Cantrell reconciled. Cantrell moved back in with his parents, and Trinkle and the child would stay overnight with Cantrell oil a somewhat regular basis. On February 27, 2009, the parties entered into an agreed order that named Trinkle residential and custodial parent of the child. Cantrell was given visitation rights. This order also required the parties to complete the voluntary case plan established by CCCS. The order provided that \u201cthe parties shall utilize Randy and Tracy Wood, the minor child\u2019s paternal grandparents for child care at times when both parents are working. In addition, at any time when the child is not in the care of the parents or Randy and/or Tracy Wood, the child is to be left in the care of a responsible party agreed upon by the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>{\u00b6 9} Trinkle and Cantrell separated again in April 2009, and Trinkle and the child lived in Trinkle\u2019s housing from April 2009 until September 3, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">{\u00b6 10} On September 3, 2010, the Woods filed a motion seeking to join the juvenile court action as parties defendant. They also filed a motion for ex parte custody of the child, based upon an affidavit of Tracy Wood in which she averred as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c7. I fear for the safety of [C.C.]. [Cantrell and Trinkle have failed to complete] the Children\u2019s Services Case Plan and [Trinkle] continues to ignore the Court\u2019s order by leaving the child with people without [Cantrell\u2019s] agreement, including her father who was the cause of Timothy gaining temporary custody by ex-parte order in 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c8. I further fear for the safety of my grandson because [Trinkle] has failed to renew his Molina Healthcare and I believe she is using marijuana and partying when she should be caring for her child.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c9. I further fear for the safety of my child [sic] because since this Court\u2019s last order of February 27, 2009,1 have hearing [sic] [Trinkle] saying such things as, Tf I can\u2019t have him, nobody can have him, that she needs mental health treatment, that the child has ruined her life, and I will fight you to the death for [C.C.].\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">{\u00b6 14} The Woods also filed a motion seeking hair-follicle testing on both Cantrell and Trinkle. All these motions were granted on the same day they were filed, and the Woods took custody of the child. The hair-follicle testing results were returned to the court and were positive for Cantrell for cocaine, but negative for Trinkle. Trinkle opposed the change of custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">{\u00b6 15} Hearings were conducted on December 15, 2010 and continued on January 24 and February 3, 9, and 11, 2011. During the hearings, the guardian ad litem appointed in the case recommended that temporary custody remain with the Woods for six months to permit Trinkle to demonstrate that she is \u201cserious\u201d about regaining custody. The GAL testified that while Trinkle had completed the mental-health assessment, she failed to attend mental-health counseling as recommended following her assessment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The GAL testified that Trinkle needed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>to demonstrate that she is \u201cserious\u201d about parenting and that she can properly parent the child. The GAL stated that in order to convince him of her seriousness she needs to \u201cget away from partying, settle down and build a home.\u201d The GAL noted that the only allegations he had regarding Trinkle\u2019s propensity for \u201cpartying\u201d were made by Cantrell and the Woods. The GAL testified that he had not been able to verify the truth or falsity of those allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">{\u00b6 16} Cantrell also testified at the hearings on January 24, 2011. He testified that he thought Trinkle should have custody of the child so long as she takes him to his medical appointments and keeps medical insurance available for him. He admitted that he still has \u201cfeelings\u201d for Trinkle. He further testified that he and Trinkle had used \u201cillegal drugs\u201d in the past, but did not specify a time frame except to say that he thought it was around the time the child was born. He then testified that the last time he had seen Trinkle use drugs was when they \u201cfirst got together\u201d as a couple. He also defined the \u201cillegal drugs\u201d as marijuana. Cantrell further testified that he spent three nights with Trinkle between December 15, 2010, and January 24, 2011, and that they \u201cwent to a pool hall a couple times.\u201d He testified that during that time period they drank alcohol, but did not use illegal drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">{\u00b6 17} Randy Wood testified that he is concerned that Trinkle cannot care for the child. Specifically, he testified that both Cantrell and Trinkle told him they had a problem with illegal drug usage. Wood made reference to both Cantrell and Trinkle taking Percocet, while Cantrell also used cocaine and Trinkle also used marijuana. Randy Wood testified that they talked about this usage some time after the child was born, but his testimony is not clear as to whether they talked about past usage or whether they were using the drugs at the time of the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">{\u00b6 18} Mr. Wood also testified that in July 2010, Trinkle left the child with her parents after the entry of the February 2009 agreed order that contained a requirement that she not leave the child with her parents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He testified that he and his wife sat parked in their vehicle \u201ctwo blocks away\u201d from Trinkle\u2019s parents that night, beginning at 7 or 8 p.m. when they observed Trinkle and the child enter the parents\u2019 home. Wood testified that Trinkle left the home at 11 p.m. and did not return until 3 a.m. Wood testified that he and his wife sat in their vehicle and watched the home that entire time. Wood also testified that there were \u201cseveral, at least three times\u201d that he and his wife were \u201cconcerned\u201d that Trinkle left the child at her parents\u2019 home. He testified that they did numerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>drive-by checks of Trinkle\u2019s parents\u2019 home, but he did not claim that they saw Trinkle leave the child there other than the one night.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">{\u00b6 19} Wood testified that he has other concerns for the child. Specifically, he stated that \u201cI don\u2019t feel that as a young mother, that [Trinkle] would keep up with his doctor visits, the insurance, his health insurance. * * * I don\u2019t feel he\u2019s getting the proper attention and care that he would need, devoting attention just to [the child] rather than running him around socializing from one different place to another, or dropping him off leaving him with someone else. And not, just the teachings of things, that he comes back and he\u2019s learned how to dance and shake his booty and the things that he learns when he comes back, I don\u2019t feel that he\u2019s gaining anything from it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">{\u00b6 20} Tracy Wood testified that after C.C. was born and the couple moved into the mobile home with the child, they began \u201cfighting, arguing, [and] partying, had several complaints from the park manager about it, and to the point that they were getting ready to evict them, which is also things that I experienced in my home prior to them moving to the mobile home.\u201d When asked to define \u201cpartying,\u201d Wood testified it meant \u201cloud music, alcohol, marijuana, possibly other things. Can\u2019t be specific.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">{\u00b6 21} She testified that neither Trinkle or Cantrell did drugs or drank while living at her home. She further testified that on one occasion while they lived in the mobile home, she had seen empty liquor bottles lined up on the refrigerator and in a cabinet. She testified that she saw \u201cvodka and Jagermeister bottles,\u201d but that she is not familiar with liquor. She also testified that beer bottles looked like liquor bottles to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">{\u00b6 22} When asked why she thought Trinkle used marijuana while she lived in the mobile home, Tracy Wood testified, \u201cwell, I can\u2019t pinpoint if it was [Cantrell] or [Trinkle] or both, the evidence was there that was there.\u201d But Wood admitted that she did not know whether Trinkle was using marijuana and that she never saw her drinking or smoking marijuana. Wood testified that when the couple reconciled in October 2008, they would leave the child with the Woods on the weekends and spend the weekends \u201cpartying.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">{\u00b6 23} Wood testified that Trinkle admitting to smoking marijuana and to taking a Percocet when \u201cher cramps were bad or she could not sleep.\u201d However, other than stating that at Thanksgiving in 2009 she thought the child smelled of marijuana, Wood was not able to give any specific time frames. Wood testified that Trinkle denied partying.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">{\u00b6 24} Wood testified that she thought Trinkle would drink and drive with the child in the car. Wood was asked whether she had ever observed Trinkle drink and then put the child in the car and drive anywhere. In response, Wood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>testified that \u201cseveral times\u201d Trinkle had called her from a restaurant to arrange for Wood to come get the child because Trinkle was having dinner and drinks and wanted to remain with her friends. She also stated that she had no evidence that Trinkle would drink and drive with the child other than \u201cjust real good, strong suspicion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">{\u00b6 25} Wood testified that \u201cone night\u201d she and her husband stopped by Trinkle\u2019s residence and saw open liquor bottles on the couch. She said that Trinkle told them that she had tried to call them to come get the child and watch him. Wood also testified that \u201cfrom time to time\u201d they would see the child at Trinkle\u2019s parents\u2019 home \u201cwith or without\u201d Trinkle\u2019s car being there or would see both Trinkle and the child there. However, other than the July 2010 incident recited above by Randy Wood, neither of the Woods testified to any specific time reference or any specific allegations that the child was left there without Trinkle.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">{\u00b6 26} Tracy Wood also testified that \u201cone night in 2010\u201d her phone rang at 11:45 p.m. and that she \u201ccalled [Trinkle] back when we got home because her cell phone was on my caller ID and she told me that [C.C.] accidentally hit our number on her phone and he was playing with the phone and she told me she was at her friend\u2019s house in South Charleston and she was not. And we had been at her house and she got in her car and left after she left [C.C.] in the car and went in and grabbed something and left.\u201d She testified that this concerned her because she did not think the child should be \u201cdrug all around from place to place to place that she choses [sic] to run to. And I don\u2019t feel that drinking and partying and driving a vehicle is a safe condition for a child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">{\u00b6 27} Tracy Wood also testified that she believes that Trinkle needs mental-health counseling because Trinkle had said things to her such as, \u201cif I can\u2019t have him nobody can; I will fight to the death for my child; and, this child will ruin my life.\u201d Wood also testified that on two occasions, Trinkle admitted that she needed mental-health counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">{\u00b6 28} Finally, Wood testified that C.C. is doing well in her custody and that he is \u201cnot as temperamental as he was, meaning he doesn\u2019t act as agitated as he would, when he came back to me from his mother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">{\u00b6 29} Following the hearing, the juvenile court awarded custody to the Woods on the basis that Trinkle is an unsuitable parent, because awarding custody to her would be detrimental to the child. The court stated that Trinkle \u201ccurrently exhibits] a total inability to provide adequate care or support for the minor child herein and it is reasonable to believe that [she] will not be able to provide such adequate care or support in the indefinite future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">{\u00b6 30} The judgment was centered upon findings that Trinkle is a 22-year-old who (1) lives in subsidized housing, (2) works 40 hours per week from six a.m. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>until two p.m., makes $20,363 per year, and lacks health insurance, (3) has a suspended operator\u2019s license due to a lack of insurance and a prior accident, (4) does not have \u201cmuch of a support system,\u201d (5) smoked marijuana at the beginning of 2010, (6) let the child\u2019s health-insurance card lapse, (7) did not comply with the case plan until shortly before trial, (8) spends considerable time \u201cpartying with friends and prioritizing her social life over that which was in C.C.\u2019s best interest,\u201d and (9) left the child in the care of unsuitable persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">{\u00b6 31} From the judgment awarding custody to the Woods, Trinkle appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">{\u00b6 32} Trinkle\u2019s fourth assignment of error states as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cThe decision of the trial court was an abuse of discretion and against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">{\u00b6 34} A parent\u2019s right to raise a child is an essential and basic civil right. <em>In re Hayes </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 46, 48, 679 N.E.2d 680. However, a parent may lose custody of a child to a nonparent if a court finds the parent unsuitable. <em>In re Perales </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St.2d 89, 369 N.E.2d 1047, syllabus. Thus, in child custody proceedings under R.C. 2151.23(A)(2) between a parent and nonparent, a court may not award custody to the nonparent \u201cwithout first determining that a preponderance of the evidence shows that the parent abandoned the child; contractually relinquished custody of the child; that the parent has become totally incapable of supporting or caring for the child; or that an award of custody to the parent would be detrimental to the child.\u201d <em>Perales </em>at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">{\u00b6 35} The standard of review we apply to a trial court\u2019s decision concerning child custody is abuse of discretion. <em>Musgrove v. Musgrove, </em>Montgomery App. No. 24640, 2011-Ohio-4460, 2011 WL 3890305, \u00b6 7. The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d is defined as \u201can attitude that is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIt is to be expected that most instances of abuse of discretion will result in decisions that are simply unreasonable, rather than decisions that are unconscionable or arbitrary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIt is not enough that the reviewing court, were it deciding the issue de novo, would not have found that reasoning process to be persuasive, perhaps in view of countervailing reasoning processes that would support a contrary result.\u201d <em>AAAA Ents., Inc. v. River Place Community Urban Redev. Corp. </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 157, 161, 553 N.E.2d 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">{\u00b6 36} A \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d is \u201cevidence which is of greater weight or more convincing than the evidence which is offered in opposition to it.\u201d Blacks Law Dictionary (6th Ed.1998) 1182. In reviewing a manifest-weight challenge, this court will not reverse a judgment that is supported by some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>competent, credible evidence. <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 376 N.E.2d 578. Furthermore, we are guided by the presumption that the findings of the trial court are correct, since the trial court is best able to view the witnesses and observe their demeanor, gestures, and voice reflections and use these observations in weighing the credibility of the testimony. <em>In re Jane Doe </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 135, 138, 566 N.E.2d 1181.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">{\u00b6 37} According to the testimony of the Woods, they believed that Trinkle should not have custody because she was not able to properly care for the child, she used drugs and drank, she would drink and drive, and she left the child with her parents, who were unsuitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">{\u00b6 38} With regard to leaving the child with unsuitable persons, the Woods were able to testify that one time during the summer of 2010, it appeared that Trinkle had left the child playing at Trinkle\u2019s parents\u2019 home. While it does appear from the record that Cantrell and the Woods believed Trinkle\u2019s parents to be unsuitable caregivers, there is nothing in the record to establish that Trinkle was prohibited from leaving the child with her parents so long as she had Cantrell\u2019s agreement to do so. And the record supports a finding that many times Trinkle was not able to contact Cantrell because he did not have a phone. In any event, the Woods\u2019 own testimony demonstrates that a third adult was present the entire time C.C. was at his maternal grandparents\u2019 home.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">{\u00b6 39} With regard to the allegations of partying, the evidence establishes that Trinkle had smoked marijuana. Indeed, Trinkle admitted during her testimony that she had smoked marijuana in the past. She also admitted that she had smoked it at a friend\u2019s home sometime in early 2010, while the child was with the Woods for visitation with Cantrell. Trinkle admitted that she does go out with friends and that she does drink alcohol. However, she denied abusing alcohol or marijuana, and she denied driving while intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">{\u00b6 40} The Woods testified that while Trinkle was living with Cantrell in the mobile home, the Woods observed some empty liquor bottles. When Trinkle was living in her subsidized housing, the Woods observed a liquor bottle in her apartment. At no point did the Woods testify that they had ever observed Trinkle smoke marijuana or drink alcohol. Neither did they testify that they ever observed her under the influence of alcohol or drugs when the child was in her care or even when the child was not in her care. The evidence establishes, at most, that Trinkle drank alcohol on occasion and smoked marijuana once since the child\u2019s birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">{\u00b6 41} But there is no evidence that Trinkle drank alcohol or smoked marijuana when the child was in her care. Instead, it shows that when she was at dinner with friends, she called the Woods because she wanted to have a drink with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>friends, and she asked the Woods to watch the child. Also, the evidence shows that there were occasions during the three years of the child\u2019s life when Trinkle had the child but would leave him with the Woods in order to go out with friends. While the Woods seem to be claiming that Trinkle was constantly leaving the child with them in order to socialize with friends, they provided no testimony concerning the frequency of these occurrences. Indeed, it appears that many of the times that Trinkle left the child with them was during the period when she and Cantrell had reconciled and would go out together, leaving the child with the grandparents during the weekend.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">{\u00b6 42} The trial court stated that Trinkle is young, works 8 hours per day, and lives in subsidized housing. This finding does nothing to establish a detrimental effect upon the child. If the fact of being younger was enough to establish detriment, many young women would automatically be deemed unsuitable. Other than unsubstantiated, vague allegations by Randy and Tracy Wood that Trinkle does not know how to take care of a child, there is nothing in this record to demonstrate her inability to care for the child. Additionally, there are no allegations that Trinkle\u2019s housing is substandard or that the living conditions in the house are unsanitary.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">{\u00b6 48} Nor can we say that being a working mother is a basis for a finding of detriment. It is clear that Trinkle had care providers for the child. The Woods had expressed the willingness, and even demanded, to watch the child while she worked. Additionally, she has two aunts who had watched the child for her in the past and who have expressed future willingness to help. If holding a full-time job were a basis for finding detriment, the Woods would be deemed unsuitable: they both work and currently leave the child with a separate caregiver during the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">{\u00b6 44} There is nothing in the record to indicate that the child experienced any detriment during the one-month period that his health insurance lapsed. The evidence shows that as soon as Trinkle was aware of the lapse, she immediately rectified the matter and coverage was resumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">{\u00b6 45} We disagree with the finding that Trinkle does not have \u201cmuch of a support system.\u201d The record does not support this finding. Trinkle has two aunts who have provided her with help and have expressed a willingness to continue to provide support. Furthermore, by their own testimony, the Woods have willingly, and even forcefully, played a support role.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">{\u00b6 46} There is nothing in the record to indicate that Trinkle\u2019s lack of an operator\u2019s license has a detrimental effect upon the child. Many people lack a license, or a car to drive, and are still able to find transportation. There is nothing in this record to support a finding that Trinkle is unable to provide some form of transportation for the child when he needs to be taken anywhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>{\u00b6 47} Finally, the use of alcohol and the recreational use of marijuana, outside the presence of the child, without more, do not establish detriment. See, e.g., <em>Gillum v. Gillum, </em>Montgomery App. No. 24401, 2011-Ohio-2558, 2011 WL 2084148. While there is evidence in this record that Trinkle has used alcohol and marijuana in the past, there is nothing to indicate that she abuses alcohol or that she has used either substance when taking care of the child. To the contrary, the evidence establishes that when Trinkle has \u201cpartied,\u201d she has called the Woods or another adult to watch the child. While we do not condone the use of marijuana, this record does not establish that Trinkle\u2019s use of the substance has been detrimental to the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">{\u00b6 48} The evidence does show that at the time of the hearings, Trinkle was a young mother of 22 who had worked a full-time job for two years while caring for a small child without the help of the child\u2019s father. After being asked to leave the Woods\u2019 mobile home, Trinkle lived with an aunt for a couple of months before establishing her own residence. During the time the child was in her custody, Trinkle maintained health insurance for the child except for a one-month lapse in coverage that she quickly rectified. There is no evidence in the record that she failed to take the child to his medical appointments. In short, other than generalized, vague allegations regarding the temperament of a three-year-old, none of the testimony presented by the Woods establishes that the child was not properly taken care of or that Trinkle was an unsuitable mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">{\u00b6 49} We conclude that the record before us fails to demonstrate that permitting Trinkle to retain custody of her child will result in detriment to the child. Thus, we conclude that the finding that Trinkle is an unsuitable parent is without adequate foundation in the record and is against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">{\u00b6 50} Under App.R. 12(C), we are permitted in a civil action tried to the trial court without a jury, having found the judgment to be against the manifest weight of the evidence, to reverse the judgment \u201cand either weigh the evidence in the record and render the judgment or final order that the trial court should have rendered on that evidence or remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.\u201d Because we find the evidence in this record to preponderate clearly against a finding that Trinkle is an unsuitable parent, we choose to reverse the judgment of the trial court and render the judgment that the trial court should have rendered on that evidence, restoring Trinkle as the legal custodian and residential parent of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">{\u00b6 51} Trinkle\u2019s fourth assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">{\u00b6 52} Trinkle\u2019s first, second and third assignments of error provide as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>{\u00b6 53} \u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law by issuing an ex parte order of custody without the existence of an emergency; without a proper R.C. 3127.23 jurisdictional affidavit; without the filing of a complaint; and for failing to immediately have a probable cause hearing on the ex parte order.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cThe trial court deprived appellant of due process of law by first the issuing of an ex parte order of custody then failing to review the order of custody timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law by allowing a stepfather [sic] of the child to be added as a party and then awarding him custody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">{\u00b6 56} Trinkle contends that the juvenile court erred with regard to procedural matters and issues of due process. Given our disposition of the fourth assignment of error set forth in Part II above, these arguments have been rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">{\u00b6 57} Trinkle\u2019s first, second and third assignments of error are overruled as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">{\u00b6 58} Trinkle\u2019s fourth assignment of error being sustained, the judgment of the juvenile court is reversed. Trinkle is restored to her previous status as the legal and residential custodian of the minor child, C.C. The child shall be returned to Trinkle in accordance with our judgment herein. This cause is remanded to the trial court for the purpose of carrying this judgment into execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b127-12\">Grady, P.J., and Froelich, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-11\">. There was evidence submitted, in the form of a letter, that as of September 27, 2010, Trinkle had completed a mental-health assessment. The letter states that Trinkle was seen for an assessment and that she reported that \"she is having a custody dispute with the paternal grandmother of her son and is experiencing some anxiety.\u201d The letter gave a diagnosis of \u201cAdjustment Disorder with Anxiety.\u201d The record before us does not contain any evidence that the person(s) who assessed Trinkle recommended follow-up counseling. While the trial court indicates that the GAL report contains a reference to a recommendation for follow-up counseling, that report was not made a part of the record. Nor does the assessment letter contain such a recommendation. Finally, the testimony of the GAL indicates that he talked to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>a \"counselor who recommended counseling\"; however, his testimony provides no further information regarding this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b120-9\">. There is no such requirement in the 2009 agreed order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b127-13\">Froelich, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AkT\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-14\">{\u00b6 59} I write separately only to express concern over the procedures, as far as they are reflected in the record, that occurred \u2014 or did not occur \u2014 in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-15\">{\u00b6 60} On September 3, 2010, the grandparents filed a \u201cmotion\u201d that asked the court for \u201can order naming the residentials parent and custodians of the minor child * * * in the best interest of that child and to provide security for that child [sic].\u201d At the same time they filed a \u201cmotion for ex parte orders\u201d requesting \u201can immediate order naming the temporary residential parents and custodians of the minor child * * * in the child\u2019s best interest and to provide security for the child and for the reasons set out in Affidavit of Tracy Wood attached hereto [sic].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-16\">{\u00b6 61} There are two affidavits of Tracy Wood attached. The \u201cAffidavit of Child Custody Pursuant to Section 3109.27 ORC\u201d says that it is in accordance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>with R.C. 3109.27 and Civ.R. 75(M) and details the names and addresses of the people involved with the care of her grandchild and certain dates and locations of that care. Interestingly, this list includes where the \u201cchild has lived * * * within the last five years\u201d despite the fact that the child was not even three yet. There is no allegation of current or potential abuse or neglect. R.C. 3109.27 does not exist. It was formerly part of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Law and was repealed in 2005. Civ.R. 75(M) is captioned \u201cTestimony\u201d and has no apparent relevance to the affidavit or the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">{\u00b6 62} The other \u201cAffidavit of Tracy Wood\u201d states that she fears for her grandson\u2019s safety because the child\u2019s biological parents did not complete the CSB care plan, the mother leaves the child with people without the father\u2019s agreement, the mother did not renew health insurance, she believes her daughter-in-law is \u201cusing marijuana and partying when she should be caring for her child,\u201d and has made statements in the last one and a half years such as she needs mental health treatment and \u201cI will fight you to the death for [my child].\u201d In an \u201cEx-Parte Entry\u201d prepared by movant\u2019s counsel and filed simultaneously with the motions, the court found the motion \u201cwell taken\u201d and set a \u201creview hearing\u201d for September 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">{\u00b6 63} On this record, there was no authority for the .court\u2019s ex parte order depriving a biological and legal parent of custody. Moreover, when ex parte emergency orders are permitted, an immediate hearing is mandatory as a matter of Ohio law, let alone due process. See, e.g., Juv.R. 13(B)(3) and R.C. 2151.33(D).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
