Each count involved at least 20,000 grams of marijuana. The trial court sentenced Truitt to concurrent terms of confinement of seven years on the conspiracy count, eight years on the possession count, and ten years on the trafficking count.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-18\">{\u00b6 2} On direct appeal, we vacated the conspiracy conviction under R.C. 2923.01(G), but affirmed the possession and trafficking convictions. <em>State v. Truitt, </em>1st Dist. No. C-050188 (Dec. 27, 2006) <em>(\u201cTruitt I </em>\u201d). In November 2010, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>Truitt applied for reconsideration under App.R. 26(A). We granted reconsideration and issued a new decision in <em>State v. Truitt, </em>1st Dist. No. C-050188, 2011-Ohio-1885, 2011 WL 1485456, <em>(\u201cTruitt II </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">{\u00b6 3} In <em>Truitt II, </em>we recognized that the trial court had \u201cfailed to specify in the judgment of conviction the duration of Truitt\u2019s postrelease-control supervision\u201d as required by R.C. 2967.28(B). <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 19. To that extent, we held that his sentences were void. <em>Id. </em>We relied upon <em>State v. Fischer, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 92, 2010-Ohio-6238, 942 N.E.2d 332, paragraph two of the syllabus, in which the Ohio Supreme Court held that the defendant\u2019s sentence was void \u201conly to the extent that he was not adequately notified concerning postrelease control.\u201d <em>See also State v. Thomas, </em>1st Dist. Nos. C-100411 and C-100412, 2011-Ohio-1331, 2011 WL 1004919, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">{\u00b6 4} We again reversed the conspiracy conviction and remanded the cause \u201conly for correction of the offending portion of the sentences.\u201d <em>Truitt II </em>at \u00b6 21-22. In all other respects, we affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. <em>Truitt II </em>at \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">{\u00b6 5} But on remand, the trial court not only imposed postrelease control, but also merged Truitt\u2019s possession and trafficking convictions under R.C. 2941.25. Following the state\u2019s election, the court sentenced Truitt to a ten-year term of confinement on the trafficking count. Truitt now appeals from that judgment of conviction, raising two assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">{\u00b6 6} In his first assignment of error, Truitt argues that the trial court erred in allowing the state to elect the trafficking offense to survive merger. We do not reach the merits of this assignment of error, because the trial court lacked authority to modify the convictions beyond the proper imposition of postrelease control.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">{\u00b6 7} In <em>Truitt II, </em>we remanded the cause \u201conly for correction of the offending portion of the sentences,\u201d that is, the postrelease-control defect. 2011-Ohio-1885, 2011 WL 1485456, at \u00b6 22. In all other respects, we affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 23. Thus, we did not authorize the trial court to merge the possession and trafficking convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cAbsent extraordinary circumstances, such as an intervening decision by the Supreme Court, an inferior court has no discretion to disregard the mandate of a superior court in a prior appeal in the same case.\u201d <em>Nolan v. Nolan, </em>11 Ohio St.3d 1, 462 N.E.2d 410 (1984), syllabus. On remand, \u201cthe trial court is without authority to extend or vary the mandate given.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4; <em>see also Dater v. PNC Bank, N.A., </em>166 Ohio App.3d 839, 2006-Ohio-2479, 853 N.E.2d 699, \u00b6 13 (1st Dist.).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>{\u00b6 9} Of course, the trial court always has jurisdiction to correct a void sentence. <em>State ex rel. Cruzado v. Zaleski, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 353, 2006-Ohio-5795, 856 N.E.2d 263, \u00b6 19. But only that part of the sentence relating to postrelease control was void. We had already affirmed the remainder of the sentence, and any issues involving that remainder were barred by res judicata. <em>See Fischer, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 92, 2010-Ohio-6238, 942 N.E.2d 332, at paragraphs one and three of the syllabus; <em>Truitt II, </em>2011-Ohio-1885, 2011 WL 1485456, at \u00b6 19-23. In merging Truitt\u2019s possession and trafficking convictions, the trial court acted beyond the mandate of this court and, therefore, without authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">{\u00b6 10} Moreover, we recently held that issues relating to merger under R.C. 2941.25 that could have been raised on direct appeal cannot be raised on a subsequent appeal from a hearing to impose postrelease control. <em>State v. Hall, </em>1st Dist. No. C-100097, 2011-Ohio-2527, 2011 WL 2112617, \u00b6 12. \u201cAlthough the doctrine of res judicata does not preclude review of a void sentence, res judicata still applies to other aspects of the merits of a conviction, including the determination of guilt and the lawful elements of the ensuing sentence.\u201d <em>Fischer, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 92, 2010-Ohio-6238, 942 N.E.2d 332, at paragraph three of the syllabus. <em>See State v. Criswell, </em>1st Dist. Nos. C-110135 and C-110286, 2011-Ohio-5786, 2011 WL 5443658, \u00b6 7-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">{\u00b6 11} We, therefore, hold that the trial court erred in merging Truitt\u2019s possession and trafficking convictions. Accordingly, we disregard the first assignment of error as moot under App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">{\u00b6 12} In his second assignment of error, Truitt argues that the court erred in not applying \u201cOhio\u2019s new sentencing law,\u201d particularly its \u201cgood time provisions.\u201d He argues that he should have received the benefit of the new law regarding \u201cfavorable prison sentence reduction.\u201d This assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">{\u00b6 13} Although Truitt does not cite any particular authority for his second assignment of error, we surmise that he is referring to R.C. 2967.19, which was recently enacted as part of 2011 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 86. But that law was enacted in September 2011, four months after Truitt\u2019s postrelease-control hearing, and does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">{\u00b6 14} Further, R.C. 2967.19 is not applicable at a sentencing hearing. It authorizes the director of rehabilitation and correction to petition sentencing courts for the release of certain prisoners who have served at least 80 percent of their stated prison term. <em>See </em>R.C. 2967.19(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">{\u00b6 15} Finally, Truitt was not eligible for release under the statute. R.C. 2967.19(C)(1) states that \u201c[a]n offender serving a stated prison term that includes a disqualifying prison term is not eligible for release from prison under this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>section.\u201d Truitt was serving a prison term for a violation of R.C. 2925.03 that was a first-degree felony, which is a disqualifying prison term under R.C. 2967.19(A)(1)(e). Consequently, we overrule Truitt\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">{\u00b6 16} We reverse that portion of the trial court\u2019s judgment in which it merged Truitt\u2019s convictions for possession of marijuana and trafficking in marijuana. We remand the case to the trial court for the purpose of sentencing Truitt on both offenses and to inform him about postrelease control under the terms of the new sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b796-7\">Hildebrandt, P.J., and Hendon, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
