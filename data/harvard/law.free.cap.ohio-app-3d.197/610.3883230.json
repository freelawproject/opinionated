Wright, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">{\u00b6 1} Appellant, Jeffrey A. Thompson, appeals from the July 14, 2010 judgment of the Portage County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division, granting the parties a divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant and appellee, Connie J. Thompson, married in 1992. Three children were born issue of the marriage. Prior to and during the course of their marriage, Jeffrey, a public-school teacher, contributed to the State Teachers Retirement System (\u201cSTRS\u201d) pension program. Connie, employed in the private sector, contributed to Social Security and had a pension with Summa Health System.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-13\">{\u00b6 3} After being married for about 17 years, Jeffrey filed for divorce. Connie filed an answer and counterclaim. Jeffrey filed a reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-14\">{\u00b6 4} Shortly thereafter, Jeffrey filed a brief on the issue of offsetting Connie\u2019s Social Security benefits against his STRS pension. In his brief, Jeffrey cited the leading case of <em>Cornbleth v. Cornbleth </em>(1990), 397 Pa.Super. 421, 580 A.2d 369, in which the Superior Court of Pennsylvania addressed the public pension/Social Security issue for property-division purposes. As will later be discussed, however, <em>Combleth </em>and the cases that followed it do not deal with offsetting the Social Security benefits of one spouse against the public pension of another spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>{\u00b6 5} A bench trial was held. The parties agreed for the trial court to issue orders regarding the allocation of their retirement accounts. Connie later filed a post-trial brief that included the issue of \u201csetoff,\u201d as well as a notice of submission of pension evaluations.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">{\u00b6 6} The trial court concluded that Connie\u2019s Social Security benefits should not be offset against Jeffrey\u2019s STRS pension, and issued the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cIn determining whether or not Husband is entitled to an offset in his STRS pension program because of Wife\u2019s potential receipt of social security benefits, the Court followed the policy of the Portage County Domestic Relations Court. That policy requires consideration of the ages of the parties and the ability to determine what benefits may be received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cWife is 39 years old and will not be eligible for benefits until she is 62 years old or 23 years from the date of trial. It will be 28 years before Wife is eligible for full benefits. Given her age, along with the 23- or 28-year wait, the Court determining what benefits she may receive becomes entirely too speculative. Accordingly, it would not be equitable to award a social security setoff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">{\u00b6 9} In granting the divorce, the trial court ordered Connie\u2019s counsel to prepare a judgment incorporating its findings along with the prior agreement of the parties. The parties subsequently filed pension evaluations. Pension Evaluators, a division of QDRO Consultants Co., L.L.C., determined the present value of the parties\u2019 accounts as of September 1, 2009. Jeffrey\u2019s STRS pension was valued at $218,424.98. Connie\u2019s Social Security was valued at $82,386.23, and her Summa pension was valued at $7,896.03. The parties agreed with the evaluations.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">{\u00b6 10} The trial court later granted the parties a divorce. Connie\u2019s Summa pension was offset against Jeffrey\u2019s STRS pension. However, the trial court did not compute and deduct the present value of a Social Security benefit that Jeffrey would have received if he contributed to Social Security from the present value of his STRS pension for distribution purposes pursuant to <em>Cornbleth. </em>Jeffrey filed a timely appeal asserting the following assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-10\">{1111} \u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law and abused its discretion when it failed to offset the marital portion of the wife\u2019s Social Security benefits against the marital portion of the STRS pension benefits of the husband.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-11\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cGenerally, pension or retirement benefits earned during the course of a marriage are marital assets to be considered when dividing marital property. <em>Hoyt v. Hoyt </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 177, 559 N.E.2d 1292,. An appellate court applies an abuse of discretion standard of review to a trial court\u2019s decision regarding the division of retirement assets. <em>Levine v. Levine </em>(Sept. 3, 1999), 4th Dist. No. 98 CA 34 [1999 WL 729262].\u201d <em>DeChristefero v. DeChristefero, </em>11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>Dist. No. 2001-T-0055, 2003-Ohio-3065, 2003 WL 21377611, at \u00b6 28. An abuse of discretion is the trial court\u2019s \u201c \u2018failure to exercise sound, reasonable, and legal decision-making.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Beechler, </em>2d Dist. No. 09-CA-54, 2010-Ohio-1900, 2010 WL 1731784, at \u00b6 62, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.Rev. 2004) 11.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">{\u00b6 13} Although Jeffrey couched his argument before the trial court and this court in language that Connie\u2019s Social Security benefits should be \u201coffset\u201d against his STRS pension, his briefings clearly reveal his citations to and reliance on <em>Cornbleth, Neel v. Neel </em>(1996), 113 Ohio App.3d 24, 680 N.E.2d 207, and <em>DeChristefero. Combleth, Neel, </em>and <em>DeChristefero, </em>which will later be discussed in detail, do not deal with \u201coffsetting\u201d the value of one spouse\u2019s Social Security benefits against the other spouse\u2019s public pension. Rather, the <em>Combleth </em>method, as correctly cited in Jeffrey\u2019s briefings before the trial court and this court, involves computing and deducting the present value of a Social Security benefit that Jeffrey would have received if he contributed to Social Security from the present value of his STRS pension in determining the marital-value portion of his pension. Thus, Jeffrey\u2019s argument with respect to the <em>Combleth </em>method was raised and preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">{\u00b6 14} In <em>Cornbleth, </em>the Superior Court of Pennsylvania addressed the public pension/Social Security issue for property-division purposes. That court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cTo facilitate a process of equating [public pension] participants and Social Security participants we believe it will be necessary to compute the present value of a Social Security benefit had the [public pension] participant been participating in the Social Security system. This present value should then be deducted from the present value of the [public] pension at which time a figure for the marital portion of the pension could be derived and included in the marital estate for distribution purposes. This process should result in equating, as near as possible, the two classes of individuals for equitable distribution purposes.\u201d <em>Cornbleth, </em>397 Pa.Super. at 427, 580 A.2d 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">{\u00b6 16} The Eighth District in <em>Neel </em>followed <em>Cornbleth </em>and found the <em>Cornbleth </em>method to be the most thorough and equitable for addressing the public pension/Social Security issue for property-division purposes. <em>Neel, </em>113 Ohio App.3d at 32, 680 N.E.2d 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">{\u00b6 17} In <em>DeChristefero, </em>this court adopted and applied <em>Cornbleth </em>and <em>Neel </em>in addressing the public pension/Social Security issue for property-division purposes. Like our case, in <em>DeChristefero </em>the husband was employed as a public-school teacher and contributed to STRS, and the wife was employed in the private sector and contributed to Social Security. <em>DeChristefero, </em>2003-Ohio-3065, 2003 WL 21377611, at \u00b6 4, 10. In <em>DeChristefero, </em>this court pointed out the inequities that result when one spouse contributes to a government pension and the other spouse contributes to Social Security:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>{\u00b6 18} \u201cState courts cannot divide Social Security benefits, allocated pursuant to federal statute, but should consider these benefits when making an equitable division of a parties\u2019 marital property. <em>Walker v. Walker </em>(1996), 112 Ohio App.3d 90, 677 N.E.2d 1252. This can create an inequity when one spouse contributes to the Social Security System and the other spouse to a government pension system. Public employees, contributing to a government pension system, may be penalized because the portions of their pension equivalent to Social Security contributions are marital property subject to division, while their spouse\u2019s contributions to Social Security are not marital property under federal statute. <em>Id. </em>Even so, a court should evaluate and consider a spouse\u2019s Social Security benefits when equitably distributing the parties\u2019 marital assets. <em>Id. </em>Courts have recommended that a domestic relations court compute the present day value of a Social Security benefit, which the spouse contributing to the public pension plan would have received if contributing to Social Security. That value should then be deducted from the present value of the public pension benefit to derive a figure for the marital portion of the pension.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 29.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">{\u00b6 19} In determining the process of evaluating the computations to be applied when equating public-pension participants and Social Security participants, this court in <em>DeChristefero </em>held that the <em>Cornbleth </em>method must be used. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 33. Thus, pursuant to <em>DeChristefero, </em>before a public pension can be divided as marital property, an amount equivalent to a Social Security benefit that the public-plan participant would have contributed to Social Security must be deducted from the present value of the public pension. See also <em>Cain v. Hamrick-Cain, </em>11th Dist. No. 2002-A-0086, 2004-Ohio-2448, 2004 WL 1086881, at \u00b6 20, and <em>Vlad v. Vlad, </em>11th Dist. No. 2003-T-0126, 2005-Ohio-2080, 2005 WL 1007252, at \u00b6 66, citing <em>DeChristefero.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">{\u00b6 20} In <em>Neville v. Neville, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 275, 2003-Ohio-3624, 791 N.E.2d 434, the Supreme Court of Ohio held that a trial court may consider the parties\u2019 future Social Security benefits in relation to all marital assets to make an equitable distribution of property. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">{\u00b6 21} Subsequent to <em>Neville, </em>on April 7, 2009, the legislature amended R.C. 3105.171, \u201cEquitable division of marital and separate property; distributive award,\u201d by inserting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">{\u00b622} \u201c(F) In making a division of marital property and in determining whether to make and the amount of any distributive award under this section, the court shall consider * * *:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-9\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(9) Any retirement benefits of the spouses, excluding the social security benefits of a spouse except as may be relevant for purposes of dividing a public pension.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>{\u00b6 24} In our case, Jeffrey and Connie testified and presented evidence to the trial court with respect to their retirement benefits. Pension Evaluators determined the present value of the parties\u2019 accounts as of September 1, 2009, and the parties agreed with those values. Again, Jeffrey\u2019s STRS pension was valued at $218,424.98. Connie\u2019s Social Security was valued at $82,386.23, and her Summa pension was valued at $7,896.03. The trial court did not follow <em>Cornbleth </em>in addressing the public pension/Social Security issue for property-division purposes. Rather, in making its determination as to whether Connie\u2019s Social Security benefits should be offset against Jeffrey\u2019s STRS pension, the trial court dismissed Connie\u2019s Social Security benefits as being \u201ctoo speculative,\u201d although evidence presented to the court clearly indicated that as of September 1, 2009, the marital portion of her Social Security benefits was valued at $82,386.23. The trial court further indicated in its findings that it followed the policy of the Portage County Domestic Relations Court, which requires consideration of the ages of the parties and the ability to determine what benefits may be received. Jeffrey is approximately eight years older than Connie. The trial court held that due to Connie\u2019s age of 39, it would not be equitable to award a Social Security setoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">{\u00b6 25} We note, however, that neither the ages of the parties nor their ability to determine what benefits may be received are factors required to be considered under R.C. 3105.171. By modifying R.C. 3105.171, the legislature mandated that courts \u201cshall consider * * * [a]ny retirement benefits of the spouses, excluding the social security benefits of a spouse except as may be relevant for purposes of dividing a public pension.\u201d R.C. 3105.171(F)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">{\u00b6 26} Again, the value of Connie\u2019s Social Security benefits is not set off against Jeffrey\u2019s public pension. Rather, the <em>Cornbleth </em>method involves computing and deducting the present value of a Social Security benefit that Jeffrey would have received if he had contributed to Social Security from the present value of his STRS pension in determining the marital-value portion of his pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">{\u00b6 27} Based on R.C. 3105.171(F)(9) and <em>DeChristefero, </em>the trial court abused its discretion by failing to compute and deduct the present value of a Social Security benefit that Jeffrey would have received if he had contributed to Social Security from the present value of his STRS pension for distribution purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">{\u00b6 28} On remand, the trial court shall follow the <em>Cornbleth </em>method. Specifically, the trial court shall compute the present value of a Social Security benefit that Jeffrey, the public plan participant, would have received if he had contributed to Social Security. That present value shall then be. deducted from the present value of Jeffrey\u2019s STRS pension. A figure for the marital portion of Jeffrey\u2019s STRS pension can then be derived and shall be included in the marital estate for distribution purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>{\u00b6 29} For the foregoing reasons, Jeffrey\u2019s sole assignment of error is well taken. The judgment of the Portage County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division, is reversed and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b650-6\">Cannon, P.J., and Grendell, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
