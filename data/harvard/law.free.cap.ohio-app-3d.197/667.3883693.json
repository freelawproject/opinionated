Wood further appeals the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion for a new trial. Finding merit to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>appeal, we reverse the judgment and remand the cause for a new trial on proximate cause and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>On July 16, 2005, 87-year-old Frank Wood was admitted to Harborside for short-term rehabilitation following knee-replacement surgery. While at Harborside, he developed a Clostridium difficile infection. He was eventually taken to the hospital, where he died five days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">{\u00b6 3} Wood filed suit, alleging that Harborside had been negligent in failing to timely diagnose and treat Frank\u2019s infection. Harborside denied the allegations of Wood\u2019s complaint, asserting that its care of Frank had not been negligent and that there was no proximate-cause relationship between the care it rendered to Frank and his ultimate death.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">{\u00b6 4} The matter proceeded to a jury trial. During deliberations, the jury considered the following interrogatories:</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">{\u00b6 5} Interrogatory No. 1: \u201cHas Plaintiff proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Defendant, Harborside Healthcare, was negligent in the care and treatment of Decedent, Frank A. Wood?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">{\u00b6 6} Interrogatory No. 2: \u201cState in what respect(s) you find that Defendant, Harborside Healthcare, was negligent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">{\u00b6 7} Interrogatory No. 3: \u201cHas Plaintiff proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the negligence of Defendant, Harborside Healthcare, was a proximate cause of injury <em>and </em>death of Frank A. Wood?\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">{\u00b6 8} Interrogatory No. 4: \u201cState an amount of money that you find will compensate the Plaintiff for Mr. Wood\u2019s pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life up to the time of his death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">{\u00b6 9} Interrogatory No. 5: \u201cState an amount of money you find will compensate the next of kin of Frank Wood for their damages caused by his <em>death.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b703-13\">{\u00b6 10} Following deliberations, the jury returned a general verdict in favor of Wood. The jury answered yes to interrogatory No. 1, finding that Harborside had been negligent in its care and treatment of Frank, and stated in its answer to interrogatory No. 2 that Harborside had been negligent as follows: \u201cDoctor not contacted early enough about diarrhea. Senna given when it should not have. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Poor charting. Chart not complete.\u201d The jury answered no to interrogatory No. 3, finding that Harborside\u2019s negligence was not the proximate cause of Frank\u2019s injury and death. Consistent with the instructions, the jury skipped interrogatory No. 4 and proceeded to interrogatory No. 5, awarding $250,000 in damages to Frank\u2019s next of kin for their damages caused by his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">{\u00b6 11} After reviewing the jury\u2019s general verdict and interrogatory answers, the trial court instructed the jury that its interrogatory answers were inconsistent with the general verdict. The court instructed the jury that the instruction at the conclusion' of interrogatory No. 3 was incorrect and should have stated, \u201c[I]f you answered \u2018no\u2019 to this interrogatory, conclude deliberations.\u201d The judge scratched out that part of the instruction that stated \u201cskip to Interrogatory No. 5\u201d and above it wrote, \u201cconclude deliberations.\u201d The court then instructed the jury to resume deliberations and \u201cmake the appropriate changes\u201d to their interrogatory answers. The court did not provide the jury with a new general verdict form or new interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">{\u00b6 12} When the jury returned after deliberating a second time, the jury again returned a verdict for the plaintiff. It again answered yes to interrogatory No. 1, finding that Harborside had been negligent; it again identified how Harborside had been negligent in its response to interrogatory No. 2; and it again answered no to interrogatory No. 3, finding that Harborside\u2019s negligence was not the proximate cause of Frank Wood\u2019s injury and death. It did not answer interrogatory No. 4, and on interrogatory No. 5, it crossed out the amount it had written in earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">{\u00b6 13} The judge again told the jury that its verdict was inconsistent with its answers to the interrogatories and instructed the jury to continue its deliberations. When the jury returned after deliberating a third time, it entered a verdict for Harborside.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">{\u00b6 14} The trial court finally accepted the verdict and, after polling the jury, entered judgment on the jury\u2019s verdict. Wood subsequently filed a motion to vacate the trial court\u2019s judgment and/or for a new trial on the issues of proximate cause and damages. The court denied the motion and ruled that Wood was not prejudiced by the jury\u2019s further deliberations because \u201cInterrogatory 3 inconsistent with Interrogatory 5 and verdict, due to erroneous directions in Interrogatory # 3\u201d and Wood had not objected to the trial court\u2019s handling of the deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">{\u00b6 15} Wood now appeals from the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">{\u00b6 16} In her second assignment of error, Wood contends that the trial court erred in denying her motion for a new trial on proximate cause and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>damages because the significant irregularities in the jury deliberations denied her a fair trial. We address this assignment of error first because it is dispositive of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">{\u00b6 17} Civ.R. 59(A)(1) provides a trial court with discretion to grant a new trial when there is an irregularity in the proceedings that prevents a party from having a fair trial. \u201cThe rule preserves the integrity of the judicial system when the presence of serious irregularities in a proceeding could have a material adverse effect on the character of and public confidence in judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Wright v. Suzuki Motor Corp., </em>Meigs App. Nos. 03CA2, 03CA3, and 03CA4, 2005-Ohio-3494, 2005 WL 1594850, \u00b6 114. The term \u201cirregularity\u201d in this context is \u201cvery comprehensive\u201d and describes \u201ca departure from the due, orderly, and established mode of proceeding therein, where a party, with no fault on his part, has been deprived of some right or benefit otherwise available to him.\u201d <em>Reeves v. Healy, </em>192 Ohio App.3d 769, 2011-Ohio-1487, 950 N.E.2d 605, \u00b6 18. We review a trial court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion for a new trial for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">{\u00b6 18} In light of the significant irregularities in the jury deliberations, we find that the trial court abused its discretion in denying Wood\u2019s motion for new trial. The trial court denied Wood\u2019s motion because it found the instruction at the end of interrogatory No. 3 to proceed to interrogatory No. 5 if the jury answered no to interrogatory No. 3 to be erroneous, and thus it concluded that the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of Wood when it returned from deliberating the first time was inconsistent with its interrogatory answers. But the trial court\u2019s ruling ignores the fact, which both parties acknowledged at oral argument, that the alleged error in interrogatory No. 3 was pointed out to the trial judge prior to jury instructions and the judge promised to correct the error, but failed to do so. The trial court did not read the interrogatories to the jury, so the attorneys were not aware prior to deliberation that the error had not been fixed. Thus, any alleged inconsistency was created by the trial court, not by Wood.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">{\u00b6 19} Furthermore, it is not apparent that the jury was, in fact, confused by the alleged erroneous instruction regarding interrogatory No. 3. It is not speculative to conclude that the jury\u2019s initial answers to the interrogatories indicated that the jury found that although Harborside was not the proximate cause of Frank Wood\u2019s Clostridium difficile infection, i.e., his <em>injury, </em>its negligent actions with respect to the care and treatment of his infection, were indeed the proximate cause of his death. When the jury returned the first time, it returned a verdict for the plaintiff, found that Harborside had been negligent, explained how Harborside had been negligent, and then, in its answer to interrogatory No. 5, listed $250,000 as the amount that would adequately compensate Wood\u2019s relatives for the damages caused by his <em>death. </em>The jury could have easily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>entered an award of $0 for Wood in interrogatory No. 5 had it found that Harborside\u2019s negligence was not the proximate cause of Frank Wood\u2019s death. The jury specifically did not answer interrogatory No. 4, which asked them to state an amount to compensate Wood for Frank\u2019s suffering \u201cup to the time of his death.\u201d Thus, one could infer that the jury did indeed find for Wood with respect to Frank\u2019s death and wanted to award her $250,000 for Harborside\u2019s negligence regarding his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">{\u00b6 20} Nevertheless, the trial court sent the jury back for further deliberations not once but twice, until it finally returned with a defense verdict. At worst, one could conclude that the jury felt compelled by the trial court to return a defense verdict. At best, the jury\u2019s inability to follow the judge\u2019s instructions, which were confusing, and provide proper and consistent responses to the interrogatories was an irregularity that deprived Wood of a fair trial and just verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">{\u00b6 21} In <em>Reeves, </em>192 Ohio App.3d 769, 2011-Ohio-1487, 950 N.E.2d 605, the jury answered interrogatories finding that the defendant-doctor was negligent and explaining how, but it found no proximate cause and did not award damages for the plaintiff. The magistrate sent the jury back for further deliberations. When the jury returned with a second verdict, the jury answered the interrogatories \"indicating that the doctor had been negligent and describing how, but the jury again found no proximate cause, despite rendering a general verdict for the plaintiff and awarding the plaintiff economic damages. The magistrate ordered the jury to resume deliberations again. When the jury returned a third time, the jury\u2019s interrogatory answers stated that the defendant-doctor had been negligent and that his negligence had proximately caused the plaintiffs injuries; the jury also entered a general verdict for the plaintiff and awarded $450,000 in damages. The magistrate granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial under Civ.R. 59(A)(1) because of an \u201cirregularity\u201d in the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">{\u00b6 22} The Tenth District affirmed the grant of a new trial on appeal, finding that \u201c[t]he jury\u2019s repeated failure to return a verdict consistent with its responses to the interrogatories, coupled with its obvious confusion in following the [trial court\u2019s] instructions regarding the interrogatories, [was] a \u2018departure from the due, orderly, and established mode of proceeding\u2019 that resulted in the defendants\u2019 being deprived of the right to a fair trial and just verdict.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00b628, quoting Civ.R. 59(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">{\u00b6 23} The jury in this case was obviously confused by the trial court\u2019s instructions regarding the interrogatories. Furthermore, the judge\u2019s instructions and his failure to provide the jury with new interrogatories and jury forms undoubtedly helped to create the irregularity in jury deliberations. Upon initially instructing the jury, the trial court did not read the verdict forms or interrogatories to the jury. Then, the first time he sent the jury back for more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>deliberations, the judge handwrote new instructions on the same interrogatory forms and returned the jury to further deliberations. He again did not read the interrogatories or verdict forms to the jury to make sure they understood them, but simply instructed the jury to \u201cmake the appropriate changes\u201d to them. The next time he sent the jury back, the judge again did not read the interrogatories or verdict forms to the jury, and he again sent them back with the same verdict forms and interrogatories they had already completed, this time with instructions to make them \u201cconsistent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">{\u00b6 24} As in <em>Reeves, </em>the jury\u2019s obvious confusion in following the trial court\u2019s instructions regarding the interrogatories compromised the fairness of the process and the integrity of the result. In short, through no fault of Wood, there was an irregularity in the process that deprived her of the right to a fair trial and just verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">{\u00b6 25} We recognize that counsel for Wood did not object to the trial court\u2019s instructions regarding further deliberations and thus has waived all but plain error on appeal. See <em>Avondet v. Blankstein </em>(1997), 118 Ohio App.3d 357, 366, 692 N.E.2d 1063. But the result is the same whether we review for abuse of discretion or plain error: the significant irregularities in the jury\u2019s deliberations, irregularities that were not created by Wood, deprived her of her right to a fair trial and just verdict. To let the trial court\u2019s judgment stand in the face of such irregularities could have a significant negative effect on the public\u2019s confidence in these and other judicial proceedings. Wood\u2019s second assignment of error is therefore sustained. The trial court\u2019s judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded for a new trial regarding proximate cause and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">{\u00b6 26} In light of our resolution of the second assignment of error, we need not address Wood\u2019s first assignment of error. See App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b707-9\">Gallagher, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b707-10\">Boyle, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b703-14\">. Following the signature lines, at the bottom of the page, the interrogatory instructed: \u201cIf you answered 'no' to this Interrogatory, skip to Interrogatory No. 5. If you answered \u2018yes' to this interrogatory, proceed to No. 4 and then No. <em>5.\"</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b707-11\">Mary J.

While I acknowledge that the proceedings below were not perfect, litigants are not entitled to a perfect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>trial, only a fair one. <em>Grundy v. Dhillon, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 415, 2008-Ohio-6324, 900 N.E.2d 153, \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">{\u00b6 29} The one irregularity that is not disputed pertains to the faulty instruction in the original interrogatory No. 3, which stated the following: \u201cIf you answered \u2018no\u2019 to this Interrogatory, skip to Interrogatory No. 5. If you answered \u2018yes\u2019 to the Interrogatory, proceed to No. 4 and then No. 5.\u201d The interrogatory should have instructed the jury to \u201cconclude deliberations\u201d if they answered no to interrogatory No. 3 \u2014 it should not have directed them to proceed to interrogatory No. 5. The mistake became apparent to all parties immediately after the jury returned from deliberations the first time \u2014 the jury had proceeded to interrogatory No. 5 and awarded damages despite finding no proximate cause in their answer to interrogatory No. 3. The majority focuses on this single mistake by the trial court and criticizes the trial court for failing to appreciate this mistake in ruling on the motion for a new trial. But I find that the majority\u2019s focus is misplaced and that the majority fails to appreciate the entire context of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">{\u00b6 30} Notably, after the jury returned its inconsistent verdict following the first deliberation \u2014 i.e., the jury found no proximate cause in its answer to interrogatory No. 3 but proceeded to the damages question in interrogatory No. 5 \u2014 no party requested that the trial court grant a new trial on the grounds that the jury had had a faulty instruction in interrogatory No. 3. To the contrary, both parties, including Wood, acquiesced in the trial court\u2019s decision to correct the instruction and return the jury for further deliberations. Wood\u2019s counsel never once objected to the manner in which the faulty instruction was handled. Wood\u2019s counsel never argued that the jury\u2019s initial verdict was consistent and should stand, thereby eliminating the need for further deliberations. The record is abundantly clear that Wood\u2019s counsel agreed that the instruction should be corrected and the matter returned to the jury. In light of these proceedings, I fail to see how Wood can now complain and argue that she.was denied a fair trial. See <em>Gable v. Gates Mills, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 449, 2004-Ohio-5719, 816 N.E.2d 1049, \u00b6 43 (where no timely objection is made on a particular issue, the issue is generally waived because plain error is rarely recognized in a civil case); <em>Fennell v. Columbiana, </em>7th Dist. No. 09CO42, 2010-Ohio-4242, 2010 WL 3503503 (trial court does not abuse its discretion in denying a motion for a new trial when the party failed to object and raise the issue during the trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">{\u00b6 31} Next, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the proceedings were so irregular by virtue of the jury\u2019s deliberating three times that it deprived Wood of a fair trial. The majority reaches this conclusion by agreeing with Wood\u2019s argument that the initial verdict may have been consistent with its answers to its interrogatories \u2014 i.e., that the jury answered no to interrogatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>No. 3 (the proximate-cause interrogatory) solely because the interrogatory relates to both injury <em>and </em>death. Wood contends that the initial verdict in her favor was consistent with the jury\u2019s answers, including the jury\u2019s answer of no to interrogatory No. 3, because the jury separately awarded damages arising out of Frank\u2019s death in interrogatory No. 5. Agreeing with this, the majority states that \u201cone could infer that the jury did indeed find for Wood with respect to Frank\u2019s death and wanted to award her $250,000 for Harborside\u2019s negligence regarding his death.\u201d But the jury answered no to interrogatory No. 3 \u2014 the proximate-cause question. Indeed, the jury consistently answered no to this question. Therefore, I refuse to speculate that the jury intended to answer yes to that portion of the question relating to injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">{\u00b6 32} As for the jury initially awarding $250,000 in answering interrogatory No. 5, it was clearly a result of the faulty instruction in interrogatory No. 3 that directed the jury to answer interrogatory No. 5 and led the jury to believe that they could award damages despite finding no proximate cause. Notably, the majority emphasizes that the jury \u201cspecifically did not answer Interrogatory No. 4\u201d \u2014 the interrogatory relating to damages for <em>injuries </em>to Frank proximately caused by Harborside \u2014 as evidence that the jury found no proximate cause between Harborside\u2019s negligence and Frank\u2019s injuries but that the jury must have found proximate cause between Harborside\u2019s negligence and Frank\u2019s death because it answered interrogatory No. 5. But the majority fails to recognize that the faulty instruction in interrogatory No. 3 specifically directed the jury to skip interrogatory No. 4 and proceed to interrogatory No. 5; therefore, the jury\u2019s not answering the interrogatory was simply a matter of their following the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">{\u00b6 33} The majority further finds that the trial judge\u2019s decision sending the jury back for further deliberations on two additional occasions could be construed \u201cat worst\u201d to mean that \u201cthe jury felt compelled by the trial court to return a defense verdict.\u201d But again, this statement ignores that the trial court\u2019s returning the jury for further deliberations was agreed to by all the parties. Wood\u2019s counsel never once objected or asked the trial court to reduce the answers to the interrogatories and verdict to a judgment. And although the trial judge could not have entered a judgment after the first deliberations, because the answers to the interrogatories were inconsistent themselves, the trial court could have opted to enter a verdict for Harborside once the faulty instruction had been corrected and after the second round of deliberations \u2014 at that point, the answers to all the interrogatories supported a verdict for Harborside. See Civ.R. 49(B)(1) (authorizing the trial court to grant judgment in accordance with interrogatory answers when the answers are inconsistent with a general verdict). Out of an abundance of caution, and consistent with the parties\u2019 wishes, however, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>court returned the matter for the jury to deliberate a third time because the jury answered the interrogatories in favor of Harborside but failed to sign a general defense verdict. I fail to see how the third round of deliberations, which served only to benefit Wood, should now serve as grounds for a new trial for Wood.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">{\u00b6 34} Additionally, unlike the majority, I cannot agree that Wood was deprived of some right or benefit through no fault of her own. Here, the gravamen of Wood\u2019s entire appeal is premised on the notion that interrogatory No. 3 was confusing because it contained a compound question relating to proximate cause: \u201cHas Plaintiff proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the negligence of Defendant, Harborside Healthcare, was a proximate cause of injury <em>and </em>death of Frank A. Wood?\u201d (Emphasis added.) The majority agrees with Wood that the jury may have found that Harborside\u2019s negligence proximately caused Frank\u2019s death but had to answer no based on how the interrogatory was worded. But Wood\u2019s proposed interrogatory for proximate cause was substantially similar to the one adopted by the court and specifically contained a compound question related to proximate cause. Wood therefore has invited the very error that she now relies on for purposes of a new trial. Moreover, Wood never polled the jury to substantiate her claim that the jury did indeed believe that Harborside\u2019s negligence proximately caused Frank\u2019s death. Given that Wood could have avoided the very issues that she now complains of, I cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in denying her motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">{\u00b6 35} Finally, and most importantly, I cannot agree with the majority that <em>Reeves v. Healy, </em>192 Ohio App.3d 769, 2011-Ohio-1487, 950 N.E.2d 605, supports its decision to reverse the trial court. Although <em>Reeves </em>involved an irregularity related to jury deliberations, there are two critical distinctions between <em>Reeves </em>and this case: (1) the appellate court in <em>Reeves affirmed </em>the trial court\u2019s decision to grant a new trial and (2) the party who moved for a new trial had objected to further deliberations by the jury once the jury returned inconsistent answers to the jury interrogatories. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">{\u00b6 36} At the heart of <em>Reeves </em>is the recognition that a trial judge or magistrate, who has presided over the proceedings, is in the best position to determine whether a party has been afforded a fair trial and \u201cto assess the jury\u2019s flaws in answering the interrogatories.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 31. Indeed, as recognized by the majority, the decision to grant a new trial \u201cis a decision committed to the trial court\u2019s sound discretion, and an appellate court will not reverse such a ruling absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d Thus, to agree with the majority, I would have to find that the trial court\u2019s decision was \u201cso palpably and grossly violative of fact or logic that it evidences not the exercise of will but the perversity of will, not the exercise of judgment but the defiance of judgment, not the exercise of reason but instead passion or bias.\u201d <em>Nakoff v. Fairview Gen. Hosp. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>254, 256, 662 N.E.2d 1. Here, where Wood failed to object to and even contributed to the alleged confusion, I cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in denying her motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">{\u00b6 37} Accordingly, I dissent and would overrule both assignments of error, affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment in its entirety.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
