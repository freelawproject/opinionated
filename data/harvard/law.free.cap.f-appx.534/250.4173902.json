He challenges the district court\u2019s imposition of a five-year period of ineligibility for federal benefits, arguing that his offense was not a distribution offense for purposes of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 862.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-17\">As Bobadilla concedes, because he did not object to the five-year denial of federal benefits in the district court, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Silva-De Hoyos, </em>702 F.3d 843, 848 (5th Cir.2012). To show plain error, Bobadilla must demonstrate (1) that there was an error, (2) that it was clear or obvious, and (3) that it affected his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes that showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error, but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-22\">Because Bobadilla\u2019s offense of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute was not an offense consisting of the distribution of controlled substances under \u00a7 862(a), the district court erred in imposing the five-year ineligibility period, that error was plain, and it affected Bobadilla\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See Silva-De Hoyos, </em>702 F.3d at 849-50. Bobadilla contends that the error affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings because it results in a sentence exceeding the statutory maximum. Boba-dilla has not, however, identified any federal benefit for which he is eligible or might be eligible during the five-year ineligibility period imposed by the district court. <em>See id. </em>at 850. Because the district court\u2019s error did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b272-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
