Their claims arise out of Belinda Bearb\u2019s injuries sustained by slipping and falling on a wet substance, believed to be water, in Wal-Mart\u2019s Marksville, Louisiana, store. They contend the district court erred because there are genuine disputes of material fact with regard to whether Wal-Mart created, or had actual or constructive notice of, the wet condition that caused Bearb\u2019s fall. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-21\">Summary judgment is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>and we apply the same standard as the district court, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant. <em>E.g., First Am. Title Ins. Co. v. Continental Cas. Co., </em>709 F.3d 1170, 1173 (5th Cir.2013). Summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.CivP. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-22\">To survive summary judgment, the Bearbs must show a genuine dispute as to whether Wal-Mart could be found liable under the Louisiana merchant-liability statute, La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 9:2800.6. The statute requires them to prove: the floor\u2019s wet condition created an unreasonable risk of reasonably foreseeable harm to Belinda Bearb; Wal-Mart created, or had actual or constructive notice of, the condition\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>existence prior to her injury; and, Wal-Mart failed to exercise reasonable care. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2800.6(B). They fail to show a genuine dispute of material fact for at least the second element.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">The Bearbs do not contend Wal-Mart had actual notice of the wet condition of the floor before Belinda Bearb\u2019s fall. Therefore, they must show a genuine dispute of material fact for whether Wal-Mart created or had constructive notice of the wet condition. Constructive notice includes a temporal element; <em>i.e., </em>if plaintiff fails to show the hazardous condition existed \u201cfor some time period prior to the fall,\u201d then she fails to meet her statutory burden. <em>White v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>699 So.2d 1081, 1084-85 (La.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">As the district court correctly noted, the Bearbs offer only speculation and their own unsubstantiated statements to support their claims that: Wal-Mart created the condition because it resulted from either a leaking skylight or wet shopping carts; and Wal-Mart had constructive notice of the condition because there was a large quantity of water in a high-traffic area of the store. In the absence of any <em>facts </em>in the record to support their claims, it is clear the Bearbs are unable to create a genuine dispute of <em>material </em>fact to survive summary judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CivP. 56(a); <em>Indian Harbor Ins. Co. v. Valley Forge Ins. Grp., </em>535 F.3d 359, 362-63 (5th Cir.2008) (\u201cTo survive a motion for summary judgment, the nonmovant must come forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The Bearbs must show a genuine dispute of material fact for all three statutory elements in order to survive summary judgment, and they fail to do so for the second element. Therefore, we need not address whether the floor\u2019s condition created an unreasonable risk, or whether Wal-Mart failed to exercise reasonable care.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b286-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
