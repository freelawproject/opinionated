After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Because this appeal involves a procedural default, we review the full history.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">A. 2006 Criminal Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">In 2006, a jury convicted Geter of one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute at least 5 grams of heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) classified Geter as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) because Get-er had at least two prior felony convictions for either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. Specifically, Geter had one prior conviction for possessing cocaine with intent to sell and two separate prior convictions for carrying a concealed firearm in violation of Florida law. Geter\u2019s career-offender designation led to a total offense level of 32 and automatically placed him into a criminal history category of VI, resulting in a guidelines range of 210 to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">Geter objected to his classification as a career offender, arguing that his two convictions for carrying a concealed firearm did not qualify as crimes of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, and that the facts underlying those convictions did not support a finding that those were crimes of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-13\">At his January 5, 2007 sentencing hearing, Geter reiterated his objections to the career-offender enhancement. Overruling Geter\u2019s objections, the district court reasoned that under this Court\u2019s then-binding precedent, specifically <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d 1371, 1372 (11th Cir.1998), a Florida conviction for carrying a concealed weapon was considered a crime of violence. When the sentencing hearing continued on January 26, 2007, the district court found that Geter qualified as a career offender and sentenced him to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment, the low end of his guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-14\">In his direct appeal, Geter did not challenge the district court\u2019s finding that he qualified as a career offender. <em>See United States v. Geter, </em>274 Fed.Appx. 805, 811 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cGeter does not challenge the district court\u2019s finding that he qualified as a career offender or otherwise challenge the procedural reasonableness of his sentence on appeal.\u201d). On April 21, 2008, this Court affirmed Geter\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b854-15\">B. 2009 \u00a7 2255 Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b854-16\">On April 14, 2009, Geter filed a counseled \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his sentence, raising two claims. First, Geter\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion argued that he was erroneously sentenced in 2007 as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) because, in light of the subsequent 2008 decisions in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), and <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir.2008), his two prior Florida convictions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>carrying concealed weapons no longer qualified as crimes of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">On April 16, 2008, about a year before Geter\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was filed, the Supreme Court in <em>Begay </em>held that driving under the influence (\u201cDUI\u201d) is not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d within the meaning of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cthe ACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), because the offense does not involve \u201cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct.\u201d 553 U.S. at 145, 128 S.Ct. at 1586-87. Shortly thereafter, on June 26, 2008, this Court decided <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir.2008), holding that \u201cin light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Begay </em>[involving the ACCA], the crime of carrying a concealed firearm may no longer be considered a crime of violence under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1352. This Court in <em>Archer </em>also recognized that <em>\u201cBe-gay </em>... has undermined <em>Gilbert </em>to the point of abrogation ... and we are thus bound to follow this new rule of law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Second, Geter\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion contended that his appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to challenge his career-offender enhancement on direct appeal. In this regard, we note the timing of events surrounding Geter\u2019s direct appeal. On February 2, 2007, Geter filed his notice of appeal in the district court. On July 16, 2007, Geter\u2019s appellate counsel filed his opening brief in this Court. On September 4, 2007, the government filed its response brief, and the briefing concluded when Geter filed his reply brief on September 28, 2007. Thus, the briefing was completed in Geter\u2019s direct appeal for over six months before <em>Begay </em>was decided on Wednesday, April 16, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">The following Monday, April 21, 2008, this Court affirmed Geter\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>See Geter, </em>274 Fed.Appx. at 805. On May 8, 2008, Geter filed a petition for panel rehearing. In this petition, Geter renewed a challenge that he had raised in his briefs on appeal to the admission of certain testimony at his trial; the petition did not discuss either <em>Begay </em>or Geter\u2019s career-offender enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">While Geter\u2019s petition for rehearing was pending, and more than two months after our opinion in Geter\u2019s direct appeal was issued, this Court decided <em>Archer </em>on June 26, 2008. <em>See </em>531 F.3d at 1347. Shortly thereafter, on July 1, 2008, Geter moved to supplement his petition for rehearing in light of <em>Archer. </em>In this motion to supplement, Geter acknowledged that in his briefs to this Court on appeal, he</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahy\">did not specifically raise the district court\u2019s ruling that calculated his advisory career offender guideline range on the basis of his two State convictions for carrying a concealed weapon because <em>[Gilbert </em>] ... foreclosed that issue. Counsel simply did not anticipate this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Archer, </em>which effectively overturned <em>[Gilbert], </em>because in <em>Begay </em>the Supreme Court ... did not address the concealed weapon issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A71\">Because of this change in controlling law, Geter requested that (1) this Court permit him to supplement his petition for rehearing to include arguments related to his career-offender enhancement and the effect of <em>Archer; </em>(2) grant his petition for rehearing; and (3) vacate his sentence and remand his appeal to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">The government opposed Geter\u2019s motion to supplement, arguing that Geter had waived any challenge to his career-offender sentencing enhancement by not raising the challenge in his briefs on appeal. In support of its argument, the government cited the \u201cwell-established\u201d rule that a party to an appeal abandons an issue by not raising it in his initial brief. The government also noted that this rule operated \u201cnotwithstanding the intervention of favor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>able [legal] authority,\u201d and that a petition for rehearing could not be used to raise a \u201cnew point of appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">On September 3, 2008, this Court denied Geter\u2019s petition for rehearing and his motion to supplement that petition. The Court held that \u201cGeter\u2019s failure to brief the \u2018crime of violence\u2019 argument in his opening brief constituted a waiver of that argument. For that reason, notwithstanding our recent decision in <em>Archer, </em>Geter\u2019s Petition for Rehearing is DENIED.\u201d (citations omitted). The mandate issued in Geter\u2019s direct appeal one week later, on September 10, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">C. Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report on \u00a7 2255 Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">After the government\u2019s \u00a7 2255 response, the magistrate judge issued a report recommending that the district court deny Geter\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. The magistrate judge first determined that Geter procedurally defaulted his career-offender claim because he failed to raise that claim in his direct appeal. The magistrate judge further determined that Geter\u2019s procedural default was not excused under the miscarriage-of-justice exception because an erroneous career-offender designation did not constitute actual innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">As to Geter\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim, the magistrate judge concluded that, in the direct appeal, Geter\u2019s appellate attorney did not perform deficiently in failing to anticipate <em>Begay </em>and Archer\u2019s change to controlling law. Furthermore, Geter could not show that he suffered prejudice as a result of his appellate counsel\u2019s failure to seek leave to file a supplemental brief in light of <em>Begay, </em>a decision the Supreme Court issued six months after the briefs were filed in Geter\u2019s direct appeal and only \u201ctwo business days\u201d before this Court ruled on Geter\u2019s direct appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">The magistrate judge also reasoned that, even if Geter\u2019s appellate counsel had filed a supplemental brief, that action would have been futile because this Court does not permit parties to raise new issues in supplemental briefing. In support of this reasoning, the magistrate judge cited our decisions in <em>United States v. Padillas-Reyes, </em>247 F.3d 1158, 1164 (11th Cir.2001), and <em>United States v. Nealy, </em>232 F.3d 825, 830 (11th Cir.2000), in which this Court affirmed its longstanding rule that parties are barred from raising a new issue in a supplemental brief, even if the issue arises based on an intervening decision or other new legal development.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-12\">D. District Court\u2019s Order</p>\n<p id=\"b856-13\">Geter objected to the magistrate judge\u2019s report. The district court overruled Get-er\u2019s objections, adopted the report, and denied Geter\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate. In its order, the district court added that Geter (1) procedurally defaulted his career-offender challenge by failing to raise it on direct appeal; (2) and failed to show either cause \u2014 i.e., ineffective assistance of appellate counsel \u2014 and prejudice or a miscarriage of justice sufficient to overcome the procedural default.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-14\">In considering Geter\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim, the district court determined that Geter\u2019s appellate counsel was not constitutionally ineffective for failing to anticipate a change in the law and raise on direct appeal a challenge to Geter\u2019s career-offender designation. The district court noted that, even though <em>Begay </em>(a DUI case under the ACCA) was pending at the time of Geter\u2019s direct appeal, appellate counsel\u2019s failure to anticipate the outcome <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>of <em>Begay </em>did not fall below the reasonable standards of professional competence. Moreover, appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to file a supplemental appellate brief raising a claim under <em>Begay </em>regarding Geter\u2019s career-offender classification under the Guidelines because under its precedent this Court would have considered the argument to have been untimely made.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Finally, the district court issued a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on \u201cwhether Petitioner is excused from procedural default where, as occurred in Petitioner\u2019s appeal, the appellate court decision affirming his conviction and sentence was rendered <em>after </em>the Supreme Court decision offering relief on an (albeit non-briefed) issue.\u201d Geter timely appealed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">In this \u00a7 2255 appeal, Geter\u2019s sole argument is that his procedural default should be excused due to his appellate counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance. Specifically, Geter asserts that on direct appeal his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to argue that he was erroneously sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) because (1) trial counsel raised this guidelines argument before the district court, and (2) at the time his direct appeal was decided, Geter\u2019s two predicate state convictions for carrying a concealed weapon no longer qualified as \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B 1.2(a) of the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">A. Standards Governing Procedural Default &amp; Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">To avoid procedurally defaulting a claim, \u201ca defendant generally must advance an available challenge to a criminal conviction or sentence on direct appeal or else the defendant is barred from presenting that claim in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding.\u201d <em>McKay v. United States, </em>657 F.3d 1190, 1196 (11th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 112, 184 L.Ed.2d 52 (2012). A procedural default may be excused, however, if the defendant can demonstrate that one of two exceptions applies: (1) cause and prejudice, or (2) actual innocence. <em>Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 622, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 1611, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-13\">Here, Geter does not dispute that he procedurally defaulted his career-offender claim because he failed to raise it on direct appeal. Thus, Geter must show that one of the two exceptions to the procedural default rule applies. <em>See Bousley, </em>523 U.S. at 622, 118 S.Ct. at 1611. Geter concedes that the actual-innocence exception to procedural default does not apply, and we need not consider this exception. <em>See McKay, </em>657 F.3d at 1196 (\u201cBecause [petitioner] does not argue on appeal that the cause and prejudice exception applies ... we do not address this exception.\u201d). Therefore, we turn to whether Geter has shown cause and prejudice necessary to excuse his procedural default.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-14\">. \u201cUnder the cause and prejudice exception, a \u00a7 2255 movant can avoid application of the procedural default bar by showing cause for not raising the claim of error on direct appeal <em>and </em>actual prejudice from the alleged error.\u201d <em>McKay, </em>657 F.3d at 1196 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). To demonstrate cause, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>\u00a7 2255 movant \u201cmust show that some objective factor external to the defense prevented [the movant] or his counsel from raising his claims on direct appeal and that this factor cannot be fairly attributable to [the movant\u2019s] own conduct.\u201d <em>Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1235 (11th Cir.2004). Ineffective assistance of counsel may serve as the cause required to excuse a movant\u2019s procedural default. <em>United States v. Nyhuis, </em>211 F.3d 1340, 1344 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cIn order to do so, however, the claim of ineffective assistance must have merit.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">To prevail on a claim of ineffective counsel, a movant must demonstrate that (1) counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, falling below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) the movant suffered prejudice as a result of the deficient performance. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The standard governing counsel\u2019s performance is \u201creasonableness under prevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. In light of the strong presumption in favor of competence, a movant seeking to prove a Sixth Amendment violation must establish that \u201cno competent counsel would have taken the action that his counsel did take.\u201d <em>Chandler v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1305, 1315 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">It is well-settled that an attorney\u2019s failure to anticipate a change in the law will not support a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. <em>See, e.g., Black v. United States, </em>373 F.3d 1140, 1146 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201c[A]ppellate counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient for failing to predict what was not yet a certain holding.\u201d); <em>Jones v. United States, </em>224 F.3d 1251, 1257-58 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201cSince the district court would be required to follow the law of this circuit until it was overruled, ... it was not completely unreasonable for counsel to make a strategic decision to forego a claim that was a loser under the then-current state of the law.... [W]e are not prepared to say categorically that counsel\u2019s failure to [preserve a losing argument] constituted prejudicial, ineffective nonfea-sance while the law was still unsettled.\u201d); <em>Spaziano v. Singletary, </em>36 F.3d 1028, 1039 (11th Cir.1994) (\u201cWe have held many times that reasonably effective representation cannot and does not include a requirement to make arguments based on predictions of how the law may develop.\u201d (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">The rule applies even if the claim, based upon anticipated changes in the law, was reasonably available at the time counsel failed to raise it. <em>See Dell v. United States, </em>710 F.3d 1267, 1282 (11th Cir.2013) (\u201c[I]t generally does not fall below the objective standard of reasonableness for ... counsel to fail to raise a claim in anticipation that undeniably would lose under current law but might succeed based on the outcome of a forthcoming Supreme Court decision.\u201d); <em>Pitts v. Cook, </em>923 F.2d 1568, 1572-74 (11th Cir.1991) (holding that even though a claim based on <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), was reasonably available to counsel at the time of trial, failure to anticipate the <em>Batson </em>decision and raise that claim was not ineffective assistance of counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">B. Counsel\u2019s Failure to Raise Career-Offender Claim on Direct Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">The district court properly denied Geter\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion because Geter did not establish that his appellate counsel was ineffective, such as to excuse his procedural default of his career-offender claim. At the time of Geter\u2019s sentencing, and when counsel filed and briefed Geter\u2019s direct appeal, a conviction for carrying a concealed firearm was a crime of violence for career-offender sentencing purposes; any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>argument to the contrary was squarely foreclosed under this Court\u2019s precedent. <em>See Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d at 1372 (holding expressly that carrying a concealed weapon in violation of Florida law is a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)). Appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise a non-meritorious claim in Geter\u2019s direct appeal, despite the fact that trial counsel had raised the claim at sentencing, does not constitute deficient performance under <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">On July 16, 2007, when Geter filed his opening brief on direct appeal, the Supreme Court had not even granted a writ of certiorari in <em>Begay. See Begay v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 1191, 128 S.Ct. 32, 168 L.Ed.2d 808 (2007) (granting writ of certio-rari and motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis). </em>Additionally, <em>Begay </em>was briefed, argued, and decided by the Supreme Court <em>after </em>Geter\u2019s initial and reply briefs were filed in Geter\u2019s direct appeal. In light of this timing, and the uncertainty about the outcome of <em>Begay, </em>Geter\u2019s appellate counsel\u2019s failure to anticipate a change in the law and raise a <em>Be-gay- </em>or Archer-type claim was not unreasonable \u201cunder prevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. \u201cWe have held many times that reasonably effective representation cannot and does not include a requirement to make arguments based on predictions of how the law may develop.\u201d <em>Spaziano, </em>36 F.3d at 1039 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted); <em>see also Pitts, </em>923 F.2d at 1573-74 (\u201c[BJecause law is not an exact science, an ordinary, reasonable lawyer may fail to recognize or to raise an issue, even when the issue is available, yet still provide constitutionally effective assistance.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">C. Counsel\u2019s Failure to Move to File a Supplemental Brief on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">In this \u00a7 2255 appeal, Geter does not appear to have renewed his claim that his appellate counsel was ineffective because he failed to move to file \u2014 in the two-day window between when <em>Begay </em>was decided and when this Court issued its decision affirming Geter\u2019s conviction and sentence \u2014 a supplemental brief to address <em>Begay </em>or its effect on Geter\u2019s status as a career offender. Even if Geter has not abandoned his supplemental-brief argument, it is without merit. Because Geter did not challenge his career-offender designation in his opening appellate brief, counsel\u2019s attempt to raise an argument related to that designation for the first time in a supplemental brief would have been futile. <em>See United States v. Levy, </em>379 F.3d 1241, 1242-43 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201c[E]ven before a decision on the merits of a direct appeal is issued, this Court repeatedly has denied motions to file supplemental briefs that seek to raise new issues not covered in an appellant\u2019s initial brief on appeal.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Njau, </em>386 F.3d 1039, 1041-42 (11th Cir.2004) (refusing to consider a claim under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), first raised in a letter submitted pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 28(j)); <em>United States v. Hembree, </em>381 F.3d 1109, 1110 (11th Cir.2004) (denying a motion to file a substitute or amended principal brief raising a <em>Blakely </em>claim); <em>United States v. Curtis, </em>380 F.3d 1308, 1310-11 (11th Cir.2004) (denying a motion to file a supplemental brief raising a <em>Blakely </em>claim), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>400 F.3d 1334 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Padilla-Reyes, </em>247 F.3d 1158, 1164 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201c[BJecause Padilla did not raise this issue in his initial brief to this court, we apply the rule that parties cannot properly raise new issues at supplemental briefing, even if the issues arise based on intervening decisions or new developments cited in supplemental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>authority.\u201d); <em>United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989, 990 (11th Cir.2001) (refusing to consider, on remand from the Supreme Court, an issue arising under <em>A-pprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), not raised in the initial or reply brief during the original appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">In light of this futility, under <em>Strickland </em>Geter cannot show that his appellate counsel performed deficiently by failing to raise a career-offender claim based on the decision in <em>Begay </em>for the first time on appeal through a supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Indeed, as outlined earlier, Geter\u2019s appellate counsel on direct appeal did file a petition for rehearing and motion to supplement that petition, wherein appellate counsel recognized that <em>Begay </em>and <em>Archer </em>effected a change to the controlling law of this Circuit by abrogating <em>Gilbert. </em>Appellate counsel then attempted to raise Get-er\u2019s career-offender sentencing enhancement issue in a motion to supplement the petition for rehearing, admitting that he \u201csimply did not anticipate\u201d the change in controlling law. This Court denied the petition for rehearing and motion to supplement on the very basis identified above: appellate counsel\u2019s \u201cfailure to brief the [career-offender sentencing enhancement] argument in his opening brief constituted a waiver of that argument.... notwithstanding our recent decision in <em>Archer.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">D. Government\u2019s Argument on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">The government argues that the underlying claim in Geter\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion \u2014 a challenge to his career offender designation \u2014 is not cognizable and cannot be brought in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding anyway because the claim does not turn on whether Geter\u2019s \u201csentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a). However, because we decide Geter\u2019s appeal on procedural default grounds, \u201cwe leave for another day the question of whether this type of claim is cognizable under \u00a7 2255 in the first instance.\u201d <em>McKay, </em>657 F.3d at 1195.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">Because Geter has failed to demonstrate that his appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance, he has not satisfied the \u201ccause\u201d component of the eause-and-preju-dice exception to the procedural default rule. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687-88, 104 S.Ct. at 2064-65; <em>Nyhuis, </em>211 F.3d at 1344. Thus, the district court did not err in denying Geter\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion because the only claim that Geter sought to raise in that motion \u2014 a challenge to his career-offender designation \u2014 was procedurally defaulted, and no exceptions to the procedural default rule apply here. We therefore affirm the denial of Geter\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b854-11\">. Without the career-offender designation, Geter\u2019s total offense level was 18 and his criminal history category was IV, yielding a guidelines range of 41 to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual, </em>Ch. 5, Part A (Sentencing Table) (Nov. 2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b856-8\">. <em>Begay </em>involved a DUI crime under the ACCA, while Geter\u2019s issue related to concealed weapon convictions under the career-offender classification in the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b857-10\">. In reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, we review findings of fact for clear error and questions of law <em>de novo. Rhode v. United States, </em>583 F.3d 1289, 1290 (11th Cir.2009). The issue of whether a \u00a7 2255 movant's claims are subject to procedural default is a mixed question of law and fact, which we review <em>de novo. Fordham v. United States, </em>706 F.3d 1345, 1347 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
