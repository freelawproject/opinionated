Jackson pled guilty to one count of aiding and abetting an attempted armed bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a), (d), and 2 (Bank Count 1), and one count of aiding and abetting the discharge of a firearm during a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(iii), and 2 (Bank Count 2). A jury then convicted Jackson on one count of conspiracy to commit a Hobbs Act robbery at Weeyums Philly Style restaurant (Weeyums), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a) (Weeyums Count 1), and one count of aiding and abetting a Hobbs Act robbery at Weeyums, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951(a), and 2 (Wee-yums Count 2). The district court sentenced Jackson to concurrent 74-month <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>sentences for Bank Count 1 and Weeyums Counts 1 and 2, followed by a consecutive mandatory minimum 10-year sentence for Bank Count 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">With respect to the Weeyums Counts, Jackson asserts the district court erred in instructing the jury that a minimal effect on interstate commerce was sufficient to convict him. He contends even under a <em>de minimis </em>standard, the Government failed to present sufficient evidence that the robbery had an effect on interstate commerce such that it supported his convictions. As to Bank Count 2, Jackson asserts the district court erred in sentencing him to a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence because he is not accountable for his codefen-dant\u2019s accidental discharge of a firearm after they left the bank.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we affirm Jackson\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"An9\">\n<em>Interstate commerce</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A9kx\">We review the sufficiency of the evidence of a Hobbs Act violation <em>de novo. United States v. Dean (Dean </em>I), 517 F.3d 1224, 1227 (11th Cir.2008), <em>aff'd in part, </em>556 U.S. 568, 129 S.Ct. 1849, 173 L.Ed.2d 785 (2009). \u201c[W]e consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, drawing all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in the Government\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>United States v. Friske, </em>640 F.3d 1288, 1290-91 (11th Cir.2011) (quotations omitted). We will not overturn a jury\u2019s verdict \u201cif any reasonable construction of the evidence would have allowed the jury to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1291 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">The Hobbs Act prohibits robbery and conspiracies to commit robbery that \u201cin any way or degree obstruct! ], delay! ], or affect! ] commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a). To prove a Hobbs Act conspiracy, \u201cthe government need only prove a robbery and effect on commerce.\u201d <em>Dean I, </em>517 F.3d at 1227-28. As to the interstate commerce element, \u201cthe government is only required to establish a minimal effect on interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1228 (quotations omitted). \u201c[A] \u2018mere depletion of assets\u2019 is sufficient proof of an effect on interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b941-11\">Jackson does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence as to the robbery element of his Weeyums convictions; thus, the parties\u2019 arguments are limited to the interstate commerce element. Jackson\u2019s contention the Government failed to present sufficient evidence of an effect on interstate commerce is without merit. The Government presented evidence that Jackson\u2019s codefendant took $500-600 from the cash register at Weeyums, and we have held that \u201ca mere depletion of assets\u201d is sufficient evidence of an effect on interstate commerce. <em>See Dean I, </em>517 F.3d at 1228. Even if such a depletion of the restaurant\u2019s assets were not sufficient, however, the Government also presented evidence that Weeyums had interstate customers, ordered supplies from other states, banked with a national bank, and closed for at least three days as a result of the robbery. Thus, it presented evidence of, at the least, a minimal effect on interstate commerce sufficient to support Jackson\u2019s convictions for conspiracy to commit, and aiding and abetting the commission of, a Hobbs Act robbery. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b942-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>We also \u201creview <em>de novo </em>a challenge to the district court\u2019s jury instructions.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1320 (11th Cir.2008). The district court has \u201cbroad discretion in formulating jury instructions provided that the charge as a whole accurately reflects the law and the facts,\u201d and we will only reverse a conviction based on a jury instruction if \u201cthe issues of law were presented inaccurately, or the charge improperly guided the jury in such a substantial way as to violate due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">As to Jackson\u2019s assertion the district court\u2019s jury instruction was erroneous, the district court did not err by instructing the jury that a minimal effect on interstate commerce was sufficient, because that charge accurately reflects the law. <em>See id.; see also Dean I, </em>517 F.3d at 1228. Accordingly, we affirm Jackson\u2019s convictions for conspiracy to commit, and aiding and abetting the commission of, a Hobbs Act Robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">\n<em>Accidental discharge of firearm</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">We review \u201c[t]he district court\u2019s legal interpretation of statutes and Sentencing Guidelines ... <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Carillo-Ayala, </em>713 F.3d 82, 87 (11th Cir.2013). Section 924(c) states, in relevant part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-7\">[A]ny person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence ... uses or carries a firearm ... shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence ...\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-8\">(ii) if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-9\">(iii) if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b942-10\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii)-(iii). The Supreme Court has held a defendant\u2019s accidental discharge of a firearm is punishable by the ten-year mandatory minimum set forth in \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(iii). <em>Dean v. United States (Dean II), </em>556 U.S. 568, 577, 129 S.Ct. 1849, 173 L.Ed.2d 785 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-12\">Section 2 of Title 18 provides that \u201c[wjhoever ... aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures [the commission of an offense against the United States] is punishable as a principal.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a). \u201cUnder \u00a7 2, the acts of the principal become those of the aider and abettor as a matter of law.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>334 F.3d 1228, 1232 (11th Cir.2003). Thus, a defendant who aided and abetted a \u00a7 924(c) offense \u201cis accountable for the entirety of the conduct\u201d relating to the \u00a7 924(c) offense. <em>Id. </em>at 1233.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-13\">The district court did not err in applying the ten-year mandatory minimum under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(iii) to Jackson. A defendant\u2019s accidental discharge of a firearm is punishable by the ten-year mandatory minimum sentence. <em>Dean II, </em>556 U.S. at 577, 129 S.Ct. 1849. The indictment charged Jackson with violating \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(iii) and 2 by aiding and abetting his codefendants in knowingly using and carrying firearms during and in relation to a crime of violence. At Jackson\u2019s change-of-plea hearing, he agreed with the Government\u2019s description of the attempted bank robbery and admitted that a firearm was discharged from the vehicle in which he and his codefendants escaped from the bank. The criminal judgment indicates that Jackson was adjudged guilty of violating \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(iii) and 2. On appeal, Jackson does not contest that his codefendant discharged his firearm. Moreover, an accidental discharge of a firearm is a reasonably foreseeable result of bringing a gun to an attempted bank robbery. Accordingly, under \u00a7 2, Jackson is accountable for his codefendant\u2019s accidental discharge of the firearm and he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>punishable by the ten-year mandatory minimum sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; <em>Williams, </em>334 F.3d at 1232-33. Thus, we affirm Jackson\u2019s sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b941-7\">. After briefing concluded, Jackson filed supplemental authority citing to the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), without further explanation of how the case applied to his appeal. We deem arguments not fully articulated on appeal as abandoned. <em>United States v. Capers, </em>708 F.3d 1286, 1296 (11th Cir.2013). Accordingly, we do not address Jackson\u2019s citation to <em>Alleyne.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
