In a comprehensive order entered June 5, 2012, the district court carefully explained why none of Christmas\u2019s claims has merit. In short, the court observed that \u201c[a]ll of the summary judgment evidence before the Court demonstrates that Christmas was suspended due to a perceived threat that he would engage in workplace violence, and he was terminated due to excessive absences for which he failed to provide timely excuses.\u201d We have reviewed the record and the briefs and conclude that the district court was correct, its reasoning sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">The summary judgment is AFFIRMED. Christmas\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the order denying, as moot, his motion to strike the defendant\u2019s brief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b260-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
