Deleon argues that the denial of his request for a continuance for the purpose of raising a collateral attack on his 2011 conviction pursuant to <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. 356, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010), violated his due process rights. He maintains that the BIA\u2019s ruling was clearly erroneous because the failure to grant continuances to aliens seeking to raise such collateral attacks on their convictions renders the ruling in <em>Padilla </em>meaningless because, in the absence of continuances, no aliens would have time to raise Padilla-based challenges to their convictions before they are removed from the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">The immigration judge ruled that Deleon was removable from the United States because he had been convicted of an aggravated felony offense. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Deleon did not challenge that determination before the BIA, and he does not challenge it in this court. Accordingly, we have jurisdiction to review only claims raising constitutional or purely legal questions. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (D). Although Deleon argues that the denial of a continuance violated his due process rights, the denial of a continuance in a case involving the jurisdiction-stripping provision of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) \u201cdoes not present a constitutional claim or issue of law that this court has jurisdiction to consider.\u201d <em>Ogunfuye v. Holder, </em>610 F.3d 303, 307 (5th Cir.2010). Therefore, we do not have jurisdiction to consider Deleon\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b262-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
