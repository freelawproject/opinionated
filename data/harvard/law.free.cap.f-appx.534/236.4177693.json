He asserts that the district court clearly erred when it declined to assign him a mitigating role adjustment in his offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Whether a defendant had a mitigating role in the offense of conviction is a factual determination that we review for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.2005). A defendant\u2019s participation in an offense is not evaluated with reference \u201cto the entire criminal enterprise of which [the defendant was] a part\u201d; instead, it is evaluated in relation to the conduct for which the defendant is being held accountable. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>242 F.3d 593, 598, 598-99 (5th Cir.2001). Section 3B1.2 applies only when a defendant is substantially less culpable than the average participant. <em>Villa-nueva, </em>408 F.3d at 203-04. It is the defendant\u2019s burden to show that he merits a \u00a7 3B1.2 adjustment. <em>Garcia, </em>242 F.3d at 597. In making factual determinations with regard to a sentence, a district court may rely on any information contained in the presentence report that has any indici-um of reliability. <em>United States v. Shipley, </em>963 F.2d 56, 59 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The PSR showed that Romero and his co-conspirator delivered to a confidential informant a black suitcase containing the methamphetamine and that Romero later met with the confidential informant to discuss transporting the methamphetamine to Atlanta. Although it made no explicit credibility determinations, the district court adopted the PSR over Romero\u2019s objection, implicitly rejecting Romero\u2019s denial at rearraignment of ever touching any narcotics or of doing more than making telephone calls. <em>Cf. United States v. Richardson, </em>998 F.2d 1014 (5th Cir.1993) (unpublished); <em>see also </em>5th Cir. R. 47.5.2. The district court was not, of course, required to accept self-serving declarations by Romero, made with the purpose of reducing his sentence, about the circumstances of his crime. <em>See United States v. Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d 135, 138 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">Romero\u2019s participation was essential, and not merely peripheral, to the advancement of the offense, <em>see Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 204, and was \u201ccoextensive with the conduct for which he was held accountable.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>242 F.3d at 598-99. Consequently, we find no clear error in the denial of Romero\u2019s request for a mitigating role adjustment. <em>See Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 203 &amp; n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b258-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
