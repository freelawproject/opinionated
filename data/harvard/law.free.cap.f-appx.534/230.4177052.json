He contends that the district court plainly erred by imposing the 16-level crime of violence enhancement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 based upon his prior conviction for burglary of a habitation under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a)(1). According to Gonzales, the Texas offense does not qualify as the enumerated offense of burglary of a dwelling in the commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 because Texas defines \u201cowner\u201d to include \u201ca person who[ ] has ... a greater right to possession of the property than the actor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">Because Gonzales did not object to the enhancement in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Morales-Mota, </em>704 F.3d 410, 411 (5th Cir.2013). We rejected a materially indistinguishable argument in <em>Morales-Mota, </em>704 F.3d at 412-13. In light of <em>Morales-Mota, </em>we find no error here, plain or otherwise. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b253-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
