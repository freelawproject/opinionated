No breach of contract legal claim is alleged on behalf of himself or his wife. And no plausible tort claim is alleged. This court has read the opinions of the district court dated August 2, 2012 and November 6, 2012 and finds no error there, nor has any claimed error been briefed as is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b289-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
