He argues on appeal that his stipulation and claim were filed in accordance with a valid admiralty rule, the Government\u2019s failure to respond should be construed as its acquiescence to his stipulation and claim, and the district court erred by failing to enforce the admiralty rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Pro se pleadings are afforded liberal construction. <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972). However, if a motion cannot be construed in such a way that relief is possible, it is a \u201cmeaningless, unauthorized motion\u201d properly denied by the district court. <em>United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 141-42 (5th Cir.1994). As found by the district court, Warren\u2019s stipulation, claim, and request for hearing were nonsensical and did not offer any coherent claim for relief. Thus, they were properly denied by the district court as meaningless, unauthorized motions. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">As Warren\u2019s appeal is utterly without merit, it is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. We caution Warren that future repetitive, frivolous, or abusive filings may result in the imposition of sanctions, including dismissal, monetary sanctions, and restrictions on his ability to file pleadings in this court or any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-14\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b265-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
