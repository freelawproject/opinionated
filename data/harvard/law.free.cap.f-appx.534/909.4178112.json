While on probation, she was arrested for selling crack cocaine to an undercover officer, and her probation was revoked on October 28, 1988. She was sentenced to a two-year term of imprisonment. After her release, she was convicted on two counts of unlawful distribution of a controlled substance and was sentenced as a habitual offender to a sixty-year prison term in November 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-23\">On June 18, 2012, Dozier, proceeding pro-se, brought this 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action for damages. She alleged that she was arrested, prosecuted, and sentenced for those controlled substance offenses in violation of the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The defendants consist of the police officers who arrested her, the attorney who prosecuted her, and the clerk of the court. The District Court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed her complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). She now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>On appeal, Dozier raises two issues. First, she argues that her claim is not barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), because she claims her convictions were invalidated when the Alabama state court remitted in 2008 the fines imposed as part of the sentence she received. Second, she argues that her claim is not barred by the statute of limitations because she claims her action should have been measured against Alabama\u2019s six-year statute of limitations for false imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">Upon a <em>de novo </em>review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">A court \u201cshall dismiss\u201d a case filed <em>in forma pauperis </em>if the court determines that the complaint \u201cfails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). However, <em>\u201c[p </em>]ro <em>se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998). We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state a claim, <em>viewing </em>the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1159-60 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">Under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>if a judgment in favor of the plaintiff on a \u00a7 1983 complaint for money damages \u201cwould necessarily imply the invalidity of [the] conviction or sentence,\u201d the district court must dismiss the complaint unless the plaintiff can \u201cdemonstrate that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated\u201d by \u201cproving] that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d 512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. at 2372.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">If successful, Dozier\u2019s claim for damages under \u00a7 1983 \u201cwould necessarily imply the invalidity of [her] conviction.\u201d <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 487, 114 S.Ct. at 2372. Thus, to proceed on her claim, Dozier must first show that her conviction has been reversed, expunged, invalidated, or called into question by issuance of a writ of habe-as corpus. <em>Id. </em>She has failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">Though Dozier cites one case, <em>Chisholm v. State, </em>42 Ala. 527, 528 (1868), in which the Alabama Supreme Court found that remittance of a fine pursuant to the Governor\u2019s pardon power under the Alabama Constitution \u201cdestroyed the vitality of the judgment, except as to costs,\u201d the more recent cases and statutory law of Alabama strongly suggest that the remittance of fines does not in all circumstances constitute such an invalidation. In <em>Thomas v. State, </em>the Court of Criminal Appeals of Alabama considered appellant\u2019s argument that remittance of the costs and fine associated with a menacing conviction invalidated that conviction. <em>Thomas v. State, </em>666 So.2d 849, 853 (Ala.Crim.App.1993), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. Ex parte Thomas, </em>666 So.2d 855 (Ala.1995). It held that appellant still had a valid conviction for menacing, because \u201c[r]e-gardless of whether the costs and fine were remitted in the misdemeanor conviction, the docket sheet for that offense clearly shows that the district court adjudged the appellant guilty [of] menacing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure, moreover, provide for an inquiry into a defendant\u2019s inability to pay a fine due to indigency and give Alabama courts the option of \u201creleasing] the defendant from obligation to pay the fine.\u201d Ala. R.Crim.P. 26.11(g) and (h)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>Dozier\u2019s claim that her conviction was invalidated in 2008 when her fines were remitted is without merit. Based on the information in the Case Action Summary that Dozier attached to her complaint, her fines were remitted not because her conviction was invalid, but because indigency and substantial hardship rendered her incapable of paying them. As in <em>Thomas, </em>\u201c[r]egardless of whether the costs and fine were remitted\u201d in her conviction, she was still judged guilty and convicted for the offenses in question. <em>Thomas, </em>666 So.2d at 853. Thus, because she has failed to show that her conviction was invalidated, we conclude that the district court did not err in finding her claim barred by <em>Heck, </em>and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">Because Dozier\u2019s complaint is barred by <em>Heck, </em>we need not reach the statute of limitations issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
