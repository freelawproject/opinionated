He contends that the district court erred by imposing a 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines based on his prior conviction for statutory rape under Georgia Code Annotated \u00a7 16-6-3. Specifically, Blanco-Fortuna argues that his prior offense does not satisfy the \u201cgeneric, contemporary meaning\u201d of the enumerated offenses of \u201cstatutory rape\u201d or \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d because the statute of conviction prescribes a three-year age differential between the victim and the defendant, rather than four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">As Blanco-Fortuna concedes, his sole argument is effectively foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d 541 (5th Cir.2013) (en banc), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>No. 12-10695 (U.S. June 6, 2013). In <em>Rodriguez, </em>we applied a \u201cplain-meaning\u201d approach to determine the \u201cgeneric, contemporary meaning\u201d of \u201cstatutory rape\u201d and \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d and concluded that the generic definitions of those offense categories do not include any specific age differential. <em>Id. </em>at 559-62 &amp; n. 28. We expressly rejected the claim that the statute at issue in that case\u2014 \u00a7 22.011(a)(2) of the Texas Penal Code\u2014 did not satisfy the \u201cgeneric, contemporary meaning\u201d of \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d because the statute prescribed a three-year instead of a four-year age differential between the victim and the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 562 n. 28. Blanco-Fortuna asserts that he is raising the issue solely to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">In light of <em>Rodriguez, </em>the district court did not err in imposing a 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2 based upon Blanco-Fortuna\u2019s prior conviction for statutory rape under \u00a7 16-6-3(a). Consequently, the motion for summary disposition is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b284-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
