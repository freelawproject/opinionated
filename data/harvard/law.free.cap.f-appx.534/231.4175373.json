The district court dismissed the \u00a7 1983 claims for failure to state a claim and noted a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) strike for the dismissal. The court dismissed the \u00a7 2254 claims without prejudice for failure to exhaust. On appeal, Thomas argues that his claim that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>probation was erroneously revoked for misidentification is a cognizable \u00a7 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Because Thomas\u2019s complaint sought monetary damages and immediate release, the district court correctly construed it as raising both \u00a7 2254 claims and \u00a7 1983 claims and properly analyzed both types. See <em>Serio v. Members of La. State Bd. of Pardons, </em>821 F.2d 1112, 1119 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 494, 499-500, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973). Thomas has abandoned, by failing to challenge, the dismissal of his \u00a7 2254 claims. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Regarding his \u00a7 1983 claims, Thomas\u2019s assertion of false imprisonment implicates the validity of his probation revocation. He has failed to establish that the probation revocation has been reversed, expunged, declared invalid, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, so his claims are barred pursuant to <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). <em>See McGrew v. Tex. Bd. of Pardons &amp; Paroles, </em>47 F.3d 158, 161 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Thomas\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and thus is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Therefore, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5TH Cir. R. 42.2. This dismissal counts as a strike under \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g); <em>Patton v. Jefferson Corr. Ctr., </em>136 F.3d 458, 463-64 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">We have also dismissed as frivolous Thomas\u2019s appeal in <em>Thomas v. Jackson, </em>No. 12-60518. Our dismissal of that appeal counts as a strike, and the dismissal of the complaint that is the subject of that appeal also counts as a strike. Accordingly, Thomas has accumulated more than three strikes and is now barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b253-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
