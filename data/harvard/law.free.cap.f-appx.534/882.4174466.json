No. Ill\u2014 220, 124 Stat. 2372. On appeal, Bell asserts that he is eligible for a sentence reduction because the district court based his sentence on the crack cocaine guideline. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. Bell further argues that the FSA\u2019s new mandatory m\u00ednimums should apply to Bell\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, which was filed after the FSA\u2019s effective date of August 3, 2010. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Bell\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-17\">Bell pleaded guilty, with a written plea agreement, to one count of distribution of more than five grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(B)(iii). Bell\u2019s mandatory minimum penalty was five years\u2019 imprisonment, with a statutory maximum of 40 years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii). Bell\u2019s plea agreement was not based on a particular sentence to be calculated pursuant to the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-18\">Prior to sentencing, a probation officer completed a presentence investigation report (PSI), which held Bell responsible for 27.22 grams of cocaine base, to which Bell stipulated in his plea agreement. The PSI assigned Bell a base offense level of 28, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(6).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, based on Bell\u2019s status as a career offender, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, his offense level automatically increased to 34 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>and he was assigned a criminal history category of VI. Based on a total offense level of 84 and a criminal history category of VI, Bell\u2019s guideline range was 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. The PSI stated that the plea agreement had no impact on Bell\u2019s guideline range calculation. At a sentencing hearing on July 12, 2007, the district court considered the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and Bell\u2019s status as a career offender. The court ultimately sentenced Bell to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment, at the low end of the guideline range. Bell did not file an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">On December 9, 2008, Bell filed a pro se \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, asking the court to reduce his sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court denied the motion, citing Bell\u2019s career offender status and finding that he was not eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706. On January 24, 2012, Bell again filed a pro se \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, later supplemented by counsel, requesting a sentence reduction pursuant to Amendment 750 and the FSA. The district court denied Bell\u2019s motion, again finding that because Bell was sentenced under the career offender guideline, he was therefore disqualified from receiving a sentence reduction under Amendment 750. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce the sentence of \u201ca defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). However, the grounds upon which a district court may reduce a sentence are limited: (1) \u201c[t]he Sentencing Commission must have amended the Sentencing Guidelines, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o)\u201d; (2) the \u201cguidelines amendment must have lowered the defendant\u2019s sentencing range\u201d; and (3) the amendment \u201cmust also be one that is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c).\u201d <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 376 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam). \u201cWhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">Amendment 750, which became effective on November 1, 2011, lowered the base offense levels for particular crack cocaine quantities in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(e). <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amends. 748, 750. The amendment did not, however, make any changes to \u00a7 4B1.1, the career offender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>provision. <em>See id; see also Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">We conclude that the district court properly denied Bell\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. As the court clearly articulated at Bell\u2019s sentencing hearing, his 262 month sentence was based upon his status as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, which resulted in the automatic assignment of an offense level of 34 and criminal history category of VI, as well as the corresponding guideline range. Therefore, because Bell\u2019s \u201cbase offense level[ ] under \u00a7 2D1.1 played no role in the calculation of [his guideline] range[],\u201d and because Amendment 750 \u201cdoes not alter the [career offender] sentencing range upon which his ... sentence was based,\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not allow for a reduction of his sentence. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327, 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Further, the FSA does not serve as a basis for Bell\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding because it \u201cis not a guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission, but rather a statutory change by Congress.\u201d <em>Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377. The FSA\u2019s statutory changes also did not apply to Bell, who was sentenced in 2007, before the FSA\u2019s enactment on August 3, 2010. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) did not empower the district court to reduce Bell\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b905-13\">. Bell\u2019s sentence was based upon the 2007 Sentencing Guidelines. The corresponding provision in the current (2010) edition of the Guidelines is \u00a7 2D 1.1 (c)(7), and now assigns a base offense level of 26 for \u201d[a]t least 20 Gframs] but less than 35 G[rams] of Cocaine Base.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b906-7\">. Although Bell did not explicitly request a sentence reduction or specify the exact legal basis of his motion, the district court was entitled to construe his pro se motion liberally. <em>See Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1160 (11th Cir.2003) (\"Pro <em>se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Bell also requested that the district court appoint counsel to assist with his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"Amh\">. We declared in <em>Lawson </em>that, despite the United States Supreme Court\u2019s plurality opinion in <em>Freeman v. United </em>States, - U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), <em>Moore </em>is still controlling law in this circuit. <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321 <em>(\u201cMoore </em>remains binding precedent because it has not been overruled.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
