However, the commission argues, no substantial rights of appellant were affected by its failure to serve appellant with a copy of a report entirely favorable to him,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and which, in any case, is merely advisory to the commission in its considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">The commission contends further that, in its order, it specifically concluded that the situation presented was not ordinary and that in such circumstances the principle that there must be a showing of deficiency in the service of a protesting carrier should not be controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-13\">Upon consideration of the entire record and under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>particular facts of this case, the order of the commission granting the application is neither unreasonable nor unlawful and is affirmed.
