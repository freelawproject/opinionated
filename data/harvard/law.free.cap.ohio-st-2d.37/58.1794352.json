An appearance by a defendant in one court does not constitute an \u201cappearance\u201d in another, entirely different, court.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">Because defendants did not enter an appearance in the Municipal Court, after having been personally served with summons and a cdpy of the petition, they were not entitled to notice of the default proceedings. Civ. R. 55(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">Accordingly, the Municipal Court was not in error in refusing to vacate the default judgment more than one year after the judgment was taken. The judgment of the Court of Appeals, affirming the overruling of defendants\u2019 motion to set aside the default judgment, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-13\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b81-14\">O\u2019Neill, C.
