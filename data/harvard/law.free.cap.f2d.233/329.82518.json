The specimens submitted also include \u201cAurora Illinois\u201d or \u201cAurora Ill. U.S.A.\u201d The Assistant Commissioner observed that \u201cIt is clearly apparent and applicant does not deny that \u2018Proquip\u2019 is a trade-mark for its products.\u201d There is nothing in the record to refute that statement and it will therefore be accepted as accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-24\">The issue is whether the use of the words \u201cWalker Process Equipment Inc.\u201d in the described manner constitutes use as a trade-mark, or, as held by the Patent Office tribunals, the words are merely a trade name used as such. The distinction between trade-marks and trade names is not always clear. As pointed out by the Supreme Court in American Steel Foundries v. Robertson, 269 U.S. 372, 46 S.Ct. 160, 70 L.Ed. 317, the two terms may sometimes overlap, but, generally speaking, a trade-mark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>is applicable to a vendible commodity and a trade name to a business. In that decision, the Court stated that a corporate name seems to fall more appropriately into the class of trade names.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The distinction between trade-marks and trade names was considered by this court in In re Lyndale Farm, 186 F.2d 723, 726, 38 C.C.P.A., Patents, 825. That case involved the words \u201cLyndale Farm,\u201d which had been affixed by means of tags, to crates in which cattle were shipped. The tags also bore the words \u201cFloydada, Texas,\u201d that being the location of the farm. This court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjF\">\u201cTrade-marks and trade names are distinct legal concepts within the ambit of the law of unfair competition. A trade-mark is fanciful and distinctive, arbitrary and unique. A trade name may be descriptive, generic, geographic, common in a trade sense, personal, firm, or corporate. A trade-mark\u2019s function is to identify and distinguish a product, whereas a trade name\u2019s function is to identify and distinguish a business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">It was further noted that the Lanham Act, Trade-Mark Act of 1946, 15 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1051 et seq., contains no provision permitting registration of trade names, as such, on the Principal Register, although section 2(f) \u201cwould permit <em>inter alia </em>a trade name which has become distinctive of applicant\u2019s <em>goods </em>in commerce to be registered on the principal register upon a showing of adequate proof of distinctiveness\u201d, but that the Lyndale application was not filed under the provisions of that section. (Italics quoted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">It is emphasized by appellant here that the decision in the Lyndale Farm case is based, at least in part, on the fact that the tags bearing the words \u201cLyndale Farm\u201d were not attached to the goods (cattle), but to the crates in which they were shipped and from which it was presumed they were removed before being sold. In that respect the Lyndale Farm case differs from the instant one, since the words \u201cWalker Process Equipment Inc.\u201d are applied directly to appellant\u2019s goods. However, the Lyndale Farm decision does not hold that a trade name <em>ipso facto </em>becomes a trade-mark when it is applied to merchandise. That is but one of the factors to be considered in determining whether there has been a trade-mark use.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">There can be no doubt that the words \u201cWalker Process Equipment Inc.\u201d constitute a trade name, but that, in itself, would not necessarily preclude them from being a trade-mark as well since, as observed in the American Steel Found-dries case, the name of a corporation may be a trade-mark, a trade name, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">As defined in the Lanham Act, \u201cThe term \u2018trade-mark\u2019 includes any word, name, symbol, or device or any combination thereof adopted and used by a manufacturer or merchant to identify his goods and distinguish them from those manufactured and sold by others.\u201d 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1127.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">It seems obvious, as was pointed out by the Assistant Commissioner, that the words \u201cWalker Process Equipment Inc.\u201d1 were adopted primarily for the purpose of identifying the applicant and distinguishing it from other producers of goods rather than for the purpose of identifying or distinguishing its goods from those of other producers.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">Since the words \u201cWalker Process Equipment Inc.\u201d were not adopted to identify or distinguish goods, and would not, standing alone, be considered a trade-mark, any trade-mark significance which they might have must be of a secondary nature acquired as the result of use. It is therefore necessary to further examine how those words were used.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-14\">As above stated, the specimens submitted by appellant show that the words \u201cWalker Process Equipment Inc.\u201d are used in association with the words \u201cAurora Illinois\u201d or \u201cAurora Ill. U.S.A.\u201d and with the trade-mark \u201cProquip,\u201d which is more prominently displayed than the other words.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-15\">Since the word \u201cProquip\u201d is a trademark, it must necessarily identify and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>distinguish the goods to which it is applied, and being the most prominent feature of the specimens presented, it is obviously intended to be the principal means of identification. The words \u201cWalker Process Equipment Inc.\u201d are therefore clearly unnecessary so far as any trade-mark purpose is concerned, since the goods are sufficiently identified without them by an arbitrary word which would normally be considered to be a trade-mark. While it may be that two or more distinct trade-marks may be applied simultaneously to the same goods, that is clearly not the usual practice, and where, as here, the most prominent feature of a label is a word which is unquestionably a trade-mark, the natural inference would be that the remaining words on the label are not to be considered a trade-mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Moreover, in the instant case, each of the specimens includes the words \u201cAurora Illinois\u201d or \u201cAurora Ill. U.S.A.\u201d displayed in such a manner as to make it clear they indicate the location of Walker Process Equipment Inc. In the Lyndale Farm case this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">\u201cFurthermore, the inference is created by the addition of the address \u2018Floydada, Texas\u2019 to the placard that the use here involved does not so much distinguish appellant\u2019s cattle as it identifies appellant as the source of the shipment while the crate and its contents are in transit. That is trade name usage as distinguished from trade-mark usage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Similarly here the addition of the address of Walker Process Equipment Inc. suggests that the name of the corporation is not being used as a trade-mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Obviously, the question of whether a corporate name, which is also a trade name, has been used as a trademark must be decided on the circumstances of each particular case. The initial presumption is that a corporate name is a trade name rather than a trade-mark. As was noted in the Lyndale Farm case, a trade name which has become distinctive of an applicant\u2019s goods in commerce may be registrable under section 2(f) of the 1946 TradeMark Act. Whether it is possible for a trade name to be registered as a trademark in any other manner is a question which need not be decided here, since, for the reasons given, we agree with the lower tribunals that appellant has failed to show a trade-mark use of the words involved and, accordingly, is not entitled to the registration sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">A situation similar to that here was before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in Duncan Electric Mfg. Co. v. Marzall, Commissioner of Patents, 95 U.S.P.Q. 242, where it was held the words \u201cDuncan Electric Mfg. Co.\u201d had not been used in a trademark sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">Appellant relies on Ex partes Dallioux, 83 U.S.P.Q. 262, holding the name \u201cAndre Dallioux\u201d to be registrable as a trade-mark. That case, however, was concerned with the prohibition in section 2(e) of the 1946 Act against the registration of a mark which is \u201cprimarily merely a surname\u201d and did not involve the manner in which the name was used. Therefore, it is not in point with the facts here.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">The decision appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b380-13\">JACKSON, Judge, retired, recalled to participate.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b380-14\">O\u2019CONNELL and COLE, JJ., because of illness, did not participate in the hearing or decision of this case.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
