The affidavit of service of the declaration by which the suit was commenced stated that \u201cdue service\u201d of a copy of the declaration was made on the agent of the relator at Bay City, Michigan, naming him, on April 21, 1893, and that another copy of the declaration, with notice of rule to plead indorsed thereon, was served upon J. J. Crowley, another acting agent of the relator, at Detroit, Michigan, on the 8th day of May, 1893. The default of the relator for want of an appearance and plea was entered, and made absolute, and a judgment rendered, which relator moved to set aside, as also its default, on the ground that no legal proof of the service of the declaration had been made. The motion was denied, and relator applied for a <em>mandamus </em>to compel the respondent to grant the motion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number><em>A.
