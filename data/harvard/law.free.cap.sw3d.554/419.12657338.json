For the reasons that follow, Movant's points are denied, and the motion court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After a jury found Movant guilty of receiving stolen property-a video camera-valued at $500 or more, he was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment.

On April 13, 2016, the State filed a \"Motion to Vacate Judgment.\" On June 28, 2016, the motion court granted the State's \"Motion to Vacate Judgment.\" On August 1, 2016, the motion court then entered a new judgment denying Movant's amended\n   Rule 29.15 motion (\"the second judgment\").

If no authorized after-trial motion is filed, the judgment becomes final at the expiration of thirty days after its entry. Rule 81.05(a)(1). If an authorized after-trial motion is timely filed, however, Rule 81.05(a)(2)(A) grants the trial court up to ninety days from the date the motion was filed to rule on the motion, after which the motion is deemed denied. Rule 81.05(a)(2)(A) and (B).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The combined effect of these Rules is to afford the trial court the authority to modify its judgment for any reason for good cause within thirty days of its entry, and the authority between the thirty-first and ninetieth day following entry of a judgment to modify its judgment to remediate a matter raised by a party in an authorized after-trial motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State ex rel.

Because Movant filed a direct appeal, his\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    motion was due within 90 days from the date the mandate was issued in his direct appeal.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Rule 29.15(b).

Thus, Movant's\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    motion was timely filed. Given the circumstances of this case, the amended motion originally had to be filed within 60 days of \"the date both the mandate of the appellate court is issued and counsel is appointed[.]\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Rule 29.15(g). Post-conviction counsel was appointed on July 22, 2015. The motion court subsequently granted a 30-day extension of time in which to file the amended motion. Thus, Movant's amended motion had to be filed within 90 days of July 22, 2015.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6876396\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/458/822/#p825\">\n       id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    Movant's amended motion, filed 89 days thereafter on October 19, 2015, was timely.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Rules 75.01 and 81.05 have been applied in the context of post-conviction review.\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Thomas v.
