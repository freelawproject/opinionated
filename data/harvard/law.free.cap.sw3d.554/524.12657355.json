DOWD, JR., Presiding Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Deanna Reinhart (\"Appellant\") appeals from a judgment granting the motion of Timothy Reinhart (\"Respondent\") to modify the child support and denying Appellant's motion for contempt. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On April 19, 2010, the trial court entered its judgment and decree of dissolution of the parties' marriage. The trial court awarded Appellant and Respondent joint legal and physical custody of their children, who were respectively ages 14 and 6 at the time of dissolution, and Appellant was designated the residential parent. The dissolution incorporated an agreement between Appellant and Respondent that Respondent would pay Appellant $1,500 per month in child support for two children and $1,000 per month for one child. The parties agreed that Respondent would pay more child support than the guidelines required, and as such, the dissolution judgment noted that the child support amounts were not determined in accordance with authorized support guidelines \"as a strict application of the child support guidelines would be unjust and inappropriate at this time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Respondent filed and served Appellant with a motion to modify child support on August 11, 2015, claiming that since the time of the original judgment there were changed circumstances so substantial and continuing as to make the terms of the judgment unreasonable. During the pendency of the case, in August 2016, when the parties' oldest child went away to college, Appellant reduced his child support payment from $1,500 for two children to $1,000 for one child. On September 8, 2016, Appellant sought to have Respondent's wages withheld for failure to pay the full $1,500 in child support, and on September 13, 2016, Appellant moved to hold Respondent in contempt for the $500 in arrears. On September 30, 2016, the trial court terminated the wage withholding pursuant to Respondent's motion, and Appellant's motion for contempt was continued to the date of the trial on Respondent's motion to modify child support. After hearing the evidence at trial, the trial court denied Appellant's motion for contempt and prospectively reduced Respondent's child support payment to $288 per month and ordered Appellant to reimburse Respondent $3,428 for overpaid child support. This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Appellant makes two points on appeal. First, she claims that the trial court erred in granting Respondent's motion to modify because modification must be predicated on a finding of the obligor's inability to pay the agreed upon amount of child support, and Respondent did not prove his inability to pay since he testified at trial that he was making more money than at the time\n   of the original dissolution judgment and that he was able to pay his current child support obligation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, Appellant claims the trial court erred in not finding Respondent in contempt for his failure to pay the required amount of child support while the parties' oldest child attended college.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Our review of the trial court's ruling on a motion to modify child support in a dissolution judgment \"is limited to determining whether the judgment is supported by substantial evidence, whether it is against the weight of the evidence, whether it erroneously declares the law or whether it erroneously applies the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Selby v.

Here, there was evidence of a change in the children's needs in that the parties no longer paid the $480 in monthly childcare expenses paid at the time of the original dissolution judgment, the parties' oldest child was in college and emancipated and a Sunday overnight was added to Respondent's weekend visitation. This evidence of changes in the children's needs contributed to the trial court's overall finding of changed circumstances so substantial and continuing so as to make the terms of the original dissolution decree unreasonable and warranted modification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section 452.370.1. Accordingly, the trial court's modification of Respondent's child support obligation was supported by substantial evidence, was not against the weight of the evidence and did not erroneously declare or apply the law.

To support this argument, Appellant relies on\n   <em>\n    Abernathy v.

In\n   <em>\n    Abernathy\n   </em>\n   , the parents agreed that the father would pay a higher amount of child support than the Form 14 presumed amount, and the father then sought modification based upon a reduction in child care costs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6908191\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/445/638/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6908191\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/445/638/\">\n    at 639-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Missouri Department of Social Services issued a proposed modification reducing the father's child support obligation, and after an administrative hearing, the agency further reduced his obligation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6908191\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/445/638/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6908191\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/445/638/\">\n    at 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On appeal, this Court noted that because the father's child support obligations were based on an agreement between the parties, not the presumed amount, the father \"had the heavy burden of proving he is unable to support his child in the manner contemplated at the time of the parties' prior agreement\" and that he could no longer afford his originally agreed to child support obligation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6908191\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/445/638/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6908191\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/445/638/\">\n    at 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting Brown,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9135634\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/19/717/#p724\">\n    19 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   724 ) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). The Court concluded that \"[t]he agency erred as a matter of law by failing to apply this standard, and instead basing its finding of a substantial and continuing change in circumstances on a decrease in [the payee's] child-care costs\" and that because the amount of the payor's child support was not based on the presumed amount and was established pursuant to the parties' agreement, \"the agency was required to predicate any finding of substantial and continuing change in circumstances on [the father's] inability to pay.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 641, 642.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   However, in\n   <em>\n    Abernathy\n   </em>\n   , the court reviewed the agency's application of the twenty-percent provision of Section 452.370.1 and found that the provision was inapplicable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 641. Here, the application of the twenty-percent provision is not at issue in this case. The trial court did not apply the provision, and neither party argues that it should have been applied. In addition, the \"inability to pay\" requirement discussed in\n   <em>\n    Abernathy\n   </em>\n   comes from a Western District case,\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

In\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , the mother claimed that the trial court erred in decreasing the father's child support obligation because the father did not show a substantial and continuing change in circumstances that made the original terms of the decree unreasonable and that the decrease in child support was not in the best interests of the children.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9135634\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/19/717/#p724\">\n    19 S.W.3d at 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At the time of the original dissolution judgment, the father agreed to pay more than the presumed child support amount, and when he later moved to modify legal custody, the court terminated joint legal custody and awarded the father legal custody of the children, ordered him to pay all the children's extracurricular expenses for the activities in which he enrolled them and decreased child support in accordance with the father's Form 14.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9135634\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/19/717/#p724\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9135634\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/19/717/#p724\">\n    at 720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Respondent here offers many bases for modification other than changes in his own financial situation: Appellant's income increased from $79,500 at the time of dissolution to $183,000 at the time of trial, Appellant's new husband contributed $530 to her monthly household expenses, the parties no longer pay the $480 in monthly childcare expenses paid at the time of the original dissolution judgment, the parties' oldest child is in college and emancipated and a Sunday overnight was added to Respondent's weekend visitation. Such bases are properly considered by the courts when faced with a request for modification of child support, and the financial resources of\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   parties are\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   considered as indicated by the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   452.370.1 (\"In a proceeding for modification of any child support ..., the court, in determining whether or not a substantial change in circumstances has occurred,\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   consider all financial resources of\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   parties, including the extent to which the reasonable expenses of either party are, or should be, shared by a spouse or other person with whom he or she cohabits\" (emphasis added) ).

On June 21, 2016, the custody order was modified to add a Sunday night to Respondent's weekend visitation, and in August 2016, when the parties' oldest child went to college, Respondent reduced his child support from $1,500 per month to cover two children to $1,000 per month to cover one child. Claiming the dissolution judgment clearly provided that child support shall not abate while a child attends college, Appellant sought to have Respondent's wages withheld for failing to pay the full amount of child support and moved to hold Respondent in contempt for the $500 in arrears. The trial court terminated the wage withholding pursuant to Respondent's motion, and Appellant's motion to hold Respondent\n   in contempt was continued to the date of the trial on Respondent's motion to modify child support. The trial court ultimately denied Appellant's motion for contempt and reduced Respondent's child support modification to $288 per month and ordered Appellant to reimburse Respondent $3,428 for overpaid child support from the time of the June 2016 custody modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Here, the trial court had discretion to modify Respondent's child support obligation as of August 11, 2015, the date Appellant was personally served with Respondent's motion to modify child support.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hoffman-Francis v.

App. W.D. 2009) (noting that under Section 452.370.6 \"a child support order may be modified only as to obligations that accrue subsequent to the date the motion is personally served\" and that the trial court \"has discretion to determine the effective date of a modified child support order\"). By ordering Respondent to be reimbursed for overpaid child support as of the June 2016 custody modification, the trial court effectively retrospectively modified Respondent's child support obligation as of that custody modification. Because the order established that Respondent overpaid rather than underpaid during the time period at issue in Appellant's motion for contempt, Appellant cannot establish that Respondent failed to perform an obligation under the original dissolution judgment as is necessary for the trial court to find civil contempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We have found no error in the trial court's order modifying child support as challenged.
