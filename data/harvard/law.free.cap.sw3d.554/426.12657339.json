(CFG) and the trustees and/or agents of such holders (collectively, Lenders).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Borrowers' claims against Lenders are not barred by the applicable statute of limitations, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This case has a long and complicated history. For purposes of this appeal, which involves a fairly narrow legal issue, we endeavor to include only those facts necessary for a full understanding and evaluation of that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Borrowers are homeowners who obtained second mortgage loans\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   on their Missouri homes from CFG. The Coxes received their second mortgage loan from CFG on September 30, 1997, the Springers received their loan on October 8, 1997, and the Bakers received their loan on December 2, 1997.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   After making the loans, CFG sold or assigned them to other entities, many of whom are participants in this litigation. The assignees pooled these (and\n   other) loans and placed them in trusts. The pools were used to collateralize bonds or other investment instruments that were sold to investors. The borrowers' monthly mortgage payments created a revenue stream from which payments were made to those who bought the mortgage-backed investments. In some cases, the assignees designated a separate entity to process the payments made by mortgagors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The MSMLA, which governs CFG's loans to the Coxes, the Springers, and the Bakers, provides, with specific exceptions, \"[n]o charge other than that permitted by section 408.232 shall be directly or indirectly charged, contracted for or received in connection with any second mortgage loan.\" \u00a7 408.233.1. The MSMLA further provides that \"[a]ny person violating [that prohibition] shall be barred from recovery of any interest on the contract,\" except as otherwise provided in that section. \u00a7 408.236.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Bakers commenced this action on June 28, 2000, by filing a petition alleging, among other things, that CFG, Master Financial, Inc. (a servicer of CFG's Missouri second mortgage loans), and Defendants \"Does 1-25,\" who would later include Lenders, among others, violated the fee limitations of MSMLA, \u00a7 408.233.1, in the course of making the Bakers' loan by directly or indirectly charging, contracting for, and/or receiving excessive loan origination fees and other fees not permitted by \u00a7 408.233.1. Approximately a year after commencing this suit, the Bakers filed a First Amended Petition, dated July 12, 2001, joining Ocwen, Impac, and Wilmington\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   as defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 26, 2002, the Bakers, joined by the Coxes and the Springers, moved for certification of a plaintiffs' class.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In their motion, the homeowners argued that their claims \"are subject to the 6-year statute of limitations (claims against 'moneyed corporations') [in \u00a7 516.420]\" and \"the class period should therefore include claims arising 6 years before the action was filed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In opposing the motion to certify and in an earlier motion for summary judgment filed by one of the Master Financial Asset Securitization Trusts (MF Trusts),\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   the defendants urged the court to apply the three-year statute of limitations in \u00a7 516.130(2) to the homeowners' claims. On December 19, 2002, the court ruled that the MF Trust was a \"moneyed corporation\" within the meaning of \u00a7 516.420 and that the applicable statute of limitations was six years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On January 2, 2003, the court issued its Order Certifying Plaintiff Class pursuant to Rule 52.08.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court defined the class as \"[a]ll individuals who, on or after June 28, 1994: obtained a 'Second Mortgage Loan' from Century Financial; and who paid [fees or interest in violation of the MSMLA], or who financed the payment of [fees or interest in violation of the\n   MSMLA] as part of the principal loan balance, at or before closing....\" In addition to certifying the class, the court determined, consistent with its denial of the MF Trust's summary judgment motion, that the six-year statute of limitations in \u00a7 516.420 applied to plaintiffs' claims, stating,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [t]he 6-year statute of limitations contained in \u00a7 516.420 RSMo. applies to \"all\" lawsuits where the claimant seeks relief (i.e., \"to recover\n   <em>\n    any penalty or forfeiture imposed\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     or\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to enforce\n   <em>\n    any liability created by\n   </em>\n   ...\n   <em>\n    law\n   </em>\n   \") from and/or against a \"moneyed corporation.\" ... Because Plaintiffs are seeking to \"enforce a liability\" and/or to recover a \"penalty or forfeiture\" imposed by the MSMLA and \u00a7 408.562\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   against and from Century Financial, a \"moneyed corporation,\" and its derivatively liable assignees, Plaintiffs' statutory claims are governed by \u00a7 516.420 RSMo. The language of the statute is crystal clear: \"all\" suits to \"recover any penalty or forfeiture imposed, or to enforce any liability created by any ... law ... shall be brought within six years after the discovery by the aggrieved party of the facts upon which such penalty or forfeiture attached, or by which such liability was created.\" \u00a7 516.420 RSMo. 2000. Hence, the 6-year statute applies in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (Emphasis in original.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Shortly after class certification, Borrowers filed their Third Amended Petition, dated February 5, 2003, joining Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM) and Republic as defendants. Borrowers filed their Fourth Amended Petition (the Petition), the operative pleading for purposes of this appeal, on February 3, 2004, joining Banc One Financial Services, Inc., predecessor to Chase, as a defendant. The Petition asserts that Lenders, among others, became liable on CFG's Missouri loans just as CFG is and would be liable because the loans are \"high-cost\" mortgages under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201602\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (bb) (HOEPA). The Petition further alleges that Lenders, among others, directly violated the MSMLA, and continued repeatedly to violate it, by charging and/or receiving interest and principal on the loans, which included portions of the illegal settlement charges that had been financed as part of the principal loan amounts. Under the authority of \u00a7 408.236 of the MSMLA, Borrowers seek to recover all excessive loan origination and other fees they were charged in connection with the CFG loans and all interest paid or to be paid on the loans; they also seek prejudgment interest, punitive damages, reasonable attorneys' fees, and equitable relief under \u00a7 408.562.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2006, while this case was pending, this court issued an opinion in\n   <em>\n    Schwartz v.

App. W.D. 2006), where we ruled that the six-year statute of limitations in \u00a7 516.420 applies to MSMLA claims. Thereafter, Borrowers and Lenders proceeded with the understanding that the applicable limitations period was six years until the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit issued its opinion in\n   <em>\n    Rashaw v.

In\n   <em>\n    Rashaw\n   </em>\n   , which involved claims under the Missouri\n   Uniform Commercial Code and the Missouri Merchandizing Practices Act, the Eighth Circuit held that \u00a7 516.420\"is limited to penal statutes and does not apply to civil actions to recover penalties and forfeitures governed by \u00a7 516.130(2).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3902188\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/685/739/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3902188\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/685/739/\">\n    at 744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Relying on\n   <em>\n    Rashaw\n   </em>\n   , the Eighth Circuit subsequently held that MSMLA claims are subject to the three-year limitations period in \u00a7 516.130(2), rather than the six-year limitations period in \u00a7 516.420.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Washington v.

Then, Wilmington filed a motion for partial summary judgment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   which was followed by Impac's motion for summary judgment, both relying on the statute of limitations defense. On November 15, 2016, the court dismissed Ocwen and Republic and granted summary judgment to Wilmington and Impac.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On February 9, 2017, Borrowers moved the trial court to enter final judgment on Borrowers' claims and to stay the remainder of the class action pending Borrowers' appeal of the court's prior dismissal and summary judgment rulings. Before the court ruled on Borrowers' motion for a final judgment and stay, Chase moved for summary judgment raising the statute of limitations defense. The court granted Chase's motion on May 23, 2017. The next day, the court granted Borrowers' motion for a final judgment, determining that there was \"no just reason for delay\" and staying the action as to the remaining defendants pending Borrowers' appeal of the court's statute of limitations rulings. The court's May 24, 2017 judgment ended Borrowers' claims against Lenders based on a common legal issue and is a final judgment subject to appeal pursuant to Rule 74.01(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   All motions at issue in this appeal, whether denominated motions to dismiss or motions for summary judgment, were granted by the trial court based on its finding that the three-year statute of limitations in \u00a7 516.130(2), rather than the six-year statute of limitations in \u00a7 516.420, governs Borrowers' claims.

In their first point, they argue that the court erred in granting Lenders' dismissal and summary judgment motions based on the statute of limitations because Borrowers' claims are subject to the six-year limitations period in \u00a7 516.420, rather than the three-year limitations period in \u00a7 516.130(2). In their remaining five points, Borrowers argue that the court erred in finding their claims time barred under the three-year statute of limitations in \u00a7 516.130(2) because, even under the shorter limitations period, their claims are timely based on the following legal theories: (1) HOEPA's derivative liability (Point II), (2) accrual of claims against Lenders occurs when they acquire or begin servicing the loans (Point III), (3) the \"continuing or repeated wrong\" exception to accrual of claims (Point IV), (4) the relation back doctrine (Point V), and (5) class action tolling (Point VI).\n    <footnotemark>\n     16\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    The initial issue on appeal is whether Borrowers' MSMLA claims are subject to the three-year limitations period in \u00a7 516.130(2), as the trial court found, or the six-year limitations period in \u00a7 516.420, as we concluded in\n    <em>\n     Schwartz\n    </em>\n    and Borrowers advocate here (Point I).\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n    Because we conclude that \u00a7 516.420 applies and Borrowers' claims must be brought within six years, we need not reach Borrowers' alternative arguments regarding the timeliness of their claims under the shorter limitations period (Points II-VI).

The overlap between \u00a7\u00a7 516.130(2) and 516.420 is resolved by \u00a7 516.300, which states, \"[t]he provisions of sections 516.010 to 516.370 shall not extend to any action which is or shall be otherwise limited by any statute; but such action shall be brought within the time limited by such statute.\" Thus, where both \u00a7\u00a7 516.130(2) and 516.420 apply, the latter governs, and MSMLA claims must be brought within six years.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    This is the same conclusion this court reached in\n    <em>\n     Schwartz\n    </em>\n    in 2006, which involved MSMLA claims similar to those asserted by Borrowers.

In support of this contention, Lenders make two arguments. First, Lenders claim that the language of \u00a7\u00a7 516.380-.420 demonstrates that the statutes apply to only criminal causes of action. Second, Lenders argue that \u00a7 516.420 's introductory reference to \u00a7\u00a7 516.380-.420 makes its six-year statute of limitations an exception to only those sections and not to the limitations period in \u00a7 516.130. For ease of discussion, we address Lenders' second argument first.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Lenders argue that, by referring to \u00a7\u00a7 516.380-.410 in the introductory phrase, the legislature intended for \u00a7 516.420 's six-year statute of limitations to be an exception to only those sections listed and, thus, inapplicable to causes of action otherwise governed by \u00a7 516.130. In other words, Lenders see the omission of \u00a7 516.130 from that list as \"substantive and intentional.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Contrary to Lenders' argument, \u00a7 516.420 applies beyond just those causes of action identified in \u00a7\u00a7 516.380-.410 insofar as it also addresses \"suits against moneyed corporations ... to recover any penalty or forfeiture imposed, or to enforce\n    <em>\n     any liability created by the act of incorporation or any other law.\n    </em>\n    \" (Emphasis added.) While \u00a7\u00a7 516.380-.400 apply to only actions for penalties or forfeiture, \u00a7 516.420 applies to those types of actions\n    <em>\n     as well as\n    </em>\n    actions to enforce liabilities.

For, even if Lenders were correct about the exclusively criminal nature of \u00a7\u00a7 516.380-.400 (a proposition we do not address), that simply means that \u00a7 516.420 applies to\n    <em>\n     both\n    </em>\n    criminal and civil matters and is, therefore, not exclusively criminal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    For these reasons, we reject Lenders' reading of \u00a7 516.420 as applying the statute's six-year statute of limitations exclusively to causes of action that, but for the defendant's status as a moneyed corporation, would be subject to the statute of limitations in \u00a7\u00a7 516.380-.400.

App. 1955) (finding that the Revision Committee, which had no legislative authority, could not alter the meaning or effect of a statute as originally enacted).\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"28\">\n    <p id=\"p-91\">\n     Although this opening clause (\"No provision of this chapter\") is broader than the beginning of today's \u00a7 516.420 (\"None of the provisions of sections 516.380 to 516.420\"), that does not change our analysis, which is based primarily of the expansive language of the remainder of \u00a7 516.420. The fact that \u00a7 516.420 opens by referring to \u00a7\u00a7 516.380-.420 likely reflects the fact that those sections have been grouped together as a unit in the Missouri statutes since they were first enacted.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"29\">\n    <p id=\"p-92\">\n     See discussion,\n     <em>\n      infra\n     </em>\n     , in note 27.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"30\">\n    <p id=\"p-93\">\n     In their brief, Borrowers anticipate that three Lenders-Banc One (predecessor of Chase) and two members of Impac-will argue that, even under the longer limitations period in \u00a7 516.420, Borrowers' claims against them are barred. The briefs submitted by these Lenders suggest otherwise, however. According to Chase's brief, four loans originated by CFG in 1999 and 2000 were assigned to Banc One; those loans were issued fewer than six years before Banc One was joined as a defendant. In its brief, Impac does not suggest that claims against any of its members would be barred even under the longer limitations period.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"31\">\n    <p id=\"p-94\">\n     The motion court's dismissal of BNYM was based solely on the statute of limitations defense; the court did not address BNYM's jurisdictional argument. Likewise, Borrowers did not address that argument on appeal. Under these circumstances, we remand for consideration of the jurisdictional argument and development of the record below on this issue.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
