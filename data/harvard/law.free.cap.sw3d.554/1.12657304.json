Following a suppression hearing, the trial court granted the defendants' motions and dismissed the charges against them. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the trial court's ruling. The State then filed an application for permission to appeal to this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tenn. R. App. P. 11(a). We granted the State's application and, upon review, hold that, with respect to defendants Winsett and Janet Stanfield, the warrantless search of the residence was constitutionally permissible based on defendant Winsett's status as a parolee and the doctrine of common authority. However, we conclude that the warrantless search with respect to defendant Justin Stanfield was constitutionally unreasonable because he retained a reasonable expectation of privacy in his bedroom and the State failed to carry its burden of proving that defendant Winsett exercised common authority over Justin Stanfield's bedroom. Accordingly, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This matter involves the warrantless search of a Union City residence shared by defendant Janet Michelle Stanfield (Janet)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; her boyfriend, defendant Tony Alan Winsett (Tony); and her adult son, defendant Justin Bradley Stanfield (Justin).

Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 6, 2015, defendant Janet Stanfield lived with her boyfriend, defendant Tony Winsett, and her adult son, defendant Justin Stanfield, in a residence in Union City, Tennessee. Janet was serving a community corrections sentence for a 2012 felony conviction for promotion of the manufacture of methamphetamine. Defendant Winsett was on parole for felony convictions for possession of a controlled substance with intent to sell/deliver\n   and promotion of the manufacture of methamphetamine. Justin was not on any form of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 6, Union City Police Officer Ben Yates, while working with the drug task force, conducted a parole search\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   at the residence of defendant Winsett. Officer Yates contacted a parole officer to obtain a copy of defendant Winsett's parole certificate, but at the time of his arrival at the residence, between 1:00 and 3:00 p.m., he was unaccompanied by a parole or probation officer and did not first obtain a search warrant. Officer Yates was acting upon information that he received from a confidential informant, who told Officer Yates that defendant Winsett was using methamphetamine and \"possibly injecting with needles.\" The informant had previously supplied Officer Yates with reliable and credible information that had developed a narcotics case. Officer Yates had met defendant Winsett through his \"line of work\" and was aware that defendant Winsett was a parolee and that Janet Stanfield resided with him. He had observed Justin Stanfield's vehicle at the residence several times, so he had reason to believe that Justin also lived there. Officer Yates, together with Investigator David Crocker and Agent James Hall, responded to the Winsett residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When they arrived at the residence, Agent Hall observed a burn pile upon which some clear, very large, plastic vacuum-sealed bags had been discarded. The bags were dry although it had been raining only ten to fifteen minutes earlier, which indicated to Officer Yates that the bags had been recently placed on the pile. After further investigation, he determined that the bags contained marijuana residue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Officer Yates knocked on the front door. Investigator Crocker simultaneously knocked on the back door, but no one answered at either door. There were no cars visible in the driveway. The police continued to knock on the doors for approximately ten to twenty minutes. While Investigator Crocker and Agent Hall continued knocking at both entry doors, Officer Yates noted an open window on the north side of the residence and proceeded toward it. Through the window he could hear movement inside the house, which sounded to him \"like a running noise.\" Noting the presence of security cameras around the house and the recently discarded plastic bags, Officer Yates believed someone was present inside the residence destroying evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Based upon this belief, Agent Hall used a pocket knife to gain entry through the front door of the residence. As soon as the officers entered the residence, they detected a \"very strong odor of marijuana.\" A large dog, estimated to weigh 140 pounds, was in the living room. Officer Yates attributed the sounds he had heard to the dog. The dog had not made any other noise, such as barking, other than the \"running noise.\" After entering, officers noted three bedrooms with open doors. One of the bedrooms was used as storage and was uninhabitable. The officers ascertained which of the other two bedrooms belonged to whom. Officer Yates recognized defendant Winsett's bedroom because he observed a jacket that he had seen Winsett wearing on previous occasions. He knew that defendants Winsett and Janet Stanfield had been in a relationship for some time and observed articles of women's clothing; thus, he identified that\n   bedroom as being jointly occupied by those two defendants. In Justin's bedroom, officers found an identification card from Justin's place of employment and a piece of mail addressed to him in a closed drawer of a nightstand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Officer Yates searched the bedroom occupied by defendants Winsett and Janet Stanfield. In it they seized a 9mm Smith &amp; Wesson handgun and thirty-five rounds of ammunition. The serial number had been scratched off the handgun. They also seized a plastic box containing several sets of clear plastic bags, a set of digital scales, a marijuana pipe, and a small blue flashlight. Upon discovering that the flashlight did not work, Officer Yates unscrewed the battery compartment and found a small bag of a substance that he recognized as methamphetamine. Investigator Crocker located a pill container that contained methamphetamine inside the pocket of a black leather jacket. Agent Hall found a large pickle jar in Justin's bedroom, concealed inside a wooden television stand, that contained approximately seven ounces of marijuana. Agent Hall also seized a Glock 22 .40 caliber handgun and fifteen rounds from that room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Meanwhile, Officer Yates observed a television monitor in the master bedroom that showed live video feed from the security cameras placed around the outside of the residence. He noted that Justin's vehicle passed by the residence very slowly then accelerated at a high rate of speed. Officers left the residence and conducted a traffic stop of Justin's car. Nothing was seized from the vehicle, and Officer Yates advised Justin of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and placed him in custody. Officer Yates asked Justin if he sold marijuana. At first he denied it but subsequently admitted that he did, in fact, sell marijuana. Officer Yates requested consent to search Justin's cellular telephone, which he granted. When Justin unlocked the telephone, Officer Yates saw a message to the effect of \"Deleting All Messages.\" He knew that at the initiation of the traffic stop, Justin had deleted all of the information on his telephone. As the messages were deleting, a new text message appeared. Justin acknowledged that it pertained to a sale of one ounce of marijuana. Justin arranged a location to meet the buyer; an officer then transported Justin to the jail while Officer Yates drove to the predetermined meeting place to confront the would-be purchaser, at which time he placed the man under arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   During the narcotics operation involving Justin's would-be purchaser, a vehicle matching the description of defendant Winsett's vehicle drove past. Officer Yates called Agent Hall and advised him of the sighting. Agent Hall located the vehicle and began pursuing it, but the driver of the vehicle would not stop. Officer Yates activated his emergency equipment and went to assist Agent Hall. When Officer Yates arrived, Agent Hall had already placed the driver, defendant Winsett, in custody, and Janet, the front seat passenger, had been detained. Both defendants were advised of their\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, and officers began a search of the vehicle. Agent Hall confiscated four alprazolam pills and $238 in currency from Janet's purse. Defendants Winsett and Janet Stanfield were arrested based on the incriminating evidence found in the residence and from Janet's person during the vehicle stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Prior to trial, defendants filed motions to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the warrantless search. The trial court made the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Upon entering the residence, [law enforcement officers] determined that there were no people present. They\n   cleared the house, was the testimony. By that, they went room to room and verified that there was no one present at that location. And at that point the officer also said that they could smell the odor of marijuana, although, it wasn't testified as to whether that was the odor of raw marijuana or smoked marijuana. And the testimony was that they did not have a probation officer with them. But I think, under the\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   case, ... that is not fatal to this matter, that the officers could in fact go and do the parole search.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   What the Court is having trouble with here, though, is while they were in the residence and had cleared the residence and had secured the residence, they clearly had probable cause to get a warrant. However, acting upon their belief that they could just unilaterally search anything within the residence, including opening drawers, and they entered-let me go back. That they entered this residence believing someone was destroying evidence, which, once they secured the residence they could find that, that wasn't happening.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   So, the Court in this case finds that, once they entered the residence and had secured it, the Court finds that at that point they should have gotten a warrant, that with no one present, there was no harm, there [were] no exigent circumstances to justify the continued Fourth Amendment intrusion, therefore, I'm going to suppress the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Accordingly, the court dismissed the indictments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The State appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeals. Addressing defendant Winsett's motion to suppress, the appellate court first acknowledged that \"the evidence in the burn pile, security cameras, and unidentified noises coming from inside the house may have created exigent circumstances for officers to cause forced entry into the house\" but concluded that any exigency that prompted the forced entry no longer existed upon the officers' discovery of the source of the suspicious noise.\n   <em>\n    State v. Stanfield\n   </em>\n   , No. W2015-02503-CCA-R3-CD,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201205952\">\n    2017 WL 1205952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (Tenn. Crim. App. Mar. 31, 2017),\n   <em>\n    perm. app. granted\n   </em>\n   (Tenn. Jul. 19, 2017). The appellate court further stated that \"[o]nce the house was 'cleared,' the subsequent extensive search without the parolee's presence did not further any legitimate law enforcement concerns.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201205952\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court highlighted the State's failure to address reasonable suspicion for the search or the reliability of the confidential information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   With regard to Janet's motion, the Court of Criminal Appeals determined that with regard to a search of a\n   <em>\n    probationer's\n   </em>\n   residence, a warrantless search is permissible if reasonable suspicion for the search exists.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6 (citations omitted). The intermediate appellate court concluded that the police officers lacked reasonable suspicion as to Janet because they were unaware of her status as a probationer and lacked any evidence of her engaging in criminal activity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6-7. The court concluded that \"the subsequent traffic stop and search of Janet's person was too attenuated from the search of the house\" and that the evidence seized in the stop was properly suppressed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Finally, as to Justin's motion, the Court of Criminal Appeals rejected the State's \"common authority\" argument and opined that because the State failed to establish that either of the other occupants had common authority over Justin's bedroom, despite the fact that the door was open, the evidence against Justin was properly suppressed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We granted the State's application for permission to appeal in this case to consider,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the expectations of privacy enjoyed by an individual granted supervised release from incarceration (\"a parolee,\" i.e. Tony Winsett); an individual granted alternative sentencing (\"a probationer,\" i.e. Janet Stanfield); and a private citizen residing with both a parolee and a probationer (i.e. Justin Stanfield). Necessary to our discussion is an analysis of how one's expectation of privacy is impacted when he or she either cohabitates with (in the same bedroom) or resides in the same dwelling with a person or persons who enjoy a lesser expectation of privacy due to legal status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On appeal from a ruling on a motion to suppress, we will uphold the trial court's findings of fact unless the evidence preponderates against those findings.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The police had been to the residence twice before and had not entered when no one answered their knock. On the day in question, the police knocked for ten to twenty minutes and entered only after hearing suspicious noises from inside the dwelling that could have been attributable to destruction of evidence. Even then, they entered the residence in a manner that minimized property damage. There is no evidence in the record that suggests that Officer Yates was acting in an arbitrary manner. The record is devoid of any proof that Officer Yates sought to cause Winsett any harm, that Officer Yates acted out of personal animosity, or that the search was\n   one of a pattern of repetitive searches while Winsett was at work or asleep.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Accordingly, considering the totality of the circumstances, the search of defendant Winsett's bedroom was clearly permissible. Based upon the\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Samson\n   </em>\n   decisions, we conclude that because Officer Yates knew about defendant Winsett's parole status and because Winsett was aware that he was subject to warrantless and suspicionless searches at any time as a condition of his parole, officers did not err in searching certain areas of defendant Winsett's residence. Absent any evidence whatsoever that the search in question was unreasonable in a constitutional sense and keeping in mind the State's significant interests in combating recidivism and thwarting illegal drug activity by parolees, we hold that evidence seized during the warrantless search of defendant Winsett's residence was admissible against him and that the trial court erred in suppressing the evidence against defendant Winsett. We reverse the trial court's decision granting defendant Winsett's motion to suppress and the Court of Criminal Appeals' opinion affirming the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Warrantless Search of Janet Stanfield's Possessions in Shared Bedroom (Probationer)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   We next address the trial court's decision to grant defendant Janet Stanfield's motion to suppress.

Moreover, although Justin is the son of defendant Janet Stanfield, this is not a \"family\" situation; Justin was not a child who resided with his mother and father or mother and step-father. Rather, the living arrangement is more closely akin to three adult roommates sharing a residence. In such arrangements, roommates typically do not have authority to rummage through the personal belongings of another roommate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   We also emphasize that Officer Yates had observed Justin's vehicle at the residence on several occasions and testified that he had reason to believe that Justin lived there. Ergo, Officer Yates knew that one of the three bedrooms was occupied by defendants Winsett and Janet Stanfield and another one was occupied by Justin Stanfield. The presence of women's clothing in the shared bedroom immediately resolved the question of who inhabited each bedroom. However, upon observing that a third bedroom was uninhabitable due to clutter, officers did not search inside that bedroom; it stands to reason that the third bedroom would have been an excellent place to hide illegal substances or objects and could have been the source of the odor of marijuana. Rather, the officers chose to search the bedroom of Justin Stanfield.

Even when faced with objections by non-parolees, officers may still enter a residence in this situation but may only search the areas that are under the control of the parolee, such as the parolee's bedroom or other areas over which the parolee shares common control or authority.

By so holding, this Court is balancing the State's interests in enforcing the terms of parole by not allowing parolees to create a \"loophole\" by residing with a non-parolee while simultaneously respecting the Fourth Amendment rights of an unencumbered citizen by not allowing law enforcement officers unfettered access to all areas inside the parolee's residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In expressly adopting the doctrine of common authority as applied to parole searches, we also adopt the limitations thereof. Under these circumstances and the unique facts presented by this case, we conclude that rather than\n   <em>\n    permitting\n   </em>\n   the search of Justin's bedroom, as asserted by the State, the doctrine of common authority applies to\n   <em>\n    limit\n   </em>\n   law enforcement's search of an area held exclusively by an individual with no conditional release status. To hold otherwise would be to grant law enforcement\n   <em>\n    carte blanche\n   </em>\n   to conduct full searches of any residence in which a parolee is living, regardless of the person who is actual target of the search, thus obviating the warrant requirement in such situations. Absent a showing that it was reasonable for law enforcement officers to believe that defendant Winsett had shared authority of Justin's bedroom, Justin held a full expectation of privacy in his bedroom that was not diminished by the conditional release status of his co-residents. There is no evidence in the record to indicate that law enforcement reasonably believed that defendant Winsett exerted any authority over Justin's bedroom; as such, Officer Yates and Agent Hall were not allowed to search his bedroom merely because they were conducting a parole search of the residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Because the parole search of the residence was proper, it was therefore permissible for officers to enter Justin's bedroom to clear it for officer safety. Upon detecting the odor of marijuana in the residence, officers had probable cause to obtain a warrant to search further, but they did not.

It would be counterintuitive to effectively strip all constitutional rights from an individual who has no restraint on his legal status by virtue of his sharing a residence with a parolee. Should circumstances exist that call into question the legality of a non-parolee's actions, such as the odor of marijuana in this case, officers should follow the appropriate channels and obtain a search warrant for the exclusive bedroom of the third party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The parole search was valid as it pertained to the common areas of the residence and defendants Winsett/Stanfield's bedroom, but it did not extend to Justin Stanfield's private quarters. When the officers entered and walked toward the bedrooms, it was immediately apparent that one bedroom was uninhabitable, one bedroom contained both men's and women's clothing, and the remaining bedroom, by process of elimination, belonged to Justin. A search of Justin's bedroom was not necessary to determine ownership, yet officers opened a nightstand drawer and located Justin's identification. Armed with this additional knowledge, Agent Hall nonetheless continued to perform a thorough search of Justin's bedroom, opening cabinets and drawers. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant, we conclude that the State has failed to carry its burden of proving that a thorough search of Justin's room was permissible under these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   We hold that because of the sweeping parole conditions to which defendant Winsett was subject and of which defendant Winsett and Officer Yates were aware, the parole search of portions of defendant Winsett's residence was constitutionally permissible. We further hold that considering the totality of the circumstances presented by this case, defendant Winsett's absence during the search did not rise to the level of rendering the search constitutionally unreasonable. Because defendants Winsett and Janet Stanfield shared a bedroom, the search of her personal belongings located within that bedroom was proper pursuant to the doctrine of common authority and notwithstanding any conditions of her probation. The resulting stop and search of the vehicle in which defendants Winsett and Janet Stanfield were traveling was not so attenuated as to necessitate suppression of the evidence seized therein. All evidence against these two defendants is admissible, and the trial court erred in suppressing the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Despite having a reduced expectation of privacy in the common areas shared by defendants Winsett and Janet Stanfield, defendant Justin Stanfield enjoyed a reasonable expectation of privacy within his private bedroom, and absent a warrant or other exception to the warrant requirement, the search of his bedroom was improper,\n   and all evidence against him was properly suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Therefore, we reverse the Court of Criminal Appeals' decision to the extent that it affirmed the granting of defendants Winsett's and Janet Stanfield's motions to suppress, and we affirm the opinion as to the court's upholding Justin's motion to suppress. We remand this cause to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Costs of this appeal are taxed to the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Sharon G.

Mr. Winsett's parolee status should not subject him, Ms. Stanfield or Mr. Stanfield to a warrantless and suspicionless search. The trial court did not err in suppressing evidence from the illegal search of the Winsett/Stanfield home. The majority does not err in suppressing the evidence as to Mr. Stanfield, although I do not agree with the majority's reasoning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   With nothing more than the knowledge that Mr. Winsett was on parole and a tip from an informant that Mr. Winsett was using (or selling) methamphetamine and possibly injecting with needles, police officers entered the curtilage of the Winsett/Stanfield home. The officers, without a warrant, first searched a burn pile close to the home, finding plastic bags containing what appeared to be marijuana residue. They found neither methamphetamine nor needles. They began knocking on the front and back doors of the home and waited for an answer for ten to twenty minutes-even though there was no vehicle in the driveway. During this prolonged wait period, one of the officers went to the side of the house and listened at an open window. Again, with no search warrant. The officers heard a \"running noise\" inside the home and concluded someone was inside, actively destroying evidence. The officers failed to mention hearing this \"running noise\" in their post-search reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Fearing the destruction of evidence, the officers forcibly entered the home without a search warrant while Mr. Winsett, Ms. Stanfield, and Mr. Stanfield were away. Once inside, the officers encountered a four-legged dog scampering about-perhaps excited by the door-knocking at both ends of the house-not a two-legged person destroying evidence. They searched the entire home without a search warrant and without exigent circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   When police officers search a home without a warrant, the search is presumptively unreasonable under both the United States and Tennessee constitutions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Resolution of this case does not require us to set forth an over-arching definition of that term. Suffice it to say that because this case clearly involves detection and prosecution of drug-related offenses, officers were acting pursuant to a legitimate law enforcement concern.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    In this case, defendant Winsett was not home at the time of the search, a fact upon which the trial court seemingly relied. Our research has yielded no authority for the proposition that a search of a parolee's residence is\n    <em>\n     per se\n    </em>\n    unreasonable if the parolee is not present at the time. To the contrary, at least one federal circuit court has concluded that a parole search conducted outside the presence of the parolee was, indeed, not unreasonable.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     United States v.

In its brief, the State emphasizes that it is not seeking to establish a rule that would permit law enforcement to enter parolee residences in the absence of exigent circumstances, such as those present in this case. Thus, we confine our analysis to the facts of this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    Later, the United States Supreme Court limited\n    <em>\n     Matlock\n    </em>\n    by holding that \"if a potential defendant with self-interest in objecting is in fact at the door and objects, the co-tenant's permission does not suffice for a reasonable search, whereas the potential objector, nearby but not invited to take part in the threshold colloquy, loses out.\"\n    <em>\n     Georgia v.

While these terms are not interchangeable, for the purpose of our analysis, we find reference to cases involving probation instructive on this issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    While some case law suggests that parole searches are akin to consent searches, other jurisdictions disagree on whether a parole search is, indeed, a consent search because of the involuntary and mandatory nature of the search.
