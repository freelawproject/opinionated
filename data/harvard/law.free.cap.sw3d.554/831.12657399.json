The Finance and Administration Cabinet's Department of Revenue (the Department), the Board of Tax Appeals, and the Franklin Circuit Court all concluded the \u00a7 170 constitutional exemption speaks only to ad valorem (property) taxes, but the Court of Appeals disagreed. We granted the Department's motion for discretionary review, and for the following reasons hold the Department, the Board of Tax Appeals, and the circuit court correctly concluded that Ky. Const. \u00a7 170 does not exempt a \"public charity\" institution from the use tax imposed by KRS 139.310.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     RELEVANT FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   According to the parties' stipulation, the taxpayer in this case, Tri-State Healthcare Laundry, Inc., is a joint-cooperative laundry association located in Edgewood, Kenton County, Kentucky. Tri-State was formed by, is owned by, and serves the laundry needs of three charitable hospitals in the Kenton County/Greater Cincinnati metropolitan area. For reasons not included in the stipulation or otherwise explained, Tri-State is not registered with the Internal Revenue Service as an I.R.C. (Internal Revenue Code) \u00a7 501(c)(3) corporation and does not qualify for a charitable exemption from the federal income tax.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Tri-State is not a \u00a7 501(c)(3) organization, it does not qualify for the exemption from sales and use taxes provided to local non-profits under KRS 139.495. Nor does it otherwise qualify for any of the specific sales and use tax exemptions provided in KRS 139.470(1) - (23). Since 1998, however, the Department and its predecessors have deemed Tri-State an \"institution of purely public charity\" under Ky. Const. \u00a7 170 and have accordingly exempted it from ad valorem taxation. Relying on this state-recognized \"public charity\" status, Tri-State now seeks exemption from the Kentucky use tax for its natural gas purchases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Tri-State uses natural gas in the operation of its laundry business, and during the period pertinent to this case, it obtained that gas from Appellee Interstate Gas Supply, Inc. (IGS), an Ohio corporation headquartered in Dublin, Ohio, IGS's business includes the retail sale of natural gas\n   to customers in northern Kentucky, such as Tri-State, and it has duly registered the Kentucky portion of its business with the Department, KRS 139.340 and 139.390. In accord with KRS 139.340, IGS collects use taxes on its natural gas sales to Kentuckians and remits the taxes to the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case began in October 2009 when IGS (the tax collector and remitter) applied to the Department on behalf of Tri-State (the taxpayer) for a refund of all Kentucky use taxes Tri-State paid through IGS from September 1, 2005 to August 31, 2009, a sum exceeding $99,000, plus the appropriate interest. In support of their refund claim, IGS and Tri-State advanced two theories. First, they maintained that Tri-State's recognized status as an \"institution of purely public charity\" exempted it under \u00a7 170 from all revenue-raising taxes (use tax included), not just ad valorem taxes. Second, citing\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth ex rel. Luckett v. City of Elizabethtown,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10127784\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/435/78/\">\n    435 S.W.2d 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ky. 1968), they maintained that the use tax, regardless of its name and the fact that use taxes are usually viewed as excise taxes rather than property taxes, operates so like a property tax as to bring it within the \u00a7 170 charitable institution exemption even if that constitutional provision applies only to property taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In its August 2010 Final Ruling, the Department denied the IGS/Tri-State refund claim and explained that in its view, even though Tri-State has been deemed a \"purely public charity\" for the purposes of \u00a7 170, both theories advanced by the claimants have been rejected. The Department reasoned that this Court explicitly rejected the first theory and implicitly rejected the second theory in\n   <em>\n    Children's Psych. Hosp. of N. Kentucky, Inc. v. Revenue Cabinet,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11623183\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/989/583/\">\n    989 S.W.2d 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ky. 1999). In that case, the Court held that the \u00a7 170 exemption for institutions of purely public charity was addressed to ad valorem taxes only and so did not apply to the 1994 \"Healthcare Provider Tax\" on the state's hospitals. This holding, in the Department's view, amounted to an explicit rejection of the claimants' theory that Tri-State is exempt from all revenue-raising taxes, and was implicitly a rejection of the ruling in\n   <em>\n    City of Elizabethtown\n   </em>\n   that \u00a7 170 exemptions could extend to use taxes. Even if\n   <em>\n    City of Elizabethtown\n   </em>\n   remained viable after\n   <em>\n    Children's Psych. Hosp.,\n   </em>\n   the Department further explained, the\n   <em>\n    City of Elizabethtown\n   </em>\n   case was distinguishable in that it concerned a different \u00a7 170 exemption,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   not the \"public charity\" exemption at issue here, but rather the exemption for \"public property used for public purposes.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Undeterred, IGS and Tri-State appealed the Department's ruling to the Kentucky Board of Tax Appeals. They relied on the same two theories the Department rejected and, for essentially the same reasons, the Board rejected them as well. Likewise, the Franklin Circuit Court, upon review of the Board's decision, concluded that under\n   <em>\n    Children's Psych. Hosp.\n   </em>\n   , the \u00a7 170 exemption for public charities \"only exempts institutions of purely public charity from the payment of property taxes. Since the use tax is not a property tax, the exemption does not apply.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the Court of Appeals, the claimants' perseverance finally paid off. Although the appellate panel concluded that\n   <em>\n    Children's Psych. Hosp.\n   </em>\n   had undone an eighty-year-old\n   construction of the constitutional exemption for \"public charities\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   by confining that exemption to property taxes, it found merit in the claimants' alternative theory. Having discussed\n   <em>\n    City of Elizabethtown,\n   </em>\n   the panel noted that \"[t]he current law in Kentucky [as expressed in\n   <em>\n    City of Elizabethtown\n   </em>\n   ] is that the use tax imposed under KRS 139.310 is similar enough to an ad valorem tax to render its enforcement on governmental entities unconstitutional under Section 170.\" The panel saw no reason \"why the rule should be applied differently with respect to institutions of purely public charity.\" Finding that Tri-State had, in effect, been taxed in violation of \u00a7 170, the Court of Appeals reversed the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We granted the Department's motion for discretionary review to consider the viability and scope of\n   <em>\n    City of Elizabethtown.\n   </em>\n   Not surprisingly, IGS and Tri-State have asked, as an alternative ground of affirmance, that we also consider the viability and scope of\n   <em>\n    Children's Psych. Hosp.\n   </em>\n   The issues having been presented as pure questions of law arising from stipulated facts, our standard of review is\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Freeman v.

We begin our analysis with consideration of the specific tax at issue, namely the use tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Silas Mason Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"336691\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/300/577/#p579\">\n    300 U.S. 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 579-81,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"336691\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/300/577/#p579\">\n    57 S.Ct. 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"336691\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/300/577/#p579\">\n    81 L.Ed. 814\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1937) (describing the then sales/use tax regime of Washington State). In very general terms, use taxes achieve that purpose in two steps. The first step is the imposition of a broad tax, at the sales tax rate, on the \"use of\" or the \"privilege of using\" within the taxing jurisdiction tangible personal property purchased anywhere. That liability falls on the \"user\" of the property. The sweeping liability thus created is then just as dramatically narrowed in the second step, by provisions that give use tax credit (or exemption) for sales tax already paid, within the jurisdiction or without, on the subject property. The upshot is a tax supplemental to the retail sales tax on personal property used-for consumption, not for resale-inside the jurisdiction even though purchased outside it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Geographic Soc. v.

Sales and use taxes generally are classified as excise taxes because they are \"not a burden laid directly upon persons or property\" but rather charges imposed on the sale and/or use of goods to raise revenue.\n   <em>\n    State Tax Comm'n v.

KRS 139.310 imposed \"an excise tax\"-the use tax (step one from above)-on \"the storage, use, or other consumption in this state of tangible personal property and digital property purchased for storage, use, or other consumption in this state at the rate of six percent (6%) of the sales price of the property.\" \"Every person storing, using or otherwise consuming in this state tangible personal property or digital property purchased from a retailer is liable for the use tax levied under KRS 139.310.\" KRS 139.330. KRS 139.500 and KRS 139.510 then (step two) exempted from the use tax any property which had been subjected to sales tax, either in Kentucky\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   or in another state (to the extent of that tax, up to the six percent Kentucky rate), provided that the other state grants a similar credit for sales taxes paid in Kentucky.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Generalized sales taxes, such as this, with their complementary use taxes, first\n   became widespread in the 1930s, a depression-era response to reduced state revenues. Pomp,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1125. Kentucky appears briefly to have joined that trend, with the enactment of a general sales tax in 1934, but that tax was repealed at the General Assembly's next session, in 1936, and the state reverted to the former practice of imposing sales and use taxes only on a few specified articles. Our current general sales and use tax regime was not enacted until 1960.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    George v. Scent,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10175021\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/346/784/#p787\">\n    346 S.W.2d 784\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 787 (Ky. 1961) (noting this development). With that understanding of the tax at issue, our focus turns to the Kentucky Constitution and the section on which IGS/Tri-State premise an exemption claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Section 170 of the Kentucky Constitution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Section 170 emanated from the 1890 Constitution Convention and had no counterpart in the three earlier Kentucky Constitutions. The section has been amended six times since its adoption in 1891, all revisions occurring after 1955 and none having any relevance to the portion of \u00a7 170 on which IGS/Tri-State relies. The section now provides in substantial part as follows, with original language since omitted in brackets and revisions from 1955 forward reflected by underlining:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   There shall be exempt from taxation public property used for public purposes; [places actually used for religious worship, with the grounds attached thereto and used and appurtenant to the house of worship, not exceeding one-half acre in cities or towns, and not exceeding two acres in the country;] places of burial not held for private or corporate profit;\n   <em>\n    real property owned and occupied by, and personal property both tangible and intangible owned by, institutions of religion;\n   </em>\n   institutions of purely public charity, and institutions of education not used or employed for gain by any person or corporation, and the income of which is devoted solely to the cause of education, public libraries, their endowments, and the income of such property as is used exclusively for their maintenance; [all parsonages or residences owned by any religious society, and occupied as a home, and for no other purpose, by the minister of any religion, with not exceeding one-half acre of ground in towns and cities and two acres of ground in the country appurtenant thereto;] household goods [and other personal property] of a person [with a family, not exceeding two hundred and fifty dollars in value;]\n   <em>\n    used in his home\n   </em>\n   ; crops grown in the year in which the assessment is made, and in the hands of the producer; [and all laws exempting or commuting property from taxation other than the property above mentioned shall be void.]\n   <em>\n    and real property maintained as the permanent residence of the owner, who is sixty-five years of age or older, or is classified as totally disabled under a program authorized or administered by an agency of the United States government or by any retirement system either within or without the Commonwealth of Kentucky....\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The real property may be held by legal or equitable title, by the entireties, jointly, in common, as a condominium, or indirectly by the stock ownership or membership representing the owner's or member's proprietary interest in a corporation owning a fee or a leasehold initially in excess of ninety-eight years. The exemptions shall apply only to the value of the real property assessable to the owner or, in case of ownership through stock or membership in a corporation, the value of the proportion which his interest in the corporation bears to the assessed value of the property.\n   </em>\n   The General Assembly\n   may authorize any incorporated city or town to exempt manufacturing establishments from municipal taxation, for a period not exceeding five years, as an inducement to their location.\n   <em>\n    Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 3, 172, and 174 of this Constitution to the contrary, provide by law an exemption for all or any portion of the property tax for any class of personal property.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The section, on its face, is replete with references to property, both real and personal, including residences, places of burial and crops. Section 170 precedes \u00a7 171 authorizing the state property tax with provisions regarding classification and uniformity; \u00a7 172 requiring property to be assessed at fair cash value; \u00a7 173 providing that misuse of public funds is a felony; \u00a7 174 requiring property to be taxed at its value regardless if owned by an individual or corporation; and \u00a7 175 prohibiting the Commonwealth from surrendering or suspending the power to tax property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Through the years, this Court and its predecessor have recognized that \u00a7 170 and other sections in that \"run\" of constitutional provisions address only property (ad valorem) taxes. Referring to the timeframe of the 1890 constitutional debates, this Court in\n   <em>\n    Gillis v.

But it exempts \"institutions of purely public charity\" without limitations of any kind, except as is implied by the descriptive terms employed; \"purely public charity\" implying, of course, that the institution could not be used for gain, and that whatever income it enjoyed must be used solely for the cause of charity. It will thus be noticed that the very language employed exempts \"property\" used for public purposes, religious worship, or for cemeteries, but that it exempts, not the property, but the institutions themselves, which are engaged purely in public charity or education, if not used for gain by any person or corporation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20S.W.%20388\">\n    205 S.W. at 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

While the dissent suggests that rejection of this language establishes the intent to grant public charities a broader exemption encompassing all forms of taxation, it is equally, indeed more, likely that it was only supportive of a\n   <em>\n    broader property exemption, i.e.,\n   </em>\n   the proposed amendment would not have allowed income-producing rental property such as that at issue in\n   <em>\n    Trustees of Ky.

We would add that nothing in the\n   <em>\n    Children's Psych.

A prior statutory exemption from the motor vehicle use tax for municipalities had been eliminated in the 1960 revision of KRS Chapters 138 and 139, the \"excise taxes\" and \"sales and use taxes\" chapters, leaving the city with only the \u00a7 170 argument.

Section 170 of the Constitution exempts the city from tax upon \"public property used for public purposes.\" As this tax is a tax upon the use of the property it would seem that if the property is used for public purposes then the incidence of the tax is identical to that of any other ad valorem tax, therefore, even though it be, strictly speaking, an excise tax it would violate the exemption provided by the Constitution because it is in fact a tax upon the use of public property used for public purposes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10127784\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/435/78/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Department contends that the Court here misconstrued-expanded-the \u00a7 170\"public property\" exemption by fudging that exemption's constitutional role as strictly a property tax exemption, and by paying insufficient heed to the use tax's statutory role as a component of the unified sales and use tax scheme. We agree with both propositions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Department further notes that the results that this Court seemingly strained to achieve in the two City of Elizabethtown cases, relieving governmental entities from the use tax (but not sales taxes, thereby creating a discrimination in in-state and out-of-state transactions), became irrelevant in 1976 when the General Assembly amended KRS 139.470 to exempt governmental entities, including cities, counties and special districts, from both sales and use taxes.

As already discussed, property taxes are direct taxes on real or personal property based on the value of the property. Income taxes are direct taxes on income for a specific period of time. Excise taxes are indirect taxes on activities, occupations, privileges and consumption, such as the sales, and use taxes. The term \"excise tax\" is a general term used to distinguish it from a property tax. Whether a tax is a property tax or an excise tax is most often so apparent that there is no room for argument. However, the category of the tax is determined from its operation, and the name of the tax assigned by the taxing authority, i.e. a legislature, is not controlling.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    Twin Hills Golf &amp; Country Club, Inc. v.

It is rather one aspect of ownership-use as a consumer within the state (again, closely approximating the retail sales tax)-and, as discussed above and as virtually universally held, that makes the use tax an excise tax, not a property tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Of course, in\n   <em>\n    City of Elizabethtown,\n   </em>\n   the Court did not dispute this. The Court allowed that, technically at least, and for the purposes of the Constitution's uniformity provisions, the KRS 139.310 use tax should be deemed an excise. For the purposes of the \"public property\" exemption under \u00a7 170, however, the Court concluded that the use tax was effectively a property tax and so called the exemption into play. Under\n   <em>\n    City of Elizabethtown,\n   </em>\n   therefore, a tax can be both an excise tax and a property tax, the one or the other depending on which section of the Constitution one has in mind. This characterization of the use tax as simultaneously both an excise tax and a property tax is largely unprecedented and unsupported anywhere else in the country.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   More importantly, it is simply wrong. The use tax falls, not on the taxpayer's personal property as such, as would a property tax, but only on the property as put to (or intended to be put to) a consumer's use in this state, and then only such property upon which a qualifying sales tax has not been paid-property such as the natural gas Tri-State put to use in its Kenton County laundry. To the extent\n   <em>\n    City of Elizabethtown\n   </em>\n   holds that the use\n   tax is sufficiently like a property tax to allow a taxpayer (public entity or \"institution of purely public charity\") to claim exemption from it under \u00a7 170, the case is hereby overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Recognizing the use tax is purely an excise tax and therefore beyond the scope of \u00a7 170 of the Kentucky Constitution comports with the reality of what the use tax is,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   a complementary tax to the sales tax.\n   <em>\n    Lazarus,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11084840\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/49/172/#p175\">\n    49 S.W.3d at 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The sales and use tax laws are integrated elements of a taxing program that is designed to reach all transactions in which tangible property is sold inside or outside of Kentucky for storage, use, or consumption within Kentucky.\").
