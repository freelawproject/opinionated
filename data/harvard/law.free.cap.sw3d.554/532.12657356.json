Shelter, Relator's insurer, negotiated a settlement with Clifton on Relator's behalf, where Clifton released Relator from liability in exchange for $8,672.16 that was paid directly to Clifton. MEM claims that Shelter (and thereby Relator), after receiving notice of MEM's subrogation interest provided by \u00a7 287.150, failed to include MEM in the settlement negotiations and improperly paid the settlement amount to Clifton instead of MEM.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Following the settlement and Shelter's payment to Clifton, MEM has been unable to collect from Clifton the amount of workers' compensation benefits it paid to her. In its petition, MEM asserted claims of negligence against Relator (Count I; relating to the actual automobile accident), breach of fiduciary duty and money had and received against Clifton (Counts II and III), and fraud against Shelter (Count IV). Relator filed a motion to dismiss Count I, arguing that Shelter, acting on her behalf, had settled with Clifton and obtained a release, and that she was not a proper party to the subrogation action under MEM's asserted counts, as MEM only brought a negligence claim against her. The trial court (\"Respondent\") denied Relator's motion to dismiss. Relator filed a petition for a writ of mandamus or prohibition with our Court, asking that we direct Respondent to enter an order granting her motion to dismiss, arguing that she should be dismissed from the action because MEM has not pleaded an applicable claim against her that would make her a proper party and upon which relief could be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We requested that Respondent file a response and suggestions in opposition to Relator's petition and suggestions in support. After MEM failed to file a response on behalf of Respondent, we issued a preliminary order in prohibition and directed Respondent to file an answer to Relator's petition and suggestions in opposition, or a default judgment would be entered against her. Once again, MEM failed to respond on Respondent's behalf. Respondent is in default. After reviewing Relator's petition, exhibits, and suggestions in support, we find that Count I against Relator should be dismissed in the underlying case because MEM has failed to state a cause of action against Relator upon which relief could be granted under \u00a7 287.150. We therefore direct Respondent to enter an order granting Relator's motion to dismiss MEM's Count I, and the preliminary order in prohibition is made permanent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"Prohibition is a discretionary writ that may be issued to prevent an abuse of judicial discretion, to avoid irreparable harm to a party, or to prevent the exercise of extra-jurisdictional authority.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

App. E.D. 1962). Courts of this state have held that an employer's right of subrogation survives an employee's settlement with a third-party tortfeasor\n   <em>\n    only when the settlement amount is inadequate to recoup the workers' compensation benefits paid or payable to the employee or when there is fraud upon the employer.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kinney,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8466192\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/200/607/#p613\">\n    200 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   613 ;\n   <em>\n    O'Hanlon,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10160828\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/360/382/#p385\">\n    360 S.W.2d at 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To hold otherwise would allow \"double recovery\" from the third party, which would clearly be an incorrect result.\n   <em>\n    O'Hanlon,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10160828\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/360/382/#p385\">\n    360 S.W.2d at 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that such double recovery is \"an evil to be avoided\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the underlying case, Count I against Relator should be dismissed because MEM did not plead that (a) the settlement amount Shelter, on behalf of Relator, paid to Clifton was inadequate for MEM to recover the full amount of the workers' compensation benefits paid to Clifton, or (b) that Relator somehow committed fraud upon MEM, as MEM asserted against Shelter. Rather, MEM only brought a claim of negligence against Relator in its Count I that related to the actual vehicular collision that injured Clifton; Relator was released from such a claim when Clifton agreed to the settlement and accepted the settlement amount. As Clifton has already recovered her damages resulting from Relator's negligence in causing the accident, MEM cannot recover additional amounts from Relator for this same claim under its subrogation action pursuant to \u00a7 287.150. Therefore, because MEM has not pleaded a claim against Relator asserting that the settlement amount was inadequate or that she committed fraud upon MEM, MEM has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and Count I against Relator should be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Based on the foregoing, we find that MEM has failed to state a claim against Relator in its Count I upon which relief can be granted. Respondent is therefore directed to enter an order granting Relator's motion to dismiss Count I of MEM's petition. The preliminary order in prohibition is made permanent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Sherri B. Sullivan, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Robert M.
