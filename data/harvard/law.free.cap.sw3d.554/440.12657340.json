Bradley raises eight points on appeal.

Finding no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This appeal comes after a second jury found Bradley to be a sexually violent predator. The following background information is taken from Bradley's first appeal to this court after his first trial held in January of 2013:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   Beginning in October of 1996, Bradley began molesting his twelve-year-old step-daughter by fondling her vagina, forcing her to fondle his penis, forcing her to lie on top of him and rub herself against his penis, and performing oral sex on her. Bradley advised the victim that she was participating in classes on rape, and at the conclusion, she would receive \"feely certificates.\" These \"classes\" lasted approximately two months, until Bradley advised the victim of the final lesson, which would involve insertion of his penis into her vagina, after which she would receive a \"rape certificate.\" Bradley advised the victim that after her final lesson, Bradley would then begin lessons with the victim's eight-year-old sister. After Bradley advised the victim of his future plans, the victim reported Bradley's abuse to her mother sometime around Christmas of 1996. Bradley was subsequently charged with and convicted of one count of first-degree statutory sodomy and two counts of second-degree child molestation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-12\">\n   While in prison, Bradley completed the Missouri Sex Offender Program (MOSOP) in December 2007, and he was released on parole in March 2008. Conditions of Bradley's parole included: registration as a sex offender, participation in sex offender treatment, no unsupervised contact with children, and no viewing or possessing pornographic material. Within months of being paroled, Bradley began watching pornography and started a relationship with a woman who had a ten-year-old daughter. Bradley would spend two or three nights per week at the woman's home, babysit the daughter without supervision for up to ten hours at a time while the mother worked, and drive the daughter to and from school approximately two days per week, all in violation of his parole conditions. Although he was in sex offender treatment at the time, which required him to self-identify and report risky behaviors,\n   Bradley did not reveal his relationship or his contact with the ten-year-old girl. He did, however, report that, just before he was paroled, he began having sexual fantasies about his prior victim and masturbating to those fantasies. After his violations were discovered, Bradley's parole was revoked in October 2008 and he returned to the Department of Corrections to finish serving his sentence. When asked about his unauthorized contact with the ten-year-old girl, Bradley indicated: \"I'm not attracted to her because she's fat.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-13\">\n   Before Bradley's scheduled release date on June 9, 2011, Dr. Kimberly Weitl, a licensed psychologist with the Department of Corrections, filed an end-of-confinement report, indicating her belief that Bradley met the definition of a sexually violent predator (SVP) and referring the matter to the multidisciplinary team (MDT) for further evaluation. The MDT reviewed Bradley's records and unanimously concluded that Bradley did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   appear to meet the definition of a sexually violent predator. Thereafter, the prosecutors' review committee met and, contrary to the MDT, unanimously concluded that Bradley\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   meet the definition of a sexually violent predator. The Attorney General, acting on behalf of the State, then filed a petition to civilly commit Bradley as a sexually violent predator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-14\">\n   Within the petition, the State requested that the probate court find probable cause to believe that Bradley was a sexually violent predator and set a hearing within 72 hours of his detention on the petition in order to allow Bradley the opportunity to appear and contest the probable cause determination. On May 24, 2011, the probate court entered an order finding probable cause to believe that Bradley met the definition of a sexually violent predator under section 632.480(5) and ordering that Bradley be brought to Jackson County for a probable cause hearing on June 10, 2011 (the day after his scheduled release from the Department of Corrections).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 26, 2011, the State filed a motion to move the probable cause hearing due to unavailability of its expert witness on the scheduled hearing date. The State proposed three alternative dates: June 8, June 9, or June 13, 2011. Also on May 26, 2011, Assistant Public Defender Randall Schlegel entered his appearance on Bradley's behalf and consented to either June 8 or June 9, but indicated his own conflict with June 13.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 3, 2011, the court held what appears to have been a status or scheduling conference, wherein both the State and Mr. Schlegel appeared, to discuss the State's motion. It appears that, at this hearing, the court indicated that it was not available on any of the proposed dates. The State indicated that it was ready to present evidence in support of the petition. Mr. Schlegel, acting on Bradley's behalf, indicated that Bradley freely and voluntarily waived his right to have the probable cause hearing held within the 72-hour time period prescribed by section 632.489.2, but \"request[ed] a continuance of this opportunity.\" The court found that Bradley freely and voluntarily waived the 72-hour time limitation for the probable cause hearing and that Bradley would not be prejudiced by a continuance of the hearing. The court then ordered that the probable cause hearing be continued until July 6, 2011, and that Bradley was to remain in the custody of the Jackson County Sheriff's Department until the proceedings were concluded. The court held the probable cause hearing on July 6, 2011, without objection, and found\n   probable cause to believe that Bradley was a sexually violent predator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Thereafter, pursuant to court order, Bradley was evaluated by Department of Mental Health psychologist, Dr. Stephen Jackson. Although Dr. Jackson believed that Bradley suffered from a mental abnormality (pedophilia) that caused him serious difficulty controlling his behavior, Dr. Jackson did not believe that Bradley was more likely than not to reoffend sexually if not confined; thus, he opined that Bradley was not a sexually violent predator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The State retained Dr. Angeline Stanislaus, a psychiatrist, to review Bradley's records and determine whether he met the definition of a sexually violent predator. Dr. Stanislaus diagnosed Bradley with both pedophilia and anti-social personality disorder, both of which she deemed to constitute mental abnormalities that caused Bradley serious difficulty controlling his behavior. Dr. Stanislaus also opined, based upon her use of actuarial tools, that Bradley was more likely than not to reoffend sexually if not confined; thus, Dr. Stanislaus was of the opinion that Bradley met the definition of a sexually violent predator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-19\">\n   Bradley retained Dr. Jarrod Steffan, a psychologist, to conduct an evaluation. Dr. Steffan diagnosed Bradley with anti-social personality disorder, a mental abnormality that caused Bradley serious difficulty controlling his behavior. Unlike Drs. Jackson and Stanislaus, however, Dr. Steffan rejected the diagnosis of pedophilia based upon his perception of the victim's stage of puberty at the time of the crimes. Like Dr. Jackson, Dr. Steffan also rejected the notion that Bradley was more likely than not to reoffend sexually if not confined. Dr. Steffan specifically took issue with the manner in which Dr. Stanislaus scored the actuarial instruments when assessing Bradley's future risk; he believed that Dr. Stanislaus improperly relied upon Bradley's parole violation, rather than his sexual convictions, to establish Bradley's index offense for scoring purposes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   On January 4, 2013, twenty-four days before trial and eighteen months after the probable cause hearing, Bradley filed a motion to dismiss due to the court's failure to hold the probable cause hearing within 72 hours of Bradley being taken into custody on the petition. Bradley argued that he did not consent to the untimely hearing and that he was prejudiced in that, without its expert, the State would not have been able to establish probable cause, and Bradley would have been released. Bradley argued that the 72-hour time period was jurisdictional and that the court's failure to timely hold the probable cause hearing deprived the court of jurisdiction to proceed on the State's petition. The State filed a response, conceding that the hearing was held outside of the 72-hour window but arguing that Bradley waived his right to challenge the timing, given his consent to the court's setting of the hearing outside of the 72-hour window.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Bradley v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6917424\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/440/546/#p547\">\n    440 S.W.3d 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 547-50 (Mo. App. W.D. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Following the trial, the jury found Bradley to be a sexually violent predator, and he appealed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6917424\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/440/546/#p547\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6917424\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/440/546/#p547\">\n    at 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Bradley raised three claims on appeal; he claimed that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury's determination, that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to dismiss for failure to hold his probable cause hearing within the 72-hour time period prescribed by statute, and that the trial court erred in excluding evidence regarding the MDT assessment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6917424\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/440/546/#p547\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This court addressed Bradley's second claim first, holding that\n   there was \"no basis for determining that the 72-hour time limit for holding the probable cause hearing [wa]s a jurisdictional prerequisite to proceeding on the State's petition. Rather, it appear[ed] to be mere error, subject to waiver and requiring a showing of prejudice to warrant reversal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6917424\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/440/546/#p547\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6917424\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/440/546/#p547\">\n    at 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We then addressed the State's claim that Bradley had waived his challenge to the timing of the probable cause hearing and held that \"Bradley waived his claim of error by failing to raise a timely objection to the court's noncompliance with the statutory time period.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6917424\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/440/546/#p547\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6917424\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/440/546/#p547\">\n    at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In a footnote, we stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-23\">\n   In his motion to dismiss, Bradley also argued that attorney Schlegel entered his appearance on Bradley's behalf without first contacting Bradley or determining if Bradley qualified for the Public Defender's services. Thus, it appears that Bradley is also arguing that Mr. Schlegel could not waive the timing on Bradley's behalf because Mr. Schlegel was not, in fact, representing Bradley at the time of the waiver. According to the motion to dismiss, Mr. Schlegel did not represent Bradley before their first meeting on June 7, 2011. Bradley offered no evidence, however, to support this argument. Mr. Schlegel's entry of appearance on Bradley's behalf on May 26, 2011, is evidence that Mr. Schlegel represented Bradley at that time. There is simply no evidence to the contrary. Thus, we will not address the merits of this alternative argument.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6917424\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/440/546/#p547\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 554 n.10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On Bradley's third point, we held that \"the trial court erred in finding that the MDT evidence was inadmissible under section 632.483.5.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6917424\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/440/546/#p547\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6917424\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/440/546/#p547\">\n    at 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But, because we were \"unable to discern whether, absent the erroneous statutory interpretation, the court would have [otherwise] erred in excluding the evidence,\" we chose to reverse the judgment and remand the case \"for further proceedings consistent with th[e] opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6917424\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/440/546/#p547\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In light of our resolution of the third point, we did not address Bradley's first point regarding the sufficiency of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6917424\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/440/546/#p547\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Following remand, the court set the matter for a new trial. On August 26, 2016, Bradley filed a renewed motion to dismiss based upon the court's failure to hold his probable cause hearing within 72 hours of his detention on the petition. In the motion, Bradley again claimed that Randall Schlegel did not represent him at the time Schlegel entered his appearance and waived the 72-hour requirement for the probable cause hearing. Bradley argued that he was prejudiced insofar as \"the court could not have found that probable cause existed\" if it had held the probable cause hearing at the originally scheduled time because the State's expert was unable to appear at that time, and Bradley surmised that, without the expert testimony, the State would have been unable to establish probable cause and Bradley would have been released. In response, the State argued that Bradley's motion should be denied based upon the law-of-the-case doctrine insofar as the issues raised had been addressed by this court in the first appeal. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss, finding \"that at the time, Mr. Schlegel was the attorney of record for Mr. Bradley and did do a proper effect of that consent of that waiver, of that 72-hour period.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In the second trial, the State no longer sought to use testimony from Dr. Stanislaus and instead endorsed Dr. Weitl as its expert witness; she authored Bradley's end-of-confinement report but had since left employment with the State of Missouri and entered private practice. Bradley sought to exclude Dr. Weitl as a witness, arguing that, because she had authored\n   the end-of-confinement report, she was precluded from serving as the State's expert by \u00a7 632.489.4. Bradley also filed a motion in limine to limit Dr. Weitl's testimony; specifically, he sought to preclude her from testifying about the \"substance of other non-testifying psychologists' opinions regarding their evaluations of Lester Bradley.\" Bradley identified information from Dr. Stanislaus and Dr. Reitmann as information he wished to preclude. Bradley emphasized that, because the other experts were not going to be testifying, he would not have the opportunity to cross-examine them. The trial court denied Bradley's motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At trial, the State's evidence was largely the same as that introduced at Bradley's first trial with the exception that it came in through Dr. Weitl, rather than Dr. Stanislaus. Like Dr. Stanislaus, Dr. Weitl diagnosed Bradley with pedophilia, opined that it constituted a mental abnormality under the definition provided by the SVPA, and determined that Bradley was more likely than not to reoffend if not confined. Dr. Steffan's testimony was also largely the same in the second trial as the first; he diagnosed Bradley with antisocial personality disorder, which he opined constituted a mental abnormality under the statutory definition, but he determined that Bradley's risk of reoffending was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   more likely than not. And, pursuant to this court's opinion in the first appeal, Bradley offered testimony from Dr. Greg Markway, a member of the MDT, reflecting the fact that the MDT unanimously voted against a determination that Bradley was a sexually violent predator. After receiving all the evidence, the jury found Bradley to be a sexually violent predator, and the court ordered him committed to the Department of Mental Health for control, care, and treatment. Bradley appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Bradley raises eight points on appeal. The first two argue error in the court's decision to overrule his motion to dismiss based upon the court's failure to hold his probable cause hearing within 72 hours of his detention on the petition. His third and fourth points challenge the court's decision to allow Dr. Weitl to testify and discuss findings of other experts upon which she relied. Bradley's fifth point challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury's verdict. And his final three points raise constitutional challenges to the SVPA. For ease of discussion we address Bradley's points out of order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The constitutional challenges have been rejected by the Missouri Supreme Court.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In Points VI, VII, and VIII, Bradley argues that the SVPA is unconstitutional in that it violates his rights to due process, equal protection, freedom from\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   laws, and freedom from double jeopardy. Because these claims raise constitutional challenges to a Missouri statute, an issue normally reserved for the exclusive jurisdiction of the Missouri Supreme Court, we must determine whether we have jurisdiction to decide these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \" Article V, section 3 of the Missouri Constitution vests th[e Missouri Supreme] Court with exclusive appellate jurisdiction in all cases involving the validity of a statute.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Care &amp; Treatment of Brown v.
