On appeal, Randall contends the court's denial of a continuance motion violated his rights to due process and to present a complete defense. Upon review of the record and the briefs, we find no error and affirm the judgment of conviction. Because a published opinion would serve no jurisprudential purpose, we have provided the parties with a Memorandum explaining the reasons for our decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   AFFIRMED. Rule 30.25(b)\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
