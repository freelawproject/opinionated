Williams appeals her convictions after a bench trial in the Circuit Court of Randolph County, Missouri, for driving while intoxicated, resisting a lawful stop, leaving the scene of a motor vehicle accident, careless and imprudent driving, and driving in the wrong direction. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum of law has been provided to the parties. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
