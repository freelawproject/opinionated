Brent Powell, Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Heather Shallow, Michael Bishop, and Todd Bishop (collectively, Plaintiffs) appeal the circuit court's judgment, after trial by jury, in favor of Dr. Richard Follwell in the wrongful death medical negligence case of Plaintiffs' mother, Saundra Beaver. Plaintiffs alleged Follwell negligently caused Beaver's death when he perforated Beaver's bowel during a hernia repair surgery and failed to recognize and treat the bowel after the surgery. On appeal, Plaintiffs argue the circuit court abused its discretion when it permitted (1) Follwell to testify at trial to a causation opinion different from the opinion he gave during his deposition and (2) cumulative evidence from Follwell's expert witnesses. We find the circuit court did not abuse its discretion and affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2012, Follwell performed surgery on Beaver to repair an abdominal hernia. Several hours after she was discharged from the hospital, Beaver began experiencing severe post-operative pain and was readmitted to the hospital. The next morning, Follwell reevaluated Beaver and discharged her a second time. When her condition worsened the following day, Beaver again returned to the hospital, where she was diagnosed with sepsis due to a serious infection in her abdominal cavity. Beaver later died as a result of the infection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Beaver's three adult children, Heather Shallow, Michael Bishop, and Todd Bishop, subsequently brought a wrongful death action against Follwell, alleging he negligently perforated Beaver's bowel during surgery, causing a leakage of bowel contents\n   that led to Beaver's septic shock, and then failed to recognize or treat the bowel perforation after Beaver was readmitted. Plaintiffs presented their theory of liability through the testimony of an expert witness and also presented the testimony of a treating surgeon who performed surgery in an attempt to remove a section of Beaver's necrotic bowel and infected surgical mesh. Follwell testified in his own defense, acting as both a fact witness and an expert witness. Follwell denied he was negligent and presented two alternative theories of causation unrelated to his own conduct. The first theory alleged the harm was most likely caused by an undetectable tear that gradually ruptured sometime after Beaver was discharged from the hospital. He supported this theory with testimony from a single expert witness. Follwell's second theory alleged a complex preexisting condition caused Beaver's death. In support of this theory, Follwell called four expert witnesses: a general care surgeon, a cardiologist, a vascular surgeon, and a colorectal surgeon. The jury returned a verdict for Follwell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After the court of appeals reversed and remanded, this Court transferred the case pursuant to article V, \u00a7 10 of the Missouri Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The circuit court \"enjoys considerable discretion in the admission or exclusion of evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Lozano v.

Plaintiffs alleged Follwell negligently perforated the bowel during the surgery to repair Beaver's abdominal hernia. Follwell claimed he did not perforate the bowel but rather the tissue in Beaver's bowel tore as a result of a vascular injury. The vascular injury restricted blood supply to the bowel, medically referred to as ischemia, and the restriction of blood supply caused the bowel to deteriorate or die, medically referred to as necrosis, resulting in the necrotic bowel tissue tearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   When asked at his deposition what caused the ischemia or lack of blood supply to Beaver's bowel, Follwell testified in relevant part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [Follwell]: I would not anticipate the bowel to be necrotic or dying.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [Plaintiffs' attorney]: Why not?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [Follwell]: For a hole or a perforation, that's not common.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [Plaintiffs' attorney]: But 24 hours later, you don't think there would have been dead bowel?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [Follwell]: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [Plaintiffs' attorney]: I'm sorry. Explain that to me again.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [Follwell]: I wouldn't anticipate dead bowel for any reason, unless there was some sort of vascular injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [Plaintiffs' attorney]: And what caused the ischemia?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [Follwell]: I don't know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Although Follwell opined he did not know what specifically caused the lack of blood supply or ischemia to Beaver's bowel, Follwell testified prior to this statement that ischemia or the lack of blood supply is caused by vascular injury. After Follwell said he didn't know what caused the ischemia, he also testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [Plaintiffs' attorney]: What are the general causes of ischemia?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [Follwell]: Compromise to the blood supply at the time of surgery, emboli from whatever cause, whether they be blood clots, when (sic) they be fragments of arthrosclerotic [sic] tissue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [Plaintiffs' attorney]: I asked you what caused her ischemic bowel ..., and you told me you didn't know?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [Follwell]: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [Plaintiffs' attorney]: Then I asked you what the potential causes are. So we'll go with her potential causes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [Follwell]: Injury of the blood supply at the time of surgery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [Plaintiffs' attorney]: or emboli?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [Follwell]: Emboli or scar tissues which could potentially compromise the blood supply.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [Plaintiffs' attorney]: Is that a clot?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [Follwell]: Blood clots or pieces of arthrosclerotic [sic] tissue; they are emboli.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   At trial, Follwell's attorney asked Follwell if he had an opinion as to whether Beaver's necrotic or dead bowel could occur as a result of anything other than a vascular injury. Plaintiffs objected, arguing Follwell's response to this question would be inconsistent with his earlier testimony because, when asked during his deposition what caused the lack of blood\n   supply or ischemia to Beaver's bowel, he answered, \"I don't know.\" The circuit court allowed Follwell to respond. The exchange between Follwell's attorney and Follwell proceeded in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [Follwell's attorney]: Do you have an opinion whether or not dead bowel, necrotic bowel ... could occur as a result of anything other than a vascular injury in this patient?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [Follwell]: Yes, I have an opinion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [Follwell's attorney]: And that opinion is?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   [Follwell]: That it was a vascular injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Similar to his deposition response, Follwell repeated his belief that necrotic or dead bowel could only be the result of a vascular injury. This testimony was neither new nor contradictory to the opinion given at his deposition. To the extent Follwell's testimony was different, he was simply stating what specifically caused ischemia or a lack of blood supply to Beaver's bowel rather than what generally restricts blood supply to the bowel. As such, his trial testimony was not \"\n   <strong>\n    substantially different\n   </strong>\n   ... than the opinion disclosed in discovery.\"\n   <em>\n    Sherar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9359067\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/98/628/#p634\">\n    98 S.W.3d at 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Follwell contends, in a wrongful death action arising from medical negligence, the very root of the matter in controversy is whether the defendant breached the standard of care and causation; therefore, this evidence was not cumulative under Missouri law. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   At trial, Plaintiffs presented expansive testimony from one expert. Plaintiffs' expert testified Follwell injured Beaver's bowel and Follwell's treatment fell below the standard of care. In response, Follwell had four experts testify to the contrary. The first expert to testify, a board-certified doctor in general surgery and critical care medicine, testified primarily about Follwell's compliance with the standard care, although he also touched upon causation. After the first expert's testimony, Plaintiffs objected to further expert testimony from the cardiologist, vascular surgeon, and colorectal surgeon, arguing the testimony would be cumulative. Although the circuit court overruled the objection, the court advised Plaintiffs they could continue to object if the testimony did become unduly cumulative. The next witness, a cardiologist, testified without objection solely in response to Plaintiffs' expert witness testimony. During the vascular surgeon's testimony, Plaintiffs renewed their cumulative objection, and the circuit court again overruled the objection and noted, while the testimony could reach a point of being cumulative, it had not yet reached that point. The circuit court further noted the vascular surgeon had \"his own section\" of testimony. Prior to the colorectal surgeon's testimony, Plaintiffs again objected on the ground the testimony would be cumulative. The circuit court again overruled the objection, noting \"each one of the experts [has] a different specialty\" and they all added \"their own parts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   A careful review of the trial transcripts indicates Follwell and his experts testified about the very root of the matter in controversy; the evidence therefore, was not cumulative. While the expert testimony overlapped at times, the experts testified about their own specialties and offered their own parts, as the circuit court noted. When the expert testimony did overlap, the overlapping testimony went to the issue of the standard of care and causation-the \"very root\" of a wrongful death action arising from medical negligence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sundermeyer v.

Excessive expert witnesses can create the risk the trier of fact will resolve differences in expert witness opinions by the number of experts called instead of giving due consideration to the quality and credibility of each expert opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Midwest Materials Co. v.

App. 1991) (\"Evidence is prejudicial if it tends to lead the jury to decide the case on some basis other than the established propositions in the case.\"). While expert witnesses testifying about the very root of the controversy have purpose and are not needlessly repetitive, such evidence remains subject to exclusion if the prejudicial effect of the testimony substantially outweighs the probative value.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9997393\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/806/477/#p495\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The circuit court \"enjoys considerable discretion in the admission or exclusion of evidence, and, absent clear abuse of discretion, its action will not be grounds for reversal.\"\n   <em>\n    Lozano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7265711\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/421/448/#p451\">\n    421 S.W.3d at 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The circuit court is uniquely positioned to evaluate the testimony of witnesses and determine its prejudicial impact when prompted by a timely objection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lozano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7265711\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/421/448/#p451\">\n    421 S.W.3d at 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When considering the testimony of Follwell's multiple expert witnesses, the circuit court showed \"careful, deliberate consideration\" of Plaintiffs' objections and articulated in each instance that the effect of the testimony had not become so unfairly prejudicial as to warrant exclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7265711\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/421/448/#p451\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The circuit court did not abuse its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Fischer, C.J., Wilson, Russell, Breckenridge and Stith, JJ., concur;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Draper, J., dissents.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    All statutory citations are to RSMo 2000.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    While Plaintiffs cite multiple excerpts from the transcript alleging this testimony should have been excluded as cumulative, Plaintiffs did not make timely objections to most, if not all, of the questions eliciting this testimony.
