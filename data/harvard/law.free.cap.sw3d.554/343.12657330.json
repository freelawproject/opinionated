Because the jury instructions on the sexual abuse counts violated the unanimity requirement, we reverse and remand King's sexual abuse convictions. On remand, we also direct the trial court to address the sentencing error in imposing a term of years to run consecutively with a term of life imprisonment. We otherwise affirm King's sodomy conviction and the trial court's evidentiary rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A.S. is a minor child, born in 2005. A.S.'s parents are heroin addicts who were frequently absent or incarcerated, so A.S. and her older brother lived with their biological grandmother, Hope King, and her husband, Ronald King, who A.S. knew as \"Pawpaw.\" The family lived in several locations throughout A.S.'s life: the \"brown trailer\" on Sioux Trail in Elsmere until A.S. was six or seven; the house on Garvey Avenue in Elsmere; and then a trailer on Amber Drive in Latonia. The Amber Drive trailer burned in a fire on May 2014, after which King no longer lived in the home, and A.S. and her brother lived with their grandmother in Crescent Springs. Hope worked full-time, and King was unemployed; he watched A.S. when Hope was at work or at the store and was alone with her often.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2014, King was incarcerated for arson for the burning of the Amber Drive trailer, after which A.S. was interviewed at the Child Advocacy Center (\"CAC\"). During that 2014 CAC interview, A.S. was asked if anyone had touched her where they should not, or if she was afraid of anyone. At that time, A.S. answered no, but she later testified that she had not disclosed King's abuse because he had threatened to hurt her if she told anyone and she was afraid of him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In January 2015, A.S. disclosed to her school counselor what King had done to her, and an investigation began, including a second interview at the CAC in 2015. At trial, and during the 2015 CAC interview, A.S. testified that King had started touching her genitals when the family lived in the brown trailer, when she was four, and had also showed her magazines with photographs of people with no clothing. She testified that King had forced her to touch his genitals as well, which she described as two spheres and a cylinder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.S. testified that the abuse continued when the family moved to Garvey Avenue, most often occurring when Hope was not at home. She testified that the abuse at the Garvey Avenue home included: King touching A.S.'s genitals when she was naked; King continuing to show A.S. pornographic magazines or videos; and King placing A.S. on the ironing board wearing only a shirt, and moving his mouth around on her genitals, continuing until Hope and A.S.'s brother returned home. No evidence was presented that King continued the abuse in the trailer on Amber Drive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the conclusion of the Commonwealth's case, the trial court dismissed one of the two counts of first-degree sodomy at the Commonwealth's request. The jury found King guilty of first-degree sodomy, and both counts of first-degree sexual abuse. The jury recommended a sentence of life imprisonment on the sodomy count, and ten years for each of the sexual abuse counts, to run consecutively for a total sentence of life. The trial court sentenced King accordingly. This appeal follows as a matter of right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   King's appeal presents five allegations of error: (A) the trial court erred in allowing duplicitous instructions on sexual abuse, which violated the unanimity requirement for jury verdicts; (B) the jury instructions on the Garvey Avenue sexual abuse subjected King to double jeopardy; (C) the trial court erred in refusing to allow defense counsel to impeach A.S.'s testimony regarding the 2015 CAC interview and in allowing improper bolstering of A.S.; (D) the trial court erred in admitting a recorded phone call as an adoptive admission; and (E) King's sentence violates KRS 1 532.110 and KRS 532.080. We will address each of these issues in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Trial Court Erred in Allowing Duplicitous Instructions on Sexual Abuse, Which Violated the Unanimity Requirement for Jury Verdicts.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   King first argues that the jury instructions on the two counts of first-degree sexual abuse were duplicative and rendered non-unanimous verdicts. This issue is unpreserved, and thus reviewed for palpable error. RCr 2 10.26 dictates:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   A palpable error which affects the substantial rights of a party may be considered by the court on motion for a new trial or by an appellate court on appeal, even though insufficiently raised or preserved for review, and appropriate relief may be granted upon a determination that manifest injustice has resulted from the error.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \" RCr 10.26 authorizes us to reverse the trial court only upon a finding of manifest injustice. This occurs when the error so seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceeding as to be shocking or jurisprudentially intolerable.\"\n   <em>\n    Roe v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6785877\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/493/814/#p820\">\n    493 S.W.3d 814\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 820 (Ky. 2015) (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A.S. testified that King committed multiple acts of sexual abuse on multiple occasions at both the Garvey and Sioux Trail (brown trailer) addresses. The jury instructions differentiated one count of first-degree sexual abuse for each residence but did not indicate which specific acts within each residence the count related.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Regarding the Garvey Avenue sexual abuse, Jury Instruction No. 5 reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   You will find the Defendant, Ronald King, guilty of Sexual Abuse in the First Degree under this Instruction and under Count One of the Indictment, if and only if, you believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt all of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   A. That in Kenton County on or between May 2010 and March 2013 and before the finding of the Indictment herein, he subjected A.S. to sexual contact\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   at 414 Garvey Avenue;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   AND,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   B. That at the time of such contact, A.S. was less than twelve years of age.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The brown trailer sexual abuse, Jury Instruction No. 7, reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   You will find the Defendant, Ronald King, guilty of Sexual Abuse in the First Degree under this Instruction and under Count Three of the Indictment and under this Instruction, if and only if, you believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt all of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A. That in Kenton County on or between May 2010 and March 2013 and before the finding of the Indictment herein, he subjected A.S. to sexual contact at 119 Sioux Trail (the brown trailer);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   AND,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   B. That at the time of such contact, A.S. was less than twelve years of age.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   King argues that under these two instructions on first-degree sexual abuse, the jury was presented with multiple instances of sexual abuse for each instruction, but that King was only charged with one count each. King argues that this instruction violates Section 7 of the Kentucky Constitution's requirement for a unanimous verdict. Under Instruction No. 5, A.S. testified to three separate instances of inappropriate sexual contact, one that constituted sodomy, and two that constituted sexual abuse: that King touched her private with his hand when they were in her granny's bedroom, and that King touched her bottom with his hands during the oral sodomy on the ironing board. Under instruction No. 7, A.S. testified to two episodes of inappropriate touching that occurred in the brown trailer: that King touched her private area and that he made her touch his private area.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This Court has clarified that \"such a scenario-a general jury verdict based on an instruction including two or more separate instances of a criminal offense, whether explicitly stated in the instruction or based on the proof-violates the requirement of a unanimous verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7091994\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/405/439/#p449\">\n    405 S.W.3d 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 449 (Ky. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Both of the counts of first-degree sexual abuse were presented to the jury with nearly identical instructions and covered the same date range. As described above, when a trial court fails to adequately distinguish one instruction from another, as is the case with these coupled instructions,\n   a unanimous-verdict violation arises. As this Court discussed in\n   <em>\n    Jenkins,\n   </em>\n   the instructions were \"duplicitous,\" i.e., not deceitful, but rather double, alleging either of two crimes in a single instruction.\n   <em>\n    Jenkins v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6774586\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/496/435/#p448\">\n    496 S.W.3d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 448 (Ky. 2016). We held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Duplicitous instructions, however, do not provide the same guarantee that all the jurors agreed as to the offense. Rather, a duplicitous instruction \"allow[s] the jury to convict [the defendant] of one crime based on two separate and distinct criminal acts that violated the same criminal statute.\" [\n   <em>\n    Kingrey\n   </em>\n   ,] 396 S.W.3d at 831. In that situation, we held, the \"multiple theories\" analysis is inapplicable, and the duplicitous instruction \"violates the requirement of a unanimous verdict,\" regardless of whether sufficient evidence existed of both criminal acts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   In both cases, we held that the constitutional violation amounted to so manifest an injustice as to call for relief under RCr 10.26, the palpable error rule. Extending that conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Martin v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6876402\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/456/1/#p9\">\n    456 S.W.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 9-10 (Ky. 2015), we held that \"all unanimous-verdict violations constitute palpable error resulting in manifest injustice.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Given the proof of two sodomies in this case, the sodomy instruction quoted above, which allowed the jury to convict on the basis of either, as though they presented merely alternative theories of a single offense, breached the rule of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kingrey.\n   </em>\n   Under\n   <em>\n    Martin,\n   </em>\n   furthermore, the breach must be deemed a palpable error. In light of this authority, Jenkins's sodomy conviction, however well justified it may appear factually, must be reversed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 448-49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Commonwealth concedes that these instructions allow for a non-unanimous verdict. Although ample evidence exists that King subjected A.S. to sexual abuse, we must agree with the Commonwealth and conclude that King is entitled to relief from his first-degree sexual abuse convictions. As in\n   <em>\n    Jenkins,\n   </em>\n   the \"jury instruction addressing that charge ran afoul of the rule articulated in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7091994\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/405/439/#p449\">\n    405 S.W.3d 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ky. 2013) and\n   <em>\n    Kingrey v.

One variant of the issue is represented in\n   <em>\n    Harp v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8205599\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/266/813/\">\n    266 S.W.3d 813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ky. 2008). In\n   <em>\n    Harp,\n   </em>\n   the jury was given seven identical instructions upon which it returned seven indistinguishable guilty verdicts. We reversed because, with no identifying characteristics requiring the jury to differentiate the specific act constituting each crime, we had no assurance that the jury was in unanimous agreement on each charge, and we determined that unanimity on each verdict could not be presumed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8205599\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/266/813/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8205599\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/266/813/\">\n    at 819-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   This Court unanimously agreed in\n   <em>\n    Harp\n   </em>\n   that multiple undifferentiated jury instructions violated the unanimous verdict requirement. Justice Scott posted a lone dissent, agreeing on the error but regarding it as harmless: \"[T]he error was clearly harmless in this instance. I concede, however, that I, too, am displeased at the frequency with which our trial courts fail to differentiate multiple instructions from each other.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8205599\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/266/813/\">\n    266 S.W.3d at 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Scott, J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The second variant of the \"unanimous verdict\" problem was represented in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7091994\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/405/439/#p449\">\n    405 S.W.3d at 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Kingrey v.

It arises when a single jury instruction, based on evidence of two or more separate instances of criminal conduct, authorizes the jury to convict the defendant of only one crime. This kind of error is often referred to as the \"multiple acts\" error, or as we called it in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   citing an extensive array of federal litigation on the subject, the \"duplicitous instruction\" error. As noted in\n   <em>\n    Johnson,\n   </em>\n   the federal cases more frequently identify the problem as a \"duplicitous indictment\" which spawns trial error when the duplicity is not corrected by proper jury instructions.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7091994\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/405/439/#p449\">\n    405 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   453-54 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Moreover, no specific jury instruction existed telling the jury that it could not convict King unless it unanimously agreed on the particular act he committed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   This court recognizes and has consistently maintained that the jurors may reach a unanimous verdict even though they may not all agree upon the means or method by which a defendant has committed the criminal act.\n   <em>\n    Conrad v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387737\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/534/779/#p784\">\n    534 S.W.3d 779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 784 (Ky. 2017) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

Nor is the jury required to agree upon the defendant's mental state in cases where alternative mental states authorize conviction for the same criminal act.\n   <em>\n    Wells v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9927465\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/561/85/#p88\">\n    561 S.W.2d 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 88 (Ky. 1978) (\"We hold that a verdict cannot be successfully attacked upon the ground that the jurors could have believed either of two theories of the case where both interpretations are supported by the evidence and the proof of either beyond a reasonable doubt constitutes the same offense.\"). Neither\n   <em>\n    Harp, Johnson,\n   </em>\n   nor their progeny changes that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   However, we have also held consistently with virtually every other American jurisdiction to address the matter, that juror unanimity means that jurors must agree upon the specific instance of criminal behavior committed by the defendant but they need not agree upon his means or method of committing the act or causing the prohibited result. The list appended to this opinion cites consistent rulings from the following states: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota (citing\n   <em>\n    Harp\n   </em>\n   ), Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Our decisions identifying these instructional errors as violations of the unanimous jury principle are not jurisprudential outliers, nor are they recent. Moreover, both types of instructional error are easily avoided. As the cases cited below illustrate, the\n   <em>\n    Harp\n   </em>\n   -type, multiple undifferentiated instruction error is avoided by simply differentiating each individual jury instruction by incorporating into each instruction whatever distinguishing feature was presented in the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The error of duplicitous instruction can be avoided by the trial court in three ways: (1) the jury instruction can simply identify which of the particular criminal acts included in the evidence the jury is asked to consider; (2) the verdict form can identify the particular act upon which the jury determined guilt; or (3) a special instruction, as held by some courts, informing the jury that, in order to convict, all twelve jurors must agree that the defendant committed the same act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   An instruction clarifying the unanimity requirement would have cured the error of the duplicitous instructions.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

If the defendant and the appellate court cannot sort it out, then neither can the jury. As we said in\n   <em>\n    Hampton\n   </em>\n   over thirty years ago, all that is required is some evidence \"ample to separately identify the various offenses charged.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9950961\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/666/737/#p740\">\n    666 S.W.2d at 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Every child who is competent to testify to the abuse he or she suffered can relate some distinction between abusive acts, however trivial, minute, or obscure. The same facts that enable a prosecutor to determine the number of crimes to charge are the same facts that can be used to differentiate the charges in the jury instructions. As stated in\n   <em>\n    Harp,\n   </em>\n   Justice Scott's frustration with the failure of trial courts to do so was not misplaced.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8205599\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/266/813/\">\n    266 S.W.3d at 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Scott, J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   We concede that this Court has taken a minority view by regarding this instructional error, in certain instances, as structural error beyond the reach of harmless error or palpable error analysis.

But this Court did not invent that analysis, and, as the above cited cases illustrate, we are not alone in it. By whatever legal yardstick the issue is measured, the fact remains that multiple, indistinguishable jury instructions and similarly undifferentiated verdict forms can allow for convictions based upon insufficient evidence; they can allow multiple convictions for the same act; they can impede the right of appellate review; and they can cause convictions for criminal acts by a less-than-unanimous jury. This Court would egregiously err to renounce our jurisprudence in this matter and pretend that this problem does not exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   While reversing these convictions will not alter King's total sentence, reversal is mandated for these two counts of sexual abuse and the two corresponding ten-year sentences because the pertinent jury instructions were \"duplicitous\" in violation of the Kentucky Constitution's unanimous verdict requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   We remand to the\n   trial court with directions to enter a new judgment in accordance with our decision to vacate King's two first-degree sexual abuse convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

King contends that the jury instructions did not properly differentiate the acts identified as sexual abuse from the acts identified as sodomy, so if the jury found him guilty of sodomy, it necessarily found him guilty of sexual abuse because one cannot engage in deviate sexual intercourse without engaging in sexual contact. Since we are reversing King's convictions for first-degree sexual abuse, and remanding to the trial court, his double jeopardy argument is now moot. However, we will briefly address double jeopardy as it pertains to first-degree sexual abuse and first-degree sodomy to reiterate that no double jeopardy occurred and to affirm King's sodomy conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 13 of the Kentucky Constitution guarantee that no person shall \"be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb[.]\" In order to determine whether a double jeopardy violation has occurred, the\n   <em>\n    Blockburger\n   </em>\n   same-elements test is employed: \"whether the act or transaction complained of constitutes a violation of two distinct statutes and, if it does, if each statute requires proof of a fact the other does not.

The Trial Court Did Not Err in the Method of Impeachment of A.S.'s Testimony, Nor in Admitting the 2015 CAC Interview.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   A.S. was interviewed on two separate and unrelated occasions at the CAC, once in 2014 following the trailer fire, and again in 2015 related to her report of sexual abuse by King. King argues that these interviews were erroneously admitted for three reasons: first, that defense counsel was not permitted to impeach A.S.'s prior inconsistent statements in a proper manner; second, that the trial court erred in allowing the Commonwealth to introduce the recording of A.S.'s 2015 interview, thus bolstering A.S.'s testimony;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   and third, that both A.S.'s and the interviewer's statements during that 2015 interview were admitted as hearsay, thus denying his right to confrontation.

Memory Refreshed.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   First, King argues that the trial court erred to his substantial prejudice by not allowing his defense attorney to refresh A.S.'s memory during cross-examination for purposes of impeachment. However, a careful review of this portion of A.S.'s testimony shows that the trial court did allow defense counsel to ask A.S. on cross-examination about prior recorded statements, and then impeach A.S.'s testimony with the recorded 2014 CAC interview; thus, King's actual argument is that he was not able to \"immediately\" impeach A.S.'s testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   During A.S.'s testimony, she testified to a single incident of sodomy, when King put his mouth on her vagina in the basement of the Garvey Avenue House. During cross-examination, King's counsel questioned A.S. about the 2014 CAC interview, when she was asked if King had kissed her \"where you pee\" one time or more than one time, and A.S. had responded once. On the stand, A.S. insisted she had told the CAC interviewer that this had happened twice. Defense counsel asked A.S. if watching the recording of her prior interview would help refresh her memory, to which A.S. said no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   At the bench, over the Commonwealth's initial objection, the trial court allowed defense counsel to impeach A.S. with her prior statement. The trial court was concerned that the term \"refresh your recollection\" had confused the child and allowed defense counsel to play a portion of the 2015 CAC interview for A.S., outside of the presence of the jury. After the jury returned, defense counsel then elicited from A.S. that the sodomy had occurred one time. After this, the trial court permitted defense counsel to cross-examine A.S. about prior inconsistent statements if they arose, but did not allow defense counsel to play the recordings for A.S. contemporaneously, in an apparent effort to ease the trauma for A.S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Defense counsel then asked A.S. about the 2015 CAC interview, when A.S. had been asked if anything else happened at the Garvey Avenue address besides King kissing her privates, and A.S. had told the interviewer no. A.S. responded that she had told the interviewer \"yes.\" Defense counsel rephrased the question, and A.S. then agreed she had told the interviewer nothing else had happened in the basement of the Garvey Avenue house.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defense counsel next asked A.S. if, during the 2015 CAC interview, she said she thought she had told her grandmother, Hope,\n   about the abuse, but that Hope must not remember because it was such a long time ago. A.S. responded no. The trial court sustained an objection to defense counsel's request to again play part of the interview recording to refresh A.S.'s memory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Defense counsel then asked A.S. about the 2014 CAC interviews following the trailer fire, when she had been asked if she understood good touch/bad touch and safety rules related to her body and if anyone had touched her private places. A.S. disagreed, and defense counsel asked the child if hearing the interview recording would help her remember what she had said. The trial court denied this request, deciding it would \"deal with that a different way.\" After an extended discussion at the bench outside the presence of the jury, the trial court allowed defense counsel to play a large portion of the 2014 CAC tape recording for the jury both for context and content, excluding any mention of the cause of the fire or that King was later arrested for arson. Defense counsel played a portion of the tape to impeach A.S.'s testimony that she had not denied that anyone had touched her improperly. The jury also heard enough of the interview to show that A.S. was being interviewed at that time about the fire, rather than following any allegations of sexual abuse.

In fact, King does not dispute that his counsel was able to verbally confront A.S. with the content of her prior statements during cross-examination. The decision to spare A.S. the replaying of her CAC interview, and to avoid confusing the young child with the usual course of impeachment was well within the trial court's discretion. King does not allege how the short delay between the child leaving the stand and the playing of the video deprived him of the ability to present a defense, especially since the jury heard large portions of the 2014 interview tape, including that A.S. told the interviewer no one had touched her inappropriately.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   King had ample opportunity to impeach A.S.'s testimony; the trial court did not err in choosing to allow King to impeach A.S. in a manner more suited for a ten-year-old child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ii. Admission of the 2015 CAC Interview.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Next, King argues that the trial court erred in allowing the Commonwealth to play the 2015 CAC interview as an improper admission of prior consistent statements, absent an express or implied charge against A.S. of recent fabrication or improper influence. KRE 801A(a)(2). He further argues that this constituted improper bolstering or vouching.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The morning after defense counsel played a large portion of the 2014 CAC interview for the jury, the Commonwealth asked to play portions of the 2015 CAC interview. The Commonwealth argued that this recording was admissible under KRE 801A(a)(2) to show A.S.'s consistency since her credibility had been called into question. Defense counsel objected, arguing that she had not attacked A.S.'s credibility, but had limited her cross-examination to the 2014 interview, asking only a few questions related to the 2015 interview. The trial court ruled that a majority of the 2015 interview could be played for the jury since much of A.S.'s cross-examination had concerned inconsistencies between the 2014 CAC interview and the 2015 CAC interview/current testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   During trial, defense counsel questioned A.S. regarding several specific portions of the 2015 CAC interview. She first asked A.S. if it was accurate that she had told the interviewer the abuse started when she was four years old in the brown trailer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defense counsel then cross-examined A.S. about particular statements she made during the 2015 interview that, when removed from the context of the entire interview, suggest that A.S. had previously reported that no other sexual abuse occurred at the Garvey Avenue home besides a single act of sodomy. During the 2015 interview, the interviewer asked A.S. if anything else had happened at the Garvey Avenue address besides \"kissing on the private,\" to which A.S. had answered \"no.\" In context A.S.'s \"no\" clearly meant that nothing else had happened that exact day in the basement. In earlier parts of the interview, A.S. described in detail other acts of sexual abuse perpetrated by King at the Garvey Avenue address in addition to the sodomy in the basement: in the back room of the house, King made A.S. take her clothes off and touched her privates with his hands; he touched her bottom and moved his hand around; he kissed her on the mouth; he touched her \"where she peed\" with his hand more than one time and moved his hand around; he showed her his privates and asked her to touch him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   King argues, in the alternative, that even if the questions about the 2014 CAC interview did impeach A.S.'s testimony with prior inconsistencies, this did not open the door to allow the 2015 CAC interview to be played for the jury. King argues that his defense strategy is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Chames v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   since defense counsel did not raise inconsistencies between the 2015 interview and A.S.'s trial testimony, nor focus his entire defense on inconsistencies between the prior interview and trial testimony.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7092308\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/405/519/#p524\">\n    405 S.W.3d 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 524 (Ky.

Defense counsel also implored the jury to consider the inconsistencies in A.S.'s testimony during opening statement. The trial court did not err in finding that A.S.'s credibility had been attacked sufficiently to allow the Commonwealth to introduce prior consistent statements pursuant to KRE 801A(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   King is correct that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   It is improper to permit a witness to testify that another witness has made prior consistent statements, absent an express or implied charge against the declarant of recent fabrication or improper influence. Otherwise, the witness is simply vouching for the truthfulness of the declarant's statement, which we have held to be reversible error. We perceive no conceptual distinction between testimony that repeats the witness's prior consistent statement verbatim and testimony that the witness previously made statements that were consistent with her trial testimony. Either way, the evidence is offered to prove that the declarant's trial testimony is truthful because it is consistent with her prior statements. A witness cannot be corroborated by proof that on previous occasions he has made the same statements as those made in his testimony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <em>\n    Tackett v.

However, the instant case is not one in which the witness's testimony was improperly vouched or bolstered for its truthfulness. No additional testimony was admitted solely to corroborate A.S.'s prior testimony, nor was the 2015 CAC interview offered only to prove that A.S. must be telling the truth now since she was consistent. King sufficiently implied a recent fabrication to allow A.S.'s prior consistent statements to be admitted as a rebuttal. This case is somewhat unique in that these prior consistent statements were introduced via a recording of the 2015 CAC interview after the child had finished testifying; however, as discussed above, the decision of the trial court to spare the child contemporaneous impeachment was within its discretion.

Furthermore, on tape, the interviewer did not repeat A.S.'s statements about the abuse to show their veracity, but rather repeated A.S.'s statements phrased as questions to encourage A.S. to give more detail without asserting independent knowledge, a technique well-suited to interview child victims. This 2015 CAC interview was not excluded as hearsay, as discussed above, since the prior consistent statements were admitted under 801A(a)(2) after defense counsel attacked A.S.'s credibility. The trial court did not violate King's right to confrontation, and no palpable error occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Defense counsel objected to the admission of this phone call several times: first through a pretrial motion, and then through objections at trial, both at the initial evidentiary bench conference, and then twice more during Hope's testimony and the playing of the recorded phone call. Although the recording is hearsay, the trial court admitted the recording under the hearsay exception for adoptive admissions, KRE 801A(b)(2).

Here, the trial court admitted Hope's out-of-court statements during the phone call as substantive evidence that King admitted his guilt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   King primarily argues that his responses to Hope's out-of-court statements on the recording, including his silence, do not manifest his adoption of, or belief in, the truth Hope's statements. We agree that his responses are ambiguous, and we are mindful that \"because of the powerful nature of such evidence, and the dubious reliability associated with it, trial judges should guard against any possible abuse and hold the admissibility of such evidence to exacting standards.\"\n   <em>\n    Trigg,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6870300\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/322/#p331\">\n    460 S.W.3d at 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   However, the evidence King challenges contains not only the hearsay statements of Hope, it also contains the hearsay statements of a second out-of-court declarant, A.S. This is hearsay within hearsay, or double hearsay: the first level of hearsay is Hope talking to King about his case; the second level of hearsay is Hope repeating to King what A.S. said. KRE 805 establishes that \"hearsay included within hearsay\" can be admitted into evidence only if each part of the out-of-court statements \"conforms with an exception to the hearsay rule provided in these rules.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Upon recognition of this double hearsay issue, a fair analysis requires us to recognize that Hope's out-of-court statement does not accuse King; she merely informs King of what A.S. had said. If King's responses can be regarded as his admission to the truth of what Hope said, he has admitted nothing more than the non-controversial fact that A.S. accused him of vile crimes. While a proper application of KRE 801A(b)(2) would allow Hope's statement to be admitted as substantive evidence, it does not reach the double hearsay of A.S.'s accusation to admit them as substantive evidence. The hearsay rule would clearly prohibit the Commonwealth from calling Hope as a witness at trial to\n   have her repeat the accusations A.S. had made out-of-court. For the same reason, the Commonwealth cannot introduce A.S.'s out-of-court accusations by using Hope's recorded statement as an evidentiary proxy for her live testimony. Even if King's responses provided, by way of KRE 801A(b)(2), an exception for admitting Hope's hearsay statement, no hearsay exception exists to qualify A.S.'s accusations as admissible evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Nevertheless, the Commonwealth contends that any error in the admission of the recorded phone conversation was harmless, and we agree. We are satisfied that, given the other evidence presented during the trial, especially A.S.'s in-court testimony, the jury was not swayed by the improper hearsay.\n   <em>\n    Winstead v.

While A.S.'s personal appearance as a witness does not remove the taint of hearsay from her out-of-court accusations, the probative impact of her in-court testimony was sufficiently compelling to overwhelm any prejudice generated by Hope's repetition of the accusations on the recorded phone call. We conclude that the trial court erred in admitting this phone call as an adoptive admission, but further conclude that the error was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    E. King's Sentence Cannot Impose a Term of Years to Run Consecutively with a Term of Life Imprisonment.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   This Court's reversal of King's two sexual abuse convictions renders moot King's last argument that his ten-year sentences for each sexual abuse count cannot run consecutively with his life sentence. King is correct that sentences for a term of years cannot run consecutively with a life sentence when part of the same action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mabe v.

One count specified sexual abuse occurring at the victim's residence on Garvey Avenue and one count described abuse occurring at \"the brown trailer\" on Sioux Trail. A.S., the victim, spoke of several incidents at each of these residences that would qualify as \"sexual abuse\" under these instructions. The Commonwealth conceded that, under this Court's more recent case law, this constitutes a unanimity violation. However, I continue to dissent from such a reading of the unanimity requirement.

Citing to a New York case, the Court quoted, \"It is not necessary that a jury, in order to find a verdict, should concur in a single view of the transaction disclosed by the evidence.

Rather, it is the unanimity of the\n   <em>\n    verdict\n   </em>\n   that is integral to our constitutional analysis and it is the unanimity of the\n   <em>\n    verdict\n   </em>\n   that is a matter of due process. This requires a unanimous jury finding that the prosecution has proven each element of the offense. If a particular element could be proven in multiple ways, why should the jury be required to distinguish which alternative means it decides upon? Such distinction should only be required when it affects the defendant's substantial rights, either through his right to appeal, his ability to present a defense, notice of his charges, etc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <strong>\n    UNANIMITY VS. REVIEWABILITY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Why is there a difference between these two treatments,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   between the situation in\n   <em>\n    Applegate\n   </em>\n   in contrast to\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Harp\n   </em>\n   ? Between alternative means and multiple acts? Why should we require unanimity on\n   <em>\n    elements\n   </em>\n   and not on\n   <em>\n    facts?\n   </em>\n   Why did the decision in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   distinctly cross a line into new territory? I cite Justice Cunningham's dissent in\n   <em>\n    Johnson.\n   </em>\n   The unanimity issues as described in these sexual abuse\n   cases are not, in actuality, unanimity issues. Instead, they are reviewability issues. In many of these cases where a defendant is found guilty of multiple counts without distinguishing characteristics, \"the reviewing court cannot be certain which offense or offenses were committed-not whether the jury voted unanimously. So it is not a unanimity issue. It is a review problem.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7091994\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/405/439/#p449\">\n    405 S.W.3d at 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Cunningham, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). This important distinction draws the line for why our cases have been so conflicted and have created such an untenable position for prosecutions of sexual abuse cases. We are simply asking the wrong question. The question is not whether the jury all agreed to the exact same act to reach its verdict. The question is, instead, are we able to adequately review that verdict? When only one offense has been charged, as in\n   <em>\n    Applegate,\n   </em>\n   it is easily reviewable as all the evidence was integral to prosecution of that one count. If there are multiple counts and the jury returns guilty verdicts on all, as in the sexual abuse counts in\n   <em>\n    Bell,\n   </em>\n   once again, reviewability is not an issue. However, when there are multiple counts and only some return guilty verdicts, like the sodomy counts in\n   <em>\n    Bell,\n   </em>\n   then reviewability becomes an integral issue. If the Court cannot determine what the defendant was convicted of, then that defendant has lost all means to any effective appeal. However, this does not necessarily mean that his verdict was non-unanimous. The majority implies that the distinction is meaningless, that what we call the problem is irrelevant. However, I would argue that it goes to the heart of the issue and determines whether the error is reversible or not. If a defendant loses the effective means of appeal, his due process rights have been violated and there is an error of constitutional magnitude that must be corrected. However, if reviewability is not affected, then I would hold that the error is not necessarily one affecting the due process rights of the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <strong>\n    RE-EXAMINING THE PURPOSE BEHIND UNANIMITY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   I question the practical distinction between one instruction on multiple instances, where each of these multiple instances is sufficiently proven, and a multiple-theory instruction. If we do not require a jury to unanimously decide whether a murder was intentional or wanton under old statutes, or a principal or accomplice, or whether the murder weapon was a knife or a sword, etc., then why must all twelve jurors agree as to only one particular instance of abuse? Consider these two scenarios: (1) on a charge of murder, six jurors believe the defendant was the accomplice and six jurors believe the defendant was the principal actor but all agree that the defendant is criminally responsible for the victim's death; (2) on a charge of sodomy, six jurors believe defendant performed oral sex on the victim while six jurors believe the defendant forced the victim to perform oral sex on him, but all agree the defendant is criminal responsible for \"sodomy.\" There is no practical difference between these scenarios. Instead, what this Court has created is a distinction without merit that severely incapacitates the ability to prosecute sexual abuse cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Not only is this distinction without legal basis, there are also numerous policy reasons for reinstating the analysis in our unanimity holdings prior to\n   <em>\n    Johnson.\n   </em>\n   This court-made distinction has been the downfall of numerous sex abuse cases.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kingrey v.

These holdings require prosecutors\n   to force victims to testify to unique, identifying characteristics-each incident of abuse and violence against them must have some unique quality which they must remember to an extent beyond reproach upon cross-examination. Their credibility must be upheld with the jury, even while being forced to relive what may be some of the worst moments of their life. This Court would require them not only to relive those moments, but also to be sure to notice the room, the clothes the abuser is wearing, the weather of the day, etc. But that detail must be unique for each circumstance. Additionally, I question whether these kinds of details will ever be subject to recall in some cases. In such cases, must the Commonwealth abandon all prosecution?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   The majority states that this particular \"lament\" is unfounded and that \"[e]very child that is competent to testify to the abuse they suffered can relate some distinction between abusive acts, however trivial, minute, or obscure.\" First, I would state that such a broad and generalized statement cannot be accurately made without reservation. Second, even the cases cited by the majority opinion recognize that this lack of distinction is a real and concrete barrier faced in child abuse prosecutions.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   Particularly when the accused resides with the victim or has virtually unchecked access to the child, and the abuse has occurred on a regular basis and in a consistent manner over a prolonged period of time, the child may have no meaningful reference point of time or detail by which to distinguish one specific act from another. The more frequent and repetitive the abuse, the more likely it becomes that the victim will be unable to recall specific dates and places. Moreover[,] because the molestation usually occurs outside the presence of witnesses, and often leaves no permanent physical evidence, the [prosecution's] case rests on the testimony of a victim whose memory may be clouded by a blur of abuse and a desire to forget.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, this Court has read into the unanimity requirement a new and different standard not guaranteed by our state Constitution. This is not an imagined barrier, as the majority opinion seems to imply. It is a real obstacle in these kinds of prosecutions. Given the history surrounding the evolution of this issue, and with great respect to my learned colleagues, I see no reason to persist in reading our laws this way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   For all these reasons, I believe now is our opportunity to overrule\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   and the successive line of cases holding the instructions at issue are reversible error. The majority opinion states that it would \"egregiously err\" in \"renounc[ing] our jurisprudence in this matter and pretend that this problem does not exist.\" I, in sharp contrast, believe it to be egregious error to continue a legal fiction that serves no constitutional purpose\n   absent creating insurmountable barriers to the efficient and effective prosecution of abusers. Other jurisdictions, as cited herein and by the majority, have developed tests and rules to examine how unanimity is affected in each situation. There is no reason our court should steadfastly hold to such a bright-line and rigid rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   I would reiterate our prior holdings that where only one count has been charged, unanimity is not an issue. I would also clarify that reviewability is a distinct issue from non-unanimous verdicts. While I anticipate that this issue will become less prevalent due to the recent legislation passed by the General Assembly allowing prosecution for a continuing course of conduct, I am concerned that our current case law continues to be a source of confusion on this issue. This error must be corrected, and I believe now is the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Even if this Court chooses not to overrule this line of cases, I would encourage the Court to look to other jurisdictions' analysis of the issue in contrast to our treatment of unanimity. In most of these other jurisdictions, prosecutors are encouraged to elect the incident the jury is to consider\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   to give a generalized instruction on unanimity. I believe this handling could be helpful to practitioners and the bench in this Commonwealth. Additionally, other states look at the particular circumstances each time this issue is raised by a defendant. It is not simply that,\n   <em>\n    ipso facto,\n   </em>\n   unanimity error leads to reversing the conviction. Instead, it is an in-depth analysis which looks at the\n   <em>\n    rights\n   </em>\n   of the defendant and whether his right to a fair trial was impeded by the error.

Rather than charging multiple counts of sexual abuse, and subjecting King to a much higher sentence, the prosecution charged one count of sexual abuse for each location. The court also wisely specified that location in the jury instructions. This advantageous arrangement is potentially why King chose to remain silent on the jury instruction issue and allow the process to take hold and then seek palpable error review. Although I agree that this is not what should be prevented under the palpable error rule, I also disagree that this even qualifies under current case law as palpable error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   First, I am disinclined to accept King's position that there would have been a different result. To prove this, it would have to be shown that some of the incidents testified about by the victim were insufficient to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. This is not the case. A.S. spoke in depth about the abuse to which she was subjected. Each incident was sufficient for the jury to find guilt. If this is the case, then even with separate counts or testimony about only one incident, the result would have been the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Second, I do not succumb to the belief that King's case was \"shocking or jurisprudentially intolerable.\" This particular situation does not affront the judicial system as\n   a whole. I do not agree that this implicates King's due process rights under the law. Instead, he benefited from the choice to be indicted only on the specified two counts of sexual abuse. As this does not \"threaten[ ] the integrity of the judicial process,\" I do not agree that the error here, if any, was palpable to warrant reversal of these particular convictions. King's defense to the entire case was the same: \"I did not do it.\" Clearly, the jury determined the victim was more credible than the defendant here. There was no parsing of defenses for each particular act; King had one defense and the jury did not believe it. I do not subscribe to the notion that this situation is what our courts have traditionally referred to as palpable error. Palpable error is an error that is egregious and offends the judicial process. This is simply not the case here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   I agree with many other jurisdictions that a general unanimity instruction to juries would help to cure potential error, although I maintain this is not palpable error. However, it is important to note that the jury was instructed in Instruction No. 1 that \"[t]he verdicts of the jury must be unanimous[.]\" Although this may not be as specific as the majority would like for a unanimity instruction, I believe it is sufficient to, at the least, remove the palpable nature of any potential error here. For the foregoing reasons, I would also affirm the sexual abuse convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Cunningham and Wright, JJ., join.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-205\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Godoy,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"283\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=284%20P.3d%20410\">\n     284 P.3d at 415\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Here the jury was unanimous in its finding of guilt, and it need not have agreed on either of the State's alternative theories of Defendant's possession of cocaine.
