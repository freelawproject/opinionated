A jury answered Question 3 of the jury charge affirmatively, finding that Westlake was excused from performance under the contract. The trial court then rendered a take-nothing judgment on MIS's claims. On appeal, MIS argues the trial court erred in submitting Question 3, which combined multiple affirmative defenses in a broad-form question. We conclude the trial court did not err in submitting Question 3 to the jury. We, therefore, affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   MIS is engaged in the business of selling, leasing, and servicing medical imaging equipment such as MRIs, CT scanners, and X-ray machines. Westlake operates a hospital and owns medical imaging equipment, including a CT scanner. In March 2011, MIS and Westlake entered into a service agreement under which MIS would\n   provide maintenance on Westlake's medical imaging equipment over the next five years. The service agreement provided that Westlake would pay MIS monthly fees in exchange for its maintenance services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In May 2014, MIS sued Westlake, claiming that it had breached the service agreement by failing to pay the monthly service fees, by improperly contacting MIS's subcontractors, and by allowing third parties to work on the equipment. Westlake filed an answer to the suit, which included a general denial, multiple affirmative defenses, and various counterclaims. The case eventually went to trial before a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At trial, MIS asserted Westlake breached the parties' contract under multiple theories. Under one theory, MIS argued that Westlake breached the contract by failing to pay the monthly service fee by the first of each month as required. MIS further argued that Westlake had never intended to timely pay or even to pay within a thirty, sixty, or ninety-day window. MIS claimed that, on average, MIS was over one hundred days in arrearages on its payments under the contract. Under another theory, MIS argued that Westlake breached the contract by allowing other service providers to work on the covered equipment without informing MIS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Westlake countered that it did not breach the contract by failing to pay the monthly service fee by the first of each month because the parties had modified the terms of the original contract to allow Westlake to pay within a sixty-day window. Westlake also argued that it did not breach the contract because MIS had waived its right to insist upon payments by the first of each month. Additionally, Westlake argued that MIS was the party that had breached the contract by not providing trained technicians who could maintain the equipment up to manufacturer specifications and by refusing to replace a covered part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Question 3 of the proposed jury charge asked if Westlake's failure to comply with the contract was excused by repudiation, waiver, modification, or fraud. At the charge conference, MIS objected to Question 3 on the basis that \"[t]here is no pleading to support prior repudiation,\" \"there is no evidence of waiver,\" and \"there is no evidence to support excuse.\" The trial court overruled MIS's objections and submitted Question 3 to the jury as stated in the proposed charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Question 1 of the jury charge asked, \"Did Westlake fail to comply with the [parties' contract]?\" The jury answered \"Yes\" to this question. Question 2 of the jury charge asked, \"Did [MIS] fail to comply with the [parties' contract]?\" The jury also answered \"Yes\" to this question. Question 3 of the jury charge asked if Westlake's failure to comply with the contract was excused. Question 3 instructed the jury that Westlake's failure to comply was excused (1) if MIS agreed that a new term would take its place, (2) by MIS's prior repudiation of the service agreement, or (3) if compliance was waived by MIS. The jury answered \"Yes\" to Question 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   MIS filed a motion to disregard the jury's answer to Question 3. In the motion to disregard, MIS argued, among other things, that the jury's finding of repudiation, modification, and waiver was not supported by the evidence. Westlake filed a response to the motion to disregard, arguing that its affirmative defenses of repudiation, modification, and waiver were all supported by some evidence. After a hearing, the trial court denied the motion to disregard and rendered judgment that MIS take nothing on its breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   MIS also filed a motion for new trial, which reiterated some of the arguments made in its motion to disregard. The trial court denied the motion for new trial. MIS appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    MIS'S ARGUMENTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On appeal, MIS's overarching complaint is that Question 3 was defective because it improperly combined four separate affirmative defenses, three of which were defective. MIS further complains that Westlake's affirmative defense of repudiation was improperly included in Question 3 because Westlake never pled repudiation and it was not tried by consent. Additionally, MIS complains that Westlake's affirmative defenses of repudiation, modification, and waiver were improperly included in Question 3 because they were not supported by any evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW AND APPLICABLE LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We review the trial court's decision to submit or refuse a particular jury instruction for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Thota v.

Westlake's CT scanner became inoperable in January 2014. MIS came out to service the CT scanner and determined that the equipment's anode power module (APM) needed replacement. MIS replaced the APM, which was a covered part under the parties' contract. However, after four or five days, the CT scanner stopped working again. MIS came out to service the CT scanner and determined that another part of the CT scanner, the x-ray tube, was causing the APM to go out. The x-ray tube was not a part covered under the parties' contract. MIS engineers predicted that the CT scanner would go down again unless the x-ray tube was replaced. Therefore, MIS refused to replace the APM unless Westlake replaced the x-ray tube.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   At this point, Westlake informed MIS that it wanted a second opinion about whether the x-ray tube was malfunctioning. Westlake called the manufacturer to inspect the CT scanner, which recommended the replacement of the CT scanner's highspeed starter board. MIS replaced the highspeed starter board, but this did not resolve the problem. MIS then prepared quotes for Westlake to replace the x-ray tube. However, Westlake once again called the manufacturer, and the manufacturer inspected the CT scanner and determined that the CT scanner did not need a new x-ray tube and that the proper repair was the installation of a non-defective APM. The manufacturer installed a new APM and the CT scanner started working again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   When MIS learned that another service provider had installed a new APM, MIS told Westlake that it was not going to cover the APM installed by the manufacturer because the service had been performed outside of the parties' contract. In response, Westlake's representative, J.J. Jefferson, advised MIS by email that Westlake was going to reduce the amount it owed MIS by the amount Westlake had paid the manufacturer for the new APM. Additionally, Jefferson informed MIS that it also was going to bill MIS for lost revenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   MIS's executive vice-president, Robert Hagan, testified that after the CT scanner dispute, MIS felt that it needed to \"fix\" its relationship with Westlake or \"end it.\" Hagan testified that after MIS received the email from Jefferson saying that Westlake was going to bill MIS for lost revenue, MIS had \"had our fill.\" Hagan also testified: \"And we just said, you know, that's it, especially with the ... blip in [Jefferson's\n   email] that says, 'You'll get my invoice for lost revenue as soon as we get through this,' and we said, 'Nah, we're just done.' \" Hagan further testified: \"You know, this is it. I mean we get a letter saying this is what you're gonna do, and we're crediting this, we just had it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Additionally, the evidence showed that MIS did not perform any other service on Westlake's equipment after the CT scanner dispute involving the APM, which occurred in late January and early February 2014. Westlake presented documents showing that MIS refused to service Westlake's covered equipment in March 2014. Specifically, on March 2, 2014, Westlake sent a service request to MIS via email informing it that its CT scanner was not operating. On March 3, 2014, Westlake informed MIS via email that because MIS had failed to respond to its request in a timely manner, Westlake had requested service from the manufacturer, and the manufacturer would be performing the repairs the following day unless MIS contacted Westlake. The evidence further showed that MIS did not respond to Westlake's March 2, 2014 request for service and the manufacturer repaired the CT scanner by replacing its graphics card.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Therefore, some evidence was presented showing that MIS had indicated by its words or actions that it was not going to perform on the parties' contract in the future. In light of this record, we conclude there was some evidence to support an instruction on Westlake's affirmative defense of repudiation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Did Westlake Plead the Affirmative Defense of Repudiation?\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Repudiation is an affirmative defense which is not available to the defendant unless specifically pleaded.\n   <em>\n    Brantley v.

In setting out its affirmative defenses, Westlake stated that MIS's \"equitable claims fail based on the doctrines of waiver, estoppel, unjust enrichment, and unclean hands.\" In setting out its various counterclaims, Westlake made only general factual allegations that MIS \"refused to perform Covered Maintenance recommended by\" the original equipment manufacturer. In setting out its breach of contract counterclaim, Westlake alleged that MIS's \"refusal to perform Covered Maintenance, failure to maintain the Covered Equipment at [original equipment manufacturer] standards, its multiple Services Failures, and other nonperformance under the Service Agreement are breaches of the Agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The general factual allegations made in support of Westlake's breach of contract counterclaim were insufficient to give\n   MIS notice that Westlake was asserting the affirmative defense of repudiation. Nowhere in its pleadings did Westlake indicate that it was relying on MIS's nonperformance to excuse Westlake's obligation to perform under the contract. Furthermore, Westlake listed several other affirmative defenses in its pleadings, but omitted repudiation from this list.

Until they put in a CT [x-ray] tube, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Hagan: And got current on their bills.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Counsel: And you told them that you weren't going to work on the system any more until they put that CT [x-ray] tube in, correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Hagan: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Hagan further testified on cross-examination: \"At that point in time we felt like the relationship was irreparable and gotten to that point, and we couldn't do any more accommodations, and that was it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Additionally, Westlake presented documents indicating that MIS also refused to service Westlake's equipment in March 2014. This evidence included an email from a Westlake representative asking MIS to send a technician to repair and replace the graphics card on the CT scanner. The email stated that if MIS did not timely\n   respond to Westlake's service request, it would secure another service provider to perform the repair. Westlake also presented an invoice showing that Westlake ultimately paid another service provider to perform the requested repair. This evidence, combined with Hagan's testimony on direct examination that MIS felt that it needed to end its relationship with Westlake, that MIS had \"had [its] fill\" with Westlake, and that MIS was \"just done\" with Westlake, demonstrates that repudiation was tried by consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We conclude that the record shows that evidence of repudiation was developed under circumstances indicating that both parties understood that the affirmative defense of repudiation was in the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Case Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8990702\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/184/760/#p771\">\n    184 S.W.3d at 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, we conclude that Westlake's repudiation defense was tried by consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Because there was some evidence of repudiation and the parties tried repudiation by consent, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by including the repudiation instruction in the charge.

In its fourth issue, MIS argues the trial court erred in submitting Question No. 3 because there was no evidence that Westlake provided any new or additional consideration to support the affirmative defense of modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The jury was instructed: \"Failure to comply with the term in the [contract] is excused if Westlake and MIS TEXAS agreed that a new term would take its place.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Whether or not a contract has been modified depends on the parties' intentions and is a question of fact.\n   <em>\n    Reytec Constr.

Therefore, to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in submitting an instruction on the affirmative defense of modification, we must examine the record to see if there is some evidence of modification of the parties' contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elbaor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9996789\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/845/240/#p243\">\n    845 S.W.2d at 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Additionally, the contract provided that Westlake would be in default if it failed to pay when due any or all amounts due to be paid by the customer and such default continued for ten days after MIS notified the customer of the failure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   At trial, evidence was admitted indicating that the parties had modified the payment terms in the original contract. On January 16, 2014, Hagan sent an email to Jefferson informing her that MIS had come up with a plan to help Westlake \"get caught up\" to less than a sixty-day payment delay. The proposed plan required Westlake to pay an additional $5,494.19 week over the course of the next twenty-five weeks. Hagan advised Westlake that if it agreed to the proposed payment plan, MIS would remove Westlake from its \"hold\" status as long as Westlake \"would stay current on its account and we could get current to within 60 days [payment delay] by July of this year.\" On January 21, 2014, a Westlake account representative, Tiffani Hendrix, responded to Hagan's email by stating that Westlake \"should be able to pay the $5500.00 per week beginning this week.\" On January 22, 2014, Hendrix informed Hagan via email, \"I will be paying $5575 per week until we are current.\" The evidence also showed that Westlake started making weekly payments of $5575, and that the payments were accepted by MIS without objection. Additionally, Jefferson testified that Westlake understood that the payment terms under the contract were changed to sixty days after the payment due date based on the communications it had received from MIS. Thus, there was some evidence that the parties modified the payment terms of the original contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As to consideration, MIS argues that a contracting party does not provide consideration for a modification merely by promising what the party is already bound to do by the original contract terms. According to MIS, there was no evidence of new or additional consideration to support a modification of the parties' original contract. We disagree. Under the parties' original contract, Westlake was not entitled to make payments on sixty-day terms, and MIS was not entitled to receive weekly payments from Westlake. Thus, there was some evidence that the alleged modification was supported by new or additional consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   We conclude there was some evidence to support an instruction on Westlake's affirmative defense of modification. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by including the modification instruction in the charge.

Under the parties' original contract, Westlake's payments were due on the first of each month and any payment received after the fifth of the month was considered delinquent and accrued interest at the rate of 1.5% per month until paid in full. Additionally, the parties' original contract stated that Westlake would be in default if it failed to pay when due any or all amounts due to be paid by the customer and such default continued for ten days after MIS notified the customer of the failure. Nevertheless, evidence was admitted indicating that MIS did not formally declare Westlake in default until March 2014, which was after the controversy involving the CT scanner and the APM. Additionally, evidence was admitted indicating that MIS never charged Westlake interest for its failure to make timely payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Furthermore, the evidence showed that, notwithstanding Westlake's delinquent account status, MIS informed Westlake that it would be in compliance with its contractual obligations if it maintained sixty-day payment terms. Specifically, in a December 17, 2013 email, Hagan informed Westlake that a sixty-day payment delay was acceptable. In a December 23, 2013 email, MIS's chief financial officer, Bates, sent a letter to Westlake reiterating that Westlake needed to bring its \"account current or at least [to] a 60 day past due immediately.\" And, in a January 16, 2014 email, Hagan informed Westlake that it had come up with a plan to get Westlake's account within a sixty-day payment window. In sum, evidence was admitted showing that MIS said and did things inconsistent with an intent to rely upon the payment term provisions in the original contract, and thus, waived portions of the parties' contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   We conclude that the instruction on the affirmative defense of waiver was supported by some evidence. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by including the waiver instruction in the charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    BROAD-FORM SUBMISSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In its first issue, MIS argues the trial court erred in submitting Question No. 3 because it was a broad-form question that contained defective instructions on the affirmative defenses of repudiation, modification, and waiver. MIS argues that if any of the instructions on repudiation, modification, and waiver was submitted in error, the submission of Question No. 3 was harmful error and the trial court's judgment must be reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   To support its argument, MIS relies on\n   <em>\n    Crown Life Ins. Co. v. Casteel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11191006\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/22/378/\">\n    22 S.W.3d 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex. 2000). In\n   <em>\n    Casteel\n   </em>\n   , the Texas Supreme Court held that when a trial court submits a broad-form liability question that erroneously commingles valid and invalid liability theories, the error is harmful when the appellate court cannot determine if the jury based its verdict on an improperly submitted invalid theory.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11191006\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/22/378/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11191006\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/22/378/\">\n    at 388-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . MIS argues that\n   <em>\n    Casteel\n   </em>\n   's reasoning extends to situations in which a single broad-form question commingles valid and invalid affirmative defenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pantaze v.

App.-Dallas 1999, no pet.) (not designated for publication) (applying\n   <em>\n    Casteel\n   </em>\n   to affirmative defenses). However, we need not decide if\n   <em>\n    Casteel\n   </em>\n   's reasoning applies when valid and invalid affirmative defenses are commingled in a single broad-form question because the broad-form question in this case did not commingle valid and invalid affirmative defenses. As we determined in our consideration of MIS's other issues, the instructions on repudiation, modification, and waiver were not defective. We, therefore, overrule MIS's first issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The trial court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    MIS also argues there was no evidence of a modification of the parties' contract that would excuse \"complete performance\" by Westlake, and therefore, the inclusion of this defense in Question No. 3 was reversible error.
