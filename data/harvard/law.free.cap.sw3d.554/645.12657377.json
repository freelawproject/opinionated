Shannon McCoy (Shannon) was thirty-seven weeks pregnant and under the prenatal obstetrical care of Dr. Debra Gunn, an obstetrician and gynecologist (ob/gyn) associated with Obstetrical and Gynecological Associates, P.A. (OGA). Shannon presented herself to the hospital with severe abdominal pain, where doctors determined that she had suffered placental abruption and that her fetus was not viable. Both during and after delivery, Shannon experienced complications that led to brain damage, quadriplegia, and later, her death. Acting as her guardian, Shannon's husband, Andre McCoy (McCoy), sued the hospital and several attending doctors, including Dr. Debra Gunn, and their medical practice groups, including OGA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following issues are before us: (1) whether the court of appeals erred in holding that there was legally sufficient evidence of causation; (2) whether the trial court committed reversible error in excluding deposition testimony of the defendants' expert witness regarding future medical expenses; (3) whether the medical billing affidavits providing proof of past medical expenses were proper under\n   Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 18.001 ; (4) whether the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on unavoidable accident; (5) whether the trial court erred in granting McCoy's no-evidence summary judgment as to the defendants' affirmative defense of comparative responsibility; (6) whether OGA's indemnity claims were properly asserted post-verdict; and (7) whether Shannon's death on the eve of the court of appeals' decision created a windfall for McCoy that calls for a remand in the interest of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We agree with the court of appeals' holdings that the evidence of causation was legally sufficient, that the affidavits submitted by McCoy were proper under section 18.001, that the trial court did not commit reversible error in refusing the requested instruction on unavoidable accident, and that OGA's indemnity claim against Dr. Gunn was properly asserted. We hold that the trial court erred in excluding the video deposition testimony of the defendants' expert witness; however, the error did not probably cause the rendition of an improper judgment. We reject Dr. Gunn's argument that Shannon's death created a windfall for McCoy, and we hold that Dr. Gunn waived her argument with regard to the trial court's summary judgment on comparative responsibility. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Shannon McCoy was thirty-five years old and pregnant with her first child. Dr. Gunn, an ob/gyn associated with OGA, provided prenatal and obstetrical care to Shannon. Shannon first saw Dr. Gunn in March 2004, when she was estimated to be roughly nine weeks into her pregnancy. Her pregnancy was generally uneventful until September 13, 2004, when she was thirty-seven weeks into her pregnancy. On that morning, Shannon went to a routine prenatal visit with Dr. Gunn and everything appeared normal. Dr. Gunn ordered lab tests as a precautionary measure to check for hypertension ; the lab results indicated that Shannon's hemoglobin level was 9.5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   That evening, Shannon presented to the Woman's Hospital of Texas with severe abdominal pain. She was admitted at 8:50 p.m., and Dr. Mark Jacobs, the ob/gyn on call, ordered an ultrasound and discovered that the fetus had died due to placental abruption, a condition in which the placenta detaches from the uterine wall. Dr. Jacobs ordered lab tests, which indicated that Shannon had developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a blood-clotting disorder which causes both abnormal blood clotting throughout the body and profuse bleeding. DIC can occur for multiple reasons, including placental abruption. There is no dispute that in Shannon's case, DIC was not the fault of any party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Dr. Jacobs consulted with Dr. Brian Kirshon, a maternal/fetal medicine specialist, and the two doctors ordered a blood-product replacement plan to counter Shannon's DIC. Exactly how much blood Shannon lost and how much she received in the following hours-and how much she should have received-are heavily disputed. Some of this dispute stems from confusion in terminology between the parties and the court of appeals with respect to \"blood\" and \"blood products.\" At no point did Shannon receive transfusions of whole \"blood.\" Instead, it is undisputed that Shannon received the following components of blood, or \"blood products\": (1) packed red blood cells, which carry oxygen via hemoglobin to the body's organs; (2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   fresh frozen plasma (FFP), which contains factors that promote the clotting process; and (3) platelets, which are cell fragments that also promote the clotting process. Once separated from whole blood, the blood products are diluted with intravenous (IV) fluid before they are transferred to the patient. Dr. Kirshon recommended that Shannon receive two units of FFP and two units of packed red blood cells \"in light of the DIC.\" On Dr. Jacobs' order, FFP was given at 3:07 a.m. and 3:21 a.m., and the packed red blood cells were given at 3:56 a.m. and 4:50 a.m. Dr. Kirshon included the following recommendation: \"I would have more blood products available and be on the look out for major postpartum hemorrhage.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Dr. Gunn arrived at the hospital around 4:00 a.m. on September 14 and assumed care of Shannon. Dr. Gunn consulted with Dr. Kirshon, and they agreed that vaginal delivery was necessary because of Shannon's DIC. They hoped, as is often the case with placental abruption and DIC, that the DIC would self-correct after delivery. Shannon delivered a stillborn baby girl at 6:20 a.m. Nurses documented a verbal order from Dr. Gunn at 7:20 to give Shannon two more units of packed red blood cells and to draw blood for lab tests. The lab results indicated that Shannon had experienced significant blood loss, as measured by her hemoglobin level, and that her blood was not clotting normally. Specifically, the lab results indicated that Shannon's hemoglobin level had dropped to 5.5, as compared to the lab results from Shannon's prenatal visit the day before, when her hemoglobin level was 9.5. According to McCoy's expert, \"for every one point that the hemoglobin goes down, that's approximately equal to one unit of blood\" lost. The use of hemoglobin as an indicator of blood volume, however, is disputed by Dr. Gunn. Nurses documented a verbal order from Dr. Gunn at 9:00 a.m. to give Shannon four units of platelets, and another verbal order at 10:15 a.m. to give an additional two units of packed red blood cells, for a total of six units of packed red blood cells. No additional FFP was given to Shannon after the two units ordered by Dr. Jacobs. At 10:50 a.m., the nurses reported a decrease in urine output, and Dr. Gunn ordered that Shannon be given Lasix, a diuretic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Shortly after 11:00 a.m., Shannon's condition was considered stable and post-labor bleeding appeared to have lessened, so Dr. Gunn authorized her transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU). At 12:00 p.m., nurses documented that Shannon's uterus was \"boggy\" and that she received uterine massage to induce firmness. Nurses documented a \"large amount of bleeding and clots.\" At 12:10 p.m., Shannon's temperature increased and her heart rate accelerated to over 200 beats per minute. Dr. James Collins, a cardiologist who was covering the ICU, ran an electrocardiogram (EKG) and concluded that Shannon was experiencing paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, or elevated heart rate. Dr. Collins administered Digoxin to lower her heart rate, and Dr. Gunn ordered that Shannon receive uterine massage every fifteen minutes to encourage the uterus to contract. At that time, Shannon was responsive, and her blood pressure and oxygen saturation-the amount of blood that is saturated with oxygen (95-99% for most people)-were both within normal limits. Her heart rate slowed to an appropriate rate after a second dose of Digoxin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At 12:45 p.m., Shannon's uterus remained boggy upon uterine massage and nurses documented another \"large amount [of] bleeding and clots.\" Around 1:00 p.m., nurses reported that Shannon's blood pressure had dropped to 106 over 60, that she was \"agitated,\" and that her oxygen saturation rate was down to 72%. Lab\n   tests ordered at 1:16 p.m. revealed that Shannon's hemoglobin levels had increased to 7.5, but her prothrombin time (PT), which measures whether blood is clotting properly, was outside the normal range. The normal PT range is 10.8 to 13.5 seconds; Shannon's was 18.2 seconds. Moreover, her creatinine levels had increased from 1.1 to 1.9, indicating that her kidneys were not receiving adequate blood flow. Nurses documented at 1:15 p.m., and again at 1:30 p.m., that Shannon \"cont[inued] to bleed [a] mod[erate] amount.\" Dr. Gunn consulted with Dr. Kirshon, and they agreed that Shannon had been given the maximum amount of contractile drugs. They concluded that she had developed uterine atony, a loss of muscle tone in the uterus that prevents it from contracting and clamping down, resulting in excessive blood loss. She was experiencing significant obstetric hemorrhage. Dr. Gunn arranged for a hysterectomy to remove Shannon's failing uterus and ordered a blood emergency, alerting the blood bank \"to prepare every unit [of blood products] that could be used with Shannon.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As the doctors moved Shannon from the ICU to the operating room, she was responsive, but she continued to hemorrhage. According to the operative report, \"[t]he ICU bed had blood throughout from the head of the bed to the foot.\" Dr. Gunn continued to massage Shannon's uterus even after Shannon was moved to the operating table. Immediately after anesthesia was given, Shannon went into ventricular fibrillation, where her heart was unable to pump blood. The anesthesiologists present performed CPR for seven minutes and delivered Shannon oxygen through a breathing tube. Her hemoglobin level at that time had dropped to 4.0, \"evidence of uterine atony associated with the rapid loss of blood.\" Once Shannon was stabilized with blood products infusing, Dr. Gunn performed the hysterectomy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Later that evening, in the ICU, Shannon experienced seizure activity. A neurology consult was called, and the neurologist concluded that this activity was probably a sign of hypoxic encephalopathy, or decreased oxygen to the brain. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was ordered, and the results were consistent with \"severe depression of cerebral function, most probably an anoxic basis at least in part.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shannon's blood gases showed that she was acidotic, meaning she had a dangerously low pH resulting from a lack of oxygen. Shannon was transferred to the neurological ICU at St. Luke's Hospital. She received months of rehabilitative treatment at St. Luke's, Select Specialty Hospital, and The Institute for Rehabilitation and Research. Her condition after the initial injury was assessed as a \"persistent state of vegetation.\" Her husband testified to carrying out his wife's daily routine of personal hygiene, grooming, and dressing in the months and years after the injury. Simply put, she required twenty-four-hour care and remained \"total[ly] dependent for all basic and higher level activities of daily living.\" The record suggests that Shannon initially experienced some improvement, including visual tracking, limited controlled movements, and producing words. However, in 2005-roughly a year after the initial injury-Shannon was hospitalized for a seizure which resulted in an episode of hypoxia, and she never recovered her previous improvement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   McCoy, acting individually and as Shannon's guardian, sued Woman's Hospital, Dr. Gunn, Dr. Jacobs, Dr. Collins, and OGA. Prior to trial, Dr. Collins was dropped from the pleadings, and Woman's Hospital and Dr. Jacobs each settled with McCoy for a total of $1,206,773.50. Dr. Gunn and OGA asserted the affirmative defense of comparative responsibility, claiming that McCoy, his family members, the treating labor-and-delivery nurses, and Dr. Collins were negligent and that their negligence contributed to Shannon's brain damage. McCoy filed a no-evidence motion for summary judgment on this affirmative defense, which the trial court granted. Testimony at trial was hotly disputed. Ultimately, the jury returned an eleven-to-one verdict in favor of McCoy as to Dr. Gunn's negligence and awarded $10,626,369.00 in damages. The award included $703,985.98 for past medical expenses and $7,242,403.00 for future medical expenses. The trial court applied a dollar-for-dollar settlement credit to offset the verdict in the amount of $1,206,773.50. The court ruled that OGA was vicariously liable for Dr. Gunn's negligence and ordered that the two defendants were jointly and severally liable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The verdict spawned a series of new litigation tactics by McCoy, who joined a number of parties to the case after the verdict and delayed the entry of judgment for nearly two years. McCoy filed amended petitions adding new defendants to the case and seeking to collect the damages awarded in the verdict from them. Ultimately, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the new defendants and the court of appeals affirmed.\n   <em>\n    McCoy v. FemPartners, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6809697\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/484/201/#p214\">\n    484 S.W.3d 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 214 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2015, no pet.). OGA filed post-verdict claims for indemnity against Dr. Gunn and legal malpractice claims against its former defense counsel,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   but later dismissed its legal malpractice claims. The trial court signed the final judgment in 2013, two years after the verdict was issued, and included an order that OGA was entitled to indemnity from Dr. Gunn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Dr. Gunn and OGA appealed, raising several issues. Both argued that: (1) there was no evidence of causation; (2) the trial court should not have granted summary judgment on comparative responsibility; (3) the court should not have excluded Dr. Helen Schilling's testimony regarding Shannon's future medical expenses; (4) the court should have submitted various jury instructions; and (5) the evidence was legally and factually insufficient to support Shannon's past medical expenses.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6798728\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/489/75/#p83\">\n    489 S.W.3d 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 83 (Tex.

Evidence is legally insufficient to support a jury finding when (1) the record discloses a complete absence of evidence of a vital fact; (2) the court is barred by rules of law or of evidence from giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact; (3) the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more than a mere scintilla; or (4) the evidence establishes conclusively the opposite of a vital fact.\n    <em>\n     Bustamante v.

However, Shannon continued to lose blood volume. As her\n    blood volume loss approached the critical danger zone of approximately 40%, Shannon's body could no longer compensate, resulting in her cardiac arrest, lack of oxygen flow to her brain, and her permanent brain damage.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6798728\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/489/75/#p83\">\n     489 S.W.3d at 90\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Dr. Gunn and OGA advanced a different theory-that Shannon's DIC caused small blood clots to form in Shannon's vascular system and some of those small clots lodged in blood vessels in Shannon's brain, resulting in her injuries. We summarize the evidence supporting the parties' arguments.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    <strong>\n     A. McCoy's Theory\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    For the standard of care and Dr. Gunn's alleged failure to meet it, McCoy relied upon the testimony of Dr. Molly Brewer, a medical doctor board certified in both obstetrics and gynecology and gynecological oncology. Dr. Brewer underwent specific training in handling DIC patients, and she taught \"how to handle DIC from placental abruption and other causes\" to other ob/gyns.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Dr. Brewer testified that DIC impacts the body's ability to clot, which puts people at risk of bleeding because their clotting factors are no longer working properly. She stated that Shannon \"absolutely\" had DIC. Dr. Brewer estimated Shannon's blood volume based on her hemoglobin levels, explaining that \"for every one point that the hemoglobin goes down, that's approximately equal to one unit of blood.\" She explained that doctors cannot always look at a patient and know if they are bleeding; therefore, doctors must rely on lab results, specifically hemoglobin levels, to approximate blood volume and blood loss.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Based on this underlying assumption, Dr. Brewer testified that the decreased hemoglobin levels shown in Shannon's lab results indicated that she was losing blood. Specifically, the lab tests ordered at 7:20 a.m. indicated that Shannon's hemoglobin levels had dropped from 9.5 to 5.5, which \"should have put [Dr. Gunn] into almost panic mode.\" Dr. Brewer testified that by 1:00 p.m., Shannon had lost about 33 to 44% of her blood volume. Lab results also indicated that Shannon's PT had increased, meaning that her blood was not clotting properly. Because DIC interfered with Shannon's body's clotting ability, Dr. Brewer stated that it was critical that she receive FFP and that Dr. Gunn breached the standard of care by failing to order or administer FFP in response to Shannon's lab results.\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n    [Y]ou can replace blood until the cows come home, but if you can't clot and you have an open wound like inside the uterus, they're going to continue to bleed. And so you basically put the blood in and the blood comes out, and without the clotting factors, you cannot control this coagulation disorder.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    According to Dr. Brewer, a reasonable and prudent physician managing DIC should be making calculations based on hemoglobin levels to justify blood transfusions (e.g., \"her hemoglobin went from x to y and therefore, we assume that she's lost two units, three units, four units, and then it's appropriate to replace it\"). She testified that Dr. Gunn breached the standard of care by failing to do these calculations and, on a broader level, by failing to create and document a cohesive plan to manage Shannon's DIC.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Additionally, Dr. Brewer believed Shannon's lab results in the morning and the afternoon with respect to her other vital functions should have alerted Dr. Gunn that Shannon was losing blood due to her body's inability to clot. Dr. Brewer reported that Shannon's increased creatinine levels indicated that she had \"acute renal failure,\" which, read in the context of DIC,\n    tells us \"[t]hat [she] probably doesn't have enough blood flow through [the] kidneys.\" She also pointed to Shannon's decreased oxygen saturation levels and her increased heart rate, describing these phenomena as compensation mechanisms to deal with low blood volume. \"[I]f their blood is low, their heart rate goes up to get more blood.... If their oxygen is low, they breathe harder because it brings in more oxygen.... [T]hey actually shunt blood away from their kidneys because they want to spare the heart and ... the brain.\" Dr. Brewer stated that Shannon's low urine output was another sign of decreased blood flow to the kidneys, which should have been a warning sign. Instead of properly treating Shannon's low blood volume, Dr. Gunn administered Lasix, which is \"for fluid overload\" and probably made it worse for Shannon. She testified that a reasonable and prudent physician needs to stay equal with or ahead of blood loss in managing a patient like Shannon, and in this case, \"Shannon was behind in her blood volume all the way along.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    According to Dr. Brewer, Dr. Gunn's failure to replace Shannon's clotting factors by administering FFP contributed to her developing uterine atony. In the afternoon, Shannon became agitated. Dr. Brewer described this as one of the cardinal signs \"that she's going into cardiovascular collapse. I mean, something terrible has happened. Patients get agitated when they don't get enough oxygen.\" When asked about Shannon's oxygen saturation level of 72%, Dr. Brewer responded, \"I think it's a crisis.\" Dr. Brewer testified that after about 1:00 p.m., \"the d[i]e was cast with reasonable certainty. I mean, they were in serious trouble. This woman was dying in front of their eyes. I mean, she had blood pouring out.\" In looking at the whole picture and at the blood loss, Dr. Brewer said it was foreseeable that Shannon would go into ventricular fibrillation. \"The problem was [ ] she had lost so much blood at that point that it was a disaster.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Dr. Brewer stated that Shannon's lack of blood led to her ventricular fibrillation in the operating room. When a patient goes into ventricular fibrillation, her heart stops pumping blood and she is unable get oxygen to the brain. Shannon's EEG results indicated, \"No focal or epileptic features are noted.\" Dr. Brewer testified that \"the way that a reasonable person would interpret that is that something had happened to all of the brain.... A global injury.\" At St. Luke's there were seventeen neurologic consults, and each neurologist agreed that Shannon had anoxic encephalopathy, which is global damage to the brain caused by a lack of oxygen.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Dr. Brewer offered the following conclusions: Dr. Gunn was negligent in failing to give more blood products from the beginning; Dr. Gunn was negligent in failing to order more frequent lab tests to determine whether the blood products needed to be adjusted; and Dr. Gunn was negligent in failing to include adjustments to the administration of blood products to deal with the hemoglobin, platelets, and lack of FFP. \"You can [pour] the blood in, but the blood just keeps coming out if you can't clot it.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    <strong>\n     B. Dr. Gunn and OGA's Theory\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Dr. Gunn and OGA produced three experts on the issue of liability: Dr. James Aubuchon, a medical doctor, board certified in anatomic and clinical pathology, blood banking, and transfusion medicine; Dr. James Alexander, a medical doctor, board certified in obstetrics and gynecology with a subspecialty of maternal/fetal medicine; and Dr. Martin Steiner, a neurologist.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Contrary to Dr. Brewer's testimony, Dr. Aubuchon testified that with the blood products and fluids she had been given,\n    Shannon had more than enough volume for her heart to function properly. He testified that her lab results (hemoglobin, creatinine, and PT), while outside of the normal ranges, were not \"exceedingly high\" or cause for panic. He also pointed to nurses' notes that recorded the presence of clots in the post-delivery vaginal bleeding, which \"implies that the clotting system [was] able to work.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    The three experts collectively offered an alternative theory of liability. They testified that placental abruption is a result of a rupture of the mother's blood vessels in the uterus. This leads to the exposure of a substance known as thromboplastin. Thromboplastin is intended normally to start a clotting process in a small area, but in the case of placental abruption, it gets into the blood system and kicks off the clotting system inside the blood vessels themselves. This process is effectively DIC: an activation of the clotting system, such that small clots, or \"thrombi,\" are being formed throughout the entire body. These small clots move through the vascular system, and if they move into even smaller vessels, they may block those vessels, which is called \"microthrombus.\" Such blockage would prevent blood flow to surrounding tissues, causing those tissues to die from lack of oxygen.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Dr. Steiner testified that Shannon's computerized axial tomography (CAT) scans after the injury were not consistent with a global hypoxic injury, but instead showed results focused in only a small area of the brain. Thus, he opined that \"it's these microthrombi or these small little [clots] that we have been talking about\" that cause the type of problems Shannon experienced. \"It's not the type of thing that you see when there is a global hypoxia or a global lack of oxygen to the brain.\" He concluded that instead of a global or hypoxic event, Shannon suffered ischemia, or lack of blood flow to tissue, to small areas of her brain from these micro clots, and her neurological damage was \"due to the small little microthrombi blocking off the blood vessels and causing teeny strokes.\" In support of this theory, he noted Shannon's initial improvement, which is typical in a patient who has mini strokes, but not in a patient who has suffered global problems of hypoxia to the brain. Thus, Dr. Steiner testified that Shannon's seizure in 2005, which he opined was unrelated to her initial brain injury, was significant because Shannon never regained the improved function she initially experienced.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    <strong>\n     C.

The trial court agreed and refused to allow the video deposition cuts on their own, but it acknowledged that Dr. Schilling could testify live at trial to establish the basis for her expertise. Dr. Gunn and OGA chose not to call Dr. Schilling as a live witness, but presented an offer of proof instead.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    To testify as an expert, a witness must be qualified, and the proposed testimony must be relevant to the issues in the case and based upon a reliable foundation.

Therefore, to be admissible, the specific video cuts at issue needed to contain Dr. Schilling's qualifications. If a court ruling excludes evidence, a party must preserve error by filing an offer of proof informing the court of the substance of the excluded evidence. TEX. R. EVID. 103. Dr. Gunn and OGA's offer of proof shows that Dr. Schilling's deposition provides adequate testimony as to her qualifications, including details about her background in physical medicine and rehabilitation, her experience teaching residents in that field, her experience as a director of rehabilitation at a hospital, her experience preparing life-care plans as part of her daily practice, and her own examination of Shannon.\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    Based on the offer of proof, which references the transcript of the excluded testimony, Dr. Schilling's qualifications are not dissimilar from those of Dr. Willingham, whose testimony was admitted without objection. Both doctors completed a physical medicine and rehabilitation residency,\n    served as medical directors at rehabilitation centers, are on a faculty teaching physical medicine and rehabilitation residents, and prepare life-care plans as part of their practices. Of course, without the specific video cuts in the record, we cannot determine with absolute certainty that the qualifications provided in the offer of proof (Dr. Schilling's deposition) were actually contained in the proffered testimony. To be clear, an offer of proof is not a work-around for the foundational requirement that an expert's qualifications be proven, and it is limited to the substance of the excluded evidence.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    TEX.

The two options were clearly presented to the jury. Both plans accounted for a twenty-year life expectancy. Dr. Willingham's testimony enumerated a number of categories of expenses-physician services, therapeutic services, medication, diagnostics, and supported life care, among others. He explained in detail what each category entailed, and he discussed why the projected expenses for some categories were the same for Option 1 and Option 2 while others were different for the two options.\n    <footnotemark>\n     15\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    He testified that, in total, the projected future medical expenses were \"just over $6.9 million\" for Option 1 and \"just over $7.3 million\" for Option 2.\n    <footnotemark>\n     16\n    </footnotemark>\n    He then explained that Dr. Schilling had made annotations to his life-care plan, \"getting rid of some items and reducing the frequency of some items and lowering the cost of some items.\" He testified that implementing Dr. Schilling's changes and criticisms reduced the projected costs to $3.3 million for Option 1 and $6.7 million for Option 2.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Neither of the two witnesses' testimony purported to speak to liability, which the jury ultimately decided in favor of McCoy. Therefore, although the exclusion of Dr. Schilling's video testimony was error, we are satisfied that the exclusion did not affect the jury's determination of liability. Nor did it cause the rendition of an improper judgment with regard to awarding future medical expenses, since both experts conceded that Shannon would require several millions of dollars in future medical expenses. And the parties do not dispute that the amount of Shannon's future medical expenses would be\n    <em>\n     at least\n    </em>\n    equal to Dr. Schilling's reduced projections for Option 1 and Option 2-a minimum of $3.3 million. Thus, the only harm that could have resulted from the exclusion of Dr. Schilling's testimony was with respect to the amount of the award for future medical expenses that exceeded Dr. Schilling's minimum projection of $3.3 million.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Furthermore, neither Dr. Willingham's testimony nor Dr. Schilling's proffered video testimony attempted to persuade the jury that one option was preferable to the other. On the contrary, Dr. Willingham specifically stated on cross examination that he was not making a judgment call as to which option was preferable: \"Either venue is appropriate, either care remaining within the home with caregivers brought in or moving to a life care residential. Either venue is appropriate.\" Likewise, Dr. Schilling's excluded deposition testimony contains nothing that might have suggested to the jury that home care would have been preferable. The jury was presented with ample testimony to understand the nature of the two options and chose Option 2, facility-based care. Thus, the question is what effect, if any, the erroneous exclusion of Dr. Schilling's video testimony had on the amount of damages awarded under the Option 2 plan, and whether the exclusion probably caused the jury to improperly award future medical expenses in excess of her projection for that option, $6.7 million.\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Dr. Gunn and OGA do not challenge the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury's award of future medical expenses; therefore, that issue is not before us. We note that there is evidence to support Dr. Willingham's projected expenses, and the jury was presented with some evidence of Dr. Schilling's projections and criticisms.

Thus, with national and regional bases on which to compare prices actually paid, insurance agents are generally well-suited to determine the reasonableness of medical expenses.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    In determining the necessity of medical expenses, it is beyond argument that medical providers-doctors-are in the best position to determine what treatments or procedures and resulting expenses are \"necessary.\" So of course, ideally, medical providers themselves would testify to the necessity of medical expenses. However, by drafting section 18.001 to allow either \"the person who provided the service\" or the \"person in charge of records\" to testify to reasonableness and necessity, the Legislature has acknowledged and made allowance for the reality that the ideal paradigm does not reflect today's complex health care system. And, for better or for worse, in the context of our health care system, what is \"necessary\" is often heavily influenced by insurance companies and by what treatments and procedures they are willing to cover. Janet L. Dolgin,\n    <em>\n     Unhealthy Determinations: Controlling \"Medical Necessity,\"\n    </em>\n    22 VA. J. SOC.

By contrast, the dissent's argument would read into the statute that an affidavit must be made by a records custodian \"sufficiently trained or experienced in medicine to give competent testimony as to the necessity of treatment and sufficiently familiar with reasonableness of charges in the region or locale in which services were rendered to give competent testimony as to the reasonableness of amounts paid by insurance companies,\" as well requiring that an affiant be \"reasonably connected to the patient\" or have \"first-hand knowledge of the services rendered.\"\n    <em>\n     But see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     TGS-NOPEC Geophysical Co. v.

If we were to hold that the subrogation agents' affidavits were also insufficient, as the dissent advocates and Dr. Gunn and OGA would have us do, we would in effect render the Legislature's streamlined proof procedure a complicated trap requiring plaintiffs to provide two sets of affidavits: (1) affidavits as to necessity of treatment from medical providers with actual knowledge of the patient's treatment, or their record custodians; and (2) separate affidavits as to reasonableness of paid charges from local or regional insurance agents or someone else with knowledge of customary amounts paid for particular treatments in that particular region.

She notes that almost 70% of the trial court's judgment was for future medical expenses, which will now never be incurred. Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 7.1 speaks to this very situation:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n    If a party to a civil case dies after the trial court renders judgment but before the case has been finally disposed of on appeal, the appeal may be perfected, and the appellate court will proceed to adjudicate the appeal as if all parties were alive.

Dr. Willingham projected and Dr. Schilling did not contest that Shannon's future medical expenses were based on a twenty-year life expectancy.

Shannon's husband, Andre McCoy (McCoy), suing individually and as Shannon's guardian, offered, and the trial court admitted, opinion testimony of Dr. Alex Willingham regarding the probable costs of Shannon's future care. The life-care plan he prepared was introduced in connection with his testimony.

Yet cases are tried because there is no way of accurately predicting how the evidence, or any particular piece of evidence, will affect a jury. Likewise, there is no realistic way of accurately determining how excluded evidence would have affected the jury's findings if it had been admitted. Thus, the conclusion that an error in excluding evidence relevant to a key issue \"likely was harmful\" is as close as any analysis is going to get. Stated another way, the test this Court has articulated is, in substance, that an error in excluding testimony is considered to have caused rendition of an improper judgment (the exclusion was likely harmful) if the excluded testimony was crucial to a key issue,\n    <em>\n     provided\n    </em>\n    that the excluded evidence was not merely cumulative and that the other evidence was not so one-sided that the excluded evidence likely would have made no difference. That is a reasonable and at least somewhat objective test that requires examination of the entire record. Because OGA and Dr. Gunn are the parties asserting error, the burden is on them to meet the test. Which, as explained below, in my view they did by demonstrating that the record shows: (1) the excluded evidence was crucial to what even McCoy's attorney told the jury was the most important issue; (2) the excluded evidence conflicted with the testimony of Dr. Willingham as to the amount of treatment and care that would be necessary for Shannon in the future, thus Dr. Schilling's testimony was not merely cumulative in regard to the key issue of the cost of necessary future medical care; and (3) the opinion testimony of Dr. Willingham was not so one-sided that Dr. Schilling's testimony likely would have had no effect at all on the jury's finding for future medical expenses. After all, Dr. Willingham's testimony was opinion testimony predicting the future, not factual testimony relating past events; Dr. Schilling and Dr. Willingham had substantively equivalent credentials; each examined Shannon one time for approximately the same amount of time; and each had extensive experience in preparing life-care plans for predicting the necessity\n    of and costs for future care for severely impaired patients.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-148\">\n    The Court subtly but importantly departs from the workable legal standard we have established, as is set out above, for determining whether the exclusion of evidence on a crucial issue was harmful. The Court opts for merely balancing the evidence admitted and excluded to determine whether, in its opinion the excluded evidence would have made a difference in the sitting jurors' minds and findings. The Court says,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n    We have, however, noted that the role excluded evidence plays in the context of trial is important, and we have provided guidelines to assist trial courts in applying the harmful error standard. Exclusion is likely harmless if the evidence was cumulative or if the rest of the evidence was so one-sided that the error likely made no difference in the judgment. By contrast, exclusion of the evidence is likely harmful if it was \"crucial to a key issue.\" We do not dispute that future medical expenses, which made up almost 70% of the trial court's judgment, was indeed a \"key issue.\" But that does not end the inquiry; our guidelines make clear that the exclusion of such evidence is \"\n    <em>\n     likely\n    </em>\n    harmful,\" not conclusively or per se harmful.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 668 (citations omitted). The Court then, however, proceeds to briefly analyze the evidence and set out the standard it uses to make its decision:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n    An error in excluding evidence is harmful when it \"probably\" caused the rendition of an improper judgment, and \"probably\" is a higher standard than \"might\" or \"could have.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Caffe Ribs, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802117\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/487/137/#p142\">\n     487 S.W.3d at 144-45\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (stating that a trial court's exclusion of evidence \"is reversible only if it probably caused the rendition of an improper judgment\");\n    <em>\n     Aultman v.

But \"likely\" does not mean \"definitively\"-\n    <em>\n     we must review the record to determine whether, in this particular case, the exclusion of Dr. Schilling's video deposition testimony \"probably,\" as opposed to \"might have\" or \"could have,\" caused the rendition of an improper judgment.\n    </em>\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 671 (emphasis added). The Court's application of the standard ignores the fact that the effect of particular evidence on a particular jury-whether admitted or excluded-is just not reasonably predictable to a fine degree. And the questions of whether the excluded evidence was cumulative and whether it was so one-sided that the error likely made no difference as part of the analysis disappear for all practical purposes in the Court's analysis. But they should be the standards for evaluating the effect of the error after it has been determined that the error was likely harmful because the excluded evidence was crucial to a key issue. In situations such as this where the evidence was crucial to a key issue and was not cumulative, the harm analysis should turn on whether the evidence was\n    <em>\n     so\n    </em>\n    one-sided that the excluded evidence likely made no difference. The \"likely\" is tethered to the \"so one-sided\" part of the standard. Not so in the standard the Court applies today. And while the standard of \"so one-sided\" is to a degree subjective, it is not nearly so subjective as determining whether excluded evidence would \"more likely than not\" have caused the jury to return a different verdict, which in effect is merely a second-guessing of the jury's view of the evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    The Court's harm analysis in this case demonstrates the difference. After determining\n    that the exclusion of Dr. Schilling's testimony was likely harmful because of its relationship to the key issue of future medical expenses, the Court moves directly to balancing the evidence. That necessarily means it considered how the jurors' thought processes likely would have worked and what the jury likely would have done had it heard the excluded evidence. Explaining a framework for that exercise is hard to do, as witnessed by the Court's explanation-less conclusion:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n    Having reviewed the entire record, we cannot say that the erroneous exclusion of Dr. Schilling's video deposition testimony probably caused the rendition of an improper judgment.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-155\">\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 671.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-156\">\n    The Court also says that there's no bright line for deciding the harm question. I agree. But there must be some articulable standard which differs from merely balancing the evidence admitted and excluded. The standard we have previously articulated, properly applied, is such a standard.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    Measuring the effect of the exclusion of Dr. Schilling's testimony once future medical was determined to be a key issue under the previously articulated standard-the exclusion was likely harmless if the excluded evidence was cumulative or the rest of the evidence was so one-sided that the error likely made no difference in the judgment,\n    <em>\n     Cent.

The amount found for future medical care was more than double the nearly $3.4 million for other damage findings combined. Second, whether the future medical was a key issue was answered by McCoy's attorney in his closing summation to the jury. He stated that the last blank, where the jury was to place its finding as to Shannon's future medical care expenses, \"is the most important blank.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    The court of appeals opined that the key dispute was liability, not damages.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6798728\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/489/75/#p83\">\n     489 S.W.3d 75\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 112 (Tex.

But they also have consistently contested the amount of damages. We have never said that there is or can be only one key dispute in a trial. Nor does such a concept make sense.

And when experts testify, one aspect of persuading the jury to the presenting party's position is presenting the expert's qualifications. That is because it is generally accepted among experienced trial lawyers that (1) part of the jury's decision regarding expert testimony will turn on whose expert the jury believes is the more credible witness, and (2) a significant part of an expert's credibility relates to the expert's qualifications and experience as to the particular issue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    As the Court notes, whether sufficient evidence supports the jury's finding as to expenses for future medical care is not at issue.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at ----. Dr. Willingham's testimony is evidence to support the finding. But where Dr. Schilling was the defendants' only witness as to the question of future medical care expenses, her testimony was crucial to the question of the differences between her opinions and those of Dr. Willingham. That conclusion is buttressed by McCoy's attempts to keep Dr. Schilling's testimony out of evidence. Further, Dr. Schilling's testimony was not cumulative of Dr. Willinghams's testimony as to many items of projected care and their cost, as demonstrated by both her testimony and her marked-up copy of Dr. Willingham's life-care plan for Shannon. If it had been, McCoy would not have strived so hard to keep it out, and OGA and Dr. Gunn to have it admitted. Further, neither the trial court, the court of appeals, nor this Court have concluded that it was cumulative.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    Which brings us to the question of whether the evidence was \"so one-sided\" that Dr. Schilling's testimony likely would have made \"no difference in the judgment.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Cent. Expressway Sign Assocs.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7300707\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/302/866/#p870\">\n     302 S.W.3d at 870\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The \"so one-sided\" question necessarily includes considering both Dr. Willingham's testimony and the evidence and testimony which would have been introduced through Dr. Schilling. If it were otherwise, then the testimony of almost every expert would be so one-sided that excluding opposing expert opinions would be harmless error.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-165\">\n    Dr. Willingham testified extensively about his training, experience in treating patients, experience in teaching medical students, lectures he had given, and other matters to bolster the opinions he testified to. However, Dr. Schilling's testimony showed that she was eminently qualified to opine as to and calculate the expenses likely to be necessary for Shannon's future medical care. Dr. Schilling testified that she was the medical director of the rehabilitation department at a Houston hospital;\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    taught fourth-year residents in that area of medicine; was on the faculty at Baylor College of Medicine; reviewed complaints against physicians in the area of physical medicine and rehabilitation for the Texas State Board of Medicine, as well as Medicare and the Texas Workers' Compensation Commission; and performed peer reviews regarding other practitioners in the field of physical medicine and rehabilitation. But because the trial court excluded Dr. Schilling's testimony, the jury never heard about her training, extensive experience, and expertise.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    Further, the jury heard Dr. Willingham testify about his personal examination of Shannon during the course of formulating his opinions. He described her conditions based on his personal observations as well as the medical records he reviewed. He described the records he reviewed in some detail and explained the amount of time he spent in reviewing them and analyzing them as part of reaching his opinions, in preparing his life-care plan for Shannon, and in estimating the costs of her future care. But the jury did not hear of Dr. Schilling's similar foundation for her testimony: her personal examination of Shannon, her detailed review of Shannon's records, the amount of time she spent in analyzing Shannon's probable future medical needs, her experience in caring for persons, such as Shannon, with severely debilitating conditions and her experience in preparing life-care plans.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    So why would the jury give similar weight-or even any weight-to Dr. Schilling's views that were briefly referenced and depreciated by Dr. Willingham when Dr. Schilling's qualifications and other testimony were not admitted? The answer, logically, is that it would not. Even more, the fact that the jury knew the defendants hired Dr. Schilling to examine Shannon and review the life-care plan prepared by Dr. Willingham could well have led it to conclude that because Dr. Schilling's testimony was not presented, Dr. Willingham's testimony was not only uncontroverted, but that it was essentially uncontrovertible. Under the circumstances, it is hard to conceive of a jury giving much, if any, credence to the limited part of Dr. Schilling's testimony that it heard via the route of hearsay through Dr. Willingham.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    Dr. Willingham gave his opinions as to a range of future medical care expenses, including projections of approximately $6.9 million for a home care option and $7.24 million for a facility-based care option. But through the filter of McCoy's retained expert, Dr. Willingham, the jury received a limited view of Dr. Schilling's opinions regarding Shannon's future medical care expenses. Dr. Willingham noted that Dr. Schilling projected $3.3 million as being necessary for home care and $6.7 million for facility-based care. He referenced a copy of a life-care plan he had prepared and that had been marked up by Dr. Schilling, and testified as to his disagreement with her opinions. After noting her projections for care, he opined that Dr. Schilling's view was, in effect, to divide the amount needed for Shannon's care in half. Thus, the jury heard in very cursory manner of Dr. Schilling's opinions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-170\">\n    The jury found $7,242,403 for future medical care-precisely the amount testified to by Dr. Willingham. That is not surprising, given that the jury heard only Dr. Willingham's testimony regarding such care. Dr. Schilling's excluded testimony, in part, would have been that approximately $3.3 million, or 46% of the amount the jury found for future care, would have been reasonable for a home care situation. Her testimony as to the probable cost of future care in a facility setting was over $500,000 less than the amount Dr. Willingham testified to. While $500,000 is less than 10% of\n    the amount that the jury found for future care, and is much less than the $3.9 million difference between Dr. Schilling's home care projection and the jury's finding, $500,000 is nevertheless a significant amount.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-171\">\n    The Court notes, as did the court of appeals, that the full range of future medical care expense projections were in front of the jury via the opinion testimony of Dr. Willingham.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at ----. But allowing a witness hired by one party to relate to the jury a filtered version of the opinion testimony of the only witness for an opposing party as to a crucial matter, then having relevant, direct testimony of the opposing party's witness as to that matter excluded and calling it a reasonably fair trial goes too far. The trial court's ruling placed the attorneys for OGA and Dr. Gunn in a no-win situation. If they did not cross examine Dr. Willingham and challenge his testimony, the jury would most likely perceive his testimony as unchallengeable. If they cross examined him extensively about Dr. Schilling's testimony, as an experienced expert witness he simply was going to repeat his opinions and disagreement with her, thus reinforcing the effect of his testimony on the jury.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-172\">\n    If the exclusion of testimony by witnesses for opposing parties as happened here becomes the paradigm, then a minimally competent lawyer for the plaintiff-or whichever party presents evidence first-in most cases should be able to short-circuit the opposing party's presenting much evidence at all, merely by having the first, friendly witnesses testify to their version of what the opposing party and the opposing witnesses have testified to or disclosed in discovery. And it is almost guaranteed that one party's evidence presented and filtered through witnesses for the opposing party will be less adverse to the opposing party than if it were fully presented through the proponent's witnesses themselves.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    In sum, I agree with the Court that the trial court erred by excluding the testimony of Dr. Schilling. But given the differences between her excluded testimony and that of Dr. Willingham regarding the key issue of the cost for future medical care for Shannon, both percentage-wise and in absolute numbers, I would hold that the excluded evidence was crucial to that key issue and the exclusion was harmful.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Diamond Offshore Servs. Ltd.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655997\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/542/539/#p551\">\n     542 S.W.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    552 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Caffe Ribs, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802117\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/487/137/#p142\">\n     487 S.W.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    145 ;\n    <em>\n     Cent.

The summaries contained information in different formats, but as relevant to the issue before us, they generally set out names of the billing providers, very brief general descriptions of services rendered by the providers, the amounts charged for the services, and the amounts paid for the services. For example, one company's summary had columns entitled \"DOS Start,\" \"DOS End,\" \"Provider,\" \"Service,\" \"Diagnostic Code,\" \"Billed,\" and \"Paid\" for each item. An example of the entries is one that listed \"DOS Start\" as \"3/24/06\"; \"DOS End\" as the same date of \"3/24/06\"; \"Provider\" as \"The Methodist Hospital\"; \"Service\" as \"D040\"; \"Diagnosis Code\" as \"7993\"; \"Billed\" as \"71,440.50\"; and \"Paid\" as \"20,808.60\". That is it-no other information, explanation, or detail as to the services provided or cost breakdown for the services. Every DOS Start and DOS End date on the summary for a particular service are the same date, just as the above example shows for $71,440.50 of hospital services billed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-186\">\n    OGA and Dr. Gunn point to the language of section 18.001 and argue that the subrogation agents who executed the affidavits are not within the pool of persons whose affidavits are sufficient to support admission of, and judgment based on, past medical expenses. They also argue that the documents attached to the affidavits do not meet the requirements of section 18.001. The Court disagrees.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at ----. I do not. I cannot agree with the Court's conclusion that by enacting section 18.001, the Legislature intended to authorize affidavits by subrogration agents located in Kentucky, Wisconsin, and Illinois to support a finding that particular treatments by health care providers in Texas were medically necessary where there is no evidence demonstrating that the affiants had any training in medicine or even had a connection with medical services, apart from their positions in companies whose business was receiving bills and information from insurance carriers and then asserting the insurers' rights of subrogation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-187\">\n    <strong>\n     A. The Subrogation Agents as Affiants\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-188\">\n    McCoy used affidavits by three subrogation agents to support the claim of $703,985.98 for Shannon's past medical expenses. One affidavit was executed in Oldham County, Kentucky, by Carroll C. Rawlings. According to the affidavit, Rawlings was the Subrogation Team Manager for the Rawlings Company, whose principal place of business was on Eden Parkway\n    in LaGrange, Kentucky. She averred that the itemized statement of claims attached to her affidavit related to Shannon's care from September 14, 2004, to December 28, 2005; the claims were paid by Aetna; and the \"information contained in the records was transmitted to [her] in the regular course of business by an employee or representative of the Rawlings Company who had personal knowledge of the information.\" The specific language of her affidavit, in relevant part, was as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-189\">\n    Attached to this affidavit are records that provide an\n    <em>\n     itemized statement\n    </em>\n    of the claims paid by Aetna related to the medical care provided to Shannon McCoy from September 14, 2004 to December 28, 2005.... The attached\n    <em>\n     billing records\n    </em>\n    are kept by me in the regular course of business. The information contained in the records was transmitted to me in the regular course of business by an employee or representative of\n    <em>\n     The Rawlings Company\n    </em>\n    who had personal knowledge of the information. The records were made at or near the time or reasonably soon after the time that the service was provided.... I am familiar with the customary charges for like or similar services rendered\n    <em>\n     in this vicinity\n    </em>\n    and I know that the charges reflected on these records are reasonable for like or similar services rendered\n    <em>\n     in this vicinity\n    </em>\n    ....

Buchanan's affidavit was essentially the same as Rawlings's affidavit except she averred that the claims itemized in the records attached to her affidavit covered Shannon's care from September 14, 2004, to December 23, 2007; they were paid by Unicare; and the information in the records was transmitted to her in the regular course of business by an \"employee or representative of Meridian Resource Company, L.L.C. who had personal knowledge of the information.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-192\">\n    The third affidavit was executed in Cook County, Illinois, by Patricia A. Heeney, the general counsel for Vengroff, Williams and Associates, Inc., whose principal place of business was 7101 North Cicero Avenue, Lincolnwood, Illinois. Heeney's affidavit was similar in substance to those of Rawlings and Buchanan. She averred that the claims itemized in records attached to her affidavit covered Shannon's care from March 6, 2006, to March 23, 2011; they were paid by the Federal Express Benefit Plan through its claims administrators, Cigna and Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield; and \"information contained in the records was transmitted to [her] in the regular course of business by an employee or representative of the claims administrators, Cigna Healthcare and Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield who had personal knowledge of the information.\" But Heeney did not state in her affidavit that the services provided to Shannon were necessary; she stated only that \"[t]he amount charged and paid for the services were reasonable at the time and place that the services were provided.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-193\">\n    The contents of the affidavits and their attachments, simply put, do not make sense as to their purpose of proving the reasonableness and necessity of Shannon's past medical expenses, as is explained more fully below. But to briefly summarize:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-194\">\n    1. The documents attached to the affidavits are not itemized statements as the affidavits say they are. They are one-line summaries of billings and collections.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-195\">\n    2. The documents attached to the affidavits are not billing records as the affidavits say they are. They are summaries of billing records.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-196\">\n    3. The affidavits of Rawlings and Buchanan circularly say that the information in the attached records was transmitted to their companies by an employee or representative of the\n    <em>\n     subrogation company\n    </em>\n    who had personal knowledge of the information, although the information in the attached summaries was for billings and collections as to numerous, diverse medical providers in Texas. The affidavit of Heeney was of the same nature, except in her affidavit Heeney says that an employee or representative of the claims administrators, Cigna Healthcare and Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield had personal knowledge of the information in the attached summaries and transmitted it to Vengroff, Williams and Associates.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-197\">\n    4. The affidavits of Rawlings and Buchanan, presented to support charges made in Houston, say that Rawlings and Buchanan, as affiants, are familiar with charges made \"in this vicinity\"-that is, in Kentucky and Wisconsin, respectively-and that the charges are reasonable for charges made in \"this vicinity.\" Then, switching tracks, Rawlings and Buchanan aver that the services provided were necessary and the charges were reasonable \"at the time and place the services were provided\"-that is, in Houston, a completely different area of the country. Heeney's affidavit is better in that she avers that \"[t]he amount charged and paid for the services were reasonable at the time and place that the services were provided.\" But she says nothing about whether the services were necessary.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-198\">\n    As noted, Rawlings and Buchanan stated in their affidavits that they were familiar with customary charges for \"like or similar services rendered in\n    <em>\n     this vicinity\n    </em>\n    \" and that the charges reflected on the records attached to their affidavits \"are reasonable for like or similar services rendered in\n    <em>\n     this vicinity\n    </em>\n    .\" (Emphasis added). The vicinity of Rawlings's principal office and the location where Carroll Rawlings executed her affidavit was Oldham County, Kentucky. The vicinity of Meridian Resource's principal office was Waukesha, Wisconsin, and the vicinity of where Christi-Jo Buchanan executed her affidavit was Waukesha County, Wisconsin. But averring that they are familiar with customary charges in Kentucky and Wisconsin does not speak to their familiarity with charges for services provided in Houston. And the affidavits do not demonstrate that the affiants had any knowledge about the rendering of or the customary charges for medical care in Houston. It is in that context that both Rawlings and Buchanan averred that \"the amount charged and paid for the services were reasonable\n    <em>\n     at the time and place that the services were provided\n    </em>\n    \"-that is, Houston. Moreover, the affidavits are devoid of information to show that any of the three affiants had any training or held any position that would qualify them to give competent testimony as to the necessity of the medical procedures and services to treat Shannon, even though Rawlings and Buchanan said they were. Heeney did not bother to aver that the services for which her company was seeking to recover were necessary.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-199\">\n    The affidavits are internally inconsistent, do not substantially comply with the Legislature's intent as to requirements for\n    this type of affidavit, and fail in several ways to support jury findings based on basic evidentiary requirements. That is understandable because the affiants were asked to verify the medical necessity of medical services rendered in another state by persons and entities with whom they had no discernable connection, that were provided to a person whose condition they had no demonstrated knowledge of, by affidavits containing language distorted to make the affidavits appear to conform to language specified by the Texas Legislature. But as demonstrated above, the affidavits do not conform to the Legislature's requirement for proof of medical expenses by affidavit. Section 18.001 is designed to allow proof by means of an affidavit as to services and charges for the services by either the provider of the services or someone in charge of records of the provider. TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7 18.001. And when affidavits are made by such providers or their employees or representatives, then the problems demonstrated by these three affidavits-internal inconsistency, lack of demonstrated knowledge of the services or of how the records of the services were made, and violation of basic evidentiary rules that protect the integrity of the trial process-for the most part disappear.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-200\">\n    The Court's interpretation fails to cabin the statute within its logical limits. \"We look to and rely on the plain meaning of a statute's words as expressing legislative intent unless a different meaning is supplied, is apparent from the context, or the plain meaning of the words leads to absurd or nonsensical results.\"\n    <em>\n     Pedernal Energy, LLC v.

Construing section 18.001 to permit anyone, no matter what the person's training and qualifications are, and no matter how far removed from the actual provider of the medical care and that provider's employees and representatives the person is, to support a judgment by swearing under oath to the necessity of medical expenses of that provider even though the affiant neither claimed to have nor demonstrated knowledge of the services rendered except for third-hand information of an apparent cursory nature, is an absurd and nonsensical result.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201122363\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Further, it may well subject the statute to a constitutional challenge.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Murchison\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11333990\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/349/133/#p136\">\n     349 U.S. 133\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 136,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11333990\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/349/133/#p136\">\n     75 S.Ct. 623\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20L.%20Ed.%20942\">\n     99 L.Ed. 942\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1955) (\"A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process.\").

In all instances, however, the exemplars, when considered in conjunction with the language of section 18.001(c)(2), demonstrate legislative intent that to comply with the requirements of section 18.001, affidavits must be made by certain categories of persons, as discussed in the preceding section, and that documents attached to the affidavits must show that the services and charges were made by persons with knowledge of the services rendered or by persons who received information from persons with knowledge of the services rendered.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-203\">\n    The documents attached to the affidavits in this case do not come close to measuring up. Rawlings, Buchanan, and Heeney attached to their affidavits what apparently are documents generated by each of their respective subrogation agencies, as indicated by the fact the documents attached to each of the three affidavits have different formats with different categories of information. The documents fairly clearly are not bills from medical providers, because each document lists numerous different providers. Rather, based on the information in the affidavits, they can only be summaries of information received from the payer entities. According to the affidavits, the amounts paid by the three payer entities were as follows: Aetna-$61,428.60; Unicare-$322,644.30; and Federal Express Benefit Plan-$319,912.99. But, according to the affidavits, the entities do not claim to have had any part in providing the services rendered to Shannon. The documents are not itemized billing records from the medical providers; instead, the attachments to the affidavits are cursory summaries of charges by providers and payments on those charges by the payer entities. Thus, the statements in the affidavits that \"Attached to this affidavit are records that provide an itemized statement of the claims paid\" are patently false. The affiants refer to the \"attached billing records\" as having been kept by the\n    affiants or the subrogation entities in the regular course of business. While the documents attached to the affidavits may have been kept in the regular course of business by the subrogation entities, the subrogation documents on their face are not billing records. The affiants each circularly state that the attachments to their affidavits are based on information transmitted to the affiant by an employee or representative of the subrogation company itself, or, in the case of Heeney, by claims administrators for Federal Express Benefit Plan \"who had personal knowledge of the information.\" But none of the affiants state that the persons who transmitted the information had knowledge of the services provided or the necessity of the services, as the section 18.002 exemplar affidavits show the Legislature intended.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-204\">\n    I would hold that the trial court erred by overruling objections of OGA and Dr. Gunn to the admission of the documents attached to the subrogation agents' affidavits. Absent the documents, there was no evidence to support the finding as to Shannon's past medical expenses. Accordingly, I would reverse the court of appeals' judgment on this issue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-205\">\n    And even if the documents attached to the affidavits of Rawlings and Buchanan were properly admitted, the documents attached to the affidavit of Heeney were admitted in error. She did not state in her affidavit that the services in the documents were necessary for Shannon's treatment. Thus, there is no evidence to support that part of the judgment awarding past medical expenses paid by the Federal Express Benefit Plan.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-206\">\n    <strong>\n     III. Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-207\">\n    I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals as to both the future and past medical care expenses and remand to the trial court for further proceedings.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-208\">\n    In the alternative, I would reverse the judgment as to the past medical expenses paid by the Federal Express Benefit Plan and render judgment that McCoy take nothing as to those expenses.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-209\">\n    I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"5\">\n    <p id=\"p-216\">\n     The court of appeals did not address this underlying assumption because Dr. Gunn and OGA did not raise it before that court.\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6798728\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/489/75/#p83\">\n      489 S.W.3d at 86\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .
