Jinkerson's (\"Defendant\") motion to suppress statements (\"Motion\"). We reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 13, 2017, Defendant was charged by complaint with first degree murder in violation of Section 565.020, armed criminal action in violation of Section 571.015, tampering with physical evidence in violation of Section 575.100, and abandonment of a corpse in violation of Section 194.425 following the shooting death of Frank J. Ancona (\"Ancona\"). Defendant was held in the St. Francois County jail on the warrant issued on the complaint. Defendant retained an attorney (\"Counsel\"), and on February 15, 2017, Counsel entered his appearance. On February 21, 2017, Defendant was arraigned, and a plea of not guilty was entered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 27, 2017, Detective Sergeant Matthew Wampler (\"Detective Wampler\") received a search warrant to collect a buccal swab from Defendant for evidentiary purposes, and when Detective Wampler met with Defendant at the designated interview room, he identified himself as the detective handling the homicide investigation. While collecting the sample, Detective Wampler told Defendant that he would like to speak with him about the events surrounding Ancona's death. Detective Wampler read Defendant his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights, and after Defendant signed a form waiving those rights, Detective Wampler began to question Defendant, throughout which time Defendant made several \"relevant statements\" pertaining to the homicide investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 1, 2017, Counsel filed a Motion seeking to suppress Defendant's\n   interview statements as well as the DNA evidence obtained from the buccal swab. Therein, Counsel granted that \"Detective Wampler read the Defendant his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   Rights [and that] Defendant waived his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   Rights in writing,\" but argued that he \"never gave permission to allow Detective Wampler to interview the Defendant\" and that he \"did not even know this interview was happening.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A hearing on the Motion was held on November 16, 2017. Detective Wampler, the sole witness to testify, explained that he did not seek permission from Counsel to interview Defendant because he was unaware that Defendant had obtained an attorney. Detective Wampler acknowledged that he had access to and knew how to use Case.net at the time of the interview, but noted that he does not use the service \"to figure out things of the court.\" Detective Wampler testified that, even so, Defendant did not indicate at the outset of the interview that he did not want to speak with him, and Defendant never informed him that he retained Counsel. Detective Wampler testified that, moreover, he read Defendant his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights from a St. Francois County designated form which, in addition to a recitation of the rights, stated above a signature line that Defendant \"fully understood his rights\" and waived them. Detective Wampler testified that Defendant indicated he understood his rights, acknowledged the waiver, and signed the form after initialing every page. Detective Wampler testified that, thereafter, he asked Defendant \"questions about where he was, what he did, [and] all of his connections with the case,\" and Defendant \"just continue[d] to speak with [him] about anything [he] was asking.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Detective Wampler testified that, eventually, Defendant \"indicated that he didn't want to answer any more questions,\" and at that point, Detective Wampler terminated the interview. Detective Wampler testified that beyond Defendant's failure to inform him that he had retained Counsel, Defendant never requested an attorney during the interview. Detective Wampler testified that he did not promise Defendant anything or coerce him into answering his questions, noted that Defendant did not appear to be intoxicated or under the influence of drugs, and explained that Defendant appeared to understand the waiver form and the questions he was asked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 6, 2018, the trial court entered its order granting Defendant's Motion only as to his interview statements. In granting the Motion, the trial court noted, without elaboration, that\n   <em>\n    Montejo v.
