Discovery Operating, Inc., which has drilled producing wells\n   on both tracts, bases its claim on leases acquired directly from the mineral-estate owners. Endeavor Energy Resources, L.P., and Endeavor Petroleum, L.L.C., (collectively, Endeavor) bases its claim on prior leases with the same owners covering land that includes the two tracts at issue. Endeavor never drilled on those two tracts, and the parties agree that Endeavor's leases' terms have expired. But the leases include \"retained-acreage clauses,\" which provide that the leases would continue after they expired as to a certain number of acres associated with each of the wells Endeavor drilled on adjacent tracts. The issue is whether the acreage Endeavor retained under the retained-acreage clauses includes the two tracts at issue. The trial court and court of appeals held that it does not. We agree and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Between 2004 and 2007, Endeavor acquired mineral leases involving two adjoining tracts. The leases relevant to this dispute cover all (approximately 640 acres) of a tract we will call \"section 4,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the northern half (approximately 320 acres) of a tract we will call \"section 9.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 4 sits immediately north of section 9. Endeavor completed two wells in section 9, both located in the section's northeastern quarter (approximately 160 acres), which we will call well #1 and well #2. Although the lease covered the entire northern half of section 9, Endeavor did not drill in or develop section 9's northwestern quarter. Endeavor also completed two wells in section 4, both in that section's southeastern quarter (approximately 160 acres), which we will call well #3 and well #4. Although the lease covered all of section 4, Endeavor did not drill wells in section 4's southwestern quarter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After completing the wells, Endeavor filed certified proration plats with the Texas Railroad Commission (the Commission). For well #1, the plat designated a proration unit of 81.21 acres consisting of the northern half of section 9's northeastern quarter. For well #2, the plat designated 81.21 acres consisting of the southern half of section 9's northeastern quarter. The designated proration units did not include any of section 9's northwestern quarter:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   For well #3, Endeavor's plat designated 81.0 acres consisting of the northern half of section 4's southeastern quarter. For well #4, the plat designated 81.0 acres consisting of the southern half of section 4's southeastern quarter. The designated proration units did not include any of section 4's southwestern quarter:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The leases at issue include two clauses that permit Endeavor to retain certain interests after the leases' primary terms expire. The first, which we refer to as the continuous-development clause, provides that the leases \"shall remain in full force and effect as to all proration units\" after the primary terms expire if Endeavor, as the lessee or \"operator,\" is \"then engaged in drilling or reworking operations\" and so long as Endeavor maintains \"a continuous drilling program.\" If Endeavor is not engaged in such operations when the primary terms expire, the leases will automatically terminate \"as to each proration unit\" on which there is no well \"producing oil or gas in commercial quantities.\" The second clause, which we refer to as the retained-acreage clause, provides that once the leases expire and the operator does not maintain the required continuous-drilling program, the leases \"shall automatically terminate as to all lands and depths covered herein,\n   <em>\n    save and except\n   </em>\n   \" certain lands within certain governmental proration units \"assigned to\" a producing well. (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After Endeavor's leases' primary terms expired, Patriot Royalty and Land, LLC, reviewed the leases and the certified proration plats Endeavor had filed with the Commission. Based on those documents, Patriot concluded that Endeavor's leases had terminated as to section 4's southwestern quarter and section 9's northwestern quarter-the lands Endeavor did not include in the proration units designated in its filed plats and on which it had not engaged in any drilling or development operations. Patriot approached the owners\n   of section 4 and section 9, obtained leases covering both of those quarters, and then assigned the leases to Discovery. Discovery successfully drilled two wells in each quarter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   When Endeavor discovered that Discovery had drilled wells on section 4's southwestern quarter and section 9's northwestern quarter, it objected to Discovery's assertion of any leasehold interest in those quarters. Relying on the leases' retained-acreage clauses, it asserted that the applicable governmental proration unit for each of its two wells in section 9's northeastern quarter covered 160 acres, and thus each proration unit included half of section 9's northwestern quarter as well as half of section 9's northeastern quarter. Endeavor also asserted that the applicable governmental proration unit for each of its two wells in section 4's southeastern quarter also covered 160 acres, and thus each proration unit included half of section 4's southwestern quarter as well as half of its southeastern quarter. In short, based on the retained-acreage clauses, Endeavor asserted that its leases remained in effect as to the entire southern half of section 4 and the entire northern half of section 9, so Discovery's leases were invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As explained, however, Endeavor had previously filed plats with the Commission assigning proration units of only 81.21 or 81.0 acres to each of the four wells, and those proration units did not include the lands described in Discovery's leases (section 4's southwestern quarter and section 9's northwestern quarter). Endeavor asserted that it had mistakenly failed to assign 160 acres to each well, consistent with the applicable \"governmental proration unit.\" Relying on this assertion, Endeavor filed new proration plats with the Commission, assigning 160 acres to each well, which included the acreage described in Discovery's leases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Also relying on the retained-acreage clauses, Discovery asserted that the lands within the governmental proration units assigned to Endeavor's producing wells included only the 81.21 and 81.0 acres that Endeavor had assigned as proration units in its plat filings before the leases' primary terms expired. Relying on this construction of the retained-acreage clauses, Discovery filed this trespass-to-try-title action against Endeavor. The Elrods and the Haggard Trust intervened as plaintiffs in support of Discovery's position. Because of this litigation, the Commission declined to take any action with regard to Endeavor's request to amend its plat filings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After stipulating to most of the relevant facts, both sides filed summary-judgment motions. Agreeing with Discovery's construction of the retained-acreage clauses, the trial court granted Discovery's motion and denied Endeavor's. In its order, the trial court held that (1) Endeavor's leases had terminated as to the disputed acreage, (2) Discovery's leases were valid, and (3) Discovery held record title to, ownership of, and the exclusive right to possession of the leasehold interests. The court of appeals affirmed, holding that Endeavor's leasehold interests survived only as to the acreage in the proration units it assigned to its wells in the plats it filed with the Commission.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6900262\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/448/169/#p178\">\n    448 S.W.3d 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 178 (Tex.

Like all mineral leases, Endeavor's leases memorialize the parties' contractual agreements. But unlike many other types of contracts, mineral leases are subject to\n   extensive governmental regulation. As a result, mineral leases often include particular types of terms and clauses through which the parties specify their respective rights in light of the regulatory context. Before addressing Endeavor's leases, we briefly describe the contractual nature of mineral leases, the regulatory context in which they exist, and the key terms they often include.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Thus, a \"habendum-only\" lease-under which the lessee's production on only a small portion may permit the lessee to retain its rights as to the entire leased tract-may conflict with the lessor's desire to seek full development given the operator's ability to hold the entire estate by drilling only a single producing well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anadarko\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9329509\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/94/550/#p554\">\n    94 S.W.3d at 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But an operator may prefer to postpone drilling and production until, for example, the market for the minerals produces a greater financial return. Continuous-development and retained-acreage clauses serve to balance the interests of the lessor and lessee in this respect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Continuous-development clauses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   A continuous-development clause \"permits a lease to be preserved under certain circumstances even though there is no production after the expiration of the primary term during\n   <em>\n    continuous\n   </em>\n   drilling operations, whether on the same or different wells.\" WILLIAMS &amp; MEYERS at \u00a7 617.

If the efforts cease at any moment after the primary term, the lease typically terminates immediately and automatically.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Retained-acreage clauses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Continuous-development clauses often work in tandem with other clauses, including retained-acreage clauses. While a\n   habendum clause generally extends the entire lease so long as some production is occurring on the lease, and a continuous-development clause further extends the entire lease so long as the operator remains engaged in the required development efforts, a retained-acreage clause typically divides the leased acreage such that production or development will preserve the lease only as to a specified portion of the leased acreage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3 WILLIAMS &amp; MEYERS at \u00a7 603.7. So if a lessor wants its entire leasehold acreage developed, it should include a retained acreage clause in its leases.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10185610,2246242\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/261/311/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Retained-acreage clauses come in many different shapes, sizes, and forms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The effect of a particular retained-acreage clause depends on the terms the parties freely chose and, like the Commission's implementation of special field rules, there is no \"one size fits all\" result of their proper construction. Each retained-acreage clause must be construed on its own, under governing principles of contract interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Although \"originally drafted to prevent the lessee from losing those portions of a lease that had productive wells located thereon if the rest of the lease terminated,\" retained-acreage clauses have expanded to \"include clauses that require the release of all acreage that, at the end of the primary term, is not within a drilling, spacing, or proration unit.\" Bruce M. Kramer,\n   <em>\n    Oil and Gas Leases and Pooling: A Look Back and a Peek Ahead\n   </em>\n   , 45 TEX. TECH L. REV. 877, 881 n.28 (2013). As a result, retained-acreage clauses often \"refer to [Commission] proration units as the lodestar for determining which acreage has been obtained and which acreage must be surrendered.\" WILLIAMS &amp; MEYERS at \u00a7 603.7. Defining the retained acreage by reference to a Commission designation like a proration unit can provide certainty or clarity regarding the extent of the acreage that remains under lease. But the inclusion of such regulatory principles in a retained-acreage clause may also cause confusion or disappointment, as the contracting parties may not fully understand the ramifications of including a regulatory term in the typical mineral lease.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ConocoPhillips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204638272\">\n    2015 WL 4638272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (\"[W]hen a lease ties the retained acreage clause to governmental authority, the parties may not 'fully anticipate the consequences of doing so.' \") (quoting Scott C.

Regulatory context\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Commission has promulgated field rules specific to the Spraberry Trend Area, and those rules have changed over time.

And since at least 1952, the Commission has required operators, \"for proration purposes,\" to \"file certified plats of their properties in the field, which plats show all those things pertinent to the determination of the acreage claimed for each well hereunder.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204638272\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Commission amended the Spraberry rules in 2008, clarifying the permissible size of standard proration units, and also adopting specific rules for the assignment of \"tolerance\" acreage:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   The acreage assigned to an individual well shall be known as a proration unit.

Under the retained-acreage clauses, these dates capture at a particular moment in time the amount of acreage Endeavor stood to retain upon the clauses' triggering event.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The retained-acreage clauses also specify the acreage excepted from termination. Specifically, the leases do not terminate as to all \"lands and depths located within a governmental proration unit assigned to a well producing oil or gas in paying quantities.\" The clauses provide further that each such proration unit must \"contain the number of acres required to comply with the applicable rules and regulations of the Railroad Commission of Texas for obtaining the maximum producing allowable for the particular well.\" Thus, Endeavor retained acreage consisting of the governmental proration unit \"assigned to\" each well, and any such unit must contain the amount of acreage required to comply with the applicable Commission rules for obtaining the \"maximum producing allowable\" for the particular well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The parties' dispute over the meaning of this clause focuses primarily on the phrases \"proration unit assigned to a well\" and \"maximum producing allowable for the particular well.\" When Endeavor filed its plats with the Commission, it assigned\n   81.21 acres as the proration unit for each of the wells in section 9 and 81.0 acres for each of the wells in section 4. But Endeavor contends that it retained rights to proration units of 160 acres for each well because the Commission rules allow for a maximum total of 160 acres including the tolerance acres, and that is the amount of acreage that would result in the \"maximum\" allowable under the Commission's rules. Like the trial court and the court of appeals, we disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    1. \"Proration unit assigned to a well\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Endeavor contends that the clauses' reference to a proration unit \"assigned to\" a well is ambiguous because it does not identify\n   <em>\n    whose\n   </em>\n   assignment controls. Specifically, Endeavor argues that, although we could reasonably construe the phrase to refer to the 81-acre proration units\n   <em>\n    Endeavor\n   </em>\n   \"assigned to\" the wells in the plats it filed with the Commission, we can also reasonably construe it to refer to the proration units\n   <em>\n    the Commission\n   </em>\n   has \"assigned to\" the wells through its special field rules. The court of appeals disagreed and held that the clause unambiguously refers to Endeavor's assignments because the Commission's rules required Endeavor, as the operator, to assign acreage to its proration units.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \"Deciding whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court.\"\n   <em>\n    N.

As the Commission has explained in its amicus brief in this case, if the operator's assignment of acreage complies with the rules, the Commission will input that acreage into a well-tracking system, and it becomes \"the lawfully assigned proration acreage for purposes of the [Commission's] records.\" The Commission then \"automatically generate[s] a maximum allowable for that particular well pursuant to\" the applicable proration formula.

Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9933163\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/553/223/#p227\">\n    553 S.W.2d 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 227 (Tex. Civ. App.-Amarillo 1977, writ ref'd n.r.e.), Endeavor's argument ignores the contractual nature of its leasehold interest and the regulatory context in which it exists. Although the Commission does not unilaterally determine title by approving or accepting an operator's assigned proration unit, the parties are free to agree that the operator's leasehold interest will survive and continue only to the extent of that assignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   That is exactly what the parties did here. The retained-acreage clauses that govern Endeavor's rights following the expiration of the leases' primary terms unambiguously provide that those rights extend only to a proration unit \"assigned to\" a well, and within this regulatory context that can only refer to the operator's assignment. The operator's assignment affects the operator's leasehold interest because Endeavor's contractual agreement, made within the context of the Commission's applicable rules, requires that result. Endeavor's leases designated the amount of retained acreage as the amount in the proration unit assigned to the wells per the Commission's rules. And consistent with the Commission's rules, Endeavor assigned a specific amount of acreage to the proration units for the wells at issue in this case by filing certified proration plats. We hold that under the leases' unambiguous language, those assignments govern the leasehold interests Endeavor retained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    2. \"Obtaining the maximum producing allowable\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Endeavor argues, however, that its retained acreage includes 160 acres per well because the leases provide that \"each [assigned] governmental proration unit\" must \"contain the number of acres required to comply with\" the Commission's rules for obtaining \"the maximum producing allowable for the particular well.\" Endeavor contends that, regardless of the meaning of the \"assigned to\" clause, the \"maximum producing allowable\" clause makes clear that Endeavor's retained proration units must consist of 160 acres, rather than the 81.21 and 81.0 acres it actually (but mistakenly) assigned to its wells.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   More specifically, Endeavor argues that the leases' references to \"maximum producing allowable\" means that each proration unit\n   <em>\n    automatically\n   </em>\n   consists of the greatest amount of acreage the Commission's rules permit an operator to assign, because that amount will result in the \"maximum producing allowable.\" As described\n   above, the Commission's special rules for the Spraberry Trend provide for a \"standard drilling and proration unit\" of 80 acres, but allow operators to \"elect to assign a tolerance of not more than\" 80 additional acres and thereby \"receive allowable credit for not more than\" 160 acres.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Endeavor, it retained 160 acres per well because that is the amount that would result in the \"maximum producing allowable\" under the Commission's rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Discovery, on the other hand, contends that the retained-acreage clauses require the operator to file a plat assigning\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   the amount of acreage\n   <em>\n    necessary\n   </em>\n   to obtain the maximum producing allowable as determined by the applicable field rules for the particular well at issue. According to Discovery, Endeavor required only 80 acres per well to obtain the maximum producing allowable for each of its wells. The court of appeals agreed with Discovery, holding that the parties intended this clause \"to define the amount of acres that Endeavor was to include in the governmental proration units that it assigned in its certified proration plats filed with the [Commission].\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6900262\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/448/169/#p178\">\n    448 S.W.3d at 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   We agree with Discovery. We construe the retained-acreage clauses as requiring Endeavor to include in its certified plats only \"the number of acres required to comply with the applicable rules and regulations of [Commission] for obtaining the maximum producing allowable for the particular well.\" If Endeavor's regulatory filings included an amount sufficient to obtain the maximum producing allowable, then that amount-however small it might be-would be excepted from termination under the retained-acreage clauses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Under the special field rules, the maximum producing allowable for Endeavor's wells depends in part on the amount of acreage it assigned to each well. Rule 4 provides that the maximum producing allowable for a well on an 80-acre proration unit is 515 barrels per day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the smallest amount of acreage that an operator can assign and remain in compliance with the applicable field rules is 80 acres, and the maximum producing allowable under that assignment is 515 barrels. If production exceeds that amount, this clause requires the operator to assign additional acreage-tolerance acreage-to each well if the operator desires to increase the maximum\n   production allowable for each well. Thus, if Endeavor included in its certified plats the minimum amount of acreage sufficient to comply with the Commission's rules for obtaining the maximum producing allowable for each of its wells, that is the amount it stood to retain upon the retained-acreage clauses' triggering event.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Endeavor assigned roughly 81 acres to each of its wells. It is undisputed, however, that Endeavor's wells could not achieve the maximum producing allowable for that amount of acreage under Rule 4. In fact, when this dispute arose, the Commission's hearings examiner acknowledged that \"the 81.0 acre allowables will allow the wells to produce an amount of oil far in excess of the amount of oil the wells are currently capable of producing.\" Thus, Endeavor assigned to each of its wells an amount of acreage that \"compl[ied] with the applicable rules and regulations of the [Commission] for obtaining the maximum producing allowable for the particular well.\" Having met the threshold requirement for compliance with the field rules, Endeavor retained exactly what it bargained for: approximately 81 acres per well. Under the leases' unambiguous language, all unassigned acreage reverted to the lessors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   To retain 160 acres per well, Endeavor needed to\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   assign 160 acres to each well. Rule 3 provides that Endeavor could have attempted to assign to each of its existing proration units an additional 80 acres of \"tolerance acreage.\" Although such an assignment would hypothetically raise each well's maximum producing allowable, when productive acreage is a component of the maximum producing allowable-as it is here-some authorities suggest that operators should \"verify[ ] that additional acreage is actually necessary or required to achieve the maximum allowable.\" Philip C.

Indeed, if a well \"is draining a certain amount of acreage, but the operator intends to claim more than that amount, the operator may open itself up to claims that it is not acting in good faith in purporting to retain a substantially greater amount of acreage.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6900262\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/448/169/#p178\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Petry at 4 (\"If the technical evidence clearly show that the well is draining eighty (80) acres, but the client operator is claiming three hundred twenty (320) acres under the maximum allowable, that client may open itself up to claims that it did not act in good faith in retaining the full 320 acres.\"). Of course, this question is not directly before us, as Endeavor did not assign\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   tolerance acreage to its proration units.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In summary, Endeavor's retained-acreage clauses provided that its leases would automatically terminate except for lands \"located within a governmental proration unit assigned to a well ... with each such governmental proration unit to contain the number of acres required to comply with the applicable rules and regulations of the [Commission] for obtaining the maximum producing allowable for the particular well.\" The applicable field rules required Endeavor to \"file with the Commission certified plats of their properties,\" and for those plats to \"set out distinctly all of those things pertinent to the determination of the acreage credit claimed for each well.\" Endeavor assigned 81-acre proration units to each of its producing wells, as depicted in the certified plats it filed with the Commission. Thus, at the clauses' triggering event-the end of each lease's continuous-development period-Endeavor retained only the acreage it had assigned to each well. That amount was 81 acres-not 160 acres. Consequently, Endeavor's leases terminated as to the acreage that Discovery's\n   leases cover, which Endeavor did not assign to a producing well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Other construction rules\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Endeavor argues that two additional rules of construction require the conclusion that it retained its lease as to 160 acres per well.

Forfeiture\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Endeavor contends that the court of appeals' construction of its leases' retained-acreage clauses violates the \"rule against forfeiture\" because it \"divest[ed] Endeavor of 320 acres of productive property, and did so without compensation.\" Although we have noted that \"[f]orfeitures are not favored in Texas, and contracts are construed to avoid them,\"\n   <em>\n    Fischer v.

This is precisely the type of clear and unequivocal language that imposes a special limitation on a lease. Here, the leases required Endeavor to either (1) continue\n   developing the tracts at issue, or (2) by the end of the continuous-development period, assign sufficient acreage to the wells' respective proration units to achieve the maximum producing allowable for those wells. Because Endeavor did not assign the undeveloped acreage to a proration unit, Endeavor's leases automatically terminated as to those lands. Lessees who agree to leases like those at issue here must meet \"the condition which they imposed upon themselves.... For their failure to do so they have only themselves to blame.\"\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   , 171 S.W.2d at 342.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Specifically, Endeavor notes that the leases' continuous-development clauses use the term \"proration unit\" to refer to a part of the lease \"even if it had no well.\" Yet Discovery construes \"assigned to,\" as used in the retained-acreage clause, to refer to the proration unit the operator assigns to a specific well. Endeavor contends that, because the term must bear the same meaning in both clauses, the term \"assigned\" as used in the retained-acreage clause must refer to what the Commission assigns, not what the operator assigns. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The continuous-development clauses provide that the leases will terminate \"as to each proration unit upon which there is no well or wells thereon located and then producing oil or gas in commercial quantities.\" We do not agree that this clause suggests that a proration unit can exist where \"there is no well.\" Rather, it refers to a proration unit upon which there is no well that is both (1) located on the proration unit, \"and\" (2) producing oil or gas in commercial quantities when the termination occurs. \" 'And' is a conjunction that means 'along with or together with.' \"\n   <em>\n    Harkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12135641\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/501/598/#p602\">\n    501 S.W.3d at 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    And\n   </em>\n   , WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 80 (2002)).
