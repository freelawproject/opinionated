The parties further disagree on which county-Galveston or Washington-may tax the compressors. We hold that the county has failed to rebut the presumed constitutionality of the statutes at issue and that Washington County is the taxable situs for the compressors. As the court of appeals held otherwise, we reverse its judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   EXLP Leasing, LLC, and EES Leasing, LLC (collectively, \"EXLP\") are wholly owned subsidiaries of Exterran Holdings, Inc. EXLP owns and leases out compressor stations used to deliver natural gas into pipelines. Some of these compressors are in use in Galveston County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The county traditionally taxed the compressors in its jurisdiction as business-personal property based on their full market value. But the legislature overrode that practice in 2012 when it added leased heavy equipment to a statutory formula used to appraise the value of heavy equipment held by dealers for sale. Act of May 21, 2011, 82d Leg., R.S., ch. 322,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20Tex.%20Gen.%20Laws%20938\">\n    2011 Tex. Gen. Laws 938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 938-41. Accordingly, state law now requires appraisal based on the lease revenue the compressors generated during the previous tax year divided by twelve.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. TAX CODE \u00a7 23.1241(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   EXLP contends the legislature intended to fix a problem that arose when the same equipment was leased multiple times within one year, with each lease counting as an individual sale for tax purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Briggs Equip. Tr. v. Harris Cty. Appraisal Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7301064\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/294/667/#p672\">\n    294 S.W.3d 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 672 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2009, pet. denied) (holding that \"successive leases\" cannot be \" 'subsequent sales' \" because \"they are not 'dealer-financed sales' \" as defined by the tax code). The new divide-revenue-by-twelve formula would simplify the appraisal process while providing an \"offsetting gain\" for the tax revenue lost to the fix.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fiscal Note, Tex. H.B. 2476, 82d Leg., R.S. (2011). But the county claims the anticipated offset\n   never materialized because lawmakers proceeded on the erroneous assumption that counties were not\n   <em>\n    already\n   </em>\n   taxing leased heavy equipment at full market value. As a result, a statutory change \"intended to produce a slight gain in tax revenue or remain neutral has actually resulted in a 97% loss in [compressor-based] tax revenue\" for Galveston County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   EXLP and the county are also at odds over\n   <em>\n    where\n   </em>\n   the compressors may be taxed in light of the 2012 tax-code amendments. After the amendments were enacted, EXLP took the position that its compressors in Galveston County are taxable only in Washington County, where EXLP maintains a business address and storage yard. The county disagreed. In a letter to all dealers with heavy equipment leased in its jurisdiction, the county announced it would appraise leased heavy equipment under the tax-code provision generally covering business-personal property,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   TEX. TAX CODE \u00a7 22.01, declaring that \"[r]ecent litigation has determined that the valuation of leased heavy equipment under Section 23.1241 of the Texas Property Tax Code is unconstitutional.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   EXLP sued for judicial review pursuant to tax code sections 42.10 and 42.21. Both sides moved for summary judgment. The county argued that: (1) the tax-code provisions at issue are unconstitutional as applied to EXLP's compressors in Galveston County; (2) EXLP's compressors are not actually \"heavy equipment\" under the tax code, and therefore the disputed statute is inapplicable; and (3) Galveston County is the taxable situs for the compressors at issue. EXLP urged the trial court to rule that: (1) the legislature validly exercised its power to prescribe a method for appraising the value of its compressors; (2) its compressors are \"heavy equipment\" as defined by the tax code; and (3) Washington County is the proper taxable situs. The trial court granted the county's motion in part, declaring that EXLP's compressors are heavy equipment under the tax code, but that tax code sections 23.1241 and 23.1242 are unconstitutional as applied to those compressors. The trial court also declared Galveston County the compressors' taxable situs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   EXLP appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court of appeals reversed in part, holding that \"[n]either side produced summary[-]judgment evidence demonstrating, as a matter of law, that the method of appraising compression unit rental inventories embodied in sections 23.1241 and 23.1242 of the Tax Code is either a reasonable or unreasonable method of calculating their reasonable market value.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6835174\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/475/421/#p428\">\n    475 S.W.3d 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 428 (Tex.

Still, none of these cases turned on whether \"value\" in article VIII, section 1(b), means \"market value.\" Nor did any examine the constitutional text as part of resolving a dispute about that text.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Two cases on which the county relies involved disparate local taxation.

EXLP, on the other hand, directs us to our holding that the legislature \"may constitutionally draw distinctions in the manner in which market value of property is determined for ad valorem purposes, so long as the classifications are not unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10022761\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/922/931/#p934\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10022761\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/922/931/#p934\">\n    at 936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The legislature's 2012 tax-code amendments, EXLP argues, provide that taxes should be paid in the county where it conducts business-Washington County-based on the revenue generated by its inventory as a whole and regardless of the physical location of individual leased units.

Section 21.02, the county argues, speaks definitively and provides for limited exceptions to its applicability, none of which apply here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   EXLP's situs argument, on the other hand, is based entirely on chapter 23, which is titled \"Appraisal Methods and Procedures\" and includes the previously discussed provisions addressing taxation of heavy equipment held by dealers for sale or lease. Sections 23.1241 and 23.1242 do not specifically mention taxable situs. But EXLP contends a process for inventory reporting and prepayment of taxes on a dealer's entire inventory to a single county establishes a scheme that supplants the default rules found in chapter 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In considering the implications of sections 23.1241 and 23.1242 for taxable situs of dealer-held heavy equipment, we \"consider the statute[s] as a whole and construe [them] in a manner which harmonizes all of [their] various provisions.\"\n   <em>\n    Lamar Homes, Inc. v.

Chapter 21 addresses taxable situs by name; sections 23.1241 and 23.1242 do not. But the omission of \"taxable situs\" as a term of art in those sections does not mean they say nothing on the subject. If, instead, they\n   create a statutory framework specific to dealer-held heavy equipment that assumes or necessitates a taxable-situs rule different from section 21.02, we may ascertain legislative intent for a rule specific to the circumstances at hand that overcomes the general situs rules separately found in chapter 21. In that case, \"the specific provision will ordinarily prevail unless the general provision is the later enactment and the manifest intent is that the general provision prevail.\"\n   <em>\n    Harris Cty.

This framework, which we explain in greater detail below, cannot function if chapter 21's provisions still determine taxable situs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The framework for valuation of dealer-held heavy equipment established in section 23.1241 ignores the physical location of any particular unit of inventory on any particular date. Instead, section 23.1241(b) provides that the value of a dealer's heavy-equipment inventory is determined by the annual income generated by the inventory as a whole, rather than the income from each individual unit of equipment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. TAX CODE \u00a7 23.1241(b) (\"For the purpose of the computation of property tax, the market value of a dealer's heavy equipment\n   <em>\n    inventory\n   </em>\n   on January 1 is the total annual sales [defined elsewhere to include lease revenue] ... for the 12-month period corresponding to the preceding tax year, divided by 12.\" (emphasis added)). A \"[d]ealer's heavy equipment inventory\" is statutorily defined as \"\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   items of heavy equipment that a dealer holds for sale, lease, or rent\n   <em>\n    in this state\n   </em>\n   during a 12-month period.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12381297\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/519/113/#p122\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 23.1241(a)(2) (emphasis added).

The revenue generated by individual units, wherever they may be, is relevant only in that it produces part of the data fed into the valuation formula that produces an aggregate taxable valuation on \"all items of heavy equipment ... in this state.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12381297\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/519/113/#p122\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 23.1241(a)(2). Section 23.1241 includes no process for tracking individual units or documenting the revenue they produce while located in any given county on any particular date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Section 23.1241 further requires dealers to value their inventory and file an annual declaration \"with the chief appraiser\" and \"collector\" containing \"a statement that the declarant is the owner of a dealer's heavy equipment\" and stating \"the market value of the declarant's heavy equipment inventory for the current tax year as computed under [ section 23.1241(b) ].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12381297\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/519/113/#p122\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 23.1241(f)(2)-(3). The dealer's annual declaration is a precursor to the statutorily required monthly prepayment of anticipated property taxes due on that inventory to the local taxing jurisdictions. This process is outlined in section 23.1242, titled \"Prepayment of Taxes by Heavy Equipment Dealers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The process for prepayment of taxes indicates legislative intent to fix the tax situs for heavy equipment at the business location where the dealer maintains its inventory, not the myriad locations where units of the inventory are physically present at any given time. Dealers are required to file an annual heavy-equipment\n   inventory form promulgated by the comptroller, which must contain: (1) \"the name and business address of each location at which the declarant conducts business\" (not each location where a unit of heavy equipment was located on January 1); (2) \"a statement that the declarant is the owner of a dealer's heavy equipment inventory\"; and (3) \"the market value of the declarant's heavy equipment inventory for the current tax year as computed under Subsection (b).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12381297\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/519/113/#p122\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 23.1241(f). Then the dealer must file with \"the collector\" monthly heavy-equipment inventory tax statements indicating the \"unit property tax\" of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   items sold or leased the preceding month and, \"together with the statement,\" must \"deposit with the collector an amount equal to the total of unit property tax assigned to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   items of heavy equipment sold, leased, or rented from the dealer's heavy equipment inventory in the preceding month to which a unit property tax was assigned.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12381297\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/519/113/#p122\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 23.1242(b) (emphasis added). Those funds are held in escrow.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12381297\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/519/113/#p122\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 23.1242(c). At the end of the year, after tax rates are finalized, the taxing unit prepares the annual tax bill, toward which prepayments held in escrow are applied.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12381297\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/519/113/#p122\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 23.1242(h). This tax-prepayment system centers on the \"unit property tax,\" which is calculated by multiplying the payments received for\n   <em>\n    each\n   </em>\n   unit by the \"unit property tax factor,\" calculated as the \"tax rate\n   <em>\n    at the location where a dealer's heavy equipment inventory\n   </em>\n   is located on January 1\"-not the different tax rates at the various locations where each individual unit of the dealer's inventory is located on January 1.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12381297\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/519/113/#p122\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 23.1242(a)(4) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The county's position would require EXLP to initiate this process in every county in which any piece of its leased equipment is located long enough to be taxed under section 21.02. But the procedure explained above is incompatible with that approach-it plainly calls for prepayments based on the monthly revenue generated by a dealer's\n   <em>\n    entire\n   </em>\n   inventory, regardless of the physical location of individual units. Under section 21.02, however, physical location is nearly all that matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   It necessarily follows that those prepayments-and the dealer's ultimate tax liability-can be made and incurred in only one county. Otherwise, dealers would face double or greater taxation when paying taxes on an entire inventory in every county where a unit of property is located. And application of the default situs provision would lead to exactly that result. Because it considers the location of individual units of inventory rather than the revenue generated by the inventory as a whole, dealers would be subject to taxation in each county where a unit of their inventory was located \"on January 1 for more than a temporary period.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12381297\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/519/113/#p122\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 21.02(a)(1). This piecemeal approach to valuing and taxing heavy-equipment inventories is inconsistent with the comprehensive methodology contained in sections 23.1241 and 23.1242, which look to inventory-wide revenue regardless of location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   A county seeking to tax\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   EXLP's compressors in its jurisdiction faces a statutory impossibility: it must rely on section 21.02 to establish taxable situs within its jurisdiction but cannot apply the exclusive procedure for taxing dealer-owned heavy equipment without valuing and taxing the dealer's entire inventory. If a county seeks to tax discrete units in its jurisdiction under section 21.02, it must ignore sections 23.1241 and 23.1242 altogether. And Galveston County chose exactly this when it effectively decided to ignore the legislature's 2012 tax-code amendments and continue taxing EXLP's compressors in its jurisdiction based on their full market value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Conversely, a dealer could not pay taxes on individual units of leased equipment to the counties in which the equipment resides on January 1 and simultaneously follow the process for valuing and making prepayments on its entire inventory as mandated by sections 23.1241 and 23.1242. If a dealer were required to pay taxes on, say, one compressor located in any given county to that county, the procedure specified in sections 23.1241 and 23.1242 would require the dealer to file a declaration of its\n   <em>\n    entire\n   </em>\n   inventory in that county and make monthly tax prepayments based on the revenue produced by that inventory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is obviously not a process that can be followed more than once, in a single county, every tax year. It would be neither sensible nor workable to send prepayments and monthly statements to each of the various counties in which a unit is located-which may not always be possible when dealers do not know where leased equipment is at all times-rather than to a single county where a dealer's entire inventory is based.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   We hold section 21.02 does not control the taxable situs of property covered by section 23.1242. Although section 21.02(a) does not include an exception to its applicability for leased heavy-equipment inventory, it nonetheless cannot be applied while giving effect to the valuation and prepayment framework created by sections 23.1241 and 23.1242. But both statutes can be given full effect if section 21.02(a) is seen for what it is-a default rule determining taxable situs for tangible personal property generally-and if sections 23.1241 and 23.1242 are read to create a comprehensive statutory scheme containing its own taxable-situs rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The county sought summary judgment that, based on section 21.02, Galveston County is the taxable situs of EXLP's compressors located there. It makes no alternative argument that, pursuant to sections 23.1241 and 23.1242, EXLP was obligated to file a declaration of its inventory in Galveston County,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12381297\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/519/113/#p122\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 23.1241(f), pre-pay taxes on that inventory,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12381297\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/519/113/#p122\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 23.1242(b), and ultimately be liable to Galveston County for the taxable value of its inventory,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12381297\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/519/113/#p122\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 23.1242(b). We are left with no basis to conclude, as a matter of law, that Galveston County is the taxable situs for EXLP's inventory or for any units located in Galveston County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The question, then, is whether EXLP should have been granted summary judgment that its compressors located in Galveston County are properly taxable in Washington County. Sections 23.1241 and 23.1242 are clear that taxes should be paid based on inventory-wide revenue, and EXLP argues it should make payment in the county where it \"conducts business.\" According to affidavit testimony from an EXLP regional vice president, the compressors located in Galveston County are part of EXLP's \"Gulf Coast Region fleet.\" As such, they are \"assigned\" to EXLP's \"business location and storage yard in Washington County,\" which is used to \"manage the inventory of compressors in the Gulf Coast region.\" At this location, EXLP \"maintains offices open to the public, stores the equipment in the yard when\n   not in use, services and repairs the equipment, stores and sells replacement parts, maintains its records, coordinates its field service and logistics, and employs service personnel.\" So although individual units of EXLP's inventory may be anywhere on January 1, its\n   <em>\n    inventory\n   </em>\n   is based and maintained in Washington County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Importantly, Galveston County does not argue Washington County should not be EXLP's taxable situs if the statutory framework described above is accepted. It did not present controverting evidence that EXLP's Washington County yard is not where the leased compressors located in Galveston County are maintained, serviced, and overseen. But EXLP offered summary-judgment evidence that its Washington County business location is such a facility-the compressors at issue here are \"assigned to\" the Washington County storage yard, which \"manages the inventory of compressors in the Gulf Coast region.\" We conclude EXLP met its summary-judgment burden to conclusively establish Washington County as the proper taxable situs for its inventory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The county goes to great lengths to argue the impropriety of both the valuation scheme and situs implications found in 23.1241 and 23.1242. It paints a dire picture of lost tax revenue. And it insists the compressors at issue are massive installations that remain fixed in place for years and should not be treated the same as a truly transitory inventory of bulldozers or backhoes. But even if this were all true, it does not cure our inability to pass judgment on the wisdom of the legislature's chosen tax policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The legislature is \"free to adopt the mode of ascertaining the value of any class of property by such method as it might deem best,\"\n   <em>\n    Shannon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20S.W.%20138\">\n    100 S.W. at 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and its statutory scheme sets situs in the county where the dealer does business. If the legislature's chosen taxation scheme produces undesirable results unforeseen by the legislature, the remedy lies in modifying the law through the legislative process. We reverse the court of appeals and render judgment against Galveston County on both issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Justice Guzman did not participate in the decision.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    The county did not contest the trial court's declaration that the compressors are \"heavy equipment\" under tax code section 23.1241(a)(6).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    The county also argues the classification here violates the equal-and-uniform provision-an argument we address later.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    The court of appeals treated the county's argument as the county labeled it-an as-applied constitutional challenge. But the claim here is facial; it attacks every application of the statute because the statute clearly does not even attempt to approximate market value under any set of circumstances. The county reveals its true position on the statute by its decision to categorically refuse to apply it as to\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    dealers doing business in its jurisdiction.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Under section 23.1242(b), monthly prepayments must consist of \"the total of unit property tax assigned to all items of heavy equipment sold, leased, or rented from the dealer's heavy equipment inventory in the preceding month.\" Pursuant to that subsection, this \"unit property tax\" is determined by multiplying the sales price or rental payment received for each unit by the \"unit property tax factor,\" which, under section 23.1242(a)(4), is calculated based on the preceding year's ad valorem tax rate \"at the location where a dealer's heavy equipment inventory\"-not each individual unit-is located on January 1 of the current tax year.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
