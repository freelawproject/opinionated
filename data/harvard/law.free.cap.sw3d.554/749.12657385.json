INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this appeal, we construe Texas Tax Code section 23.23(c), to determine the first tax year that section 23.23 's 10% limitation on an increase to the appraised value of a residence homestead (10% Homestead Cap) may apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2023.23\">\n    Tex. Tax Code Ann. \u00a7 23.23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (West 2015). The plain language of section 23.23(c) dictates that the 10% Homestead Cap cannot apply until\n   the tax year following the first tax year that a property qualified for a Homestead Exemption under section 11.13.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2023.23\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 11.13(a)-(b) (West Supp. 2017). Because Appellee Richard Scott Gladden's residence first qualified for a Homestead Exemption in the 2013 tax year, the first tax year after that-the 2014 tax year-was the first tax year that the 10% Homestead Cap applied to Gladden's residence; we therefore will reverse the trial court's declaratory judgment for Gladden, will render a judgment declaring that 2014 is the first tax year to which the 10% Homestead Cap applies to Gladden's residence, and will remand this case to the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In May 2012, Gladden purchased a house in Denton, Texas (the Property), for $310,000 and began occupying the Property as his principal residence. The appraised value of the Property was recorded by Appellant Denton County Appraisal District (DCAD) for the 2012 tax year as $203,595. DCAD increased the appraised value of the Property for the 2013 tax year to $312,352. In April 2013, Gladden applied for the general residence homestead exemption (Homestead Exemption) located in section 11.13 of the tax code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2023.23\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 11.13. DCAD applied Gladden's claimed Homestead Exemption to the Property for the 2013 tax year but refused to apply the 10% Homestead Cap to the 2013 tax year. DCAD claimed that the \"10% Homestead Cap\" located in section 23.23 of the tax code would be applied on January 1, 2014, to the 2014 tax year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2023.23\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 23.23(a), (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Gladden filed a protest of DCAD's decision not to apply the 10% Homestead Cap for the 2013 tax year, and the Denton County Appraisal Review Board (ARB) conducted a hearing. After the hearing, the ARB overruled Gladden's objections, and ARB secretary John Greenslade issued a notice of final order concluding that the records and appraisal of DCAD were \"correct.\" Gladden filed the present declaratory judgment action, challenging the ARB's order denying his protest concerning which tax year the 10% Homestead Cap first applied to the Property.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2023.23\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 42.21 (West 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ultimately, the trial court ruled on the parties' competing motions for summary judgment. The trial court denied DCAD's partial motion to dismiss and motions for summary judgment and in a separate order granted Gladden's cross-motion for summary judgment. The trial court's order declared that \"the limitation imposed by [s]ection 23.23(a) of the Texas Tax Code 'took effect' and applied\" to the Property on January 1, 2013, and, consequently, imposed a mandatory injunction ordering DCAD to correct the appraisal roll and other records to \"reflect the final determination of the Court regarding the 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016[,] and 2017 tax years.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   DCAD raises two issues that are dispositive of this appeal, both challenging the trial court's declaration that the 10% Homestead Cap first applied to the Property in the 2013 tax year.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
