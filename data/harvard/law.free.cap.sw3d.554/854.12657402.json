Kelly was also indicted for second-degree fleeing or evading and being a persistent felony offender (PFO), second degree. The case ultimately went to trial in March 2017 and the jury convicted Kelly of first-degree rape, incest, first-degree sexual abuse, and second-degree fleeing or evading. At the penalty phase, the jury also found Kelly was a second-degree PFO. The jury recommended 50 years for rape, 50 years for incest, 10 years for sexual abuse, and 6 months for fleeing or evading. The jury recommended a consecutive sentence for a total of 110 years and 6 months. The court, however, capped the sentence at 70 years, pursuant to statute. Kelly now appeals as a matter of right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In April 2013, J.K. was living with her great-uncle. On or about April 6, 2013, Kelly came to the bathroom window of the home and asked J.K. to shave her vaginal area and meet him elsewhere. J.K., knowing she was not supposed to leave the home, snuck out of the house and met Kelly. They spent several days at a campsite and a yellow house, where Kelly was staying. At a certain point at the yellow house, J.K. stated that Kelly started kissing her and touching her vagina over her clothes. Kelly then removed her clothing, held her down, and forcibly raped her. He completed the act by ejaculating on J.K.'s stomach. J.K. stated that she waited until Kelly fell asleep and then left the house. She went to her boyfriend's home and hid under a truck because she knew her boyfriend's parents did not like her. The parents did find her, however, and contacted authorities. J.K. was taken to the hospital and a rape kit was performed. The samples were sent to the Kentucky State Police Lab and it was ultimately determined that a sample of semen found on J.K.'s stomach matched Kelly's DNA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Kelly was indicted by a Knox County Grand Jury on July 25, 2014 and the court issued a bench warrant for Kelly's arrest. The case remained on the court's docket while this warrant was pending. On December 15, 2014, the Commonwealth requested that the case be placed on the \"fugitive docket\" as the case had been pending for several months and Kelly had yet to be arrested on the warrant. The court ordered it so and entered a written order, dismissing the case without prejudice and stating that \"upon the arrest of the defendant, the indictment may be reinstated and redocketed on motion of the Commonwealth.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Kelly was found in Washington and extradited back to Kentucky in late 2015. He was arraigned before the trial court on October 2, 2015. At that time, the Commonwealth moved the court to reinstate the indictment. The court sustained the motion, without objection from Kelly or his counsel. It is undisputed that there was never a new indictment presented. Nor is it alleged, however, that the charges presented at trial were different from the\n   charges in the dismissed and reinstated indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As previously stated, the case proceeded to trial. The jury found Kelly guilty of rape first-degree, incest, sexual abuse first-degree, fleeing or evading second-degree, and being a PFO, second-degree. The court sentenced Kelly to 70 years imprisonment. On appeal, Kelly alleges five errors: (1) the indictment against Kelly was dismissed and prosecution absent a new indictment violated Kelly's due process rights; (2) there was no evidence to sustain Kelly's conviction for second-degree fleeing or evading; (3) the trial court should have granted a mistrial for the deliberate introduction of Kentucky Rule of Evidence (KRE) 404(b) testimony; (4) the rape, incest, and sexual abuse convictions were non-unanimous; and (5) the trial court improperly imposed a fine upon Kelly, who was indigent. We shall address each of these errors and discuss additional facts as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. ALTHOUGH THE COMMONWEALTH ERRED IN FAILING TO RE-PRESENT THE CASE TO THE GRAND JURY, KELLY'S DUE PROCESS RIGHTS WERE NOT VIOLATED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Kelly first argues that the indictment against him was dismissed and he was never re-indicted, thus his due process rights were violated\n   <em>\n    per se.\n   </em>\n   This allegation requires several nuanced issues to be addressed by this Court. First, we must determine whether the procedural singularity here of reinstating an indictment is proper. Second, if it is not proper, we must determine whether that affects the jurisdiction of the trial court. Finally, we must determine whether Kelly's due process rights were actually violated through a potentially flawed procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    1) The Commonwealth and the trial court erred in simply reinstating the indictment, rather than re-indicting Kelly.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

The prosecution must seek another indictment or warrant just as in any original prosecution. The order of dismissal, even though it is without prejudice, cannot simply be undone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This Court understands that the intent of the parties was simply to unclog the court's docket and put aside this particular case until Kelly was arrested on the outstanding warrant. It seems the trial court's intention was to revert to the pre-procedural rules days when indictments could simply be \"filed away\" from the court's docket. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Jones v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   71 S.W.643, 643 (Ky. 1903), the Commonwealth, being unprepared for trial, moved to have the indictment \"filed away, with leave to redocket upon motion of the commonwealth's attorney.\" The motion was granted.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=131%20S.W.%20391\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"The practice of filing away indictments, though never authorized by legislative enactment, has long obtained in this state.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=131%20S.W.%20391\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In that case, the order \"filing away\" was construed as not being a dismissal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 644. \"But here the right to reinstate the case on the docket being expressly reserved, the order, we think, should not be construed as a dismissal or discontinuance, but as a mere removal or omission of the case upon the docket.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Given this construction, \"[t]he legal effect of such an order was simply a continuance indefinitely[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Jones,\n   </em>\n   however, the case was \"filed away\" against the objection of defendant and deemed an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Despite this past practice, along with the development of our rules of civil and criminal procedure, our administrative court system has delineated a system for handling fugitive cases so as to prevent a court's docket from being hampered by numerous cases without any progression. These cases can be closed administratively in our case management system and reopened administratively upon service of a warrant. Trial courts and the Commonwealth are bound by the rules of procedure. The rules are unequivocal that an indictment is required, although subject to waiver, for a felony prosecution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ky. Const. 12 and\n   <em>\n    Malone v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11176158\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/30/180/\">\n    30 S.W.3d 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ky. 2000). It is questionable whether the trial court was in error in allowing the reinstatement of the indictment or in terming the 'filing away' of the indictment as a dismissal. Under these pre-rule cases, such a \"filing away\" with reservation for reinstatement, has been deemed a non-final and non-dismissive order. In either context, the procedure utilized by the trial court was error. Thus, this Court holds that reinstatement of an indictment is procedurally impermissible. Additionally, it is important to remember that there are administrative processes for handling fugitive cases and it is best practice to follow these procedures. We cannot say that such procedural infirmities would\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   create reversible error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    2) The trial court still retained subject-matter jurisdiction over Kelly's case\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    and Kelly waived particular-case jurisdiction.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Because reinstatement of the indictment was procedurally infirm, and because we cannot fully determine whether this order was, in effect, a dismissal or a \"filing away,\" we are forced to determine whether the trial court even had jurisdiction to hear Kelly's case. Both\n   <em>\n    Sowell\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   state that ten days after the final order of dismissal, the trial court loses jurisdiction over the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sowell,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9181878\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/157/616/#p617\">\n    157 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   619 and\n   <em>\n    Smith,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=131%20S.W.%20391\">\n    131 S.W. at 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This mechanism is pursuant to CR 59, which states that a motion altering, amending, or vacating a judgment must be served no more than ten days after entry of the final judgment. However, this loss of jurisdiction refers to particular-case jurisdiction, rather than subject-matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"Whether a court has subject-matter jurisdiction is determined at the beginning of a case, based on the type of case presented.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

He was appointed a public defender. The Commonwealth stated that the case had been dismissed due to Kelly's fugitive status, and \"move[d] to reinstate\" the indictment. The trial court sustained the motion. Defense counsel\n   <em>\n    did not\n   </em>\n   object nor raise any potential issues with this reinstatement. Additionally, Kelly did not raise the jurisdictional issue until appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Kelly waived any issue relating to particular-case jurisdiction. This is not to say that the trial court did not err. Reinstatement of an indictment is not the proper procedure. Had Kelly brought this issue to the trial court's attention, and the trial court determined its original order was a dismissal, Kelly would have been entitled to dismissal. The prosecution would have been forced to re-indict Kelly. However, this Court will not allow Kelly to ignore an issue, fail to bring the situation to light until\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   a conviction, and then succeed in obtaining a\n   <em>\n    dismissal\n   </em>\n   of his case on a purely procedural technicality.

Kelly had over a year from the date of his arraignment to his trial date. He presented a robust defense, including his own testimony as to the events in this case. There is no allegation that he was not presented with sufficient information in the indictment, only that the indictment was procedurally insufficient. However, we choose not to infer prejudice from such a defect.

The particular questioning on direct, after J.K. had described the rape in detail, was:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Commonwealth (CW): Did this just happen that one time?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   J.K.: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   CW: Did it happen more than once?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   J.K.: On this night, no.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   CW: But it happened again on another night?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   J.K.: It happened several times before.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   At this point, defense counsel objected and the attorneys went to the bench. There was some disagreement at the bench as to whether this \"several times\" referred to prior incidents further removed in the past or to incidents that had occurred over this specific period of days at the campsite and the yellow house. Defense counsel specifically stated that J.K.'s statement had been so soft that she believed an admonition would draw more attention to the statement. The Commonwealth stated he could be more direct to limit the testimony to this particular incident. The judge did sustain the motion and stated KRE 404(b) evidence had been excluded. At no time did defense counsel request a mistrial. The questioning then continued.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   CW: Let me clarify. I don't think I understood what you said.

He did not request an admonition to the jury. In fact, defense counsel specifically spoke\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   the judge giving an admonition. Therefore, at most this issue merits palpable error review pursuant to RCr 10.26. With that framework, we cannot hold that any error here negatively affected Kelly's \"substantial rights.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RCr 10.26. First, the trial court made no written order regarding any KRE 404(b) evidence. Thus, it is unclear to this Court the specific boundaries of any order made by the trial court. Second, the statements here are confusing at most. J.K. stated it happened several times, but then stated it happened once, and then stated she did not remember how many times it happened. If anything, it supported the defense's cross-examination in reference to J.K.'s credibility. Even if the statements were admitted in error, with the brief and soft-spoken statement, an admonition would have been sufficient to cure any potential prejudice. Kelly's substantial rights under RCr 10.26 were not affected here.

THE VERDICTS ARE UNANIMOUS.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Kelly also alleges that his verdicts for rape, incest, and sexual abuse were not unanimous. His argument stems from more recent case law, holding that testimony of multiple incidents that fit the definition of the jury instruction, even when only one count is charged, violates a defendant's right to a unanimous verdict. The Court has held \"that such a scenario-a general jury verdict based on an instruction including two or more separate instances of a criminal offense, whether explicitly stated in the instruction or based on the proof-violates the requirement of a unanimous verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Kelly concedes the issue is unpreserved and requests palpable error review under RCr 10.26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The gist of Kelly's argument is that the proof presented at trial proved more than one incident of rape, incest, and sexual abuse. As such, it is unclear that the jury agreed as to the same incident of rape, incest, and sexual abuse. However, even given the majority of the Court's more recent, and stricter, analysis of unanimity, Kelly's argument is illusory. The evidence Kelly points to that allegedly \"proved\" more than one incident was within J.K.'s testimony and Deputy Hensley's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   As stated previously, J.K. made one statement about some kind of abuse happening \"several times.\" However, she made no specific statements about\n   <em>\n    any other\n   </em>\n   incidents. It was not even clear that she remained consistent that it happened more than once. J.K. spoke in gruesome detail about the particular incident of rape on the night of April 8. She gave intimate details about the ordeal. Her testimony did not speak of any other incidents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Deputy Hensley was one of the responding officers. He spoke with J.K. in some detail about what had occurred. As he started testifying, he spoke about some of J.K.'s statements to him at that time. The judge actually called the attorneys to the bench to address the issue of J.K.'s statements\n   coming in through the officer. Defense counsel specifically stated that she wanted\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of J.K.'s statements to come in. The defense's theory was that J.K. was not credible because her story was inconsistent. Thus, they elicited J.K.'s statements to Deputy Hensley to show these inconsistencies. As a result of this strategy, Deputy Hensley made two statements about multiple incidents. On direct examination, he stated that J.K. had told him that Kelly had engaged in \"sexual contact\" with her at the campsite \"multiple times.\" On cross, defense counsel asked Deputy Hensley if J.K. had told him about any \"inappropriate contact\" at the campsite.

In the line of cases mandating reversal, the victims usually testified in great detail about ongoing courses of conduct or multiple incidents. There was testimony about multiple, specific incidents from which jurors could find guilt. Here, at most are a couple of fleeting statements about amorphous, unspecified prior incidents. J.K.'s testimony hardly rises to the level of giving specific information about any other incidents. The most information was from Deputy Hensley, and it was all based on hearsay testimony. Given these brief, fleeting statements, it would be wholly unreasonable for a juror to find one of these vague incidents amounted to proof beyond a reasonable doubt when J.K. spoke of one particular incident in detail. This case does not even rise to the level of\n   <em>\n    Travis,\n   </em>\n   because it was only testimony that led to a potentially erroneous theory rather than an actual instruction to the jury. There was no reason for any juror to convict Kelly of rape, incest, or sexual abuse based on the vague surplus statements in question. As such, unanimity of the jury verdict is preserved. As Justice Hughes stated in her concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Travis:\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   The real threat to fairness, integrity and public opinion of these particular proceedings would come from overturning a verdict, where the instructions were sufficiently specific and the evidence was sufficient for conviction, based on a unanimous verdict theory that requires us to assume wholly implausible, if not completely irrational, behavior on the part of a juror or jurors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7321648\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/327/456/#p463\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7321648\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/327/456/#p463\">\n    at 468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Hughes, J., concurring in result only).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   We also must acknowledge that any error here, was, to a certain extent, invited error. \"Generally, a party is estopped from asserting an invited error on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Quisenberry v.

This Court has even determined that a statement violating a defendant's\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights admitted at trial can be determined to be invited error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clay v.

Aug. 21, 2014). Here, defense counsel admitted it was strategy to elicit as many of J.K.'s statements as she could through Deputy Hensley's testimony. The fact that some of those statements may have led to prior incidents being vaguely referenced was an invited error. As such, we will not find reversible error here. The statements in question were too attenuated for a reasonable juror to rely upon them in finding guilt and the statements were, in all likelihood, elicited as invited error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    E. THE COMMONWEALTH CONCEDES THAT THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN IMPOSING A FINE ON AN INDIGENT DEFENDANT.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Commonwealth has also conceded the fine imposed upon Kelly was impermissible. Kelly had been found to be indigent and, as such, a fine could not be imposed under KRS 534.040(4). Therefore, we shall vacate that portion of the trial court's order imposing a fine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
