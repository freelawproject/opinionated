The State Habeas Corpus Application and Writ Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On November 4, 2015, the State timely moved for a new trial under trial court cause number 786224, which the state judge for the retrial granted on the record. On August 17, 2016, the state court granted the State's motions to transfer its prior filings to new cause numbers, noting that the original indictment under trial court cause number 786224 had been reindicted into two separate trial court cause numbers, 1520246 (anal sodomy) and 1520247 (oral sodomy), after the grand jury had indicted Leachman on two separate counts of aggravated sexual assault of a child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 30, 2016, Leachman filed a pro se pretrial habeas corpus application in the trial court, which was assigned to the underlying trial court cause number 1522187. Leachman asserted that, while the State may seek a new indictment on the same offense, the superseding indictment must mirror the initial charge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Legrand\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7299256\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/291/31/#p38\">\n    291 S.W.3d 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 38-39 (Tex.

He claimed that the State was attempting to turn the single charge into two separate charges, two convictions, and two sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On September 28, 2016, the habeas judge, who did not preside over Leachman's original trial, held a non-evidentiary writ hearing on Leachman's pro se habeas application in which both sides presented argument, but no witnesses. Leachman repeated his argument that the State was trying to take the same offense and split it into multiple offenses, thereby violating the multiple-punishment aspect of the double jeopardy clause. The State responded that it intended to withdraw its motion to consolidate and would proceed to trial only on the first trial court cause number 1520246. The prosecutor stated that he\n   intended to file an amended motion to cumulate sentences, seeking only to stack any sentence on the existing 20-year sentence Leachman was still serving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At the end of the writ hearing, the habeas court orally denied Leachman's writ. The habeas court noted that if the State's \"intent is to proceed on one of the two new indictments, as opposed to both,\" that \"take[s] care[ ] of any potential issues, so I am going to deny your writ of habeas corpus.\" Later that day, the habeas court signed a judgment denying Leachman's pretrial habeas corpus application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Proceedings in this Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On September 28, 2016, Leachman timely filed a pro se notice of appeal from the habeas court's denial of his pretrial habeas application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. APP. P. 26.2(a)(1), 31.1. On October 24, 2016, in compliance with a request from the Clerk of this Court, the trial court certified Leachman's right of appeal of the denial of his pretrial habeas application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   25.2(a)(2), (d). In compliance with a second request, the district clerk also filed a second supplemental clerk's record in this Court on October 26, 2016. This record contains the State's amended motion to cumulate sentences, which was filed only in the first charge 1520246, and the docket sheet for the second charge 1520247, showing that no such motion was filed there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This Court abated this case several times for the habeas court to hold a hearing to determine whether the State intended to dismiss the second charge, as it appeared to have stated at the writ hearing. This Court's February 15, 2018 Order reinstated this case after the district clerk filed a compliant supplemental clerk's record. This record included the habeas court's findings of fact and conclusions of law and order, signed on February 8, 2018, arising from the abatement hearing. The State clarified that it intended to proceed to trial first on the first charge, but did not intend to dismiss the second or other charges, pending the outcome of the first trial. The habeas court found that the State never stated that it had intended to dismiss the second charge at the writ hearing, and that it does not intend to dismiss the second charge now. This Court's Order also requested briefing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. APP. P. 31.1. Both Leachman and the State have filed briefs, and Leachman has filed a reply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Leachman also filed an advisory in this Court, attaching an \"Advisory to the Court and Motion to Re-Open Proceedings\" that he filed in the federal habeas court. Leachman argued that the federal court should re-open the habeas petition because the state trial court's grant of a new trial was void, asserting that only the Court of Criminal Appeals may do so under art. 11.07. Leachman further claimed that he intended to raise these issues before the Court of Criminal Appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Leachman then filed a motion for judicial notice in this Court on April 20, 2018, contending that this Court must take judicial notice of the federal habeas court order, signed on February 8, 2018, regarding his motion to re-open proceedings. Leachman requests that this Court take judicial notice of the federal court order for his\n   propositions that: (1) the federal district court did not view its earlier, conditional order granting federal habeas relief as voiding the state conviction, and (2) the question of whether the state trial court's new-trial order was void was a matter for the state courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the February 8, 2018 federal court order, the federal district court held that the State had complied with its earlier order granting habeas relief and ordering Leachman's release unless the State moved to grant him a new trial within 90 days. The federal district court also noted that it lacked jurisdiction over Leachman's retrial, but that Leachman \"may move in state court to dismiss the indictment for lack of jurisdiction,\" and \"[i]f he is again convicted, then he may challenge defects in the proceeding through a direct appeal and, if necessary, postconviction proceedings pertaining to that conviction.\" Thus, the federal district court denied Leachman's motion to re-open the federal proceedings and denied his motion for oral argument as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This Court requested a response to the motion from the State, which was filed on April 30, 2018, and carried the motion with the case. Under Rule of Evidence 202, this Court must take judicial notice of a federal court's order if requested by a party and if this Court is supplied with the necessary information, as Leachman did here by attaching the order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. EVID. 202(b)(2). To the extent that Leachman requests that this Court take judicial notice of the existence of this federal court order, this Court grants his motion, but concludes that this order is not relevant for this appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MCI Sales &amp; Service, Inc. v.

In his second issue, also for the first time in this Court, Leachman asserts that the two pending reindictments in the trial court violate the Double Jeopardy Clause because, as a matter of law, his prior conviction in the original charge still exists. Finally, Leachman contends in his third issue, in the alternative, that the two pending reindictments violate the Double Jeopardy Clause because the State may not reprosecute an earlier conviction multiple times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The State responded that, to the degree that Leachman is complaining about a future trial on the second indictment following his first trial, this double-jeopardy claim is not ripe for review. Regarding Leachman's second issue, the State responds that, because his jurisdictional claims were not part of his habeas application, they are not properly before this Court, but the trial court was bound by the judgment of the federal court because state courts are bound by federal law under\n   the Supremacy Clause. Finally, as for Leachman's third issue, the State responds that, because Leachman's prior conviction was declared void, at his request, a retrial does not implicate Double Jeopardy protections and, thus, the trial court was correct to deny his habeas petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As discussed below, we have jurisdiction only to review the state court's order denying Leachman's habeas application, not the state court's new-trial order which, as the federal district court noted, may be challenged on direct appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Thus, double jeopardy does not bar the retrial here because a new trial was granted on the\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   self-representation claim, not insufficient evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In his amended rehearing motion, while he concedes that\n   <em>\n    Legrand\n   </em>\n   was the main case that he relied upon in his habeas application, Leachman contends that he cited\n   <em>\n    Legrand\n   </em>\n   to support his overall argument that his case primarily falls under the multiple-prosecutions context for double-jeopardy claims, rather than the multiple-punishments context. Even when reprosecution was allowed, Leachman contends that the original trial charge matters, and the case he cited is\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ewell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168414\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/116/\">\n    383 U.S. 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168414\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/116/\">\n    86 S.Ct. 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168414\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/116/\">\n    15 L.Ed.2d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966). Leachman states that the\n   <em>\n    Ewell\n   </em>\n   Court held that \"[i]f the present indictments charge the same offense as the [\u00a7] 4705 offense for which appellees were previously convicted, they may clearly be retried on either [\u00a7] 4705 or [\u00a7] 4704 after their convictions have been vacated on their own motions.\"\n   <em>\n    Ewell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168414\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/116/\">\n    383 U.S. at 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168414\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/116/\">\n    86 S.Ct. 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Leachman claims that the\n   <em>\n    Ewell\n   </em>\n   Court held that retrial under a different penal statute with different elements was allowed by the Double Jeopardy Clause, after a conviction was set aside, because the new charge \"does not in any manner\n   <em>\n    expand the number of trials\n   </em>\n   that may be brought against [the defendants].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168414\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/116/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168414\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/116/\">\n    at 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168414\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/116/\">\n    86 S.Ct. 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Thus, Leachman asserts that the\n   <em>\n    Ewell\n   </em>\n   Court prohibits what the State is trying to do here, break the indictment from the first trial into two indictments, because \"[t]he identity of the offense(s) charged\n   <em>\n    in the first trial\n   </em>\n   continues to govern the scope of what may be tried\n   <em>\n    in the single retrial the State is allowed.\n   </em>\n   \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   However, Leachman first raised this multiple-prosecutions argument citing\n   <em>\n    Ewell\n   </em>\n   in his proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, which were filed with the trial court on August 14, 2017, for the\n   abatement hearing, well after his habeas application was denied on September 28, 2016. In its abatement findings and conclusions, the habeas court did not address any of Leachman's arguments, including\n   <em>\n    Ewell\n   </em>\n   , because it concluded that the \"additional findings of fact and conclusions of law proposed by [Leachman] [we]re beyond the scope of the order of the Court of Appeals[.]\" As noted above, this Court does not address new arguments that were not raised and addressed by the trial court in denying habeas relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Perez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12410632\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/536/877/#p880\">\n    536 S.W.3d at 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In any event,\n   <em>\n    Ewell\n   </em>\n   does not apply here because the United States Supreme Court's holding and reason for reversing the dismissal of the federal narcotics indictments was based solely on the Speedy Trial Clause, not the Double Jeopardy Clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ewell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168414\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/116/\">\n    383 U.S. at 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168414\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/116/\">\n    86 S.Ct. 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that, \"[w]e cannot agree that the passage of 19 months between the original arrests and the hearings on the later indictments itself demonstrates a violation of the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of a speedy trial.\").
