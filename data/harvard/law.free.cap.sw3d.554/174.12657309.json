If it does so, the parties further dispute whether the expert report deadline applies only to the conduct of Alpine, the owner of the range, or to Alpine's employee Shinogle as well. Additionally, the parties ask us to determine whether section 128.053 violates the open-courts and due-course-of-law provisions of the Texas Constitution. We affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 17, 2016, Benjamin Whitlock went to Alpine's shooting range in Fort Worth. He carried with him a fully-loaded .22 caliber Winchester rifle. When\n   he arrived at the range, Whitlock stopped at the gate to have his rifle cleared before entering. While Range Safety Officer Shinogle inspected Whitlock's rifle, the weapon was accidentally discharged, and a bullet struck Whitlock's leg, injuring him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Whitlock and his wife Brianna filed suit against Alpine and Shinogle for personal injuries caused by the discharge of a firearm at a sport shooting range, a cause of action that both sides agree-at least as to Alpine-implicates chapter 128 of the civil practice and remedies code. The parties also agree that the Whitlocks failed to serve a threshold expert report as mandated by section 128.053 by the statutory deadline, i.e., not later than the 90th day after filing their original petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2051.014\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Whitlocks filed their lawsuit on February 24, 2017. Three days after Alpine and Shinogle filed their answer, the trial court sent a letter to \"all counsel and pro se parties,\" identifying the case as one being governed by a discovery control plan under Level 3.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. R. Civ. P. 190.4. In compliance with rule 190.4, the trial court ordered the parties to attend a pretrial hearing or, in the alternative, submit an agreed discovery control plan which included, among other deadlines: \"(1) all deadlines required under Rule 190.4(b)(1)-(4), plus (2) deadlines for challenges to reliability or qualifications of expert witnesses and any hearing thereon.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A week prior to the scheduled pretrial hearing, the trial court signed an Agreed Uniform Scheduling Order (Level III). In it, the parties agreed that the Whitlocks would \"designate experts and must provide reports\" by February 12, 2018. The order made no specific reference to section 128.053, its expert report deadline, or whether the agreement purported to alter the statutory expert report deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On the 98th day after the lawsuit was filed-June 2, 2017-Alpine and Shinogle filed a joint motion to dismiss based on the Whitlocks' failure to timely serve a section 128.053 threshold expert report. Although the trial court initially denied the motion without explanation, the trial court clarified the basis for the denial in its October 26 amended order: \"The April 7, 2017 Agreed Scheduling Order signed by the parties constituted a written agreement to extend Chapter 128's 90-day expert report deadline.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In that same order, the trial court also found that \"there is a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion,\" identifying one issue and three subissues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Does section 128.053 of the Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code require dismissal of this lawsuit because Plaintiffs did not serve an expert report within 90 days of filing their Original Petition? The following sub-issues are subsumed within this issue:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   a. Does a defendant's agreement and signature to an Agreed Scheduling Order setting expert disclosure dates extend the deadline to submit an expert report under Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 128.053 ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   b. Does section 128.053 's expert report requirement violate the Open Courts or Due Process of Law provisions of the Texas Constitution?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   c. Does section 128.053 's expert report requirement apply to claims against an employee of a \"sport shooting range\"?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Concluding that \"an immediate appeal pursuant to Section 51.014(d) may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation,\" the trial court also granted the\n   Whitlocks' request to stay the trial court proceedings until the interlocutory appeal had \"concluded and the case returns to this Court.\" Thereafter, Alpine and Shinogle filed an unopposed petition for permissive interlocutory appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2051.014\">\n    Tex.

Standards of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   No Texas appellate court has discussed the standard of review applicable to reviewing a motion to dismiss under section 128.053(a), but both sides agree that, generally speaking, motions to dismiss-and motions generally-are reviewed for an abuse of discretion and that this is the standard we should apply here to the trial court's decision to deny the motion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Baty v.

Is section 128.053 unconstitutional?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In their brief, the Whitlocks argue that civil practice and remedies code section 128.053 violates the Texas Constitution. Their argument is two-fold: first, that section 128.053 poses an unreasonable restriction on the Whitlocks' common law cause of action against Alpine and Shinogle, and second, that the restriction is unreasonable or arbitrary when balanced against the purpose of the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Owens Corning v.

To prove such a restriction, the Whitlocks must show either that section 128.053 has prevented them from pursuing their claims or\n   that the statute has imposed an impossible condition to bringing the action.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=145%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20386\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Specifically, they argue that section 128.053 's expert report requirement violates both of these constitutional provisions because the unique structure and purposes of the expert report requirement are fundamentally different from threshold report requirements provided for in other code provisions, specifically chapter 74\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and chapter 150.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

Accordingly, they claim that dismissal of their claims under section 128.053 would be arbitrary when balanced against the statute's expressed purpose and would therefore violate the state constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   But a claimant who brings an open courts challenge has the burden, among other things, to show that the expert-report requirement actually prevented him from pursuing his claims, and like the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Stockton\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Joplin\n   </em>\n   , here it is the failure to timely serve the expert report-not the existence of the expert report requirement-that would bar the Whitlocks' claims. That is, the chapter 128 expert report requirement, by itself, does not deprive the Whitlocks of a jury trial or infringe on their right to equal protection or due process under the law. One of the legislature's stated purposes is to \"protect safe ranges from legal harassment,\" thus serving the same purpose as that of the expert report in chapter 74 and of the certificate of merit in chapter 150-to add a legislative hurdle to the filing of frivolous lawsuits. As the legislature stated in the statute's statement of intent, \"nothing in the bill prohibits private citizens with clear and convincing evidence of guilt from suing for damages to private property, personal injury, or injunctive relief to enforce valid statutes, ordinances, or regulations.\" Sen.

With regard to\n   <em>\n    Spectrum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   they point to the \"unique purpose separate and apart from\" other expert reports used in litigation that the section 74.351 threshold expert report occupies, including the prohibition of using the report in litigation, a characteristic not shared with section 128.053 reports. In addition, the language of the docket control order in\n   <em>\n    Spectrum\n   </em>\n   differed from the one here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   With regard to\n   <em>\n    Crosstex\n   </em>\n   , the Whitlocks draw a distinction between an expert report and a certificate of merit, both as to substance and to timing. Under chapter 150, the threshold report has not only a different nomenclature-a \"certificate of merit,\" rather than \"expert report\"-but also takes a different form. Although offered by an expert, the certificate of merit is filed as an affidavit, not a report, and it must be filed at the outset of the lawsuit-\"with the complaint\"-not by a specified time after the filing of the lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20150.002\">\n    Tex.

It focused upon the uncertainty and impracticality of requiring trial courts to glean specific intent from the general docket control orders that have become prolific in everyday practice. In expressing the need for a standard that would remedy this problem, the court stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    [T]he ubiquity of agreed docket control orders militates the adoption of a simple standard for extending the threshold expert report deadline that litigants can easily meet and courts can readily apply....\n   </em>\n   To require courts to scrutinize agreed docket control orders or gather additional evidence of the parties' intent to extend chapter 74's threshold expert report deadline along with the suit's unrelated discovery deadlines is impractical.

Because the generic docket control order in that case \"made no mention of the separate certificate of merit requirements under section 150.002,\" the docket control order did not operate to extend the deadline for that filing requirement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6959870\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/430/384/#p388\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   And while the holding in\n   <em>\n    Spectrum\n   </em>\n   was limited to section 74.351 expert reports and the holding in\n   <em>\n    Crosstex\n   </em>\n   was limited to section 150.002 certificates of merit, the problem the supreme court addressed in reaching these holdings is equally applicable here. The ubiquity of agreed docket control orders presents the same problem in lawsuits under chapter 128 as it does in those under chapters 74 and 150. The reasoning of the supreme court in these two cases leads us to conclude with regard to subissue 1a that because the agreed scheduling order here was generic and did not specifically reference the section 128.053 expert report, it did not establish the intent of the parties to extend the statutory expert report deadline mandated under section 128.053.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    C.
