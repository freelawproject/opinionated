Movant entered an \"open plea,\" meaning that he had no plea agreement. The plea court questioned Movant, accepted the plea, found him guilty, sentenced him to an eight-year prison term as a prior and persistent felony offender, and denied probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Movant filed an amended post-conviction motion wherein he claimed, among other things, that plea counsel had \"erroneously assured Movant he would receive a new term of probation if he entered an 'open plea.' \" After an evidentiary hearing, the motion court overruled Movant's amended motion. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Governing Law and Principles of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A movant has the burden of proving his or her claims for relief by a preponderance of the evidence at an evidentiary\n   hearing. Rule 24.035(i). To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a post-conviction movant must overcome the strong presumption that counsel was competent and demonstrate instead that: (1) counsel failed to exercise the customary skill and diligence that a reasonably competent attorney would exercise; and (2) such failure prejudiced the movant.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Hill v.

Movant responded in the negative. Movant also told the plea court that no one had suggested that he should answer questions from the court untruthfully. At the sentencing hearing, the State recommended a ten-year sentence and restitution. Plea counsel argued for another chance on probation, or alternatively, long-term drug treatment. After Movant received his eight-year sentence, Movant told the plea court that he was satisfied with plea counsel's services and had no complaints regarding plea counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the evidentiary hearing on Movant's amended post-conviction motion, Movant and plea counsel provided the only testimony. Movant testified that: (1) plea counsel \"assured\" him that he would get probation if he accepted an open plea; (2) he had relied on that representation when deciding whether to plead guilty; and (3) if plea counsel had not so assured him, he would not have pleaded guilty but would have instead proceeded to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On cross-examination, the State pointed out Movant's negative response when the plea court had asked him if anyone had made him any promises to get him to plead guilty. Movant immediately responded, \"I said 'No, sir,' but he did, and he also assured me twice. He said just take an\n   open plea and he would get me probation, probation continued.\" The State also stressed that Movant had told the plea court that no one had put any pressure on him to get him to plead guilty. Movant responded that his answers were \"incorrect\" and that plea counsel had told him to \"go in there, make it easy on everybody, and [he] would get probation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plea counsel provided the following testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   We talked about an open plea, because [Movant] had been in prison for quite some time and had been incarcerated, and I thought his odds would be good. But, of course, you never know, and it was-we were very clear, and I was always clear with him that-that no one could guarantee him anything. All I guaranteed him was a fighting shot at probation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   So I thought that the Judge might consider that [Movant] had been in for two years or three years, something like that, and that he had a bunch of time served and might think that he was a good candidate to take a chance with, in light of that time served.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plea counsel testified that he was sorry that Movant was dissatisfied with the plea court's sentencing decision, but that he had never promised Movant that he would receive probation if he entered an open plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The motion court's order denying relief set forth Movant's testimony from the plea hearing and evidentiary hearing, as well as plea counsel's testimony from the evidentiary hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The motion court concluded that plea counsel had never assured Movant that he would receive probation in exchange for his guilty plea. The motion court found plea counsel's testimony was \"more credible\" than Movant's. Because the motion court believed plea counsel's testimony, Movant failed to prove his claim that plea counsel \"erroneously assured\" him that he would receive probation. Without such proof, Movant failed to overcome the strong presumption that plea counsel exercised the level of skill and diligence that a reasonably competent attorney would exercise in a similar situation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Movant argues the motion court should not have considered Movant's testimony that he had given \"incorrect\" answers to the plea court when weighing Movant's credibility because Movant was only following plea counsel's advice to \"go in there and make it easy on everybody\" so that Movant would receive the probation plea counsel assured. But the motion court was free to find plea counsel's testimony more credible and thus conclude that plea counsel had never assured Movant that he would receive probation. That credibility determination was \"exclusively\" for the motion court,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Hill\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856275,6856307\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/467/818/\">\n    467 S.W.3d at 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and we defer to its decision.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Oliphant\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386608\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/525/572/#p577\">\n    525 S.W.3d at 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Post-conviction counsel sought to add a claim that Movant's eight-year sentence for felony stealing exceeded the maximum authorized by law. He argued that, pursuant to the rationale of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State v.

Post-conviction counsel was appointed on July 13, 2015, and the transcripts were filed on August 13, 2015. That same day, August 13, 2015, the motion court granted post-conviction counsel the one 30-day extension allowed by Rule 24.035(g). Thus, post-conviction counsel had 90 days from August 13 to file the amended motion. The 90th day of that time period was Wednesday, November 11, 2015. Because that day was a legal holiday (Veteran's Day), however, the amended motion was due on the next business day: Thursday, November 12, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 44.01(a).

At the evidentiary hearing, post-conviction counsel moved \"to expand the amended motion claim to include a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bazell\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   claim as plain error.\" He asserted that \"it's manifest injustice for someone to be serving a\n   felony sentence for a misdemeanor offense.\" He asked to orally amend the post-conviction motion to include the claim. The State responded that any amendment was \"significantly out of time.\" The motion court agreed with the State, ruling that the proposed amendment was \"out of time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The motion court did not clearly err. \"Rule 24.035(g) prevents counsel from filing an amended motion ... outside a certain time period following appointment of the public defender's office.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Stanley\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7268162\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/420/532/#p540\">\n    420 S.W.3d at 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
