Terms and conditions of this agreement accepted. Wood &amp; Leman and the agreement continued in force until the 20th of February 1878, when it was terminated by a written notice for that purpose from Creveling to Wood &amp; Leman served on the 20th December 1877.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-9\">While Wood &amp; Leman were the agents of Creveling, they introduced him to William S. Williams, a director and agent of the Covington, Columbus and Black Hills Railroad Company; and considerable negotiation then took place between Creveling, assisted by Wood &amp; Leman on the one side, and Williams on the other, in regard to the manufacture of railroad iron by Creveling and its sale to the railroad company. Creveling made an offer in writing, dated September 4th 1877, to furnish 4500 tons of railroad iron of the therein specified weight, lengths and quality and of the pattern agreed upon; not less than 200 tons to be delivered at Chicago per week, at $34.50 per ton, provided the freight would not exceed $4 per ton, each 200 tons to be paid for on delivery, and presentation of invoice and bills of lading to W. S. Williams, 26 Pine Street New York. Proposition to be accepted on or before the 20th of September 1877. On the 20th of September 1877 Wood &amp; Lea-man made two copies of a memorandum of an agreement between Creveling and the railroad company, which they called \u201cbought and sold notes,\u201d which differed from Creveling\u2019s offer among other things, in requiring that 300 tons should be delivered each week, and in stipulating that the payments should be made by drafts on Williams payable three days after sight. They, sent one copy to the president of the railroad company to be signed by him, and the other to Mr. Creveling for his signature. The latter refused to assent to these changes in the contract, but interlined the copy of the memorandum sent to him, so as to make it correspond to his proposal of September 4th 1877, and signed it thus altered, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>sent it to Wood &amp; Leman. They gave it to Williams and received from him the copy signed by the president of the railroad company as drawn by them, Wood A Leman, and without being altered so as to correspond with the copy signed by Creveling; and, by letter dated the 8th of October 1877, stated to Creveling that the changes would have to be sent to Sioux City for formal acceptance, but that Williams said he should go on and commence making rails, as the company must have 2000 tons-before winter. Creveling commenced making the rails which he charged to Williams at $30.50 per ton delivered at Danville. He delivered 646 tons, the last of which was delivered before the 5th of November 1877, and he was paid for this iron each week for the amount then delivered, by means of sight drafts on Williams, which the latter paid. Creveling made some 300 tons more but before they were delivered, viz. on the 10th of November 1877, he was directed by Wood &amp; Leman, at the instance of Williams, to withhold drafts and shipments, until he, Williams, should return from Chicago. It was then discovered that the railroad company was embarrassed and could not pay for any more rails, and no more were made for them, the 300 tons on hand being sold to other parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-6\">At the trial before Elwell, P. J., the plaintiff submitted the following point, to which is subjoined the answer of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-7\">The court are requested to charge the jury that if they find from the evidence that Wood &amp; Leman effected a sale of 4500 tons of railroad iron for the defendant, to the railroad company, and bought and sold notes were exchanged between said Creveling and said company evidencing said sale, the plaintiffs thereupon became entitled under the provisions of the agreement between-them and the said Creveling, of the date of July 19th 1877, to their commissions on the net amount of said sale \u2014 that is, on the pric\u00e9 of the iron at the defendant\u2019s mill in Danville, and are entitled to recover the same in this action unless the said commissions have been paid by the defendant or released by plaintiffs for a sufBcient consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-8\">Ans. \u201cI affirm that point as the law of the case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-9\">The first point of the defendant with the answer of the court was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-10\">That under the written contract of July 19th 1877, by -which the plaintiffs became the selling agents of the defendant, the plaintiffs are not entitled to charge a commission on the price of 4500 tons of railroad iron agreed to be made by the defendant for the railroad company, but only on so much of said railroad iron as was actually sold by the defendant to the said railroad company \u2014 that is, under the evidence in this cause, on the iron made and delivered to the said company or its agent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-11\">'Ans. \u201cI decline to affirm that point. In what I have already said in the general charge it is apparent to you that the law is, as we hold it to be, that the right to compensation does not depend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>upon the amount of railroad iron delivered, but upon the amount which was sold through the agency of the plaintiffs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-6\">In the general charge the court, inter alia, said :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-7\">\u201c The contract in, this case is evidenced <em>by </em>a writing dated on the 19th of July 1877, signed by one party and an acceptance written upon it by the other. * * * There is a passage in it which I would like to refer to, however. On the part of the defendant it was proposed to the plaintiffs in the words following: \u2018 In compensation for such service (after stating what the service was), I will agree to allow you a commission on all sales of railroad iron and muck bar iron in your district of one and one-half per cent.; out of this percentage, you to pay all extra commissions to other brokers.\u2019 That phraseology requires us, in construing this contract, to ascertain what is meant by the words, \u2018 all sales of railroad iron.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-8\">\u201c Where technical terms are used, they are to have the interpretation given by law to the particular word, unless there be something in the character or nature of the contract which would really control the general significance of. a technical term, but we are to consider the relative situation of the parties and the subject-matter of the contract, in order to understand what. the parties meant; for it is their intention which is sought for in giving construction to a writing. Where they have in express and clear terms indicated and put upon record their whole meaning, it is not open to construction because it speaks for itself. But in many instances it is necessary to consider facts and circumstances, the relation of the parties and the subject-matter of the .contract, in order to understand what the parties have meant by the terms which they have used. As applied to the business of an iron broker, an agent in a city who sells a large amount of property like railroad iron, a question arises whether the word \u2018 sale\u2019 is to be considered in its technical sense, as the transfer of an article existing at the time in a shape capable of being handed over directly and immediately to the purchaser, or whether it relates to the transfer of the future produce of the vendor. What is generally understood in cases of that kind ? Suppose a man who has a large dairy agrees in the spring of the year to sell the product of his farm, his entire dairy, how would that be understood ? that it was a sale of each and every particular cheese, and would amount to no sale \"unless there were cheeses then existing ? True, it would not pass the title to the particular article at the time of making the contract; but if one man should employ another to make a sale of his dairy for him, promising him (say) a hundred dollars if he -would do so, when this employee has brought a purchaser, accepted by the dairyman and their contract is complete, I apprehend, according to the usual understanding and common parlance, a sale has been effected, at least so far as regards the agreement between the dairyman and his agent. Such is my understanding 'of the word \u2018sale\u2019 used in this contract.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>\u201c[I hold, therefore, that if the jury find that a contractivas made, a purchaser was found for Creveling for the product of his mill, that Creveling and this purchaser were brought together by their writings, that there was an act of sale or purchase- passing from one to the other, the one agreeing to do, and the other accepting, this constitutes a sale so far as the agent is concerned; who, when he has gained the mutual assent of the minds of the person who desires to purchase, and of him who desires to sell, then performed what he agreed to perform and has earned his percentage. No responsibility rests- upon the broker, acting as an agent, for the solvency of the purchaser to whom his employer has contracted to sell. No stipulation as to delivery is binding upon him after the contract. In fact, without improperly inter-, fering, he could do nothing more than to accomplish the sale satisfactorily to his employer.\u201d]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-6\">Verdict for plaintiffs for $1442.54; and after judgment thereon defendant took this writ and alleged that the court erred in the answers to the above points (2d and 3d. assignments), and in the portion of the charge in brackets.

They were employed to sell, not to deliver, or do any other act in reference to the execution of the contract.

The plaintiffs having accepted the terms of said letter by an endorsement thereon, we must look to it as embodying the agreement of the parties. The effect of iwas to make the plaintiffs \u201cselling agents \u201d for the defendant for the sale of his \u201crailroad iron, merchant and muck bar for New York and eastern markets,\u201d upon certain conditions therein named, and for an agreed compensation \u201c on all sales.\u201d Under this appointment the plaintiffs alleged that they had sold forty-five hundred tons of iron for the defendant to the Covington, Columbus &amp; Black Hills Railroad Company. A contract in writing between the defendant and the railroad company was prepared for the sale of said iron, the due execution of which was, however, denied by the defendant. This point we regard as unimportant. The defendant delivered six hundred and forty-six tons of iron to the company, when a further compliance with the contract on his part was prevented by the inability of the company to make payments. The plaintiffs claimed a right to recover commissions on the whole forty-five hundred tons; the defendant denied any liability beyond the six hundred and forty-six tons.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The learned judge instructed the jury that the right of the plaintiffs to compensation did not depend upon the quantity of railroad iron delivered, but upon the amount which was sold through the agency of the plaintiffs; that if the plaintiffs brought the defendant and the purchaser together, and \u201c there was an act of sale or purchase passing from one to the other, the one agreeing to do, and the other accepting, this constitutes a sale so far as the agent employed is concerned, who, when he has gained the mutual assent of the minds of the person who d\u00e9sires to purchase, and of him who desires to sell, has then performed what he agrees to perform, and has earned his percentage.\u201d This is in almost the language of Inslee <em>v. </em>Jones, Bright. R. 76, and Keys <em>v. </em>Johnston, 18 P. F. Smith 42, in which it was held that \u201c brokers are persons whose business is to bring buyer and seller together; they need have nothing to do with the negotiation of the bargain.\u201d This language was applied in a case where a real estate broker had brought suit to recover his commissions. If the present claim had been by a broker for commissions on the sale of real estate, the ruling of the court would have been accurate. But this was a case of merchandise, and the plaintiffs were not acting in the capacity of brokers of the defendants. They were agents to sell under a special agreement. The sales contemplated in said agreement were actual sales in a commercial sense, not mere contracts to sell. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>sale is <em>\u201c </em>a transfer of the absolute title to property for a certain agreed price. It is a contract between two parties, one of whom acquires thereby a property in the thing sold, and the other parts with it for a valuable considerationStory on Sales, sect. 1. There was no sale -here beyond the six hundred and forty-six tons. There was a mere contract to sell. The iron was not even made. If the plaintiffs were entitled to commissions on the contract to sell, they had earned commissions on the entire forty-five hundred tons the moment the contract was entered into. No claim, however, was made for commissions on the undelivered iron until after the matte* fell through by reason of the inability of the purchaser to pay. This portion of the claim was evidently an afterthought. The parties to the agreement regarded it as a contract for commissions on actual sales. On the 15th of December 1877, more than a month after the last iron had been delivered, the plaintiffs sent to the defendant their bill for services to that time, in which they claimed one and a half per cent, on the six hundred and forty-six tons delivered, and made no claim for percentage on the residue of the forty-five hundred tons. The construction placed upon their agreement by the parties themselves at the time they were acting under it, was the proper one. There can be no recovery for commissions on the forty-five hundred tons beyond the amount actually sold and delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">What has been said covers the first, second and third assignments and renders the fourth unimportant.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap89\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
