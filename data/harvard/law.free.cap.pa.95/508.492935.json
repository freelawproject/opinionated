On May 28th 1878, J. H. and J. W. Windsor obtained a judgment against Russell, a writ of fieri facias was issued, and Hoover, the sheriff, levied on the tables and sold them to the Windsors. The company then brought this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-9\">The defendants claimed that the lease and the other papers above recited were but one transaction, and should be construed together, and that they constituted a sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-10\">The plaintiffs contended that the tables were held under the lease, and that the other papers were preliminary and were all merged in the lease, but if they were all construed together, they constituted a bailment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-11\">The court, Taylor, P. J., inter alia, charged :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-12\">\u201c After certain preliminary arrangements were made between the parties, certain negotiations looking forward to a final sale, on the 28th of January 1878, a paper was executed which, in our opinion, states the contract between these parties, when it was submitted to the plaintiffs in the suit, and approved by them. That it was done is evidenced by the fact that, under the contract the possession of the property was changed. The billiard tables and fixtures were sent, in pursuance of this contract, to Oil City. This contract, in our opinion, is the contract between the parties, although it provides upon its face for certain matters to be performed thereafter, to wit: The execution of a lease which the plaintiffs here claim was the final contract between the parties. We cannot agree with them in that; we think that this was the contract between the parties, and that the lease was executed in pursuance of this contract therefor, as well as the delivery of the possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>of the property. That being so, we instruct you, that under the papers in this case, as the parties have chosen to make this a question of law for the court \u2014 we instruct you, that under the papers in this ease, this was a conditional sale, and that the title to the property passed at the time of its delivery in Oil City, and the consummation of the contract by the delivery of the property and the execution of the lease therefor; the title to'the property passed, so far as creditors were concerned. * * * Under the papers, then, we instruct you \u2014 and under the evidence in the case \u2014 that the title to this property passed to Russell, so far as creditors of Russell were concerned, upon the delivery of the property and- the execution of this paper., called a lease, and it was subject to be levied upon in his possession by the creditors of Russell, and the defendants having levied upon it as the property of Russell and sold it as his property, plaintiff cannot recover in this action. They are not trespassers. Your verdict will be for the defendants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-6\">Yerdict and judgment for defendants. Plaintiffs then took this writ and alleged that the court. erred, inter alia, in the above portion of the charge.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b511-7\"><em>Wm. </em>McNair, for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Auy\">The paper of January 28th 1878, provides that the title to the property shall remain with the plaintiffs until the notes and lease are executed by Russell, and under no circumstances shall any claim be made as owner until the settlement is completed, the settlement to be made at the express office, Oil City. The settlement was made at Oil City, the terms of the lease fixed and executed by Russell, and it was the final act of the parties, and the other then became <em>functus officio. </em>The word \u201clease\u201d in the original paper had, unquestionably, a well-understood meaning in the trade, and shows that a bailment for use was contemplated, and that no title was to pass, and that the lease and terms were to be fixed before delivery of' possession to Russell. No title to the property of any kind passed, and if lost in transitu it would have been plaintiff\u2019s loss. It is not a sale either absolute or conditional.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-8\">The agreements in the following cases were held to be bailments: Henry <em>v. </em>Patterson, 7 P. F. Smith 351; Enlow <em>v. </em>Klein, 29 Id. 488; Becker <em>v. </em>Smith, 9 Id. 470; and we cannot comprehend why a different construction should be put upon the agreements in this case. There is no analogy between this case and Martin <em>v. </em>Mathiot, 14 S. &amp; R. 214, which was a conditional sale simply and purely, and our case does not come within the definition of a conditional sale as given in Rose <em>v. </em>Story, 1 Barr 190; but said case supports the plaintiffs\u2019 theory.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b511-9\"><em>Dodd &amp; Lee, </em>for defendants m error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXA\">The whole question is one of intention to be deduced from written contracts. The parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>stated their intention too clearly for mistake when they contracted for a sale of the goods with a lease as security, and carried that contract into execution. The case comes clearly within the principle laid down by Rogers, J., in Rose <em>v. </em>Story, 1 Barr 190, and affirmed in Euwer <em>v. </em>Van Giesen, 6 W. N. C. 363. If the vendor and vendee agree that the possession shall pass to the vendee, but the property remain in the vendor until the purchase-money is paid, such agreement, as respects creditors and the sheriff, is fraudulent. The lease, standing by itself, does not constitute a bailment. It differs from the lease in the case of Rowe <em>v. </em>Sharp, in that no provision is made for the return of the property at the end of the term. The obligation to return the property is an essential quality to the bailment. \u201c A delivery of chattels upon a sale made on condition that the title shall pass on the payment of the purchase-money at a future day, is something more than a bailment; it gives the buyer a conditional title:\u201d Krause <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 12 Norris 418.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AHtH\">November 8th 1880.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b512-6\">Mr. Justice Paxson</author>\n<p id=\"Af6F\">delivered the opinion of the court,</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">In the recent case of Stadtfeld <em>v. </em>Huntsman, 11 Norris 53, we endeavored to point out with some care the distinction between a conditional sale and a bailment, and the line of cases commencing with Clow <em>v. </em>Woods, 5 S. &amp; R. 275, and ending with Enlow <em>v. </em>Klein, 29 P. F. Smith 488, was considered and commented upon. We need not repeat what was there said.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">The case in hand comes precisely within the ruling of Stadtfeld <em>v. </em>Huntsman. The transaction was a conditional sale. The attempt to disguise it under the cloak of a bailment was too clumsy to have the merit of being clever. The contract of January 28th 1878 was a sale of the billiard tables upon a credit, with a stipulation that payment should be secured by a lease of the tables and an insurance thereon. When the tables were delivered the subsequent agreement of 22d of February 1878 was executed. This paper is in form a lease, and it was not denied that it was executed in pursuance of and in strict compliance with the contract' of sale of the preceding January. The feeble attempt to prove that the tables were delivered under the lease and not under the contract, will not avail, for the reason, among others, that the two papers must be regarded as one transaction. Taken together they amount to a sale of the billiard tables upon credit accompanied with a lease thereof as a security for the payment of the price. Such a contract, while good between the parties, will not keep creditors at bay. It is worthless as to them. There is no principle of law better settled in Pennsylvania than that a sale and delivery of personal property, with an agreement that the ownership shall remain in the vendor until the purchase-money is paid, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>enables creditors of the vendee to seize and sell the. same for the payment of his debts. \u2019 It would be a needless labor to cite the numerous cases in which this doctrine has been asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">It was urged, however, that the case in hand is upon all fours with Rowe <em>v. </em>Sharp, 1 P. F. Smith 27, and that we cannot affirm this judgment without overruling that case. Rowe <em>v. </em>Sharp, like Enlow <em>v. </em>Klein, was a close ease and stands upon the border. It differs from the present one in two important particulars. While in Rowe <em>v. </em>Sharp there was evidence of a sale of the billiard tables by Sharp to Goff a few days prior to the lease, there was no agreement for a lease as security. And again, in Rowe <em>v. </em>Sharp there was an express stipulation for a return of the property at the end of the bailment. This important part of a contract of bailment is wholly omitted in the lease between the parties to this contention. The lessors may re-enter and take possession of the property upon a breach by the lessee of the covenants contained in the lease. Rut if the lessee fulfils his covenants, that is to say if he pays the several instalments as they mature, the lessors cannot reclaim the property, nor is the lessee bound to restore it after the bailment is over.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">There is not a single element of a bailment in this transaction. It is immaterial what the parties call it; the law pays little heed to the label; it looks beneath and examines the nature and character of the contract between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
