[In order to prove a riot it is necessary at common law to prove on the trial a previous unlawful assembling. It must be shown that the assembling was accompanied with some such circumstances, either of actual force or violence, or at least by such apparent tendency thereto as would inspire the people with terror, such as being armed, using threatening speeches, turbulent gestures or the like. If the assembling of persons be not accompanied with such circumstances as these, it cannot be deemed a riot, however unlawful the acts which they actually committed.] (2d assignment.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-8\">\u201c [Then at common law it was also necessary that there should be a tumultuous disturbance of the-public peace. By that is meant, we think, a violent, turbulent, disorderly and noisy disturbance of the public peace.] (3d assignment.) Then this disturbance must be by three or more persons, and they must have assembled together of their own authority, with intent mutually .to assist one another against all persons who might oppose them in the execution of some private object, as for instance in the execution of the burning down of a building or anything \"of that kind. Then it must be shown that they afterwards actually did execute this object in a violent and turbulent manner, to the terror of the people.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-9\">\u201c While the law is for the court to determine, and you are bound by the instructions of the court on questions of law, yet you are to determine the facts from the evidence in the case, and you must have reference in making up your verdict to a]j the facts and circumstances in the evidence. :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-10\">\u201c Then if you believe the evidence, on the night of the 3d of June 1875, the plaintiffs\u2019 property was destroyed by fire. You will recollect the testimony of the witnesses on the subject as to what took place at the time that the property was destroyed for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>which the plaintiffs seek to recover the insurance in this case. Timothy Adams stated that he was there, employed by the plaintiffs, William Sehwenk &amp; Co., as watchman; that on the 3d of June, at about eleven o\u2019clock at night, he heard a noise in the bush, a rustling in the leaves. He didn\u2019t.know for certain what was there but he fired his gun, and immediately after his firing it was returned by another proceeding from the direction of this noise in the woods, and presently by another shot, and then in a short time he says there was a volley fired. At one time he said there might have been fifty or seventy shots, and again he said that there might have been only four or five, six, seven or eight. What is meant by a volley was the firing of a number of shots. Then, he says, presently a number of men, probably seven or eight, came out to the breaker and he heard them talking. He was up on the plane of the breaker above them and he heard one of them asking for some wood and another asking for some coal oil; soon after that the breaker was on fire. He doesn\u2019t speak of any noise having been made by these men except the firing of the pistols, as he thought, previous to the time of setting fire to the breaker. He moved on down the plane and finally got inside of the drift and remained there a short time when he saw the men going away. He doesn\u2019t speak of their having made any noise at the time they were going away.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-6\">\u201c Then you heard the testimony of Alfred and Joseph Ford and Harriet Farley, all persons who were in the neighborhood the evening of this fire, and you will determine from these witnesses what actually did occur on that occasion. Young Mr. Ford that he saw the men coming down the railroad ; that he heard them talking loudly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-7\">\u201c[You will take into consideration all the evidence. Was this a riot ? Was this a tumultuous disturbance of the public peace by three or more persons assembled there together of their own authority with intent, mutually, to assist one another against any who should oppose them in the execution of their purposes, or in burning of the breaker or other property ? Did they burn the breaker and other property in a violent and turbulent manner to the terror of the people ?] (4th assignment.) You heard the testimony, so far as terror is concerned, of Harriet Farley. She was on her way home from Mount Carmel. She testified as to what she heard and saw. You heard the testimony of Alfred Ford in regard to whether he was put in terror, and the testimony of Timothy Adams on the same subject. [You will determine from all the evidence whether the acts of shooting and the noise that was created by the firing of the building were violent and turbulent acts, and whether they were to the terror of the people. We think that it is not necessary that there should have been shouting or blowing of horns; that the noise caused by the shooting off of guns and pistols would be a tumultuous disturbance of the public peace.]\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-8\">The 12th assignment of error was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>\u201cBecause the general charge of the court, as to what constitutes a riot, differs from and is in conflict with the law as is stated by the court by affirming the third and fifth points of the defendant below, which the court below affirmed to be correct to such a degree as to be contradictory and irreconcilable, and this contradiction tended to confuse and mislead the jury, and prevented them from obtaining from the charge any certain idea of what is necessary in law to constitute a riot, to wit: the court in their general charge say, \u2018 then at common law it was also necessary that there should be a tumultuous disturbance of the public peace. By that is meant, as we think, a violent, turbulent, disorderly and noisy disturbance of the public peace, &amp;c.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-6\">The following are the 3d and 5th points, with the answers of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-7\">3. \u201c That if any persons to the number' of three or more shall meet together with clubs, staves or other hurtful weapons, to the terror of the peaceable people or inhabitants of this Commonwealth, and shall commit or design to commit violence or injury upon the persons or goods of any of the said inhabitants, such persons are guilty of riot.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-8\">Ans. \u201c I answer this point as requested.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-9\">5. That noise is not a necessary element of a riot, nor is it necessary that any person should be put in actual fear, but if a number of men, to the number of three or more, banded together for the purpose of destroying the breaker of the plaintiffs, and having armed themselves with pistols or other arms or weapons, went to the said breaker with a determination and purpose to destroy it, against any resistance that the watchmen there might offer, and did actually destroy it by fire, the plaintiffs cannot, under the terms of the policy of insurance, recover in this suit, and the verdict ought to be in favor of defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-10\">Ans. \u201cAffirmed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-11\">Verdict for plaintiffs for $2473.33, and after judgment thereon, defendant took this writ and alleged that the court erred, inter alia, as set forth in the above assignments of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b93-12\"><em>George Hill </em>and <em>Joshua W.

This was calculated to confuse and mislead the jury.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b94-8\"><em>S. </em>P. <em>Wolverton </em>and J. <em>B. Packer, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASO\">The definition of riot by the court below is abundantly sustained by authority: 2 Russell on Crimes 247; Roscoe on Crim. Ev. 725 ; 3 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law 153, sect. 2474, 6th ed.; King, P. J., in case In re Riots of 1844, 2 Clark 278; Angeli on Fire and Life Insurance, sect. 136; Langdall <em>v. </em>Mason, Park on Insurance 965, 8th Eng. ed. There was not a riot, nor was the destruction caused by means of a riot within the words of the policy. The men who burned the breaker were incendiaries, not rioters. They proceeded quietly to the breaker and left it without noise or violence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-9\">The testimony of Adams and Ford clearly show that the breaker was not burned by men engaged in a riot, and the court could not have affirmed the defendant\u2019s sixth point without committing manifest error. As there is no statute defining riot in Pennsylvania, and the common law is still in force, it was the duty of the court to define and explain riot at common law. In doing this the court adopted the definitions approved by all writers on criminal law. After explaining riot at common law, they accepted the definition drawn by the defendants\u2019 counsel affirming their third, fourth and fifth points.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b94-10\">Mr. Justice Green</author>\n<p id=\"AAf\">delivered the opinion of the court,</p>\n<p id=\"A5k\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>The defendant\u2019s sixth point requested the court to say \u201cthat if the jury believe that the breaker was destroyed by fire in the manner testified by Timothy Adams, their verdict ought to be in favor of the defendant.\u201d The seventh point made a similar request as to the testimony of Alfred Ford. Adams had testified that at about eleven o\u2019clock at night, while he was watching at the breaker,</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">\u201c there was a lot of men came up to the breaker through the woods. I first heard them, and I fired a shot; they fired too; they returned the fire and came up right away and set fire to the breaker. I seen some of them; now I couldn\u2019t tell you how many I seen that was there. I didn\u2019t see any before the breaker was on fire; I seen then may be eight or ten; I can\u2019t tell how far they were away from the breaker when they commenced shooting ; may be fifty yards or so; they didn\u2019t make much noise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Q. \u201cWhat amount of shooting was done?\u201d A. \u201cIt was a regular volley. I think may be there was fifty shots fired altogether; I heard them coming in the direction of the breaker. * * * I did not go down until they had the breaker on fire; they came right up after the shooting and set fire to the breaker; after they set fire to the breaker I came down and went into the drift. * * * I didn\u2019t hear them say much, only when they came they said \u2018Get out of this;\u2019 that is about all I think I heard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">Q. \u201cHow did they set fire to it?\u201d A. \u201cThey got some fine kindling wood and poured some coal oil on; they hollered for it; one hollered for wood; and the other said \u2018give me that coal oil;\u2019 that I heard; then they set it on fire; it burned pretty rapidly. * * * I can\u2019t say I was afraid; I didn\u2019t like to stay in the breaker any how; I didn\u2019t want to be burned up. * * * I was not in danger of being shot, because I was inside of the breaker; they couldn\u2019t shoot through. I was more in danger of the fire than from being shot; I crawled down the plane over their heads.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">Ford testified that he also was a watchman at the breaker on the night of the fire, and was in the office immediately before the fire, and heard four shots fired one at a time, and then there was a silence. \u201c After I heard the four shots then there was a lot fired just about I guess ten or fifteen yards from me; lot of shots, sounded to me like a volley of them. * * * After the shots were fired they plunged into the office, one of the men as soon as that volley of shots was fired, and asked who was there, but there was nobody there; I wasn\u2019t in the office at the time; I saw him coming into the office from the back window; I didn\u2019t see anybody else there at the time; I* heard him ask who was there; I didn\u2019t make any answer to the question; I wouldn\u2019t have been here if I had, I guess; I went back of the office down in the bush and concealed myself. * * * I wouldn\u2019t like to fight against so many men.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">We are decidedly of the opinion that in the foregoing testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>every element of riot is found, whether at common law or under our Act of 1705. There was the unlawful assemblage of three or more persons combined together to perpetrate an outrageous and violent crime. The commission of the crime was immediately preceded by numerous discharges of firearms. Two peaceable citizens engaged in watching and protecting the premises, placed there for that purpose, were compelled to flee therefrom in terror of their lives. The crime was arson, one of the most odious known to the criminal law. It was committed at a late hour of the night, when the great majority of persons are in their beds and asleep and least prepared to defend themselves or their property. It is an offence having a more natural and necessary tendency to put whole communities in fea'r and terror than almost any other. In this instance it was accompanied by the voices of men calling for wood and oil with which to apply the fire, by the loud and appalling noise of exploding weapons of destruction, and the criminals themselves were a band of men whose numbers could not'be determined on account of the darkness of the night. For a court in charging a jury to speak of such an occurrence as anything less than a riot of the most marked and distinct character would be simply to mislead them. We think the learned judge of the court below, in his comments to the jury, dealt quite too leniently with the plain and undisputed facts of the case. lie said to them that to prove a riot there must be a previous unlawful assembling, accompanied with circumstances of force or violence, and \u201c that if the assembling of persons be not accompanied with such circumstances as these it cannot be deemed a riot, however unlawful the acts which they actually committed.\u201d From this the jury would naturally infer that unless the proof went back to the time when the men first met together, and established that such original meeting was attended with circumstances of actual force and violence, a case of riot could not be made out, no matter what acts of outrage and violence were subsequently perpetrated. Such is not the law as we understand it, and we consider it error to say or to intimate that it is to a jury charged with the trial of such a case. We think, too, that the court rather overstated the necessity of proving \u201c a violent turbulent, disorderly and noisy disturbance of the public peace\u201d in order to make out a case of riot. There was no controversy as to what were the facts; not a witness was called to give any other account of the occurrence than that testified to by Adams and Alfred Ford. Their credibility was not assailed or impeached in any manner. It was a case in which it would have been entirely proper for the court to characterize directly the criminal aspect of the facts testified to by the witnesses named. Instead of doing this the learned judge told the jury they must decide whether they believed the witnesses when there was not a shadow of doubt thrown upon their credibility; and if they believe them they are to \u201c determine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>facts and circumstances.\u201d Whether the facts and circumstances constituted a riot he did not tell them, although expressly requested to do so in two points. In our opinion he should have affirmed the defendant\u2019s sixth and seventh points without qualification. For not doing so he was in error, as also in the general charge for the reasons heretofore stated. We sustain the second, tenth, eleventh and twelfth assignments of error, and on these the case is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
