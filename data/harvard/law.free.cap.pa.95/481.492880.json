The plaintiff was at that time sheriff of said county, and served the writ and alias summons No. 7, September Term 1873.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AiHN\">November 8th 1880.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-6\">His fees for service, travel, mileage and advertising were $24.21 Interest from September 1st 1873 to February 1st 1879</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-7\">5 y.ears and 6 months . . . . . . 7.97</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-8\">$32.18</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-9\">The defendants deny their liability for interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-10\">If the court be of opinion that the fees of the sheriff bear interest, they shall enter judgment for the plaintiff for $32.18 with costs.

J., of the Thirty-fifth Judicial District, who entered judgment for the plaintiff, which action was assigned for error by defendants who took this writ.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b482-12\"><em>L. S. Norton, </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFUP\">Interest on costs lias never been allowed in Pennsylvania: Rogers <em>v. </em>Burns\u2019s Adm\u2019r, 3 Casey 525; Baum <em>v. </em>Reed, 24 P. F. Smith 320.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b482-13\"><em>John P. Vincent </em>and <em>J. W. Wetmore, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATlo\">If an officer becomes an actor and brings assumpsit to recover payment for his services, there is no reason why he should not recover interest, and no decision of this court against it. If his fees have been collected in the suit in which they were earned he takes them, and no question about interest arises. But if not paid there, and he is delayed and compelled to collect from his employer, as the amount was due as soon as the service was rendered, he is entitled to interest.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b482-14\">Mr. Justice Green</author>\n<p id=\"Al3\">delivered the opinion of the court,</p>\n<p id=\"b482-15\">In the case of Rogers <em>v. </em>Burns, 3 Casey, on p. 528, we said: <em>\u201c </em>But the court below allowed interest on the judgment for costs. By the common law of England this is not allowed: 14 Viner\u2019s Abr. 457; Sweatland <em>v. </em>Squire, Id. 458 ; Butler <em>v. </em>Burk, 2 Salk. 623 ; 3 Jacob\u2019s Law Dic., tit. <em>Interest. </em>In Pennsylvania the same rule prevails, and the statute allowing interest on judgments is held to apply to the debt alone and not to the costs : 2 Dall. 105, note; McCausland\u2019s Adm\u2019rs <em>v. </em>Bell, 9 S. &amp; R. 390.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-16\">In Baum <em>v. </em>Reed, 24 P. F. Smith, on p. 322, we said: \u201c It is certainly the settled general rule in this state that costs do not bear interest. The best evidence of this is the universal practice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>endorsing executions. On the fi. fa. or other writ, the debt is stated, followed by the date from which interest is to be computed, and then come the costs without rate of interest. Such is the mode of endorsement, no matter how many years have elapsed from the entry of judgment. Even after, a.revival of the judgment, the same practice is pursued, the first costs being marked as on the original, and the second as on 'the scire facias.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">We see no reason for changing the rule thus laid down. We understand it to be the uniform practice'in all parts of the state not to allow interest on costs to the officers to whom they are due. There is no statute, course of decision or practice authorizing or justifying such allowance, nor is -interest a natural or necessary incident to costs in any view of the subject. Of course we except from these remarks the case of an actual payment of costs by a party. There interest may be allowed as on money paid and expended. But that is not this case. This is an ordinary case of a claim by a sheriff for costs due him for services in a cause. The court below allowed interest on the costs, and in this there was error.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">Judgment reversed, and judgment is entered here on the case stated in favor of the plaintiff for $24.21.</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
