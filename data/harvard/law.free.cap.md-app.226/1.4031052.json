He was sentenced to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. On appeal, Phillips challenges the DNA evidence the State used against him. The State argues that the DNA evidence was automatically admissible under \u00a7 10-915 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings (\u201cCJP\u201d) Article of the Maryland Code. Section 10-915, however, requires that, to be admissible, a DNA profile must include certification that the analysis was performed according to standards promulgated by two entities that no longer exist. Phillips asserts that the DNA evidence failed to comply with this factually obsolete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>statute and, therefore, that the trial court was correct in conducting a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing to determine whether to admit the DNA evidence. Phillips alleges, however, that the trial court erred in concluding that the DNA evidence was admissible under <em>Frye-Reed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">For the following reasons, we will affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">Phillips was charged and convicted of the murders of his ex-girlfriend, Wynetta Wright, and their 11-month-old child, Jaylin Wright. Wynetta\u2019s body was found in a park near the Hillcrest Heights Community Center. Wynetta died of a gunshot wound to the head. Jaylin was found dead in Wynet-ta\u2019s car in a nearby parking lot. Jaylin died of hyperthermia as a result of being left in a hot vehicle for an extended period of time. Phillips admitted to meeting with Wynetta during the early morning hours of May 31, 2011, but denied any part in her or their child\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">The police obtained DNA samples,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which were tested in June 2011 by forensic chemist Jessica Charak of the Prince George\u2019s County DNA laboratory. Two of the DNA samples are relevant to this appeal: one was from the steering wheel of Wynetta\u2019s car, and the other was from Phillips\u2019 buccal swab.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Based on DNA analysis of the two samples, it was Charak\u2019s opinion that the steering wheel sample contained material that was consistent with Phillips\u2019 DNA and, therefore, Phillips could not be excluded as a contributor. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>steering wheel sample also contained genetic material from Wynetta, Jaylin, and two other unknown contributors. In her report, Charak calculated that \u201c[t]he chances of selecting an unrelated individual from the random population who would be included as a possible contributor to the mixed DNA profile obtained from the evidence sample at the remaining tested loci are approximately ... 1 in 2.93 million individuals in the African American population.\u201d Additionally, Charak\u2019s report included the following statement that figures prominently in this appeal: \u201cThe DNA profiles reported below were determined by procedures which have been validated according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Quality Assurance Standards for Forensic DNA Testing Laboratories.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">Prior to trial, Phillips filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude any expert testimony pertaining to the State\u2019s DNA evidence, asserting that the Prince George\u2019s County DNA laboratory\u2019s interpretation of complex, low copy number DNA samples<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was not based on generally accepted scientific standards and was thus inadmissible under the <em>Frye-Reed </em>standard.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The State countered that the DNA evidence at issue is automatically admissible under CJP \u00a7 10-915 (the \u201cDNA Admissibility Statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">The trial court undertook a two-step process to determine the admissibility of expert testimony pertaining to the disputed DNA analysis. <em>First, </em>the trial court held a hearing to determine whether the Prince George\u2019s County DNA laboratory was in compliance with the DNA Admissibility Statute, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>whether the resulting DNA evidence was therefore automatically admissible without a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing. The trial court determined that the Prince George\u2019s County DNA laboratory was not following the standards referred to by the DNA Admissibility Statute, and, therefore, that the DNA evidence was not automatically admissible pursuant to the statute. <em>Second, </em>the trial court conducted a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing. The trial court determined that the underlying scientific methods used by the Prince George\u2019s County DNA laboratory were generally accepted in the relevant scientific community and, therefore, the DNA analysis would be admissible at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">The case proceeded to trial on January 14, 2013, and resulted in Phillips\u2019 conviction. On March 22, 2013, the trial court sentenced Phillips to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">I. Compliance with the DNA Admissibility Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">Maryland\u2019s DNA Admissibility Statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-8\">(a) (1) <em>Definitions. </em>\u2014 In this section the following words have the meanings indicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-9\">(2) \u201cDeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)\u201d means the molecules in all cellular forms that contain genetic information in a chemical structure of each individual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-10\">(3) \u201cDNA profile\u201d means an analysis of genetic loci that have been validated according to standards established by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-11\">(i) The Technical Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods (TWGDAM); or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-12\">(ii) The DNA Advisory Board of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-13\">(b) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 A statement from the testing laboratory setting forth that the analysis of genetic loci has been validated by standards established by TWGDAM or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>DNA Advisory Board is sufficient to admit a DNA profile under this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-5\">(c) <em>Purposes. </em>\u2014 In any criminal proceeding, the evidence of a DNA profile is admissible to prove or disprove the identity of any person, if the party seeking to introduce the evidence of a DNA profile:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-6\">(1) Notifies in writing the other party or parties by mail at least 45 days before any criminal proceeding; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-7\">(2) Provides, if applicable and requested in writing, the other party or parties at least 30 days before any criminal proceeding with:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-8\">(i) First generation film copy or suitable reproductions of autoradiographs, dot blots, slot blots, silver stained gels, test strips, control strips, and any other results generated in the course of the analysis;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-9\">(ii) Copies of laboratory notes generated in connection with the analysis, including chain of custody documents, sizing and hybridization information, statistical calculations, and worksheets;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-10\">(iii) Laboratory protocols and procedures utilized in the analysis;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-11\">(iv) The identification of each genetic locus analyzed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-12\">(v) A statement setting forth the genotype data and the profile frequencies for the databases utilized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-13\">(d) <em>Prerequisites. </em>\u2014 If a party is unable to provide the information required under subsection (c) of this section at least 30 days prior to the criminal proceedings, the court may grant a continuance to permit such timely disclosures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-14\">(e) <em>Discovery. </em>\u2014 Except as to the issue of admissibility under this section, subsection (c) of this section does not preclude discovery under the Maryland Rules relating to discovery, upon a showing of scientific relevance to a material issue regarding the DNA profile.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>CJP \u00a7 10-915. The import of the statute is clear: so long as the sponsoring party complies with the notice provisions of subsection (c), a DNA profile will be automatically admissible to prove or disprove identity if it is accompanied by a statement from the testing laboratory that it was \u201cvalidated by standards established by TWGDAM or the DNA Advisory Board.\u201d CJP \u00a7 10\u2014915(b). In Phillips\u2019 case, however, the DNA profile was accompanied by a certification stating, \u201c[t]he DNA profiles reported below were determined by procedures which have been validated according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Quality Assurance Standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Thus, the threshold question is whether compliance with the FBI\u2019s Quality Assurance Standards is sufficient for automatic admissibility or whether we must insist on compliance with standards issued by TWGDAM or the DNA Advisory Board. If compliance with the FBI Quality Assurance Standards is sufficient, then the steering wheel DNA sample is automatically admissible because the Prince George\u2019s County DNA laboratory complied with those standards. If, on the other hand, the DNA analysis needed a statement that it complied with standards from either TWGDAM or the DNA Advisory Board (which it did not have), then the steering wheel sample is not automatically admissible. If not automatically admissible for this reason, the DNA analysis must satisfy the <em>Frye-Reed </em>standard of general acceptance in the scientific community before it may be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">The issue is made more complicated because neither TWGDAM nor the DNA Advisory Board remain in existence. SWGDAM, <em>About Us, </em>http://perma.cc/VHA5-5FXX. Accordingly, compliance is impossible today.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">1. <em>The Problem of Obsolete Statutes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">Statutes, from time to time, become obsolete. Statutes can become <em>legally </em>obsolete when they are completely superseded by a subsequent legislative enactment (but, for whatever reason, not deleted) or are declared unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court or by the appellate courts of this State. Thus, for example, adoption of Article 46 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Maryland Declaration of Rights (Maryland\u2019s Equal Rights Amendment) rendered the \u201cnecessities statute,\u201d (then Md. Code. Ann. Art. 45, \u00a7 21), whereby a husband was legally responsible for his wife\u2019s expenses, legally obsolete. <em>Condore v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>289 Md. 516, 530, 425 A.2d 1011 (1981). There are many other examples. The code revision process is the principal but not the only means for removing legally obsolete provisions from the Maryland Code.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Statutes may also become <em>factually </em>obsolete. Conditions change. Laws drafted for the horse and buggy don\u2019t make sense for automobiles; some current automobile laws may not make sense for driverless cars. Unfortunately, unlike code revision, there is no regularized mechanism for eliminating factually obsolete statutes. While a legislature may delete a factually obsolete statute when it is noticed, combing the Code for factually obsolete statutes is generally not a high legislative priority. Judge Guido Calabresi and others have referred to this concept as legislative inertia \u2014 the recognition that it is easier to leave obsolete statutes than it is to remove or revise them. Guido Calabresi, <em>A Common Law for the Age of Statutes </em>2 (1982) [hereinafter Calabresi]; Archibald Cox, <em>Book Review, A Common Law for the Age of Statutes; by Guido Calabresi </em>70 Cal. L.Rev. 1463, 1464 (1982) (\u201cthe obsolete law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>remains ... because of inertia\u201d). The result is that many factually obsolete statutes remain on the books.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Courts have generally taken three different approaches when dealing with factually obsolete statutes: (1) enforce the statute \u201cas is\u201d; (2) invent a new interpretation, unimagined by the legislative drafters, that saves the statute from obsolescence; or (3) declare the obsolete statute unconstitutional. Calabresi at 6. As Judge Calabresi puts it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-6\">Faced with [the problem of an obsolete statute], it is little wonder that the least willful judges have responded to their task with open aversion, but have enforced time-worn interpretations of even more time-worn laws. Other judges have acted far more aggressively and used the Constitution or far-fetched interpretations to make obsolete laws functional.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AU\"><em>Id. </em>All of these approaches are unsatisfactory. Applying a factually obsolete statute \u201cas is\u201d can result in serious injustice. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 6 n. 26 (citing <em>Behrns v. Burke, </em>89 S.D. 96, 229 N.W.2d 86 (1975) (stating that a statute was \u201cunreasonable ... In fact, unreasonable may be too kind an expression,\u201d yet upholding the statute)). Inventing a far-fetched interpretation to save an obsolete statute makes the court appear willful and undermines its important role in conscientious and careful modes of ordinary statutory interpretation. <em>See id. </em>at ch. IV (discussing the problems that arise from judges using \u201cstretched\u201d interpretations of obsolete statutes). Perhaps worst of all is the choice to declare an obsolete statute unconstitutional. \u201cCalabresi ... cites scores of cases in which the courts have declared obsolete statutes unconstitutional when such a conclusion could not be justified by any cogent constitutional analysis....\u201d Richard Neely, <em>Obsolete Statutes, Structural Due Process, and the Power of Courts to Demand a Second Legislative Look, </em>131 U. Pa. L.Rev. 271, 277 (1982) [hereinafter Neely] (\u201cThe problem has traditionally been that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>due process and equal protection are the only constitutional theories available to unimaginative courts.\u201d). Stretching constitutional doctrines to judicially revise or eliminate obsolete statutes weakens the doctrines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-5\">New things will destroy judicial review, and weaken those rights we want to have protected by the Constitution, more effectively than its use to overcome legislative inertia in areas involving bad law, perhaps, but no real constitutional issue. Even correct results in cases of this sort, where the Constitution is used to invalidate a law that was only held in place by inertia and was inconsistent with other prevailing legal principles, will tend to spawn highly vulnerable constitutional doctrines and hence may weaken the \u201ccore\u201d rights that need to be protected by our constitutions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Calabresi at 11-12. Of course, a judicial determination that a particular statute is obsolete exacerbates the problem of legislative inertia by foreclosing the possibility of a legislative revision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-7\">Once the courts have modified or invalidated a statute on constitutional grounds, they have done much more than act in an area of legislative inertia. If the courts\u2019 aim is only to update in an area of inertia and if they are wrong in their judgment that a statute which does not fit the legal fabric no longer has majoritarian support, their use of constitutional adjudication makes legislative correction of their mistake impossible. The consequence of a wrong guess is not merely legislative revision, as in common law adjudication; a wrong guess will entail either a constitutional amendment or the dominance of judge-made law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 11.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">Cognizant of the challenges presented by obsolete statutes, and mindful of the pitfalls of the three approaches courts have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>taken, it is our view that the best way to proceed with an obsolete statute is not to take any of the three, but to rely on the traditional tools of statutory interpretation to effectuate the legislature\u2019s intent, as we have previously done when dealing with outdated statutes. <em>See, e.g., Sieglein v. Schmidt, </em>224 Md.App. 222, 242, 120 A.3d 790 (2015) (interpreting \u201cartificial insemination\u201d in parentage statute to encompass in vitro fertilization \u2014 a newer reproductive technology that didn\u2019t exist at the time of the statute\u2019s enactment \u2014 because the legislature intended to \u201cacknowledge the role of medically assisted, nontraditional conception of a child in establishing a parent\u2019s rights and obligations\u201d). Therefore, we will attempt to discern the legislature\u2019s intent in passing the DNA Admissibility Statute. Our principal aim in this undertaking is to determine if and how the legislature would have intended for us to enforce this now-obsolete statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Thus, we hold that the proper way to deal with a statute that is obsolete on its face is to look to the legislature\u2019s intent and work to effectuate that intent in the present legal and factual landscape. We note that it will not always be the case that the legislature will tell us what to do if a statute becomes obsolete. In this instance, however, we conclude that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">\n<em>2. Discerning Legislative Intent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">The DNA Admissibility Statute\u2019s legislative history is instructive. Our review strongly suggests that the 1997 statute was enacted to address a perceived drafting flaw in a previous version. The 1991 version of the DNA Admissibility Statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>allowed automatic admissibility of DNA that was analyzed with the restriction fragment length polymorphism method (\u201cRFLP\u201d), which it specified by name. CJP \u00a7 10-915 (1991) (amended 1997). By 1997, however, the RFLP method for DNA analysis had been superseded by a new technique, the polymerase chain reaction method (\u201cPCR\u201d). Jud. Proc. Comm., <em>Bill Analysis: H.B. 414 </em>(1997). Laboratories were using PCR but, because the 1991 DNA Admissibility Statute specified only RFLP by name, PCR was not automatically admissible. <em>Id. </em>In effect, the 1991 statute had become obsolete. As a result, state\u2019s attorneys throughout Maryland were forced to justify their use of PCR in every case at expensive <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearings. State of Maryland Department of State Police, <em>Position on Proposed Legislation HB 414 </em>(Feb. 11, 1997) (\u201cAn enormous amount of time and money has been spent defending PCR methods at <em>[Frye-Reed] </em>Hearings in various Circuit Court[s] in the State.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">In drafting the 1997 DNA Admissibility Statute, the General Assembly wanted to eliminate the need for <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearings for PCR analysis. <em>See </em>Jud. Proc. Comm., <em>Bill Analysis: H.B. 414 </em>(1997). (\u201cThis statute obviates the need for a Frye-Reed hearing on the admissibility of [PCR] evidence. This will save the State and the counties money and will keep law enforcement personnel out of court.\u201d) Furthermore, we gather that the legislature did not want to repeat the drafting weakness of the 1991 statute and identify the PCR method by name \u2014 such that when scientific advances inevitably replace PCR, the 1997 statute would become obsolete too. Rather, the legislature cleverly delegated the power to approve new DNA analysis techniques to two national standards-setting entities on the cutting edge of DNA science, TWGDAM and the DNA Advisory Board. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cThis bill expands the definition of \u201cDNA profile\u201d to include an analysis of genetic loci that has been validated according to standards established by either the Technical Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods (TWGDAM) or the FBI DNA Advisory Board.\u201d) In that way, we see that the 1997 DNA Admissibility Statute was designed to be obsolescence-proof. If a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>technique was good enough for TWGDAM and the DNA Advisory Board, it would be good enough for automatic admissibility in Maryland courts. <em>Id. </em>Those standards-setting entities soon became defunct, however, in effect, rendering the obsolescence-proof statute, ironically, obsolete. SWGDAM, <em>About Us, </em>http://perma.cc/VHA5-5FXX. Nevertheless, we discern that the legislature intended to create a statute that would track cutting-edge DNA science and ensure automatic admissibility only if the DNA techniques complied with the standards promulgated by the most rigorous standards-setting body available.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\n<em>3. Effectuating Legislative Intent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Having determined that the legislative intent in adopting the DNA Admissibility Statute was to permit automatic admissibility for cutting-edge DNA analysis if that analysis complied with the standards promulgated by the most rigorous standards-setting body, we must now determine if the Prince George\u2019s County DNA laboratory\u2019s DNA analysis\u2014 performed in compliance with the FBI\u2019s Quality Assurance Standards \u2014 satisfies that test. We find it useful, as the trial court did, to contrast the FBI\u2019s Quality Assurance Standards to those set by the Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods (\u201cSWGDAM\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">First, we recognize that SWGDAM is both the successor entity and the successor \u201cin spirit\u201d to both TWGDAM and the DNA Advisory Board. SWGDAM succeeded both of those organizations as the entity responsible for developing rigorous DNA analysis standards and recommending revisions to the FBI Quality Assurance Standards. SWGDAM, <em>About Us, supra. </em>TWGDAM developed the original guidelines for DNA analysis, beginning in 1989. <em>Id. </em>The forensic DNA community followed TWGDAM\u2019s guidelines when implementing their programs, making the guidelines the <em>de facto </em>standards, \u201crecognized by courts as minimum requirements for a quality DNA forensic analysis program.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Like TWGDAM, the DNA Advisory Board, established by the DNA Identification Act of 1994, produced comprehensive standards for the forensic DNA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>community. John M. Butler, <em>Forensic DNA Typing </em>593 (2d ed. 2005) [hereinafter Butler]. The DNA Advisory Board was responsible for recommending standards and revisions to the FBI for inclusion in the FBI Quality Assurance Standards. SWGDAM, <em>About Us, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">TWGDAM and the DNA Advisory Board no longer exist, and their responsibility for recommending rigorous standards for cutting-edge DNA technology has been transferred to SWGDAM. <em>Id. </em>In 1998, TWGDAM was renamed the \u201cScientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods\u201d or SWGDAM. Butler at 394. In 2000, the DNA Advisory Board expired at the end of its statutory term and \u201ctransferred responsibility for recommending revisions of [the FBI] Quality Assurance Standards to the Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods (SWGDAM).\u201d FBI, <em>CODIS </em>\u2014 Quality <em>Assurance, </em>http://perma.cc/7HHX-2X7E. SWGDAM succeeded TWGDAM and the DNA Advisory Board as the entity charged with recommending revisions for DNA analysis standards to the FBI. SWGDAM, <em>About Us, supra. </em>We have no doubt, as the trial court concluded, that a DNA analysis would be automatically admissible, pursuant to the DNA Admissibility Statute, if it bore a statement that it had been conducted pursuant to standards promulgated by SWGDAM.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">By contrast, the FBI Quality Assurance Standards fulfill a different purpose. Unlike SWGDAM\u2019s recommendations, which are based on cutting-edge DNA science, the FBI Quality Assurance Standards are the minimum requirements that must be followed by forensic DNA laboratories. FBI, <em>CODIS </em>\u2014 Quality <em>Assurance, supra; </em>SWGDAM, <em>Frequently Asked Questions, </em>http://perma.cc/H8LL-Q7EK (\u201c[SWGDAM guidelines] are intended to provide additional guidance to the DNA community ... and should not be treated as requirements or minimum standards for forensic DNA laboratories\u201d) As such, SWGDAM\u2019s recommendations are forwarded to the FBI for consideration, but the FBI is not required to incorporate every revision that SWGDAM recommends for the FBI Quality Assurance Standards. SWGDAM, <em>About Us, supra. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Furthermore, when the FBI does adopt a SWGDAM recommendation, the revised standard often does not apply retroactively. SWGDAM, <em>Frequently Asked Questions, supra; see </em>FBI, <em>SWGDAM Interpretation Guidelines for Autosomal STR Typing by Forensic DNA Testing Laboratories, available at </em>http://perma.cc/7D4J-D8J3 (\u201cThe revised guidelines are not intended to be applied retroactively.\u201d). Accordingly, although SWGDAM provides recommendations based on cutting-edge DNA techniques and research, older protocols that are \u201cgood enough\u201d remain in force because either the FBI chooses not to follow SWGDAM\u2019s recommendation or does not retroactively implement the recommendation. SWGDAM, <em>Frequently Asked Questions, supra </em>(stating that there is an underlying assumption that \u201cwork (validation, training, analysis, interpretation) performed prior to the issuance of the revisions was appropriate and scientifically valid\u201d). Therefore, we conclude that, unlike SWGDAM recommendations, the FBI Quality Assurance Standards do not reflect the most recent advances in DNA analysis. Thus, we hold that while a DNA analysis conducted pursuant to the FBI Quality Assurance Standards may be admissible, it is not automatically admissible under the DNA Admissibility Statute. Therefore, the trial court was correct in finding that the steering wheel DNA sample was not automatically admissible under the DNA Admissibility Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">II. <em>Frye-Reed </em>Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Having determined that the analysis of the steering wheel DNA sample is not automatically admissible under the DNA Admissibility Statute, we now turn to whether the trial court properly applied the <em>Frye-Reed </em>standard in concluding that the Prince George\u2019s County DNA laboratory used generally accepted scientific methodology to analyze the sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Phillips argues that the steering wheel DNA sample was inadmissible because the Prince George\u2019s County DNA laboratory\u2019s methodologies lacked reliability and general acceptance by the scientific community. Phillips challenges the following: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>(1) the lack of a stochastic threshold<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in analyzing the steering wheel sample; (2) the use of <em>\u201ca </em>filtering technique in a way for which the technique was not validated;\u201d and (3) the application of certain statistical computations to a DNA profile comparison, for which the computations are allegedly unfit to apply. While presented as three separate critiques of the Prince George\u2019s County DNA laboratory\u2019s methodologies, we note that Phillips\u2019 second and third challenges to the analysis of the steering wheel sample are, in essence, reiterations of his first critique regarding the lack of a validated stochastic threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">We hold that the State sufficiently demonstrated that the Prince George\u2019s County DNA laboratory\u2019s analysis of the steering wheel sample was admissible under <em>Frye-Reed. </em>The laboratory complied with the FBI Quality Assurance Standards, which while insufficient for automatic admissibility under the DNA Admissibility Statute, are, for reasons that we will describe, sufficient to show that the analysis is generally accepted in the relevant scientific community. Moreover, the experts testified that forensic laboratories commonly use the same methods employed by the Prince George\u2019s County DNA laboratory when analyzing complex, low copy number DNA. Therefore, any attack on the reliability of the DNA analysis properly went to the weight that the trier of fact should accord the evidence, rather than to its admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Under Maryland\u2019s <em>Frye-Reed </em>standard, \u201cbefore a scientific opinion will be received as evidence at trial, the basis of that opinion must be shown to be generally accepted as reliable within the expert\u2019s particular scientific field.\u201d <em>Reed v. State, </em>283 Md. 374, 381, 391 A.2d 364 (1978). Maryland\u2019s <em>Frye-Reed </em>\u201cjurisprudence engages trial judges in a serious gate-keeping function, to differentiate serious science from \u2018junk science.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blackwell v. Wyeth, </em>408 Md. 575, 591, 971 A.2d 235 (2009). The trial judge exercises this gatekeeping func<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>tion by holding a pre-trial <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing to determine \u201cwhether the challenged evidence is actually the product of a novel scientific technique and, if so, whether that technique is generally accepted in the relevant scientific community....\u201d <em>Clemons v. State, </em>392 Md. 339, 347 n. 6, 896 A.2d 1059 (2006). We review the trial court\u2019s determination of whether a scientific opinion is generally accepted <em>de novo. Blackwell, </em>408 Md. at 611, 971 A.2d 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">At the <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing in this case,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the central issue was whether the Prince George\u2019s County DNA laboratory had adequate methodologies to deal with the unique complications of complex, low copy number DNA. The DNA material in the steering wheel sample is both complex, meaning that there were three or more contributors, and low copy number, meaning that there was very little DNA material present. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>602 F.Supp.2d 658, 669 (D.Md.2009) (\u201c[Low copy number] testing involves testing minuscule amounts of DNA that fall below the (somewhat amorphous) stochastic threshold \u2014 around 100 picograms or less.\u201d). Low copy num<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>ber DNA is particularly susceptible to stochastic effects\u2014 random errors that make accurately analyzing the DNA more difficult \u2014 and increased risks of contamination. <em>U.S. v. Morgan, 53 </em>F.Supp.3d 732, 736 (S.D.N.Y.2014); Butler at 168-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Phillips argues that it is generally accepted that to analyze complex, low copy number DNA, forensic labs must adopt a validated stochastic threshold. During the <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing, two experts testified: Jessica Charak testified on behalf of the State and Dr. Charlotte Word testified on behalf of Phillips. In particular, the experts disagreed about the necessity of a validated stochastic threshold when analyzing complex, low copy number DNA. Both experts agreed, however, that (1) the Prince George\u2019s County DNA laboratory complied with the FBI Quality Assurance Standards, even though it did not use a stochastic threshold when analyzing the steering wheel sample; and (2) other forensic laboratories interpret complex, low copy number DNA without a validated stochastic threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\"><em>First, </em>Charak, a DNA analyst from the Prince George\u2019s County DNA laboratory, testified that the laboratory was fully compliant with the FBI Quality Assurance Standards, even though it did not employ a validated stochastic threshold. The genetic analyzer kit used to amplify the DNA in the steering wheel sample was validated in 2008, under a previous version of the FBI Quality Assurance Standards that did not require a stochastic threshold. While the current FBI Quality Assurance Standards require laboratories to establish a validated stochastic threshold as part of their internal validation procedures, that requirement was specifically not made retroactive, based on an assumption that the work performed prior to the requirement was appropriate and scientifically valid. FBI, <em>Quality Assurance Standards for Forensic DNA Testing Laboratories, available at </em>http://perma.cc/M84U-FYMP; SWGDAM, <em>Frequently Asked Questions, supra. </em>Thus, the Prince George\u2019s County DNA laboratory was fully compliant with the relevant FBI Quality Assurance Standards even though the analysis of the steering wheel sample did not include a stochastic threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number><em>Second, </em>other forensic laboratories interpret complex, low copy number DNA using the methodology employed by the Prince George\u2019s County DNA laboratory. Dr. Word, Phillips\u2019 expert witness, testified that validated stochastic thresholds are a best practice, but that not all laboratories use them. In her view, without a validated stochastic threshold, a laboratory cannot reliably determine whether an individual\u2019s DNA is actually present in a complex, low copy number DNA sample. Dr. Word was unable, however, to say that laboratories actually employ validated stochastic thresholds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-5\">[COUNSEL FOR STATE]: And is it generally the practice that forensic laboratories using [the] technique [used by the Prince George\u2019s County DNA laboratory] conduct additional valuation studies to determine analytic and stochastic threshold[s] ... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">[DR. WORD]: It is essential the correct procedure should be done. I don\u2019t know that many labs that have done it, but it should be done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Regarding typical forensic laboratories, Dr. Word further testified that laboratories would interpret complex, low copy number DNA samples:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-8\">[COUNSEL FOR STATE]: Let me ask you, would other labs interpret [complex, low copy number DNA]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-9\">[DR. WORD]: I think, unfortunately, other labs are, but I think they should not be, because the appropriate valuation studies to do the interpretation of these types of samples simply have not been done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-11\">[COUNSEL FOR STATE]: And [is it] common that [complex, low copy number DNA samples are] being interpreted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-12\">[DR. WORD]: I believe, unfortunately, that is probably true. I know a handful of labs that are interpreting, though I don\u2019t know what everyone is doing, but there are labs that are interpreting them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-13\">Dr. Word explained that laboratories are using outdated, albeit verified, procedures to analyze increasingly complex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>DNA samples for which the old procedures are ill-equipped. In effect, Dr. Word\u2019s testimony was that although all laboratories ought to use validated stochastic thresholds, many do so without those thresholds.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">In our gatekeeping function, we do not operate to enforce emerging best practices in a rapidly evolving scientific field. Rather, we keep out \u201cjunk science.\u201d <em>Blackwell, </em>408 Md. at 591, 971 A.2d 235. In this case, while the use of a validated stochastic threshold may be the current best practice, the Prince George\u2019s County DNA laboratory\u2019s failure to use a stochastic threshold does not make its analysis \u201cjunk science.\u201d Although, perhaps, not the best, most accurate, or most \u201ccutting-edge\u201d technique,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the Prince George\u2019s County DNA laboratory used a generally accepted methodology to analyze the steering wheel DNA sample. The laboratory followed Quality Assurance Standards promulgated by the FBI \u2014 the organization charged with setting minimum national standards for forensic laboratories. FBI, <em>CODIS </em>\u2014 Quality <em>Assurance, supra. </em>Additionally, Charak and Dr. Word both testified that forensic labs commonly use the methods employed by the Prince George\u2019s County DNA laboratory when analyzing complex, low copy number DNA. For these reasons, we find that the lack of a validated stochastic threshold does not mean that the analysis performed was \u201cjunk science.\u201d Any challenges to the Prince George\u2019s County DNA laboratory\u2019s lack of a set stochastic threshold properly goes, and did go, to weight rather than admissibility.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Because the Prince George\u2019s County DNA laboratory\u2019s methods were generally accepted in the relevant scientific community, we affirm the trial court\u2019s admission of the steering wheel DNA evidence. This is not to say that Phillips could not challenge the DNA evidence on the basis of a lack of stochastic threshold. Rather, it is our view that the proper avenue to do so was either to cross-examine Charak or to call <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>a rebuttal expert to attack the weight of the evidence. We find it telling that Phillips chose not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">III. Right to a Public Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Phillips\u2019 final argument on appeal is that the trial court improperly \u201csealed\u201d a portion of his trial in violation of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial.\u201d U.S. Const.amend. VI. Phillips urges us to find that in doing so, the trial court committed reversible error. As the courtroom was never closed to the public, however, there was no error, much less a violation of Phillips\u2019 constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Under the United States Constitution as applied in Maryland courts, \u201ccriminal trials are to be open to the public as a matter of course, and any closure of the courtroom for even part of the trial and only affecting some of the public must be done with great caution.\u201d <em>Robinson v. State, </em>410 Md. 91, 102, 976 A.2d 1072 (2009). The right to a public trial, however, is not absolute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-8\">The Sixth Amendment does not require a court to forfeit its legitimate and substantial interest in maintaining security and order in the courtroom. To the contrary, prophylactic measures, including closure, may be warranted under some circumstances, in order to maintain order, to preserve the dignity of the court, and to meet the State\u2019s interests in safeguarding witnesses and protecting confidentiality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ag-dedup-0\"><em>Walker v. State, </em>125 Md.App. 48, 69, 723 A.2d 922 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">At Phillips\u2019 trial, the trial court closed the courtroom while the jury instructions were read. Prior to issuing the jury instructions, the trial court explained that to prevent the jury, from being distracted, people would be prevented from exiting or entering the courtroom during the reading of the instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-10\">THE COURT: Now, just so everyone knows, once the jury comes in, we\u2019re going to be sealing the courtroom for jury instructions. So if you do not want to be in here to hear jury [instructions, you can leave. Once we seal the court<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>room, no one will be able to leave the courtroom until we conelude[ ] the jury instructions. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-5\">[COUNSEL FOR PHILLIPS]: I do object to the sealing of the courtroom during instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-6\">THE COURT: Okay, I\u2019m going to seal the courtroom during instructions____Mr. Bailiff, I will ask you [to] check [ ] the hallway. If anyone wants to come in the courtroom, let me know. We\u2019re going to seal the courtroom until after the jury comes in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-9\">[The jury enters and is seated]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-11\">THE COURT: At this time I\u2019m going [to] ask you Mr. Bobo to seal the courtroom. Mr. Bobo, <em>please inquire whether or not there is anyone in the hallway that wishes to come in.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-12\"><em>Or, if there is anyone in the courtroom that wishes to step out during instructions, please do so at this time. </em>If not, I\u2019m going to ask you remain in your seat until we conclude instructions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-13\">(emphasis added). The trial court made repeated efforts to ensure that anyone who wished to be present was in attendance. The public was not excluded from this portion of the trial. Therefore, there was no Sixth Amendment violation. Other courts that have considered similar fact situations have reached the same result. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>564 F.3d 34 (1st Cir.2009) (holding that there was no closure where spectators were prohibited from entering and exiting during jury instructions); <em>State v. Brown, </em>815 N.W.2d 609 (Minn.2012) (same). We affirm the sound discretion of the trial court in temporarily closing the courtroom from persons who wished to enter or exit while the jury instructions were read.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-14\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY AFFIRMED.

The State argues that while the trial court called the hearing a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing, the hearing that took place was actually an admissibility hearing under Md. Rule 5-702. We disagree. It is plain from the transcript that the trial court both called it a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing, and conducted it as such:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-7\">THE COURT: [T]he Court finds that I must have a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing on this issue before we can go any further.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">The trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion was also consistent with a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing, namely the trial court's conclusion that the scientific methodology was not novel, and was widely accepted in the relevant scientific community:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-9\">THE COURT: What was disputed among the experts that testified was how this data should be analyzed and reported; namely, whether an analytical threshold would be used or if a stochastic threshold was required. It further becomes abundantly clear that is not a novel discussion.... SWGDAM issued recommendations. The stochastic threshold is several years old, but the FBI has never adopted them, nor have they issued a directive requiring a lab to eliminate the analytical threshold method of analyzing the data.

We note that other courts that have dealt with the admissibility of low copy number DNA analysis have reached varying results, none of which are controlling in this case. See <em>People v.

While Phillips makes two additional challenges to the methodologies employed by the Prince George's County DNA laboratory, they are essentially finer-parsed arguments stemming from his primary claim that when dealing with complex, low copy number DNA, the only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>reliable methodology is to employ a validated stochastic threshold. As these arguments are derivative of the primary argument, our holding that the Prince George\u2019s County DNA laboratory used generally accepted techniques likewise applies to Phillips\u2019 two additional challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\"><em>First, </em>Phillips argues that the use of a post-amplification filtration system after the steering wheel sample has already undergone PCR amplification is not a generally accepted methodology. This allegation of error, however, is rooted in the Prince George\u2019s County DNA laboratory's lack of a validated stochastic threshold. At the hearing, Dr. Word testified that the Prince George\u2019s County DNA laboratory should not have used the Microcon filtration system after amplification without first conducting validation studies that addressed what the stochastic effects would be post-amplification. Dr. Word, however, did not challenge the underlying methodology:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-7\">[DR. WORD]: So the [pre-amplification] clean up step and that concentrating step ... give us enough DNA to proceed. And if I can jump ahead, because you\u2019re going to ask it it's the same thing for the post-amplification, that's functioning exactly in the same way, it\u2019s a clean-up step, it\u2019s a concentration step to then have more product to evaluate. And those have nothing to do with generating stochastic effect[s], the Microcon process. The stochastic effects come because we have too little DNA in the first place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">Dr. Word testified that the underlying issue was the lack of a stochastic threshold, not the use of a post-amplification filtration method \u2014 a method that she acknowledges is appropriate. Our holding that the Prince George\u2019s County DNA laboratoiy analyzed the steering wheel sample in a generally accepted manner even in the absence of a validated stochastic threshold applies to this argument as well, and, accordingly, we hold that use of the Microcon filtration system post-amplification is a generally accepted methodology.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\"><em>Second, </em>Phillips argues that the use of the Combined Probability of Inclusion (\"CPI\u201d) statistical computation for the steering wheel sample is not a generally accepted method of determining the likelihood of inclusion in a complex, low copy number sample. Phillips' argument to this point is again derivative of his argument that without the stochastic threshold, there is no way to be certain that stochastic effects have not occurred. As we held above, the Prince George\u2019s County DNA laboratory used an acceptable methodology to analyze the steering wheel sample. It follows then that the Prince George\u2019s County DNA laboratoiy\u2019s derivative conclusion \u2014 that the CPI program could be used- \u2014 -necessarily also survives a Frye-Reed challenge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
