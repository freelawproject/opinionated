Our holding is framed by the fact that, while the engineering firm and the contractor each had separate contracts with the government to perform work on the same design-bid-build construction project, there was no contract between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The City of Baltimore entered into a contract with Rummel Klepper &amp; Kahl, LLP (\u201cRK &amp; K\u201d or \u201cAppellee\u201d), a design engineering firm, to produce construction designs and associated documents for use by the successful bidder(s) on succeeding proposals for construction of the Patapsco Wastewater Treatment Plant. Fru-Con Construction Corporation, predecessor to Balfour Beatty Infrastructure, Inc. (\u201cBBII\u201d or \u201cAppellant\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was the successful bidder on the plant upgrade projects, and entered into Sanitary Contract 852R with the City in November 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Just over four years later, BBII filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against RK &amp; K, claiming that, during construction, BBII ran into costly delays and complications in reliance on RK &amp; K\u2019s allegedly defective designs and negligent misrepresentations concerning project timeline projections. The complaint sounded in tort, supported by the theory that RK &amp; K had a duty to BBII based on the \u201cintimate nexus\u201d between them, and asserted three causes of action: 1) professional negligence, 2) information negligently supplied for the guidance of others under Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 552, and, 3) negligent misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">RK &amp; K filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. RK <em>&amp; </em>K\u2019s central argument was that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>complaint sought recovery for purely economic losses, and, because there was no contractual privity or its equivalent between BBII and RK &amp; K, the economic loss doctrine barred BBII\u2019s tort claims. The circuit court granted the motion to dismiss in an order entered on April 10, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">We affirm. We hold that BBII failed to state a claim because, as a matter of law, in the absence of privity, death, personal injury, property damage, or the risk of death or serious personal injury, no duty of care in tort runs from an engineer or architect to a contractor for purely economic losses on a public construction project. In reaching this holding, we determine that Maryland does not expand the \u201cintimate nexus\u201d test to include extra-contractual concepts of duty for the recovery of solely economic losses in public construction cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AWF\">Design-bid-build contracts</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Under the \u201cdesign-bid-build\u201d project delivery method utilized by the City in this case, the owner first enters into a contract with an architect and/or engineer (\u201cA/E\u201d or \u201cdesign professional\u201d) to design the project. Typically, the engineering and design is completed before the owner releases a request for proposals for a general contractor to perform the work.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 1 Bruner &amp; O\u2019Connor Construction Law \u00a7 2:11 (2015). Under this method:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">(1) the design is fully developed and completed before the pricing of the work, thus, presumably resulting in lowest cost, and (2) selection among responsible and responsive bidders can be made on the basis of price alone ... the contractor is excluded from contributing to the design process ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number><em>Id. </em>The A/E and the contractor each have a contract with the owner, but they have no contractual relationship with each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">In contrast, integrated delivery methods, such as \u201cdesign-build,\u201d create a single point of responsibility because the A/E and the contractor are bound under a single contract with the owner. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2:12. Typically the contractor who is part of a design-build team is involved in aspects of the design of a project from the beginning, and the A/E remains involved\u2014 normally in an oversight and advisory role \u2014 during the construction phase. <em>Id.; </em>5 Bruner &amp; O\u2019Connor Construction Law \u00a7 17:52 (2015) (explaining the modern trend to minimize the A/E\u2019s previous \u201csubstantial involvement in the construction process\u201d to a lesser obligation to \u201cobserve the work and determine in general if the work is being performed in accordance with the contract documents.\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The traditional design-bid-build model often engenders tensions between the A/E and the construction contractor, as explained in one treatise on the subject:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">A fundamental difficulty in allocating liability under the design-bid-build model is the inherent tension between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>interests of the architect and contractor. Some contractors believe they can increase profits through change orders that are based on ambiguities, errors, or omissions in the architect\u2019s design. Architects have an interest in protecting their designs, and frequently serve as the owner\u2019s representative during construction. In these situations, it benefits the architect to resist any suggestion that the design is flawed and deny change order requests based on defective plans and specifications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-4\">Because of these competing interests, it can be difficult for the owner to determine whether the architect or contractor is responsible for a delay.... To complicate matters further, it may not be possible to join the architect and contractor in a single action[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Robert F. Cushman <em>et al., Proving &amp; Pricing Construction Claims </em>\u00a7 9.03[A][1] (3d ed.2015). As discussed further <em>infra, </em>under traditional design-bid-build contracts, especially in the public sector, the contractor normally has a contractual entitlement to recover against the owner for construction delays and other benefit-of-the-bargain damages caused by the A/E\u2019s defective specifications and designs.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">RK &amp; K\u2019s Professional Engineering Services Contract</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">According to the complaint,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> sometime prior to October 2009,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the City entered into a contract with RK &amp; K for the design of two interrelated projects to upgrade the plant, termed the \u201cEnhanced Nutrient Removal Facilities.\u201d According to BBII, the City\u2019s contract with RK <em>&amp; </em>K specified that RK &amp; K was to produce accurate, complete, and correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>construction designs and drawings for use by the successful bidder(s) who would construct the plant upgrades. RK &amp; K\u2019s duties and responsibilities allegedly included, but were not limited to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-4\">\u2022 Development of the design for the two interrelated projects;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">\u2022 Development and preparation of drawings and specifications for use by prospective contractors for preparing and submitting bids and ultimately for use by the successful contractor for the construction of the projects;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\">\u2022 Development of timelines for construction of the projects;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\">\u2022 Development and preparation of responses to questions regarding the design raised by prospective contractors during the bid phase;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-8\">\u2022 Review, evaluation, and comment on the proposals submitted by bidders/prospective contractors;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-9\">\u2022 Review, evaluation, and approval of various submittals from the successful contractor during construction related to the Work and RK &amp; K\u2019s design;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-10\">\u2022 Review, evaluation, and inspection of the successful contractor\u2019s Work during construction to assure conformance with RK &amp; K\u2019s design intent and design; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-11\">\u2022 Review, evaluation, and acceptance of the successful contractor\u2019s Work and certification to the City regarding the same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">Thus, in addition to its pre-construetion/design phase responsibilities, RK &amp; K was allegedly assigned several construction-phase responsibilities, including: 1) evaluating and approving \u201cvarious submittals\u201d from the contractor related to the work and RK &amp; K\u2019s design; 2) inspecting the contractor\u2019s work during construction to assure conformance with RK &amp; K\u2019s design intent and design; and, 3) review, evaluation, and, if acceptable, certification of the contractor\u2019s work to the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Sanitary Contract 852R</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">Construction work for the projects under Sanitary Contract 852R (\u201cSC 852\u201d) and Sanitary Contract 845R (\u201cSC 845\u201d)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was to be completed at the same time, although SC 852 was let out for bid prior to SC 845. After it was pre-qualified by the City as capable of performing the work, Fru-Con Construction Corporation (predecessor in interest to BBII) bid on the SC 852 project, directly relying upon RK &amp; K\u2019s documents and designs.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">On November 20, 2009, Fru-Con Construction Corporation and the City entered into a contract for the SC 852 project (\u201cContract\u201d). Several years later, on January 1, 2014, the City agreed to an assignment of the Contract from Fru-Con Construction, LLC, to BBII.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under the Contract, BBII was to, \u201camong other things,\u201d construct thirty-four \u201c[d]enitrification filter cells (\u2018DNF cells\u2019) adjacent to the existing wastewater facility.\u201d DNF cells are \u201cenormous, concrete tubs that hold massive amounts of wastewater to be treated.\u201d The Contract also required BBII to construct pipes and pipe support systems for the SC 852 project.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>BBII\u2019s Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">In its complaint filed on January 6, 2014, BBII related that RK <em>&amp; </em>K designed the DNF cells to expand or contract at keyed joints located in their concrete walls to accommodate fluctuating water pressure. BBII constructed the DNF cells in accordance with RK &amp; K\u2019s designs, but, when the water retention integrity of the DNF cells was tested, BBII learned that the cells were leaking due to cracks in the expansion and contraction joints. BBII alleged that these cracks and the associated leaks were a direct result of deficiencies in RK &amp; K\u2019s design and that it cost BBII substantial additional time and expense to remediate the problems. BBII also claimed that, once construction was underway, it discovered RK &amp; K\u2019s design for the pipe support system was defective, and again, suffered substantial additional time and cost remedying RK <em>&amp; </em>K\u2019s allegedly defective pipe system design.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Finally, BBII contended that RK &amp; K delayed completion of its design of the companion project, SC 845, and that RK &amp; K knew that any delays in the design of SC 845 would delay BBII\u2019s ability to complete work on SC 852 and expose BBII to substantial costs and expenses. BBII alleged RK &amp; K failed to properly establish a reasonable contract duration or project timeline for SC 852, and, instead, supplied false information to prospective contractors who were developing their estimates and competitive bids for the projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Predicated on these factual allegations, BBII asserted a claim for Professional Negligence (Count I), Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 552 (Count II), and Negligent Misrepresentation (Count III). In Count I, BBII claimed that it was a foreseeable party that would directly rely upon RK &amp; K\u2019s professional services and designs, and, that \u201cbased upon the intimate nexus between [RK &amp; K\u2019s] design and [BBII\u2019s] work as well as the contractual privity equivalent that exists between [RK &amp; K] and [BBII], [RK &amp; K] owed [BBII] a duty to act with a reasonable degree of care, knowledge, diligence and skill ordinarily possessed and exercised by similarly situated design professionals.\u201d BBII demanded an estimated $10 mil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>lion in damages for \u201cincreased and additional labor, materials, equipment and subcontractor costs, investigative costs, consultant fees, remediation costs, and delay costs.\u201d In Count II (Restatement \u00a7 552 for \u201cInformation Negligently Supplied for the Guidance of Others\u201d), BBII contended that it suffered damages \u201c[a]s a direct and proximate result of [RK &amp; K\u2019s] failure to exercise reasonable care in preparing, supplying and communicating the design, including plans and specifications, for the Project.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Finally, in its third count for negligent misrepresentation, BBII posited that, as a result of the overlapping responsibilities of RK &amp; K in both the design and construction phases of the project, and, because RK &amp; K knew that BBII would rely on RK &amp; K\u2019s design and project duration schedule, \u201can intimate nexus and contractual privity equivalent exists between [RK &amp; K] and [BBII].\u201d According to BBII, RK &amp; K knew that the design of SC 845 was not sufficiently complete so as to allow SC 582 to be constructed within the contract schedule, and RK &amp; K faded to warn BBII that the prices and ultimate costs of completing SC 852 would far exceed estimates.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Motions Before the Circuit Court</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">After it was served with a copy of the complaint, on January 29, 2014, RK &amp; K filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim in the circuit court. In its memorandum of points and authorities, RK &amp; K argued that BBII failed to plead any facts that would support finding the existence of a legally cognizable duty in tort running from RK &amp; K to BBII.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Invoking the \u201ceconomic loss rule,\u201d RK <em>&amp; </em>K argued that, in the construction industry, in the absence of privity or death, injury or a genuine risk of death or serious personal injury or property damage, no duty is owed by an architect or engineer to a contractor where the loss or damage alleged is economic in nature. RK <em>&amp; </em>K asserted that there was no contract between the parties, and argued that the \u201cintimate nexus\u201d and Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 522 concepts of extra-contractual duty have never been applied in Maryland to design <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>professionals in the construction field. Nonetheless, RK &amp; K contended that BBII failed to allege facts that would allow a court to find the parties shared an \u201cintimate nexus\u201d or \u201cprofessional/client relationship.\u201d RK &amp; K asserted that, for example, there were no allegations in the complaint regarding any specific communications between RK &amp; K and BBII before or during construction, or consultations between BBII and RK &amp; K on BBII\u2019s bid or schedule assumptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">RK &amp; K advanced the principles that support the economic loss rule as applied in the construction industry; namely, that common variables and \u201cunknowns\u201d \u2014 such as hidden site conditions, owner-directed changes, material and labor shortages, price escalations, defective materials, change orders and errors \u2014 are addressed through contracts that allocate risks and provide mechanisms for the assertion of claims and resolution of disputes. RK &amp; K asserted that \u201c[w]hen considered in the construction industry context,\u201d BBII\u2019s \u201cpitch to apply tort principles in order to bypass its bargained-for rights ... [is] a disruptive tactic that only can undermine public confidence in public procurement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">In its response filed February 20, 2014, BBII argued that RK &amp; K misconstrued Maryland case law because the \u201ceconomic loss rule\u201d applies to products liability claims and was not meant to be a shield for professional malpractice. BBII defended its failure to allege facts detailing the provisions of BBII\u2019s contract(s) with the City because the causes of action alleged in the complaint were separate from any claims BBII may have had against the City. BBII challenged RK &amp; K\u2019s assertion that the complaint failed to allege facts showing a relationship between RK &amp; K and BBII on the ground that the complaint alleged that BBII was one of a limited group of pre-qualified, prospective contractors and that RK &amp; K knew the City\u2019s prospective contractors would directly rely upon RK <em>&amp; </em>K\u2019s design in preparing their bids. Finally, BBII argued that under Maryland law, a plaintiff seeking purely economic losses is not foreclosed from bringing an action for negligent misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>RK <em>&amp; </em>K replied, adding that tort liability should not be extended in this case because the \u201cSpearin Doctrine\u201d should have sheltered BBII from the risk of suffering the benefit-of-the-bargain type economic damages alleged in the complaint.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The doctrine, as enunciated in <em>United States v. Spearin, </em>applies specifically to construction projects and provides that \u201cif the contractor is bound to build according to plans and specifications prepared by the owner, the contractor will not be responsible for the consequences of defects in the plans and specifications.\u201d 248 U.S. 132, 136, 54 Ct.Cl. 187, 39 S.Ct. 59, 63 L.Ed. 166 (1918) (citations omitted); <em>see also Dewey Jordan, Inc. v. Maryland-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>258 Md. 490, 498, 265 A.2d 892 (1970) (\u201cthe contracting authority impliedly warrants that the plans and specifications are adequate and sufficient for the purpose intended and that the contractor is entitled to be compensated for delays in work occasioned by faulty plans and specifications.\u201d). Thus, RK &amp; K argued, that if its designs were indeed defective, and if BBII had a right to rely on them (as BBII alleged in the complaint), then BBII would have been entitled to reimbursement from the City for any extra costs incurred under its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>contract with the City under the <em>Spearin </em>doctrine. On the other hand, if BBII could not establish that RK &amp; K\u2019s designs were defective, or if it was determined that BBII failed to follow or properly interpret the designs, then BBII\u2019s tort claims would fail as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">On March 14, 2014, BBII filed a motion for leave to file a sur-reply. BBII argued that RK &amp; K misapplied the <em>Spearin </em>Doctrine because, although courts have held that the contracting authority impliedly warrants that plans and specifications supplied under the contract are adequate, and that the contractor is entitled to be compensated for certain costs and delays, those courts have never held that the implied warranty was a \u201climitation on a contractor\u2019s ability to pursue another, viable cause of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">On April 2, 2014, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City heard argument from counsel on the pending motion to dismiss. At the close of the hearing, the circuit court orally granted RK <em>&amp; </em>K\u2019s motion, finding that there was no privity between the parties giving rise to a tort duty under the current law in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">BBII filed a motion to reconsider on April 7, 2014, along with a memorandum of law, arguing (1) that privity is not a requirement for a claim under Restatement (Second) Torts \u00a7 552, or negligent misrepresentation, and (2) the circuit court did not consider the \u201cequivalent of privity\u201d between BBII and RK &amp; K to support BBII\u2019s professional negligence claim. On May 6, 2014, the circuit court denied BBII\u2019s motion for reconsideration, and, on May 15, 2014, BBII noticed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">BBII presents three questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">I. Does an engineer owe a duty to a contractor when the engineer is aware that the contractor will rely upon the engineer\u2019s services to the contractor\u2019s detriment if the engineer\u2019s services are negligently performed, even though no contract exists between the engineer and contractor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>II. Does a contractor have a cause of action under Restatement of Torts (Second) \u00a7 552 against an engineer for negligently supplied information when the design professional knew the contractor would rely upon the information supplied and be harmed by the engineer\u2019s negligence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-4\">III. Does a contractor have an action for negligent misrepresentation against an engineer when the engineer: (a) intended the contractor to rely upon the representations (i.e., design); (b) knew that the contractor would rely upon the design; and (c) knew that the contractor would be harmed if the design was negligently performed?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"asq-dedup-0\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Appellate courts \u201creview [ ] the grant of a motion to dismiss for legal correctness.\u201d <em>Rounds v.

According to BBII, RK &amp; K breached a duty to BBII to act with the reasonable care of a design professional in creating designs for the SC 852 project, and in \u201cfailing to establish a reasonable duration\u201d for the construction of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">The elements required to establish a cause of action for professional negligence are equivalent to the elements required in a standard negligence action; the professional, however, is held to the standard of care that prevails in his or her profession. <em>See Crockett v.

The <em>Walpert </em>Court further clarified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-4\">\u201c[T]here can be no negligence where there is no duty that is due; for negligence is the breach of some duty that one person owes to another....

Cent., </em>96 Md. at 666, 54 A. 669). In <em>Jacques, </em>the Court of Appeals instructed that two major considerations in determining whether a tort duty should be recognized in a particular context are \u201cthe nature of the harm likely to result from a failure to exercise due care, and the relationship that exists between the parties.\u201d 307 Md. at 534, 515 A.2d 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">A. The Economic Loss Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Most states recognize that lack of privity between the parties is not, alone, a bar to a negligence claim. <em>See Council of Co-Owners Atlantis Condo., Inc. v. Whiting-Turner Contracting Co., </em>308 Md. 18, 32, 517 A.2d 336 (1986) (\u201cIn following the modern trend, we hold that privity is not an absolute prerequisite to the existence of a tort duty.\u201d); <em>Adams v. Buffalo Forge Co., </em>443 A.2d 932, 939 (Me.1982) (\u201cWe hold, therefore, that lack of privity does not constitute a bar to an action alleging negligence on the part of the manufacturer\u201d); <em>Barni v. Kutner, </em>76 A.2d 801, 803 (Del.Super.Ct.1950) (stating that \u201clack of privity is no defense in a negligence case under certain conditions.\u201d) (citation omitted). But in cases such as the one presented here, in which a contractor sustains higher than anticipated costs based on the allegedly defective designs of an engineering firm with which it has no contract, states are divided over whether and in what circumstances a negligence claim to recover the costs is barred by the \u201ceconomic loss doctrine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>The general rule is that a party cannot recover against another in tort where the resulting harm is purely economic loss and the parties have no contract between them. <em>See Robins Dry Dock &amp; Repair Co. v. Flint, </em>275 U.S. 303, 48 S.Ct. 134, 72 L.Ed. 290 (1927); <em>see also U.S. Gypsum Co. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>336 Md. 145, 156, 647 A.2d 405 (1994). The recovery of purely economic, benefit-of-the-bargain-type damages has long been limited in the United States. In <em>Robins, </em>Justice Holmes addressed the issue in a suit brought by the charterers of a steamship against a dry dock for damages for loss of the use of the vessel. <em>Id. </em>at 307, 48 S.Ct. 134. The dry dock company was contractually responsible to the vessel owner to perform periodic servicing. <em>Id. </em>When the dry dock company negligently broke a propeller, the Supreme Court held that the charterers could not recover their economic damages from the dry dock, either as third-party beneficiaries to the owner\u2019s service contract, nor for the dry dock company\u2019s negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 308-09, 48 S.Ct. 134. Justice Holmes explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-4\">[The charterer\u2019s] loss arose only through their contract with the owners \u2014 and while intentionally to bring about a breach of contract may give rise to a cause of action, no authority need be cited to show that, as a general rule, at least, a tort to the person or property of one man does not make the tort-feasor liable to another merely because the injured person was under a contract with that other unknown to the doer of the wrong. The law does not spread its protection so far.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 308-09, 48 S.Ct. 134 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">In Maryland, we acknowledge that \u201c \u2018the first obstacle which arises [to imposition of a duty] is the fact that there has been no direct transaction between the plaintiff and the defendant, which usually is expressed by saying that they are not in \u2018privity\u2019 of contract.\u2019\u201d <em>Whiting-Turner, </em>308 Md. at 26, 517 A.2d 336 (quoting <em>Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 18.5, at 708-10 (2d ed.1986)). The rationale supporting the requirement of privity (or, as we shall explain <em>infra, </em>a \u201cprivity equivalent\u201d) as a condition to the recovery of economic dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>ages for negligent conduct is \u201cto avoid \u2018liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class.\u2019 \u201d <em>Walpert, </em>361 Md. at 671, 762 A.2d 582 (quoting Chief Judge Cardozo in <em>Ultramares Corp. v. Touche, </em>255 N.Y. 170, 174 N.E. 441, 444 (1931)). Still, Maryland courts have established that the economic loss doctrine does not always apply to bar recovery of economic damages. <em>See, e.g., Lloyd, </em>397 Md. at 121, 916 A.2d 257 (stating that the economic loss doctrine will not bar a claim for products liability where the product at issue [defective car seats that collapse rearward in rear-impact collisions] creates a dangerous condition that \u201cgives rise to a <em>clear danger of death or personal injury.\u201d </em>(citation omitted)); <em>A.J. Decoster Co. v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., </em>333 Md. 245, 254-60, 634 A.2d 1330 (1994) (stating that economic loss can be recovered for property damage through strict products liability claims where the damage is caused by \u201cunreasonably dangerous products.\u201d); <em>Cash &amp; Carry America, Inc. v. Roof Solutions, Inc., </em>223 Md.App. 451, 468-470, 117 A.3d 52 (2015) (holding that the economic loss doctrine did not bar a negligence claim against a contractor by a third party where the risk of harm was personal injury and property damage).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">In construction matters, the law in Maryland contours more narrow circumstances under which the economic loss doctrine does <em>not </em>bar tort claims for purely economic loss. As explored further below, a construction contractor\u2019s ability to recover for economic losses against a design professional where there is no contractual privity is generally limited to situations involving death, personal injury, property damage, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>or the risk of death or serious personal injury. <em>See Whiting-Turner, </em>308 Md. at 35, 517 A.2d 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">i. Privity, Property Damage, Death, Injury, or the Risk of Death or Serious Personal Injury</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">In <em>Whiting-Turner, </em>the Court of Appeals held that builders and architects have a duty, even where no privity exists between the parties, to use due care in the design, inspection, and construction of a project that extends to \u201cpersons foresee-ably subjected to the risk of personal injury because of a latent and unreasonably dangerous condition resulting from that negligence.\u201d 308 Md. at 22, 517 A.2d 336. In <em>Whiting-Turner, </em>a condominium owners\u2019 association brought a negligence action against the general contractor, developer, and architects of a building, alleging that their negligence had resulted in the deficient construction of the building and created a fire hazard that \u201cpresent[ed] a threat to the safety and welfare of the owners and occupants.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22-23, 517 A.2d 336. The unit owners also alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that, in advertising and selling the units, the developer negligently misrepresented \u201cthe building\u2019s suitability for occupancy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23, 517 A.2d 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The builder and certifying architects filed motions to dismiss, contending that the complaint failed to allege facts sufficient to show they owed a duty of care to the unit owners. <em>Id. </em>The defendants argued that a duty should not be recognized because the unit owners had only suffered economic loss, not personal injury or property damage. <em>Id. </em>at 23-24, 517 A.2d 336. The trial court concluded it was bound by the Court of Appeals\u2019 statement in <em>Marlboro Shirt, </em>that \u201c \u2018a contractor owes no duty to the general public for which it may be made responsible in an action in tort for negligence if it does not perform its contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29, 517 A.2d 336 (quoting <em>Marlboro Shirt Co. v.

The Court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"af-dedup-0\">the determination of whether a duty will be imposed in this type of case should depend upon the risk generated by the negligent conduct, rather than upon the fortuitous circumstance of the nature of the resultant damage. Where the risk is of death or personal injury the action will lie for recovery of the reasonable cost of correcting the dangerous condition.[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 35, 517 A.2d 336 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Eight years later in <em>Chambco, Div. of Chamberlin Waterproofing &amp; Roofing System, Inc. v.

This Court clarified that the appellees must have had an original duty to the condominium owners in the underlying suit in order to be liable to appellants for contribution and/or indemnity. <em>Id. </em>at 706, 795 A.2d 806. The appellants needed to \u201cplead clear facts that would support a finding of extreme danger and an imminent risk of severe personal injury,\u201d to circumvent the economic loss doctrine in order to find tort liability. <em>Id. </em>at 708, 795 A.2d 806 (citing <em>Morris, supra, </em>340 Md. at 536, 667 A.2d 624).

After reviewing established principles governing application of the doctrine, we explained that \u201cthe economic loss doctrine serves as a boundary between contract law, the purpose of which is to enforce the expectations of the parties to an agreement, and tort law, the purpose of which is to protect people and property from foreseeable risks of harm by imposing upon others a duty of reasonable care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 466, 117 A.3d 52 (citing <em>East River S.S.

BBII also made no claim of damage to property. Therefore, the economic loss doctrine bars BBII\u2019s claim of professional negligence against RK &amp; K for purely economic losses. <em>See Whiting-Turner, </em>308 Md. at 35, 517 A.2d 336; <em>Chambco, </em>101 Md.App. at 680-81, 647 A.2d 1284; <em>Heritage Harbour, </em>143 Md.App. at 708, 795 A.2d 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">ii. The \u201cPrivity Equivalent\u201d Analysis Does Not Apply</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">BBII asks this Court to hold for the first time, that where there is no contract between a construction contractor and a design professional in a negligence action for the recovery of purely economic losses, an intimate nexus, and therefore a duty in tort, can be established by demonstrating a \u201cprivity equivalent\u201d between the parties. BBII argues that, as stated in the complaint, its relationship with RK &amp; K satisfies the intimate nexus test because BBII was not a member of an \u201cindeterminate class,\u201d but, rather, as bidder on the contract with the City, was known to RK <em>&amp; </em>K as an entity that would rely on RK <em>&amp; </em>K\u2019s schematics after winning the bid for the contract. Thus, RK &amp; K owed a duty to BBII to act with reasonable care.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">In riposte, RK &amp; K states that no Maryland appellate court has recognized a tort claim by a contractor against a not-in-privity design professional for the type of damages allegedly suffered by BBII. RK &amp; K\u2019s principal argument relies on policy \u2014 that Maryland contract law allows government contractors to recover against the owner in negligent design cases under the <em>Spearin </em>Doctrine, and that many state supreme courts have expressly denied recovery for contractors against architects, engineers, and designers. RK <em>&amp; </em>K contends that the intimate nexus analysis does not apply to this case at all, but that even if it did, RK &amp; K owed no duty to BBII because the circumstances alleged in the complaint do not rise to the level of privity or its equivalent. RK &amp; K maintains that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>facts were alleged in BBII\u2019s complaint concerning \u201cany design-phase interactions\u201d between RK &amp; K and BBII.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">As we next explain, although we agree that the law does not impose a duty of care that would sustain an action for professional negligence against RK &amp; K on the complaint filed in this case, we do not adopt RK &amp; K\u2019s blanket contention that the intimate nexus analysis does not apply in construction contract cases. Rather, we hold that in government construction matters such as the case on appeal,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the intimate nexus analysis is not expanded to include \u201cprivity equivalent\u201d concepts of extra-contractual duty for the recovery of solely economic losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Generally, \u201cwhen the failure to exercise due care creates a risk of economic loss only, and not the risk of personal injury, we have required an \u2018intimate nexus\u2019 between the parties as a condition to the imposition of tort liability.\u201d <em>Swinson v.

The court found that the relationship and dealings between the parties amounted to a contract and that the contract contained an implied promise to use reasonable care. <em>Id. </em>at 540, 515 A.2d 756.

There, the Court found that an accounting firm that had prepared a financial report for a business in a negligent manner was liable to a third party who relied on the report in deciding whether to loan the business money and then suffered economic damages. <em>Id. </em>at 692-94, 762 A.2d 582.

The Court of Appeals concluded that this approach reflected the same policy reported in prior Maryland cases involving negligence claims brought by non-contractual third parties, and it \u201climit[ed] the unpredictable and unlimited nature of economic damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 675, 762 A.2d 582 (citation omitted).

In reaching its holding, the <em>Walpert </em>Court focused on the third prong of the test \u2014 the requirement for conduct linking the parties \u2014 and concluded that the accountant\u2019s proven knowledge that the third party would rely on the report satisfied the legal privity equivalent. <em>Id. </em>at 684-92, 762 A.2d 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Maryland state appellate courts have not applied the \u201cprivity equivalent\u201d test in a construction case sounding in tort for economic damages against a design professional.

[and] reasonable minds could find that a sufficient nexus existed between the parties to substitute for privity of contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147. <em>See also Nicholson v. Turner/Cargile, </em>107 Ohio App.3d 797, 669 N.E.2d 529, 535 (1995) (concluding that \u201ca design professional who exercises \u2018excessive control over the contractor\u2019 through the power to stop the work and give orders about the project is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>liable for such economic damages.\u201d (citing <em>Clevecon, </em>628 N.E.2d at 147)).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Similarly, the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia held that the lack of privity was not an absolute bar to recovery for economic damages in tort against a design professional where there was a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the parties. <em>E. Steel Constructors, Inc. v. City of Salem, </em>209 W.Va. 392, 549 S.E.2d 266, 275 (2001). In <em>E. Steel, </em>the appellate court reversed the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to a design professional in a professional negligence action where the design professional and contractor were separately employed by the same project owner. <em>Id. </em>The court held that \u201ca design professional (e.g. an architect or engineer) owes a duty of care to a contractor, who has been employed by the same project owner as the design professional and who has relied upon the design professional\u2019s work product in carrying out his or her obligations to the owner, notwithstanding the absence of privity of contract between the contractor and the design professional, due to the special relationship that exists between the two. Consequently, the contractor may, upon proper proof, recover purely economic damages in an action alleging professional negligence on the part of the design professional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">We return to the threshold considerations presented at the beginning of this discussion to determine whether, in Maryland, we should extend the \u201cprivity equivalent\u201d concept of extra-contractual duty in an action for professional negligence in a public construction industry case that does not involve a risk of death, serious injury, or property damage. Accordingly, whether to find a duty in tort, we must examine \u201cthe nature of the harm likely to result from a failure to exercise due care, and the relationship that exists between the parties.\u201d <em>Jacques, </em>307 Md. at 534, 515 A.2d 756. The <em>Jacques </em>Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">We discern from our review of the development of the law of tort duty that an inverse correlation exists between the nature of the risk on one hand, and the relationship of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>parties on the other. <em>As the magnitude of the risk increases, the requirement of privity is relaxed-thus justifying the imposition of a duty in favor of a large class of persons where the risk is of death or personal injury. </em>Conversely, as the magnitude of the risk decreases, a closer relationship between the parties must be shown to support a tort duty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZh\"><em>Jacques, </em>307 Md. at 537, 515 A.2d 756 (emphasis supplied). \u201c \u2018[D]uty is not sacrosanct in itself, but is only an expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the plaintiff is entitled to protection.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sanchez, </em>213 Md.App. at 110, 73 A.3d 343 (some internal quotations omitted) (citing Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts \u00a7 53 at 358.) \u201cIn other words, \u2018the determination of whether a duty exists represents a policy question of whether the specific plaintiff is entitled to protection from the acts of the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108, 73 A.3d 343 (citing <em>Gourdine v.

In the construction industry, parties can delimit their economic risk by defining their respective rights and liabilities contractually. We read our precedent, embracing the <em>Spearin </em>doctrine, to encourage, rather than discourage, design professionals and contractors to communicate with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>each other on public works projects where necessary in the interest of public safety. Especially in situations where the design professional is hired as a neutral agent of the owner, expanding Maryland law to permit exposure to tort liability for economic loss would create a chilling effect on the design professional\u2019s neutrality and ability to communicate effectively. We agree with the observations of the Supreme Court of Washington that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-4\">[t]here is a beneficial effect to society when contractual agreements are enforced and expectancy interests are not frustrated.... The preservation of the contract represents the most efficient and fair manner in which to limit liability and govern economic expectations in the construction business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-5\"><em>Berschauer/Phillips, supra, </em>881 P.2d at 992-92. Accordingly, we hold that the \u201cprivity equivalent\u201d concept of extra-contractual duty does not apply in an action for professional negligence against a design professional by a contractor seeking purely economic damages on a public construction project where there is no death, personal injury, property damage, or the risk of death or serious personal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 552</p>\n<p id=\"AcN\">BBII also argues that the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 552 provides plaintiffs in Maryland with a cause of action for harm stemming from information negligently supplied for the guidance of others and that it was error for the circuit court to dismiss this claim presented in Count II of the complaint. BBII states that this tort is independent of its other two claims. RK &amp; K maintains in response that Restatement \u00a7 552 has not been applied in Maryland in cases involving architects, engineers, or contractors not in privity with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Maryland courts have adopted the Restatement \u00a7 552 as an alternative means of satisfying the intimate nexus test. <em>Swinson, supra, </em>360 Md. at 477, 758 A.2d 1008; <em>see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number><em>Sanchez, </em>213 Md.App. at 115, 73 A.3d 343 (citing <em>100 Inv.

P\u2019ship, supra, </em>430 Md. at 230, 60 A.3d 1).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In lieu of demonstrating the equivalent of contractual privity under the three-prong test developed in <em>Credit Alliance Corp., supra, </em>a plaintiff can demonstrate a privity equivalent under Restatement \u00a7 552. <em>Id. </em>However, for the same reasons that we declined to apply the \u201cprivity equivalent\u201d analysis of the <em>Credit Alliance </em>and <em>Walpert </em>line of cases to satisfy the intimate nexus test, we also decline to apply the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 552 in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">In <em>Sanchez, </em>we examined the application of \u00a7 522 as an alternative to contractual privity in a case in which a physician, who provided life expectancy estimates to an insurance provider for viatical policies, was sued by investors for negligence in underestimating life expectancies. <em>Sanchez, </em>213 Md.App. at 97-100, 73 A.3d 343. There, we determined that \u00a7 552 was not a basis for imposing a tort duty on the physician. <em>Id. </em>at 118, 73 A.3d 343. We noted that the \u201cundisputed evidence shows that Sanchez had no inkling of [the insurer\u2019s] actual role in the purchase of the viatical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>policies.... The mere possibility that [the insurer] might disclose the evaluation to others [the investors] is an insufficient basis to expand the scope of Sanchez\u2019s duty.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">BBII maintains that, because RK &amp; K should have known that BBII was among the entities that would bid on the SC 852 contract with the City, \u00a7 552 permits recovery against RK &amp; K \u201cby the person or one of a limited group of persons for whose benefit and guidance [RK <em>&amp; </em>K] intends to supply the information or knows that the recipient intends to supply it.\u201d Restatement \u00a7 552(2)(a). BBII underscores in its briefing that we also said in <em>Sanchez, </em>that \u201chad [the insurer] told Sanchez that it was not purchasing viatical policies for its own benefit but was instead doing so as an agent for investors, Sanchez might owe a duty to those investors even if he did not know their specific identities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although this dicta lends some support to BBII\u2019s argument, it does not translate to the imposition of a tort duty under these facts where there was no pre-determined set of bidders for the project. Moreover, this case involves two sophisticated businesses working on the same construction project. They each negotiated their independent contracts with the owner in what they understood was a \u201cdesign-bid-build\u201d construction project with the City of Baltimore. The relationship between BBII and RK &amp; K \u2014 two veteran business entities in the construction field \u2014 is not at all similar to the relationship between the physician and the investors in <em>Sanchez. </em>The investors in <em>Sanchez </em>are more comparable to the client in <em>Jacques, </em>or the third-party investor in <em>Walpert </em>\u2014 parties who typically cannot recover their expectation-type damages from anyone other than the professional on whom they relied for advice. <em>See Jacques, supra, </em>307 Md. at 540, 515 A.2d 756; <em>Walpert, </em>361 Md. at 692-94, 762 A.2d 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">But even if the Restatement \u00a7 552 analysis had application in the present context, BBII failed to allege facts sufficient to support this alternative intimate nexus equivalent. Under Restatement \u00a7 552(1), BBII must plead facts that establish RK <em>&amp; </em>K provided <em>false information </em>and failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>exercise reasonable care or competence. The Court of Appeals explained in <em>Walpert:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\">For liability to attach under \u00a7 552, the plaintiff must be a member of a limited class to whom the accountant intends to supply the information or to whom the accountant knows the recipient intends to supply it, <em>who suffers loss through reliance on the information for substantially the same purpose as the bona fide </em>client.[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">361 Md. at 677, 762 A.2d 582 (citation omitted) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Here, the complaint states simply that \u201cRK &amp; K failed to exercise reasonable care and competence in preparing, supplying and communicating the design to [BBII] and in failing to timely design the 845R project so that it would not impact the completion of the [SC 852] Project.\u201d There is no allegation in the complaint that RK &amp; K made a false statement other than the allegedly flawed designs, or that RK &amp; K told BBII that the 845R project would be completed on a certain date. BBII does not allege any facts to demonstrate that RK <em>&amp; </em>K did not exercise reasonable care or competence, other than making a conclusory statement that they did not. Therefore, we concluded that the utility of Restatement \u00a7 552 as an alternative means to establishing an intimate nexus is not applicable to this case, and even if it were, BBII failed to allege facts sufficient to meet the elements of \u00a7 552. We affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">III. Negligent Misrepresentation</p>\n<p id=\"A8e\">BBII presents another alternate theory for recovery in Count III, alleging that RK &amp; K is liable under the tort of negligent misrepresentation. Relying on <em>Whiting-Turner, supra, </em>308 Md. at 41, 517 A.2d 336, BBII asserts that Maryland has recognized a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation seeking only economic loss that does not require contractual privity. BBII argues that it specifically pled in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>complaint the elements of negligent misrepresentation, including that \u201cRK &amp; K made a false statement; i.e., RKK\u2019s design was flawed\u201d and that RK <em>&amp; </em>K intended that its design be relied upon by a \u201cdistinct class of persons \u2014 prospective contractors bidding on the Project, including BBII.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">RK &amp; K relies on its general contention that, in Maryland, the economic loss doctrine bars design professionals in the construction field from liability for purely economic loss suffered by a contractor, \u201cin the absence of privity, death, injury or a risk of death or serious personal injury, or property damage.... \u201d RK <em>&amp; </em>K maintains that its position is supported by sound policy, citing to <em>LAN/STV, supra, </em>wherein the Supreme Court of Texas considered whether a contractor could recover for negligent misrepresentation against the project architect. 435 S.W.3d 234. The contractor alleged that, \u201c[i]n the course of providing the referenced plans, drawings, and specifications, LAN/STV made representations, in a transaction for which it was compensated, where those representations were false, misleading and/or inaccurate and were made with the knowledge that contractors such as EBY would rely upon them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237 n. 10. The Supreme Court held that the contractor was barred from bringing a negligent misrepresentation claim by the economic loss rule because the construction industry has the \u201cfreedom to allocate economic risk through contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">As stated in <em>Whiting-Turner, </em>\u201c[t]he tort of negligent misrepresentation has been recognized in this State.\u201d 308 Md. at 41-42, 517 A.2d 336 (citing <em>Flaherty v. Weinberg, </em>303 Md. 116, 135, 492 A.2d 618 (1985); <em>Martens Chevrolet, Inc. v. Seney, </em>292 Md. 328, 439 A.2d 534 (1982)). In Maryland, common law negligent misrepresentation is comprised of the following elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">(1) The defendant, <em>owing a duty of care to the plaintiff, </em>negligently asserts a false statement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">(2) The defendant intends that his statement will be acted upon by the plaintiff;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>(3) The defendant has knowledge that the plaintiff will probably rely on the statement, which, if erroneous, will cause loss or injury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\">(4) The plaintiff, justifiably, takes action in reliance on the statement; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">(5) The plaintiff suffers damage proximately caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-6\"><em>Flaherty, </em>303 Md. at 135, 492 A.2d 618 (emphasis in <em>Flaherty) </em>(citing <em>Martens Chevrolet, </em>292 Md. at 337, 439 A.2d 534); <em>see also Walpert, </em>361 Md. at 656-57, 762 A.2d 582. To recover damages in a tort action for fraudulent misrepresentation, \u201ca plaintiff must prove that a false representation was made, that its falsity was either known to the maker or that the representation was made with such reckless indifference to the truth as to be equivalent to actual knowledge of falsity, that the representation was made for the purpose of defrauding the plaintiff, that the plaintiff not only relied on the representation but had a right to rely on it and would not have done the thing from which the injury arose had the misrepresentation not been made, and that the plaintiff actually suffered damage directly resulting from the misrepresentation.\u201d <em>Swinson, supra, </em>360 Md. at 476, 758 A.2d 1008 (citing <em>Gittings v. Von Dorn, </em>136 Md. 10, 15-16, 109 A. 553 (1920); <em>Martens Chevrolet, </em>292 Md. at 333, 439 A.2d 534).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">For claims of economic loss based on negligent misrepresentation, the injured party must demonstrate it had an \u201cintimate nexus\u201d relationship with the defendant in order to establish that the defendant owed a duty to the injured party. <em>See Jacques, supra, </em>307 Md. at 534-35, 515 A.2d 756. In <em>Walpert, </em>the Court of Appeals determined that a duty could be imposed on accountants to a non-contractual plaintiff if the plaintiff could establish an intimate nexus through the privity equivalent test developed in <em>Credit Alliance. </em>361 Md. at 681, 689-93, 762 A.2d 582; <em>see also Sanchez, supra, </em>213 Md.App. at 107-109, 73 A.3d 343 (explaining that negligent misrepresentation\u2019s duty element requires satisfaction of the intimate nexus test as stated in Walpert).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>The cases surveyed above and throughout this opinion make plain that the prerequisites for establishing the duty element are the same for negligent misrepresentation and professional negligence claims in Maryland.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Because, in this case, there was no contract between the parties, to impose a duty for negligent misrepresentation would require that we apply the \u201cprivity equivalent\u201d test, or Restatement \u00a7 552, to determine whether there was an intimate nexus between the parties. Just as we did with respect to BBII\u2019s claim of professional negligence, we reject the argument that extra-contractual concepts of duty permit the recovery of solely economic losses in the construction industry in a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The parties, both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>sophisticated businesses with experience in construction projects and contracts, were free to allocate their duties and risks in their contracts with the City. BBII\u2019s claims against RK &amp; K for benefit-of-the-bargain economic damages under theories of professional negligence and negligent misrepresentation based on allegedly inaccurate timelines and flawed specifications that belonged to the City are barred by the economic loss doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s dismissal of BBIFs negligent misrepresentation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-8\">.

As we have noted, <em>supra </em>at n. 5, the record does not contain any documents detailing the contract between BBII and the City. But even accounting for the possibility that the contract contained a \"no-damage-for-delay\u201d or similar clause, BBII would arguably have been entitled, under the <em>Spearin </em>Doctrine, to recover damages from the City for its reliance on the designs provided by the City, if those designs were in fact defective. <em>Dewey Jordan, Inc., supra </em>258 Md. at 499, 265 A.2d 892 (1970). In <em>Dewey Jordan, Inc., </em>the Court of Appeals concluded, following an examination of <em>United States v. Spearin, </em>that it would not enforce the public owner\u2019s no-damage-for-delay clause, reasoning that \" \u2018[t]he defendant cannot, by errors in the specifications, cause delay in plaintiff's completion of the work and then compensate plaintiff merely by extending its performance time and by payment of any added direct cost occasioned by changes to correct those errors.' \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 499, 265 A.2d 892 (quoting <em>Laburnum Constr. Corp. v. United States, </em>325 F.2d 451, 457 (1963)). In <em>Raymond Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Baltimore County, </em>45 Md.App. 247, 258, 412 A.2d 1296 (1980), this Court declined to relieve the Government of responsibility for inaccurate representations contained in specifications provided by County's engineer, despite \u201cexten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>sive and direct exculpatory clauses intended to place the responsibility and risk of inaccurate information upon the contractor.\u201d (quoting <em>Maryland Dept. of Public Safety &amp; Correctional Servs. v. PHP Healthcare Corp., </em>151 Md.App. 182, 202, 824 A.2d 986 (2003)). Notably, however, where delay damages are not caused by a contractor's reliance on the public owner\u2019s faulty plan specifications, the <em>Spearin </em>Doctrine does not apply and this Court has determined that \"no-damage-for-delay\u201d clauses are enforceable, even for delays not contemplated by the parties. <em>See State Highway Admin. v. Greiner Engineering Sciences, Inc., </em>83 Md.App. 621, 638-39, 577 A.2d 363 (1990) (enforcing a \"no-damages-for-delay\u201d clause in a state highway contract where the engineer suffered delay damages resulting from the SHA\u2019s numerous changes in the scope of the design work and funding uncertainties).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b476-5\">.

For example, in <em>Prudential Securities, Inc. v. E-Net, Inc., </em>this Court considered whether a corporation and transfer agent had a duty in tort to a stock broker under theories of negligence and negligent misrepresentation. 140 Md.App. 194, 200-206, 780 A.2d 359 (2001). First, this Court acknowledged that, to establish a duty in tort where the risk of loss is purely economic, the parties must share an intimate nexus, satisfied by contractual privity or its equivalent. <em>Id. </em>at 213-14, 780 A.2d 359. This Court then determined that the parties did not share a \"meaningful link\u201d to support a cause of action for negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 221, 780 A.2d 359 (quoting <em>Jacques, </em>307 Md. at 535, 515 A.2d 756). Later in the opinion, in considering the appellant\u2019s negligent misrepresentation claim, this court acknowledged that negligent misrepresentation is \u201cone variety of a negligence action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 230, 780 A.2d 359 (quoting <em>Walpert, </em>361 Md. at 654, 762 A.2d 582). After setting out the elements of a negligent misrepresentation claim, however, this Court summarily dismissed the claim, explaining, \"[a]s we discussed above ... neither [appellees] owed a duty to [appellant] in this situation.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Village of Cross Keys, supra, </em>315 Md. at 752-755, 556 A.2d 1126 (determining whether a duty in tort for purely economic loss existed <em>prior </em>to determining whether to treat the claim as one for negligent misrepresentation or one for negligent conduct).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b481-5\">. We are not persuaded that BBII's contention that RK &amp; K should have known BBII would be among the entities that would bid on the SC 852 contract establishes the kind of reliance required to sustain a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation. In <em>Raymond, supra, </em>this court explained why it found no error in the trial court\u2019s granting of Greiner\u2019s motion to dismiss Raymond International\u2019s suit against Greiner on the grounds of misrepresentation at the conclusion of Raymond\u2019s case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">It would serve no useful purpose to again restate the five prerequisites of proof required to sustain an action for misrepresentation or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>deceit. It is sufficient to state that the appellant failed to produce evidence from which could be found or inferred that Greiner intended to defraud by reason of the allegedly incorrect information it furnished to Raymond. Even assuming that Greiner was negligent in preparing the information it furnished to the bidders, that would not be sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff's burden as a misrepresentation induced by negligence or ignorance will not sustain an action for fraud____There was no testimony establishing clear and convincing evidence that Greiner's representations in this case were made for the specific purpose of defrauding the plaintiff. <em>This is particularly so when we note that at the time the information was supplied to the prospective bidders no one had any knowledge as to who the successful bidder would be.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-16\">45 Md.App. 247, 261-62, 412 A.2d 1296 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
