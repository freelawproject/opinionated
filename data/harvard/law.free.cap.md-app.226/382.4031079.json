He was sentenced to two consecutive life terms, plus ninety years. In this appeal, appellant challenges two evidentiary rulings. He also asserts that the trial judge erred in failing to give one of his requested jury instructions, and erred in considering impermissible matters when imposing the sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">QUESTIONS PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">On appeal, appellant asks this Court to review the following questions, which we have reordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-11\">1. Did the trial court err in allowing into evidence Tia Grannison\u2019s prior consistent statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-12\">2. Did the trial court err in allowing the prosecutor to impermissibly cross-examine appellant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-13\">3. Did the trial court err in refusing to propound a jury instruction on the testimony of an accomplice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-14\">4. Did the trial court rely on an impermissible sentencing consideration?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-15\">For the reasons stated herein, we perceive no reversible error, and affirm the judgments of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-16\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b407-17\">In the early morning hours of January 13, 2013, two couples \u2014 Sean Rhodes and his girlfriend, Shanelle Hopkins, along <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>with Rudy Hyman and his girlfriend, Joy Darden \u2014 were at an after-hours club in Baltimore City called 007s. When the group left that club, they went to another after-hours club on North Avenue called Rasta\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">This foursome was unaware that they had been noticed by the appellant and his group while they were at 007s. Appellant was also visiting clubs during the early morning in question. Appellant\u2019s group included some unnamed associates and Tia Grannison, a woman with whom he had a relationship. According to the testimony of Grannison, appellant spotted Sean Rhodes at 007s and expressed his belief that Rhodes had, at some earlier time, shot one of appellant\u2019s friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Appellant and his group followed Sean Rhodes\u2019s group to Rasta\u2019s. When the Rhodes group left Rasta\u2019s, appellant walked up to Rhodes as he was getting into his car, and shot him in the head at close range. Rudy Hyman stepped in front of his sister \u2014 Shanelle Hopkins \u2014 and Hyman was then also shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">The evidence reflected that, at the time of the shootings, Tia Grannison and another associate of appellant\u2019s were sitting in the car her group had taken to Rasta\u2019s. After the shots were fired, appellant ran back to the car. Grannison shouted to her co-occupant: \u201copen the door,\u201d and appellant and his friend then entered the back seat of the car, with Grannison seated in the middle of them. The car traveled a few blocks, and stopped in an alley. Appellant ordered everyone out of the car. Appellant announced: \u201cIf you are not a Blood then you\u2019ve got to die.\u201d He then shot Grannison in the stomach and face. She played dead, and he fled. But she lived, and testified for the prosecution at appellant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Grannison testified that, on January 13, 2013, she went to 007s with the appellant, whom she knew as \u201cPurple.\u201d She and appellant had known each other for \u201ca month or two,\u201d and had a relationship she described as \u201cfriendly\u201d and \u201csomewhat\u201d romantic. Once they arrived at 007s, appellant met up with some of his friends, whose names Grannison once knew but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>she claimed to have forgotten by the time of trial. Grannison first saw Sean Rhodes outside of 007s, while she was sitting in a car with appellant and his friends. She heard appellant say that Sean Rhodes had shot appellant\u2019s friend, and appellant said he wanted to shoot Sean Rhodes.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">Appellant and his group followed the Rhodes group to Rasta\u2019s. Appellant drove and parked around the corner from the club. Appellant and one of his friends got out of the car. Grannison described what happened next:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">Q. [BY THE STATE]: Did you hear any gunshots?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">A. [BY TIA GRANNISON]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">Q. Do you know how many?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-9\">Q. What, if anything, happened next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-10\">A. Then they came back to the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-11\">Q. Who\u2019s they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-12\">A. Purple and his friend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-13\">Q. And then what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-14\">A. He got in the back seat and the other boy got in the other side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-15\">Q. And where were you seated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-16\">A. In the middle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-17\">Q. And then what, if anything, happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-18\">A. And then they pulled off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-19\">Q. Do you know where they went?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-20\">A. I\u2019m not sure of the street name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-21\">Q. Did it take a while to get there, if you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-22\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-23\">Q. Then what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-24\">A. Then he said, Come on. Everybody go get in my car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"acj-dedup-0\">Q. Whose car was he referring to, if you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-25\">A. His car, Purple\u2019s car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Q. The car that he came to North Avenue with was not his car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">Q. And then what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-7\">A. He waited until they pulled off and then\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-8\">Q. Are you all right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-9\">A. Mm-hmm. He waited until they pulled off and he said, if you\u2019re not\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-10\">Q. Did you get out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-11\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-12\">Q. Who got out with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-13\">A. Purple and this other boy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-14\">Q. Ms. Grannison, can you just tell us what you heard from Purple?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-15\">A. He said, um, leave no witnesses to the scene if you\u2019re not a Blood. If you\u2019re not a Blood then you\u2019ve got to die.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-16\">Q. And then what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-17\">A. And then he shot me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-18\">Q. Where did he shoot you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-19\">A. In my stomach and my face.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-20\">Q. Is that all? What happened next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-21\">A. I mean, he was going to shoot me again, but I guess the gun got jammed\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-22\">[BY APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-23\">[BY THE COURT]: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-24\">[BY TIA GRANNISON]: \u2014 and\u2014the gun got jammed and he ran. I laid there like I was dead. I got up and ran the other way. I ran on somebody\u2019s door and I fell on their, I fell in their doorway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-25\">[BY THE STATE]: And then what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-26\">A. I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Q. Do you remember telling anybody at the hospital who did this to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-5\">A. I think it was the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">Q. And what did you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">[BY APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">[BY THE COURT]: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-9\">[BY TIA GRANNISON]: I told them Purple shot me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">Grannison identified appellant as her assailant when the police interviewed her at the hospital on January 16. Although her jaw was wired shut and she could not speak, she was able to put an \u201cX\u201d next to appellant\u2019s photo in a photo array presented to her by detectives. On February 6, after her discharge from Shock Trauma, she gave police a recorded statement identifying appellant as the person who shot her. She also identified him in open court, and pointed him out for the jury in surveillance video from a local business. Granni-son was consistent in stating that appellant was the person who shot her.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">Appellant testified in his defense at trial. He agreed that he had been in a group partying and clubbing that night, and that he had been at 007s and Rasta\u2019s. He agreed that it was him depicted in the surveillance footage from which Grannison identified him. But he denied knowing Sean Rhodes or Rudy Hyman, and claimed that, when they were shot, he was standing on the sidewalk, smoking a cigarette. He testified that he heard the gunshots and ran back to the car where Grannison was waiting. He also claimed to know nothing about how Tia Grannison ended up getting shot. He gave this account of what took place when he and his group were outside Rasta\u2019s, near the intersection of North Avenue and Smallwood Street:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-12\">[BY APPELLANT]: I was standing on North Avenue and Smallwood Bottle Bar [sic], smoking a cigarette, taking a cigarette break and I heard gun shots. And when I heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>gun shots I got scared and I ran to the car and jumped in the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-4\">Me and my friend, we ran back to the car and we jumped in the car. And then we left. And as I left, as we left it was just enough for me that night, it was just too much that night, gun shots, partying and all that, and I wanted to leave and I just told dudes to drop me off where my car was at, and that\u2019s where I got dropped off and I left. And I left Tia with them guys because Tia wanted to, basically they was going to give Tia a ride home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The jury convicted appellant of first-degree murder of Sean Rhodes; using a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence; wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun; conspiracy to murder Sean Rhodes; first-degree assault of Rudy Hyman; using a firearm in the commission of that crime; wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun, as to the assault on Mr. Hyman; attempted murder of Tia Grannison; using a firearm in the commission of that crime; and wearing, carrying, or transporting a firearm in the commission of that crime. It had also been stipulated that appellant was prohibited from being in possession of a firearm, and he was found guilty of being a prohibited person in possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">On April 14, 2014, the court sentenced appellant to two consecutive life sentences, plus ninety years. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">I. Tia Grannison\u2019s prior consistent statement</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in permitting the prosecutor to play for the jury a recording of the investigating officers\u2019 February 6 interview of Tia Grannison. The recording was played, over appellant\u2019s objection, during the State\u2019s redirect examination of Grannison. Leading up to the trial court\u2019s ruling that the recording could be played, the following transpired.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>On direct examination during the State\u2019s case, Tia Granni-son testified to the following: she was with her friend \u201cPur<em>ple\u201d </em>\u2014 ie., appellant \u2014 during the early morning hours of January 13; some friends of Purple\u2019s whose names she did not recall at the time of trial were also with them; she overheard Purple say that Sean Rhodes had shot Purple\u2019s friend, and Purple therefore wanted to shoot Sean Rhodes; the whole group with Purple followed Sean Rhodes\u2019s group to Rasta\u2019s, and Purple and one of his friends then exited the car; she then heard gunshots; Purple and his friend ran to, and reentered, the car; the group then drove to an alley; the other men left; Purple turned to Grannison and said, \u201cLeave no witnesses to the scene if you\u2019re not a Blood. If you\u2019re not a Blood then you\u2019ve got to die\u201d; and Purple then shot her in the face and stomach and ran away.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">She testified that she was interviewed by police on January 16, while she was still in the hospital with her jaw wired shut. She was nevertheless able to identify appellant from a photo array on that date. The photo array procedure was videotaped, and the videotape and the photo array were both admitted into evidence, without objection. The State also played surveillance video from a business near the shootings of Rhodes and Hyman, and Grannison pointed out for the jury the vehicle in which she and Purple and his friends arrived at Rasta\u2019s, and, in a later clip, she pointed out appellant falling down trying to get back in the car after she heard gunshots.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Appellant\u2019s counsel began cross-examination by questioning Ms. Grannison about the recorded statement she gave police on February 6 \u2014 the same statement which he argues on appeal, should not have been admitted into evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s cross-examination included questions that suggested Grannison was not telling the complete truth about the extent of her prior knowledge of, and participation in, the shootings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>of Sean Rhodes and Rudy Hyman. The questions suggested that she was not being totally forthcoming regarding the identities of appellant\u2019s associates who were present on the evening of the shooting, and further suggested that, in light of the fact that she had never been charged with any crime, Grannison may have been promised some deal in return for her testimony against appellant. A representative excerpt of the cross-examination of Grannison is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">[BY APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: All right. Ma\u2019am, you were interviewed by Detective Robert Ross on February 7, 2013, [sic] correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-8\">[BY TIA GRANNISON]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-9\">Q. And your memory was better at that time, when it was closer to the incident, wasn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-11\">Q. Ma\u2019am, isn\u2019t it true that at the time you gave the statement to Detective Ross you said you never saw Purple shoot anybody?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-12\">A. Yes, I said I didn\u2019t see him shoot anybody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-13\">Q. Okay. So then what you said on direct examination, that you saw Purple shoot the guy is not true, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-14\">[BY THE STATE]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-15\">[BY TIA GRANNISON]: I didn\u2019t say that.[<footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em>]</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-16\">[BY THE COURT]: That\u2019s answered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-17\">[BY APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: You said Purple shot him, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-19\">[BY TIA GRANNISON]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-20\">Q. You didn\u2019t see him shoot him, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-21\">A. Mm-hmm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-22\">Q. So you were parked, actually, around the corner from where Rasta\u2019s was, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-5\">Q. All right, and then the person that we see running back to the car and slipping, that you say is Purple, that\u2019s at 5:51, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-6\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">Q. Okay. So between 5:26 and 5:51 the car had turned around and you were sitting in the car, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-8\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-9\">Q. And it was you and one other boy, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-10\">A. And there was another boy in the front.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-11\">Q. Okay so there were two in the car with you and two had gotten out, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-12\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-13\">Q. And there was also another car that was with you, isn\u2019t that correct? That\u2019s what you told Detective Ross?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-14\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-15\">Q. You told Detective Ross there was another car, and that was the car that was behind you, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-16\">A. I think\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-17\">Q. You have to answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-18\">A. I think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-19\">Q. Okay. And, in fact, there was a third car, isn\u2019t that correct? The one that was parked across the street, on the corner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-20\">A. The little gold car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-21\">Q. The little gold car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-22\">A. I\u2019m not sure if it was with us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-23\">Q. Okay, well, what time did you leave 007s?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-24\">A. I\u2019m not sure what time it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-25\">Q. Okay, but you were there partying that night, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-26\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-27\">Q. And you say you were with Purple and his friends, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">Q. And you had hung out with Purple before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">Q. And you knew his friends, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">A. Yeah, but I didn\u2019t know their names. I mean, I forgot their names.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-9\">Q. But you knew them by their street names, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-10\">A. I forgot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-11\">Q. You forgot? Okay. So sitting in court today you forgot who those people were?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-12\">A. No, I\u2019ve forgot their names.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-13\">Q. So you were never asked who any of the other individuals were in the car that you were in, which included Purple and three other guys, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-14\">A. Mm-hmm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-15\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-16\">Q. All right, and you remember Detective Ross asking you, on February [6]th, if you knew any of the other boys?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-17\">And, Ms. Grannison, when Detective Ross asked you about who the other boys were in the car or involved with this, you didn\u2019t know, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-18\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-19\">Hi Hi *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-20\">Q. Ma\u2019am, did you \u2014 were you ever asked \u2014 did you ever point out anybody else, or did you ever identify anybody else who was in your group?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-21\">A. Yeah, I think I did. I don\u2019t remember though.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-22\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-23\">A. I don\u2019t remember. I just remember Purple because he\u2019s the one that shot me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Q. Would it surprise you that in your statement, that was recorded with Detective Ross, that you never said that Purple said he was going to shoot this guys [sic], it was always they said they were going to shoot this guy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ain-dedup-0\">A. It was like \u2014 say that again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\">Q. In your recorded statement to Detective Ross, isn\u2019t it true that you always said, they said they said they were going to shoot this guy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">A.

The State then proposed to play for the jury the recording of that statement, the transcript of which appellant had been using to cross-examine Grannison. Appellant objected, and the parties approached for a bench conference, at which the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcK\">[BY THE COURT]: And the transcript that you [Mr. Defense Counsel] were using is the one from the same [February 6] statement with Detective Ross?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-9\">[BY APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-10\">[BY THE COURT]: And that\u2019s what the audio is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-11\">[BY APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: They provided that to me\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-12\">[BY THE STATE]: That\u2019s what the audio is, and that\u2019s the one I intend on playing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-13\">[BY THE COURT]: Okay, and so you\u2019re saying that he can\u2019t play her testimony, or her statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-14\">[BY APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: I don\u2019t think he can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A--\">[BY THE COURT]: You don\u2019t think he can?

State, </em>429 Md. 85, 106-07, 55 A.3d 10 (2012), and <em>Holmes v. State, </em>350 Md. 412, 424, 712 A.2d 554 (1998). At trial, appellant argued that the statement could not be played because it was hearsay. When the State noted that the statement was admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule, namely Rule 5-802.1(b), appellant responded as quoted above. He did not argue, as he does now, that any statements made to police by Grannison after the crime would have been inadmissible because they were given after her involvement in the crime and therefore were statements made after she had a motive to fabricate. This contention was not made at trial, and has not been preserved for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">II. Cross-examination of appellant</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in allowing the State, during its cross-examination of appellant, to ask several questions about whether the prior witnesses against him were lying. <em>See Hunter v. State, </em>397 Md. 580, 589, 919 A.2d 63 (2007) (\u201cit is impermissible, as a matter of law, for a witness to give an opinion on the credibility of another witness\u201d); <em>accord Bohnert v. State, </em>312 Md. 266, 277-78, 539 A.2d 657 (1988) (\u201cWhether a witness on the stand personally believes or disbelieves testimony of a previous witness is irrelevant, and questions to that effect are improper, either on direct or cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>examination.\u201d \u201cTestimony from a witness relating to the credibility of another witness is to be rejected as a matter of law.\u201d); <em>Parker v. State, </em>189 Md.App. 474, 496-500, 985 A.2d 72 (2009) (\u201cAs in <em>Hunter, </em>the \u2018were-they-lying\u2019 questions the prosecutor asked Parker [the defendant] were improper.\u201d); <em>Hall v. State, </em>107 Md.App. 684, 692, 670 A.2d 962 (1996) (\u201cEvery witness is prohibited from testifying that, in his or her opinion, the testimony given by another witness is false.\u201d (footnote omitted)); 6 Lynn McLain, Maryland Evidence (3d ed. 2013) \u00a7 701:6 (\u201cThe prosecution may not ask an accused whether he contends that the State\u2019s witnesses are lying.\u201d); Joseph F. Murphy, Jr., Maryland Evidence Handbook (4th ed. 2010) \u00a7 1303 (\u201cBecause nobody is competent to read anyone else\u2019s mind, it is improper to ask a witness whether another witness was \u2018lying.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The State responds that appellant\u2019s argument regarding this issue is \u201cmostly unpreserved.\u201d The State points out that the court expressly overruled only one of his objections, and the appellant made no motions to strike any of the testimony about which he now complains. The State further asserts that any prejudice would have been minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Although we conclude that appellant preserved an issue relative to asking a witness to comment on the credibility of testimony of other witnesses, we are persuaded that any error in this regard was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">\n<em>a. Preliminary agreement?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Appellant has characterized as impermissible four questions the State posed to him during the prosecutor\u2019s cross examination. The first such question was asked after the prosecutor had asked a series of questions about the events that transpired prior to the shootings. After appellant agreed with the prosecutor that acquaintances appellant knew as \u201cTim and Tia\u201d were in the car with him when they stopped on Smallwood Street near the intersection with North Avenue, the prosecutor asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-9\">[BY THE STATE]: <em>So everything Ms. Grannison testified to, up until this point, has been true and accurate?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>[BY APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-5\">[BY APPELLANT]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">[BY THE COURT]: There\u2019s your answer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Although appellant argues in his brief that the above question was an impermissible request for appellant to comment on the credibility of a prior witness, it is clear when the question is read in context that the prosecutor was, at this point in the cross-examination, suggesting that appellant\u2019s testimony was consistent with Grannison\u2019s account of what transpired up to that point in the evening. <em>See Tyner v. State, </em>417 Md. 611, 617, 11 A.3d 824 (2011) (\u201cwe must consider not only precisely what the focal testimony was at trial, but also the context in which it was used\u201d). Although it would have been preferable for the prosecutor to phrase the question in a manner that did not ask the appellant to agree that the prior witness\u2019s testimony had been \u201ctrue and accurate,\u201d we fail to discern any prejudice to appellant flowing from the trial judge\u2019s failure to sustain this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">\n<em>b. Why would they lie?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">The second and third questions appellant challenges as impermissible came after the prosecutor asked a series of questions based upon Grannison\u2019s testimony as to which appellant had given contrary testimony. The second and third questions appellant challenges did not specifically ask \u201cdid she lie?\u201d but asked appellant what motive the prosecution\u2019s witnesses would have to lie. The pertinent exchange on cross-examination was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-11\">Q.[BY THE STATE] So Tia, a woman that you had relations for a couple of months, gets shot that morning. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-13\">A.[BY APPELLANT] I guess so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-14\">Q. But you didn\u2019t do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-15\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-16\">Q.

Did you not try to shoot her a third time but the gun jammed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-10\">[BY DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-11\">[BY THE COURT]: Overruled. You can answer, Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-12\">[BY APPELLANT]: No, I never shot anybody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-13\">[BY THE STATE]: <em>So help me understand, Mr. Horton. What motivation would Tia Grannison have to come into this courtroom, sit where you are and testify to this fabrication?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-14\">[BY DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-15\">[BY THE COURT]: If he knows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-16\">[BY APPELLANT]: I have no idea. Maybe Tia is scared. Maybe she was scared. Maybe she don\u2019t want to tell on the people who told on her, so she using me for some sort of outlet. But I\u2019m pretty sure Tia know I would never hurt her. Tia knows that, and I\u2019m sitting here today with my life on the line. I got to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-17\">[BY THE COURT]: Sustained, sustained, sustained. Next question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-18\">[BY THE STATE]: <em>Mr. Horton, what motivation would [Shanelle] Hopkins have to come into this courtroom and identify you?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-19\">[BY DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-20\">[BY THE COURT]: If you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-21\">[BY APPELLANT]: I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>[BY THE STATE]: Are the same people that Tia\u2019s concerned about the same people that [Shanelle] is concerned about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">[BY DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">[BY THE COURT]: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">[BY THE STATE]: Is this a conspiracy to get Ricky Horton?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-9\">[BY DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-10\">[BY THE COURT]: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">Although the italicized questions did not directly ask appellant if he contended that witnesses Grannison and Hopkins had lied in their testimony, appellant contends that these questions were \u201cclever variations of prohibited \u2018were they lying\u2019 questions,\u201d citing <em>Bohnert, supra, </em>312 Md. at 278, 539 A.2d 657, and <em>Hunter, supra, </em>397 Md. at 590, 919 A.2d 63. We agree with appellant that, under the circumstances, the questions regarding any possible motivation for Grannison and Hopkins to have testified falsely were impermissible, and the trial court erred in not sustaining appellant\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-13\">A motive for a witness to testify in a manner that is contrary to a party\u2019s interests is normally relevant information that is an appropriate subject of evidence. <em>See, e.g., </em>Maryland Rule 5-616, providing that \u201c[t]he credibility of a witness may be attacked through questions asked of the witness, including questions that are directed at ... [p]roving that the witness is biased, prejudiced, ... or has a motive to testify falsely,\u201d and further providing that \u201c[e]xtrinsic evidence of bias, prejudice, interest, or other motive to testify falsely may be admitted.\u201d Rule 5-616(a)(4) and -616(b)(3). And it is appropriate to cross-examine a witness about the witness\u2019s <em>own </em>motive to testify falsely. <em>Marshall v. State, </em>346 Md. 186, 192, 695 A.2d 184 (1997) (\u201cThe constitutional right of confrontation includes the right to cross-examine a witness about matters which affect the witness\u2019s bias, interest or motive to testify falsely.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>But, in most instances, when a witness is asked on cross-examination what possible motive another witness might have had to testify in a manner that is contrary to the testimony of the witness being cross-examined, the questioner has no expectation of eliciting evidence that might impeach the <em>previous </em>witness. In most instances, when a witness is asked on cross-examination about possible motives of other witnesses, the questioner anticipates that the witness being examined will not be able to offer any evidence of a motive for the prior witness to have testified falsely. Consequently, in most instances, as in the present case, there is no foundation for the question, and the question is tantamount to asking the witness: \u201cSo, not only are you are saying the prior witness was lying, but you cannot offer any explanation for why that witness would lie?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Neither appellant nor appellee cited a case in which the court expressly addressed the propriety of asking a witness on cross-examination what motive a previous witness might have had to testify falsely. Concerns regarding misuse of an unfounded inquiry about other witnesses\u2019 motives were addressed in Michael C. Plaxton, Casenote, <em>Portuondo v. Agard: Can a Criminal Defendant Be a Credible Witness?, </em>27 Am. J. Crim. L. 279 (2000). The author cites cases from Canada and Australia that have held questions asking \u201cwhy would the witness lie?\u201d to be objectionable. The author states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">The presumption of innocence requires, as a matter of policy, that the accused be regarded as if she had no compelling interest in deceiving the trier of fact----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-8\">The flipside of this dictum \u2014 that the accused may not be subjected to a presumption of unreliability \u2014 is the notion that prosecution witnesses (usually complainants) cannot enjoy a presumption of reliability. Such a presumption most commonly arises where the accused, during cross-examination, is asked why a prosecution witness would lie. The question implies that, if the accused cannot produce a reason why the witness would lie, the witness must be telling the truth. As the Ontario Court of Appeal noted, <em>[R. v. Stewart </em>(1994), 18 O.R.3d 509 (Can.),] the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>tacitly suggests that it is the burden of the accused to disprove the allegations leveled against her; that prosecution witnesses should be viewed as presumptively truthful and reliable. This effectively undermines the presumption of innocence and therefore takes on constitutional significance, though the issue has not generally been addressed in constitutional terms. Insofar as this line of questioning adversely impacts the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial, the prosecution is disallowed from approaching the accused \"with such a query. Where it is asked, the trial judge must not allow the burden to be shifted to the defendant to disprove the allegations....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">H* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">The Manitoba Court of Appeal commented upon the \u201cmischievous\u201d quality of the \u201cwhy-would-she-lie\u201d line of questioning [in <em>R. v. R. (A.), </em>1994 MBCA 4524 (Can.) ]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_Q\">[Q]uite apart from the irrelevancy of the accused\u2019s opinion, this type of question is mischievous in that it tends to place an improper burden on the accused to account for another\u2019s conduct. The inability of the accused to explain a conflict between his evidence and that of a Crown witness is not, of itself, a ground for disbelieving the accused. Sometimes, the motivation of an untruthful witness is obscure even to the trained mind of a psychologist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">The leading case in Canada on this issue is <em>R. v. Kusk, </em>[1999 ABCA 49 (Can.),] recently decided by the Alberta Court of Appeal. In a unanimous opinion, the court complained that the \u201cwhy-would-she-lie\u201d line of questioning: \u201cwrongly suggests that a complainant who is not deliberately lying must be correct, and that a complainant without an obvious motive to lie must be sincere. Neither thing need be true, still less true beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">The Australian approach to the \u201cwhy-would-she-lie\u201d line of questioning similarly conforms to the Canadian experience. In <em>Palmer v. R., </em>[ (1998) 151 ALR 16 (Austl.),] the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>High Court of Australia held that the prosecution cannot question an accused as to the possible reasons why a prosecution witness would fabricate an inculpatory story.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-5\">... As the majority in <em>Palmer </em>argues, the inability of the defendant to find some motive to lie on the part of the complainant is without any probative value that could mitigate the risk of offending the presumption of innocence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 287-89, 290-91 (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">There may be cases in which the party being cross-examined is known to have personal knowledge bearing on the motive of the prior witness to testify falsely, and inquiry into that topic would not be inappropriate in those cases. But this is not one of those cases. Appellant did not claim to know the witnesses\u2019 motives for testifying against him, and the record indicates that the prosecutor had no reason to believe that appellant could testify to any facts relevant to the witnesses\u2019 motives. Under such circumstances, a \u201cwhy-would-they-lie\u201d question calls for speculation and irrelevant opinion. Here, rather than require the appellant to respond to the \u201cwhy-would-they-lie\u201d questions, in the absence of a foundational proffer from the prosecutor that the appellant possessed relevant personal knowledge about the witnesses\u2019 motives, the trial court should have sustained the appellant\u2019s objections to the questions about Grannison\u2019s and Hopkins\u2019s motives.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">\n<em>c. Were they lying?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Appellant also complains about a fourth \u201cwere they lying\u201d question. That portion of the cross-examination was a follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-10\">[BY THE STATE]: <em>So Ms. Grannison, [and Shanellel Hopkins came in here and told stories, according to you?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-11\">[BY DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection. Asked and answered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-12\">[BY THE COURT]: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>[BY APPELLANT]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">As the State points out in its brief, the specific objection asserted with respect to this question was not that it was prohibited \u2014 by <em>Hunter </em>and similar cases \u2014 because it asked one witness to comment upon the credibility of other witnesses. Instead, the sole objection asserted was that this question had been \u201c[a]sked and answered.\u201d Although the question was clearly impermissible under <em>Hunter, </em>the Court of Appeals has consistently held that, \u201c \u2018where specific grounds are delineated for an objection, the one objecting will be held to those grounds and will ordinarily be deemed to have waived grounds not specified.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thomas v. State, </em>301 Md. 294, 328, 483 A.2d 6 (1984) (quoting <em>Jackson v. State, </em>288 Md. 191, 196, 416 A.2d 278 (1980)). Consequently, appellant\u2019s contention that this fourth question was an impermissible \u201cwere they lying\u201d question has not been preserved for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">\n<em>d. Harmless error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">With respect to the objections to the second and third questions (about possible motives for Grannison and Hopkins to lie), even though we conclude that appellant\u2019s objections to those two questions should have been sustained, such errors have been analyzed under the harmless error standard. <em>See, e.g., Brooks v. State, </em>439 Md. 698, 735-36, 98 A.3d 236 (2014) (even if it was error for the trial court to permit a nurse witness to testify that her \u201cexamination would verify the story that [the complaining witness] told me,\u201d such error was harmless); <em>Robinson v. State, </em>151 Md.App. 384, 393, 827 A.2d 167 (2003) (error in permitting detective to testify that complaining witness\u2019s statements to him were consistent was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt). <em>See also Ware v. State, </em>360 Md. 650, 679-80, 759 A.2d 764 (2000) (permitting witness to testify that \u201cthe prosecutor and detective said he was being truthful,\u201d although inadmissible, \u201cwas harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>In the instant case, there was substantial evidence in addition to the testimony of Grannison and Hopkins corroborating the State\u2019s contention that appellant shot and killed Sean Rhodes, shot Rudy Hyman, and shot Tia Grannison. The State obtained surveillance video of the area around Rasta\u2019s from the owner of a business located at the corner of North Avenue and Smallwood Street. The owner of the business testified that he had installed the surveillance system himself, that it contained \u201croughly about 50 cameras, inside and outside,\u201d that the outside cameras are equipped with infrared, so they can record in the dark; and that the cameras are motion-sensitive, and run 24 hours a day. The video recording played for the jury did not show the shooting, but did show appellant falling down as he was getting back into the car after Rhodes and Hyman had been shot. Appellant agreed that it was he shown on the video. He conceded that he was on Smallwood Street at the time of the shootings of Rhodes and Hyman, even though he claimed he did not shoot them. His testimony was that he was scared by the sound of the gunfire and he ran away.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Tia Grannison and Shanelle Hopkins did not know each other, yet each independently identified appellant as the perpetrator of shootings that were closely connected in time and place. Shanelle Hopkins testified that she saw her fianc\u00e9, Sean Rhodes, get shot in the face by appellant. She picked appellant out of a photo array on January 16. She wrote on the back of the array: \u201cThis is the guy that shot Sean.\u201d Hopkins also made an in-court identification of appellant as the person who shot Rhodes. As she testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">[BY THE STATE]: Now, Ms. Hopkins, in the course of police showing you [the photo array], did they tell you who to pick out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">[BY THE WITNESS]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">Q. Did they threaten or force you to pick out anybody?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-9\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-10\">Q. The person that you picked out is whom to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-11\">A. The guy that killed my daughter\u2019s father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Q. And are you certain of that identification?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">A. Yes, I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">Q. And looking at the Defendant today, is that the same person?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">A. Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">Tia Grannison also picked appellant out of a photo array on January 16, identified him again in a recorded statement on February 6, and identified him in court as the person who shot her on January 13. Appellant admitted that he had known Grannison for at least a couple of months, that they had been intimately involved, and had been together during the hours leading up to the shootings.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">Under the circumstances, given the volume of evidence in the case, and the fact that two totally unrelated witnesses identified appellant as a shooter, we are able to express a belief beyond a reasonable doubt that the brief testimony of appellant (quoted above) in denying knowledge of any motive for Grannison and Hopkins to fabricate their allegations did not contribute to the rendition of the guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">III. Jury instruction as to testimony of an accomplice</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">Appellant complains that the court erred in denying his request that the jury be given a \u201ctestimony of accomplice\u201d instruction as to Tia Grannison. <em>See </em>MPJI-Cr 3:11B, which provides, in part: \u201cAn accomplice is one who knowingly and voluntarily cooperated with, aided, advised or encouraged another person in the commission of a crime. The defendant cannot be convicted solely on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice.\u201d Appellant urged the court to give the instruction \u201cbased upon [Grannison\u2019s] testimony, going along for the ride knowing that the group was planning on killing Sean Rhodes. That squarely falls within aiding and abetting and she would be considered an accomplice.\u201d The prosecutor responded that \u201cMs. Grannison is not an accomplice in this,\u201d and pointed out for the court that the Comment to MPJI-Cr 3:11 states: \u201cAn accomplice is one who, knowingly and with common criminal intent [participated, cooperated, aided, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>abetted the principal offender ... ].\u201d The court advised counsel that the judge would consider the instruction overnight and advise them the following morning whether she would give an instruction regarding Grannison being an accomplice.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The following day, the trial judge advised counsel that the court would not read MPJI-Cr 3:11B. The court observed that the Comment to MPJI-Cr 3:11 states that an accomplice is one who acts \u201cknowingly and with common criminal intent.\u201d The court explained: \u201cThat\u2019s the hold up because there\u2019s been no evidence that there was a common criminal intent that you can attribute to Ms. Grannison that would make Ms. Granni-son an accomplice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Appellant did not renew the objection after the court instructed the jury without reading MPJI-Cr 3:11B. The State argues on appeal that appellant\u2019s failure to renew the objection after the court instructed the jury waived the objection because Maryland Rule 4-325(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">No party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless the party objects on the record promptly after the court instructs the jury, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection. Upon request of any party, the court shall receive objections out of the hearing of the jury. An appellate court, on its own initiative or on the suggestion of a party, may however take cognizance of any plain error in the instructions, material to the rights of the defendant, despite a failure to object.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">The State further asserts that appellant expressly waived any argument about the court\u2019s failure to give the accomplice instruction because defense counsel responded in the affirmative to the court\u2019s post-instructions query of \u201cCounsel satisfied?\u201d But that question was posed after the court gave a clarifying supplemental instruction, and, when read in context, cannot be reasonably interpreted as a waiver of all previously argued objections to the instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">The Court of Appeals has held that, if certain conditions are met, substantial compliance with Rule 4-325(e) may be suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>cient to preserve arguments for appellate review even if the party fails to renew the objection on the record after the jury has been instructed. In <em>Gore v. State, </em>309 Md. 203, 209, 522 A.2d 1338 (1987), the Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">Several conditions for the establishment of substantial compliance with Rule 4-325(e) emerge from <em>Bennett [v. State, </em>230 Md. 562, 568-69, 188 A.2d 142 (1963) ]: there must be an objection to the instruction; the objection must appear on the record; the objection must be accompanied by a definite statement of the ground for objection unless the ground for objection is apparent from the record and the circumstances must be such that a renewal of the objection after the court instructs the jury would be futile or useless.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">We are satisfied that Gore\u2019s objection at the bench conference was sufficient to establish substantial compliance with Rule 4-325(e) and therefore will review his assignment of error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">In the present case, appellant\u2019s objection to the court\u2019s refusal to give MPJI-Cr 3:11B was preserved by substantial compliance with the requirements of Rule 4-325(e) because the request for the instruction was clearly brought to the court\u2019s attention in open court, counsel\u2019s reasons for requesting the instruction were stated on the record, the court had ample opportunity to consider the request and did consider the request, and the court\u2019s explanation of why the instruction would not be given was unequivocal and not likely to change if the exception was restated after the court gave its instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">But we find no merit in appellant\u2019s argument that he was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury pursuant to MPJI-Cr 3:11B. There was no evidence to generate an issue of whether Grannison was an accomplice. No witness \u2014 not even appellant \u2014 suggested Grannison participated in the shootings of Rhodes and Hyman \u201cknowingly and with common criminal intent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Moreover, the general principle that a \u201cdefendant cannot be convicted solely on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice\u201d is a moot point at best given the fact that another eyewitness to the shootings \u2014 Shanelle Hopkins \u2014 identified appellant as the shooter. Consequently, even if it could be said that there was some evidence that Grannison could have been considered a accomplice, there was ample corroboration for her testimony, and the failure to give MPJI-Cr 3:11B was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">IV. Improper sentencing considerations</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">At the time of sentencing, the trial judge made extensive preliminary remarks about the impact of appellant\u2019s crimes on the surviving victims and their families. The court expressed empathy and explained that her own nephew had been shot in the head, \u201cvery similar to Mr. Rhodes.\u201d The court\u2019s comments also included Biblical references and references to faith and God. On appeal, appellant contends that these comments suggest that the sentencing judge was motivated by impermissible considerations. Appellant asserts that we should vacate his sentence and remand the case for resentencing because, he contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">The trial court in this case expounded at great length about her own, quite tragic, experience as the family member of a murder victim. The trial judge explained that she was so close with her [murdered] nephew that \u201cit was just as if he were my child,\u201d and in fact later referred to him as \u201cmy child.\u201d She spoke at great length about what [\u201c]her[\u201d] child may have been feeling, or suffering \u201cwith that searing fire in his head.\u201d The judge spent an enormous amount of time speaking directly to the mother of the murder victim, sharing with the mother her own experience as the parent [sic] of a murder victim, her fears about the suffering of her child and her anguish when the jury found the person charged with the murder not guilty.... [After discussing the witnesses,] the sentencing judge circled her comments back to the victim\u2019s mother \u2014 quoting a scripture from her faith, adding yet another level of inappropriate content.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>... While the court admittedly did not explicitly state that her sentence was based on those considerations, they had no place at that sentencing at all. And a reasonable person could easily infer that the court may have been motivated by an impermissible consideration when it imposed sentence.... [<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>The State argues that the claim of error is not preserved, and, in any event, appellant \u201ccites no authority indicating that impermissible considerations include a trial judge\u2019s own experience having a relative murdered, or the trial judge\u2019s reference to a Bible verse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Appellant concedes in his brief that he \u201cdid not object at the time the court made the remarks in question, and did not object at the time the court imposed sentence.\u201d Nevertheless, he urges this Court to consider his claim under the doctrine of plain error review. Appellant relies heavily on <em>Abdul-Maleek v. State, </em>426 Md. 59, 43 A.3d 383 (2012), a case in which Abdul-Maleek alleged on appeal that his sentencing judge had punished him more harshly after his conviction in the circuit court because he had taken a <em>de novo </em>appeal from his conviction on the same charges in district court. In that case, as in the instant case, Abdul-Maleek did not object at sentencing. The Court of Appeals expressly ruled that Abdul-Maleek had not properly preserved his objection about improper sentencing considerations, stating, <em>id. </em>at 69, 43 A.3d 383:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">[W]e have consistently recognized that allegations of impermissible considerations at sentencing are not \u201cillegal sentences\u201d subject to collateral or belated review and \u201cmust ordinarily be raised in or decided by the trial court.... [A]nd, subject to the appellate court\u2019s discretion under Maryland Rule 8-131(a), the defendant is not excused from having to raise a timely objection in the trial court.\u201d <em>[Chaney v. State </em>] <em>Id. </em>[397 Md. 460] at 466-67, 918 A.2d [506] at 510 [ (2007) ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">Petitioner recognizes that his challenge does not fall within the narrow class of inherently illegal sentences to which the general rules of waiver do not apply. He asks, though, that we expand the application of the preservation exception to the circumstances of this case. We decline to do so, as there is no good reason why either the circumstances presented here should be exempt from the preservation requirement or the trial court should not have been given the opportunity to address at the time the concern that Petitioner now raises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Despite the forgoing discussion reaffirming the requirement that objections to improper sentencing considerations be raised in the circuit court, the Court of Appeals elected to exercise its discretion to review Abdul-Maleek\u2019s unpreserved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>claim on appeal. The Court commented that it was moved to exercise its discretion because there would be no prejudice to either party if the Court remanded for resentencing, and reviewing Abdul-Maleek\u2019s claim would give the Court an opportunity \u201cto comment on the sentencing issue in the context of de novo appeals and thereby promote the \u2018orderly administration of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70, 43 A.3d 383 (quoting <em>Bible v. State, </em>411 Md. 138, 152, 982 A.2d 348 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">We are not similarly moved to exercise our discretion to excuse appellant\u2019s failure to raise any objection in the circuit court in response to the sentencing judge\u2019s comments. In <em>Reiger v. State, </em>170 Md.App. 693, 700, 908 A.2d 124 (2006), we observed that such objections should be brought to the attention of the sentencing judge while there is an opportunity to clarify the court\u2019s motivations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">When, as in this case, a judge\u2019s statement from the bench about the reasons for the sentence gives rise to the claim of impermissible sentencing considerations, defense counsel has good reason to speak up. A timely objection serves an important purpose in this context. Specifically, it gives the court opportunity to reconsider the sentence in light of the defendant\u2019s complaint that it is premised upon improper factors, or otherwise to clarify the reasons for the sentence in order to alleviate such concerns. <em>See </em>Md. Rules 4-342, 4-345. As recognized in the rule, it is the availability of an opportunity to ask for and obtain immediate relief from the sentencing court that determines whether a contemporaneous objection is necessary. Simply stated, when there is time to object, there is opportunity to correct. <em>Cf. Graham v. State, </em>325 Md. 398, 411, 601 A.2d 131 (1992) (defense counsel had adequate time to object to trial court\u2019s failure to disclose entire contents of jury\u2019s note and waived right to appeal on that point by failing to do so).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3\">170 Md.App. at 701, 908 A.2d 124 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Appellant suggests in his brief that asserting an \u201cobjection under the circumstances would have come across as argumen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>tative and disrespectful and would have risked drawing the ire of the court, which could have imposed an even greater penalty.\u201d We do not accept the argument that fear of reprisal is a sufficient excuse for trial counsel failing to raise a timely objection. <em>See Kamara v. State, </em>184 Md.App. 59, 81-82, 964 A.2d 244 (2009). In the overwhelming majority of instances, a professionally lodged objection will not be met with hostility. We see no reason to conclude that this case would be one of the rare exceptions to that. And the rules also provide for motions for modification after the sentencing hearing. Maryland Rule 4-345(e). We are not persuaded that appellant is raising an error that is \u201ccompelling, extraordinary, exceptional or fundamental to assure the defendant a fair trial.\u201d <em>State v. Hutchinson, </em>287 Md. 198, 203, 411 A.2d 1035 (1980). We decline to exercise our discretion to overlook appellant\u2019s failure to raise the issue in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.

And that's all it really was at the end of the day, was my opinion. I don\u2019t know whether the jury was right or they were wrong. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-9\">But I swore to do is, is that whenever I am faced with any case, whether it\u2019s murder of it\u2019s of an adult or a child, or it\u2019s a robbery case, or whatever. My job is to make sure that you get the fairest trial that I can possibly give you or any defendant that comes before me. That\u2019s my obligation. And my obligation is to also let the jury do its job. Often times a jury comes back and I\u2019m sitting here thinking to myself; what trial were they listening to? Because I might have come up with a different ruling. But that wasn't my job. My job was to make sure that you received a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-10\">But I have to admit that when the jury came back on this one, I wasn't shocked. I was not shocked. And I tell you what convinced me. Because I sit in a lot of cases where witnesses come in and they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>are scared to the point of silence. Because we have so created an atmosphere in this world that if you tell the truth, if you stand up for yourself, that you or yours could suffer the consequences of it. That's the society that we\u2019re now living in. Is that you can\u2019t come in to Court and raise your right hand, and tell the truth, for fear of all of the people that are in the room, and fear of all of the antennas that the players in the courtroom have in the community. Knowing that when they walk out of this courtroom, that Judge Brown and the officers that are around me, and around the Defendant, may or may not be there when they need them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">That's what has been created in our society. But when Ms. Grannison took the witness stand in here, I fully suspected that Ms. Grannison was going to sit up here and deny every single thing that the Prosecutor was asking her. That was what I expected. But Ms. Grannison stood as flatfooted as she could. And I\u2019m going to tell you something. I say \"as she could,\u201d because she shook the entire time she was sitting there. She was the most believable witness there was in this courtroom, was Ms. Grannison, because of her courage. The jurors saw what I saw.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">She had a hard time talking about it, but she pressed forward, she pressed through it. Even though you were sitting as close to her almost as anybody else, other than your lawyer, in this room. And she held you accountable. She did her job. And the jury believed her, as did this Court. Ms. Ewell has stepped out. But if anybody wishes to give her the word from me is, is that the thing that kept me going, and it was at \u2014 I don\u2019t know where I heard this scripture, I don\u2019t know where it was. I do know where it was, but it\u2019s not applicable to this. But there\u2019s a scripture in my faith where it talks about the day I fear the most has come upon me. It's out of Job. And that\u2019s what Ms. Ewell \u2014 because as parents, you send your children out into the world. And the day you fear the most is when they don\u2019t come back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-8\">And I know you\u2019re sitting there grinning at me, and smiling at me, as if this doesn\u2019t matter to you. And I know it doesn\u2019t. Which makes my job easier. Because as I say, it doesn\u2019t matter to you. And you shook you head; no, it doesn't. It makes my job easier. But tell her that in that story, keep reading, keep reading. Because although the day you feared the most has come up on you, the years that were taken away from you will be returned unto you. I believe that, too. But for those that don\u2019t believe, you don\u2019t get it. But I got that, too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-9\">So I\u2019m going to stand down, stand down from my soapbox, but I\u2019m going to give you your sentence, sir. Stand, please.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
