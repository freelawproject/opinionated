X-rays revealed that B.N. had a complete fracture of the humerus. The attending doctor reported that the injury, not common in a two-month-old, was caused by a \u201ctwisting force.\u201d B.N. was taken by ambulance to Johns Hopkins Hospital where a skeletal survey revealed that B.N. also had a posterior rib fracture and a healing clavicle fracture.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">After receiving notice from the Howard County Hospital that B.N.\u2019s right humerus was fractured, the Appellee, Howard County Department of Social Services (the \u201cDepartment\u201d), quickly intervened and implemented a \u201csafety plan\u201d that required, among other things, that Appellants M.N. and T.N. (\u201cFather\u201d and \u201cMother,\u201d or \u201cParents\u201d) take their other two babies, A.N. and V.N., to have physical examinations the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">A skeletal survey of A.N., B.N.\u2019s twin brother, revealed that A.N. had an older skull fracture as well as a fractured rib. Their older sister, V.N., was not found to have any injuries. Despite the extent of the infants\u2019 injuries, the Parents maintained that they did not know about the injuries or the manner by which the infants sustained such injuries. The Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>immediately removed all three children from the physical care and legal custody of the Parents and placed them in shelter care.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">On October 21, 2013, the Department filed a \u201cChild in Need of Assistance\u201d (\u201cCINA\u201d) Petition for each child. That same day, a Shelter Care Hearing was held in the Circuit Court for Howard County (sitting as the juvenile court) in which the magistrate recommended and the court ordered that the children be placed in the custody of their grandmother, C.N., and that the Parents would be allowed supervised visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Throughout the next year, the Parents willingly participated in various treatment and evaluation programs, and Department reports indicated that they were \u201cappropriate with the children during visits.\u201d The Parents\u2019 psychological evaluators ultimately concluded that neither parent presented risk or danger to the children. As late as August 28, 2014, the Department and the court-appointed special advocate recommended beginning a monitored transition to custody with the Parents. Then on October 9, 2014, Mother\u2019s polygraph examination indicated that she was not being truthful.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">On April 7, 2015, the juvenile court held a permanency planning review hearing. The court received the Department\u2019s February 23, 2015, report, which recommended\u2014 based, in part, on the results of Mother\u2019s October 9, 2014, polygraph examination \u2014 that the permanency plan for all three children be changed to a sole plan of custody and guardianship with paternal relatives. The court concluded, as reflected in its subsequent order dated May 1, 2015, that \u201cobjections to the polygraph exam results were waived and the Court can consider the results.\u201d Noting that \u201c[b]oth parents deny causing the injuries and continue to be a \u2018united force\u2019 in their denial,\u201d the court found that reunification with the Parents was not in the best interest of the children and, subsequently, modified the permanency plan to remove the goal of reunification.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">On May 26, 2015, Father and Mother noted the instant appeal. The Parents raised numerous evidentiary issues in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>their briefing, but the principal issue on appeal is whether it was reversible error for the juvenile court to consider and rely on the results of Mother\u2019s polygraph examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">We hold that, because \u201c[i]t is well-settled in Maryland that the results of a polygraph test are inadmissible,\u201d and even \u201cmere references to the fact that a test was taken ... may be grounds for reversal if results can be inferred from the circumstances or if the references are prejudicial,\u201d <em>Murphy v. State, </em>105 Md.App. 303, 309-10, 659 A.2d 384 (1995) (citations omitted), the juvenile court erred in considering Mother\u2019s polygraph results. Under the facts of this case, that consideration was prejudicial, and the court erred in changing the CINA permanency plan based, in part, on consideration of that inadmissible evidence. We therefore vacate the May 1, 2015, orders and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">The twin boys, A.N. and B.N., were born on August 12, 2013. Father and Mother were already parents to V.N., born less than a year earlier after the Parents\u2019 long struggle with infertility. Parents are employed as financial analysts. Mother cared for the twin boys at home until they were six-weeks old, when they, along with their sister, began attending daycare on September 30, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">On the afternoon of October 17, 2013, the daycare provider called Father and told him that she noticed after B.N.\u2019s nap that his arm was injured. Parents picked up the children and then called their pediatrician, who had seen the twin boys the day before. The pediatrician instructed Parents to take B.N. to the emergency room.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">Doctors examined B.N. at Howard County General Hospital and determined that his right humerus was completely fractured. The hospital report stated that the fracture was recent and was likely caused by a \u201ctwisting force.\u201d The hospital then immediately notified the Department of the injuries and potential child abuse situation. Although the twin boys had been seen by their pediatrician regularly since their birth, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>injuries had previously been detected. However, after B.N. was taken by ambulance to Johns Hopkins Hospital that same day, a skeletal survey revealed that B.N. \u2014 not yet nine weeks old \u2014 also had a posterior rib fracture and a healing clavicle fracture. Dr. Anders, the Director of Pediatric Emergency Medicine at Johns Hopkins, made the assessment that \u201csomeone did this and this is consistent with child abuse.\u201d He advised that B.N.\u2019s siblings come to Hopkins as soon as possible for full skeletal scans.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">B.N.\u2019s twin brother and older sister were brought to Johns Hopkins Hospital the next day, October 18, 2013. The hospital notified the Department that tests confirmed that the twin, A.N., had an older skull fracture and fractured rib. The sister had no injuries. In response to the information about A.N.\u2019s injuries, Father admitted that he had dropped the infant onto a carpeted floor the week before because the family dog had come up behind him and he had stumbled over the dog. Otherwise, both parents maintained that they did not abuse any of the children and did not know how the twins sustained their injuries. Medical experts, however, determined that A.N.\u2019s injuries were \u201cconsistent with non-accidental trauma,\u201d and A.N.\u2019s injuries were diagnosed as child abuse. That same day, all three children were removed from the physical care and legal custody of Parents and placed in shelter care.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">On October 21, 2013, CINA petitions were filed for each of the children, and a shelter care hearing was held in the juvenile court. The magistrate determined that the children would be placed in the custody of their paternal grandmother, C.N., and that Mother and Father would have supervised visitation. Meanwhile, Father and Mother moved out of their home to allow the paternal grandparents to reside in the home with all three children. Father and Mother moved in with Mother\u2019s parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">On October 25, 2013, a revised shelter care order was entered establishing that \u201cMother shall visit the children three hours per day Monday through Friday,\u201d and that \u201cMother and Father shall visit for an additional two hours per day, Monday <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>through Friday.\u201d On weekends, the parents were allowed to visit for one three-hour visit and one two-hour visit on Saturday and Sunday. The Adjudication/Disposition Hearing was set for November 13, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\n<em>The 2013 CINA Adjudication Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aqi\">A magistrate conducted a CINA adjudication/disposition hearing over three days: November 13, December 11, and December 18, 2013.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The magistrate heard the testimony of several experts, beginning with Dr. Wendy G. Lane, a board certified general pediatrician and specialist in child abuse pediatrics from the Child Advocacy Center at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Dr. Lane examined the children and, regarding the injuries to two-month old B.N., stated in her expert report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">There is no history of injury to explain the fractures ... [Father] acknowledged that [B.N.]\u2019s arm didn\u2019t appear right that morning [October 17, 2013], the injury likely occurred on the day that he was brought to the hospital, prior to being dropped off at daycare. Oblique fractures indicate a twisting injury, which [B.N.] could not have caused himself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AH1\">Dr. Lane\u2019s report noted that the most likely explanation for B.N. having injuries in various stages of healing was abuse. However, she also considered other potential causes for the injuries to B.N. and A.N. not indicative of abuse or neglect and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">Birth injury was considered as an explanation for the healing clavicle and rib fractures. However, I reviewed a chest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>x-ray (report and films) taken on the day of birth, and there were no fractures present at that time. Rickets (from inadequate vitamin D store/intake) does not typically present early in infancy because children receive vitamin D from their mother in \u00fatero. Osteogenesis Imperfecta should be considered because paternal grandmother has identified some risk factors in the family history. However, most of these risk factors have not been noted elsewhere in [B.N.J\u2019s medical records, and details may need to be clarified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Dr. Lane recommended that both A.N. and B.N. see a Pediatric Geneticist for evaluation for Osteogenesis Imperfecta (brittle bone disease). She noted, however, that \u201c[i]n the absence of th[at] diagnosis, the only reasonable explanation for BJST.\u2019s injuries is abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Dr. Richard S. Strahlman, head of pediatrics at Columbia Medical Practice \u2014 where the children received primary healthcare \u2014 also examined the x-rays from B.N.\u2019s date of birth and found the clavicle to be \u201cintact.\u201d In addition, Dr. Strahl-man opined that A.N.\u2019s skull and rib fractures were a sign of trauma and not indicative of Osteogenesis Imperfecta.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The Parents called Dr. Doug Benson, a board certified orthopedic surgeon and Director of Orthopedic Trauma at the Enloe Medical Center in Chico, California. He testified that A.N. and B.N. had rickets, and that rickets caused their injuries. Dr. Benson was accepted as an expert in orthopedic medicine; however, because he had no specialized training in pediatrics or pediatric child abuse, his testimony on those issues and the cause of the children\u2019s injuries was found by the magistrate not to be credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">During the time between the adjudication hearings before the magistrate and entry of its order, the juvenile court appointed Susan Gordon of the Howard County Court Appointed Special Advocates Program (\u201cCASA\u201d) to represent all three children, as a friend of the court. Then, on January 10, 2014, the juvenile court entered an adjudication/disposition order for each of the children. In accordance with Maryland Code (1973, 2013 Repl.Vol.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Article (\u201cCJP\u201d) \u00a7 3-819<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Maryland Rule 11-115<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>juvenile court determined the children to be CI\u00d1A and ordered them committed to the custody of the Department and placed with their paternal grandmother pending further review. The juvenile court found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the injuries sustained by B.N. and A.N. were \u201cconsistent with non-accidental trauma,\u201d and that both parents \u2014 unable or unwilling to explain the injuries \u2014 \u201ceither abused the [children] or neglected them by faffing to protect them.\u201d The juvenile court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">[Mother and Father] were the primary caregivers for [the children] at the time [A.N.] and [B.N.] sustained injuries. Either [Mother or Father] caused [A.N.] and [B.N.] to be injured and either [Mother or Father] failed to protect [the children] from injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">The childfren] require[ ] court intervention; [t]he child[ren] ha[ve] been abused and ha[ve] been neglected and the child[ren]\u2019s parents are unable or unwilling to give proper care and attention to the child[ren] and the child[ren]\u2019s needs. One parent has abused the child[ren] and the other parent has failed to give proper care and attention to the child[ren] under the circumstances that the child[ren]\u2019s health or welfare is harmed or placed at substantial risk of harm. One parent is unable or unwilling to believe that the other parent harmed the child[ren] and is unable or unwilling to provide proper care for the child[ren].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">The January 10, 2014, court order maintained the visitation schedule set by the October 23, 2013, revised shelter care order and ordered genetic testing of the children \u201cto rule out genetic disease or deformity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">\n<em>Expert Reports and Department Recommendations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">After the genetic testing of B.N., the Department filed a report with the juvenile court dated April 18, 2014, detailing that B.N. was found to not be suffering from Osteogenesis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Imperfecta or rickets. A.N. was not tested on the assumption that, as an identical twin, testing one child was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The Department\u2019s April 18 report, submitted for consideration at the next review hearing, acknowledged that the permanency plan for all three children was reunification with the Parents, but recommended that the children remain in the custody of their paternal grandparents, with a review of the placement in six months.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The report further indicated that Father and Mother both signed a service agreement on January 30, 2014, completed parenting classes, completed anger management classes, were actively involved in individual and couples therapy, visited the children regularly, and agreed to submit to a polygraph and forensic evaluation. The service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>agreement provided that Father and Mother could use an independent provider for the polygraph examination, but it reserved the Department\u2019s right to submit questions to be asked. The initial polygraph examination was scheduled for April 25, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">On June 28, 2014, John Lefkowits, Ph.D., completed a psychological evaluation report for Father. Dr. Lefkowits\u2019s report diagnosed Father with adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, \u201cexpected distress based on the allegations from social services and removal of his children,\u201d but, overall, found that Father \u201cdoes not represent any risk or danger to his children and it is unlikely that he engaged in any behaviors which would have previously harmed his children.\u201d Dr. Lefkowits recommended reunification with children at the earliest possible date.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Dr. Lefkowits released a similar psychological evaluation report for Mother on June 25, 2014. The report diagnosed Mother with adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, \u201cdue to the stress of a social service investigation and removal of her children,\u201d but overall found that Mother \u201cdoes not represent any risk or danger to her children and it is unlikely that she engaged in any behaviors which would have previously harmed her children.\u201d Dr. Lefkowits again recommended reunification with children at the earliest possible date.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">In preparation for the approaching July 23, 2014, permanency plan review hearing, the Department filed a report with the juvenile court recommending that the children be gradually reunited with the Parents through a reunification program. Parents also filed a line attaching a medical report from Charles J. Hyman, M.D., F.A.A.P., a board certified pediatrician in the State of California. Dr. Hyman founded and directed the Loma Linda University Medical Center\u2019s child abuse team in the late 1970s, and was at the time a member of an infant injury evaluation group that studied diseases and injury of infants that could be misconstrued as child abuse. Dr. Hyman\u2019s lengthy report posited that the twins, being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>premature, could have suffered from bone fragility disorder and rickets, which could explain their fractures. Dr. Hyman maintained that child abuse should not be the assumed cause of injury, where there is no other evidence of such abuse, and no other organs \u2014 including the skin \u2014 showed signs of trauma. CASA Susan Gordon also filed a report for the July 23, 2014, hearing, recapping the case and recommending, based on her observation of the family and the assessments by the therapists and psychologist that \u201cit is appropriate for the parents to regain care of their children,\u201d even though \u201cit remains a troubling mystery how A.N. and B.N. received such serious injuries.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">\n<em>The Polygraph Problem</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">At the July 23, 2014, review hearing before the magistrate, the Department submitted on its report and stated on the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-7\">[Ijdeally we would like to know what happened to the children. Realistically I don\u2019t believe the police are going to pursue this matter. We might not ever know what happened to the children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">But the parents have done everything the Department has asked them to do. They\u2019ve completed the service agreement. They\u2019ve completed the parenting program, psychological, and the individual and couple\u2019s counseling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-9\">We\u2019re not sure what else we can ask them to do, so we\u2019re recommending [ ] a slow transition back into the custody of the parents with some oversight by the Department making announced and unannounced home visits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">Although the Department had not changed its position that one of the parents caused the serious injuries to the children, it was willing to move forward with reunification. Nonetheless, counsel for the Parents brought Dr. Hyman\u2019s report to the magistrate\u2019s attention, as well as the fact that both Father and Mother had passed private polygraph tests in support of their argument that no child abuse had occurred. This prompted the magistrate to ask the Department about the polygraph examination, and the Department responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>We asked the parents to participate in the polygraph. Our stipulation was that we were involved.... We asked the parents to coordinate with [the investigating officer] Detective Camp.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">And then they called. Detective Camp had ... 10 minutes notice to get to the polygraph. With 10 minutes notice Detective Camp was not able to get to the polygraph and [neither] the Department nor the Detective were able to submit questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">So we took the results of the test that they gave us. We asked the police polygrapher (sic) to look at them. He gave us his opinion as to the validity of the exam and we accepted the results.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">At the conclusion of the review hearing, the magistrate made recommendations on the record, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">[I]n my opinion, the parents haven\u2019t fully complied in that they haven\u2019t submitted to a polygraph that\u2019s been offered by the Department and there is no explanation for the injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-9\">If one parent was willing to take responsibility for the infliction of the injuries [ ] I\u2019d feel very comfortable moving on. In this circumstance I am not of a mind that I can assure that the children are safe in their home without the current conditions in place, and I\u2019m recommending that the status remain the same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">On July 25, 2014, Father and Mother filed exceptions to the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendations, arguing that the magistrate incorrectly denied their request for immediate reunification where all the current reports before the court indicated that the Parents posed no threat to the children. The Parents argued that, because the Department had not specified requirements for the polygraph \u2014 other than that the Parents must submit to one \u2014 and because the Department advised on the record that they received the polygraph and their expert was satisfied with the conclusion, the magistrate erred in concluding that the private polygraph was insufficient for compliance with the Department\u2019s Service Agreement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Regarding the magistrate\u2019s concern over their \u201cwilling[ness] to take responsibility for the infliction of the injuries,\u201d the Parents argued that \u201c[the magistrate] has placed the parents in the impossible position of confessing to a criminal act in which the Parents had reported and testified under oath that they had no knowledge of how the injuries occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">On August 28, 2014, a <em>de novo </em>review hearing on the exceptions was held in the juvenile court before a judge. The Department again submitted on its report prepared for the July 23, 2014, hearing and recommended that \u201cthe children remain in the care and custody of the Department of Social Services, but we start a procedure whereby they can return to the fulltime (sic) care of their parents.\u201d The juvenile court remained concerned, however, that a finding had been made that abuse occurred without an indication of which parent was the abuser. The court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">It was either one or both of the parents, and now [the Department\u2019s] asking this Court to send the children back into their care when we don\u2019t know what happened. How can the children be safe in the future? That\u2019s the problem that I see the [magistrate] had, that even I had on reviewing this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Addressing the independent polygraph, the court agreed with the magistrate that, because the Department had no input in the polygraph, the Parents did not comply with the requirements of the Service Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">On September 12, 2014, the circuit court (sitting as the juvenile court) entered a review hearing order accepting the magistrate\u2019s findings in the July 23 hearing. However, the court went beyond the magistrate\u2019s recommendation that the status quo be maintained and determined that the existing sole plan of reunification was not in the best interest of the children. The circuit court changed the permanency plan for the children to a concurrent plan of reunification with the Parents or placement with relative for custody and guardianship. In addition, the court ordered the Parents to submit to another polygraph examination and a \u201cfitness to parent evalu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>ation\u201d to be arranged by the Department. Finally, the court ordered that the next permanency plan hearing be set before a judge in the circuit court, rather than before a magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The next permanency plan hearing was scheduled for December 4, 2014, and the Department filed its report for that hearing with the court on November 21, 2014. The report stated that the Department arranged, and the parents submitted to, a second polygraph examination on October 9, 2014. The Department\u2019s report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">As a part of their service agreement, the parents agreed to take a polygraph. A polygraph is a tool for the Department to use when completing a risk assessment. Both parents took polygraphs at Chesapeake Polygraph, as arranged by their attorney, and both passed. The Department, however, was not permitted to participate in the polygraph offered at Chesapeake Polygraph. On August 28, 2014, the court ordered the parents to submit to a polygraph that would allow participation from [the Department]. The Department arranged for [both Father and Mother] to take a polygraph at the Howard County Police Department on 10/9/14. [Father] passed the polygraph. [Mother] did not pass; her results indicated deception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">The Department\u2019s recommendation at that point was that the children remain in the custody of the agency with a concurrent plan of reunification and custody and guardianship to a relative.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">On February 25, 2015, the Department filed an updated report for the court for the next permanency planning review hearing. Importantly, the Department changed its recommendation to remove reunification from the permanency plan, and instead advocated for a sole plan of custody and guardianship with the children\u2019s paternal relatives with another review in six months. On the same date, CASA filed a report recommending that the children be placed in the custody of their paternal grandparents with liberal visitation with the Parents. The CASA report concluded that because the injuries to the children remain unexplained and because \u201c[Mother] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>was found to be deceptive during the polygraph examination,\u201d the only way to reasonably ensure the continued safety of the children was to give custody to the grandparents.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\n<em>The April 7, 2015, Review Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">On April 7, 2015, the permanency planning review hearing was held in the circuit court. At the outset of the hearing, the court brought to Parents\u2019 counsel\u2019s attention the potential conflict of interest presented by representing both Father and Mother in light of their differing polygraph results. Counsel for the Parents responded by making a preliminary objection to the polygraph results. The court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">Well, I find it interesting, you wanted to submit, or you confirmed that your sole polygraph test was okay because they both came back as non-deceptive. Now I [ ] require the [Department] to be involved, and one comes back to be deceptive, now you\u2019re going to want that information to be not considered by this Court, I find that interesting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Amk\">Thereafter, at the urging of the court, both Father and Mother were questioned on the record about their knowledge of and consent to representation where there may be a conflict, and counsel agreed to submit informed written consent from each parent to the court after the lunch recess.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Following the voir dire of the Parents, counsel formally objected to introduction \u201cnot only of the polygraph results, but ... [to] any provision of the Department\u2019s report as well as any report which indicates a deceptive finding[.]\u201d The Parents\u2019 counsel cited <em>Kelley v. State, </em>288 Md. 298, 418 A.2d 217 (1980), for the proposition that polygraph-based evidence is not admissible in a court proceeding. The court then took a short break to review <em>Kelley v. State </em>and, upon return, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkUZ\">[T]he Court [in <em>Kelley </em>] did in fact say, because it talked about the reliability of [polygraph] examinations and referred to <em>Reed v. State, </em>and <em>Lusby v. State, </em>and the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>does say, \u201cWe conclude therefore, that until such time as the reliability of this particular type of scientific testing can be appropriately established to the satisfaction of this Court, testimony which directly or indirectly conveys the results of such tests should [ ] not be admitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">So that\u2019s clearly the ruling and holding in <em>Kelley, </em>so, based on that, even though it is a tool that we use, since the reliability \u2014 this is from 1980, has not been scientifically established, the Court will grant the request, and the polygraph results will not be considered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Opening statements followed, and during her opening, attorney for the children Connie Ridgway, advocated for transitioning the children into the custody of the Parents. Ms. Ridg-way, who was appointed to represent all three children on October 24, 2013, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">I actually believe, Your Honor, that there should be a transition plan for the parents. Even if, let\u2019s say, for sake of argument, one of the parents had admitted to whatever may have occurred; Your Honor, we still have to work towards reunification. And part of that work towards reunification is setting out a ... service agreement____ The parents have lived up to everything required of them.... [T]he therapist is recommending that there is no further fear of abuse by these parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-9\">I just don\u2019t believe, Your Honor, based on what I know of this case, that a transition plan could not be put in place that would assure the safety of the children, assure the Department of their continued growth, and assure this Court that, in fact, the children could be raised by their parents, given the transition plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">The Department\u2019s witness, Cheryl Lawson-Anderson \u2014 a foster care social worker with the Howard County Department of Social Services \u2014 testified that she had observed the children in their current living situation, that the Parents had complied with all the terms of their Service Agreement, and that there were no other services that the Department could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>offer to the Parents. She maintained, however, that the Department was recommending a sole plan of custody and guardianship to a relative. In listing the Department\u2019s considerations leading to their recommendation, Ms. Lawson-Anderson cited the extent of the injuries to the children, the reports of Dr. Means and Dr. Lefkowits, and the polygraph. The Parents\u2019 counsel immediately objected to the testimony; however, the Court overruled the objection, stating \u201cI\u2019m not admitting the results, she\u2019s just saying she considered the polygraph[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Further into Ms. Lawson-Anderson\u2019s examination, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">[DEPARTMENT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Now, why did your recommendation change between July 2014 and now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">[MS. LAWSON-ANDERSON]: The main reason was the results of the polygraph.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">[PARENTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-9\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-10\">[DEPARTMENT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And what were\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-11\">[MS. LAWSON-ANDERSON]: And\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-12\">[DEPARTMENT\u2019S COUNSEL]: \u2014 the other reasons?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-13\">[MS. LAWSON-ANDERSON]: \u2014 that one was deceptive?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Akr\">[PARENTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-14\">THE COURT: That part I\u2019ll sustain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-15\">Next, Dr. Ronald F. Means testified regarding the results of his parental fitness evaluation,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and concluded that \u201c[t]o a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>reasonable degree of medical certainty, I\u2019m of the opinion that [Father and Mother] are more than adequate parents.\u201d Dr. John Lefkowits also testified regarding his report and the Parents\u2019 psychological evaluations. Dr. Lefkowits opined that, to a reasonable degree of psychological certainty, neither parent represented any risk or danger to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Paternal grandmother and custodial guardian of the children, C.N., testified regarding her observations of the children and their interactions with Father and Mother, maintaining that she did not believe that the Parents ever abused the children. In her opinion, reunification was in the best interest of the children. At the end of her direct examination, C.N. was asked by the Parents\u2019 counsel whether the Department had communicated to her why it changed its position regarding reunification, and she replied: \u201c[the Department] said [Mother] failed the poly and nobody\u2019s admitted to [the abuse], and the judge wouldn\u2019t go for it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">There was no further mention of the polygraph until the middle of the closing argument by the Parents\u2019 counsel, when the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">[PARENTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: ... Now in regards to [the Department\u2019s change of plan, I have no idea why. What\u2019s the reason that they have changed their plan? In July of 2014\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-8\">THE COURT: You elicited from [C.N.] Which just puzzled me. I granted your motion, and what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHN\">[PARENTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Well, Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-9\">THE COURT: You \u2014 stop. You asked Ms. N., \u201cWhy did Cheryl Lawson-Anderson say she changed her mind?\u201d And the answer, which shocked me that you would elicit that, now I think that\u2019s a waiver, because your client, [Mother], failed the polygraph and the judge wouldn\u2019t go for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>[PARENTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Respectfully\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-4\">THE COURT: So \u2014 no, no, no, so, that\u2019s [] the testimony that you presented to this Court. So, clearly we know why [the Department] changed \u2014 or DHR changed their opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">At the close of the proceeding the court reiterated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">[C]learly, even though I indicated earlier, ... I granted the motion, [I] wasn\u2019t going to consider everything about the polygraph ... until Counsel asked her, \u201cWhy did [the Department] say they changed their opinion?\u201d And she said, \u201cThey changed their opinion because [Mother] failed the polygraph, and the judge won\u2019t go for it.\u201d Wow. Okay, so, that\u2019s \u2014 we know based on that testimony, that [Mother] failed the polygraph.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">On May 1, 2015, the juvenile court entered permanency planning review hearing orders for the children, finding it to be in the children\u2019s best interest to remove reunification from the permanency plan and seek placement with a relative for custody and guardianship instead. The court discounted the recommendations and reports of Dr. Means and Dr. Lefkowits because both doctors admitted that their findings were based on the premise that neither parent abused the children. Significantly, the court did consider evidence of the second polygraph when changing the permanency plan. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-8\">[The Department] originally recommended that the children be returned to the care and custody of the parents, however, due to the results of the polygraph examination, changed the recommendation to custody and guardianship with a relative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-9\">In January 2014 and July 2014 the Court found that, even though the parents have maintained their innocence and deny causing the children\u2019s injuries, it is abundantly clear and already established by the Court that the two boys sustained serious injuries that are indicative of child abuse while in the care and custody of their parents, and one or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>both of them physically abused these children and the children are not safe in their care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">The Court, based on the parents counsel\u2019s request, excluded the results of the polygraph examination, however, the parents counsel, during the questioning of the [Department] case worker elicited from the worker that the mother\u2019s polygraph examination results indicated deception, and that the mother was not being truthful, which is why [the Department] changed their recommendation from reunification to custody and guardianship with a relative. By eliciting testimony from the [Department] case worker, the objection to the polygraph exam results were waived and the Court can consider the results.... Reunification with a parent who has abused them and/or failed to protect them [is] not in the children\u2019s best interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">The Court finds that the child[ren]\u2019s permanency plan is: Placement with a relative for custody and guardianship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">On May 26, 2015, the Parents noted this timely appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">They present the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-9\">Whether the circuit court abused its discretion when it found that reunification is not in the best interest of the children, after admitting evidence of the results of a polygraph test during the April 2015 permanency plan hearing review, and considering all of the competent and credible evidence of the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">Additional facts will be introduced as they pertain to the issues discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A8q\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">When reviewing an order regarding a permanency plan in a CINA proceeding \u201c[t]he appellate standard of review as to the overall determination of the hearing court is one of \u2018abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. 551, 583, 819 A.2d 1030 (2003). However, when an appellate court reviews <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>cases involving the custody of children generally, it simultaneously applies three different levels of review. <em>Id. </em>at 584, 819 A.2d 1030. First, when an appellate court scrutinizes factual findings, the clearly erroneous standard applies. <em>In re Shirley B., </em>419 Md. 1, 18, 18 A.3d 40 (2011) (citing <em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. at 586, 819 A.2d 1030). Second, \u201cif it appears that the [juvenile court] erred as to matters of law, further proceedings in the trial court will ordinarily be required unless the error is determined to be harmless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (quoting <em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. at 586, 819 A.2d 1030). Finally, when reviewing a juvenile court\u2019s decision to modify the permanency plan for the children, this Court \u201cmust determine whether the court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18-19, 18 A.3d 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">B. Changes to CINA Permanency Plans After a Finding of Abuse</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Parents enjoy a well-established and fundamental constitutional right \u2014 protected by the Fourteenth Amendment \u2014 to raise their children without undue influence by the State, and that right cannot be taken away \u201c \u2018unless clearly justified.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. at 565-66, 819 A.2d 1030 (quoting <em>Wolinski v. Browneller, </em>115 Md.App. 285, 693 A.2d 30 (1997)). However, that right is not absolute and must be balanced against the State\u2019s interest in protecting the health, safety, and welfare of the child. <em>Id. </em>at 568-69, 819 A.2d 1030. Indeed, the Court of Appeals has \u201c \u2018often reaffirmed that [the best interest of the child] takes precedence over the fundamental right of a parent to raise his or her child.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 569-70, 819 A.2d 1030 (quoting <em>Wolinski, </em>115 Md.App. at 301, 693 A.2d 30). Nonetheless, \u201cthe best interests of the child standard embraces a strong presumption that the child\u2019s best interests are served by maintaining parental rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 571, 819 A.2d 1030 (citing <em>In Re: Adoption/Guardianship Nos. J9610436 &amp; J9711031, </em>368 Md. 666, 692-93, 796 A.2d 778 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Certainly, the courts of Maryland have recognized that, \u201cin cases where abuse or neglect is evidenced, particularly in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>CINA case, the court\u2019s role is necessarily more proactive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570, 819 A.2d 1030. Pursuant to Maryland Code (1984, 2012 Repl.Vol.), Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d) \u00a7 9-101, \u201cin cases where evidence of abuse exists, courts are required by statute to <em>deny </em>custody or unsupervised visitation <em>unless </em>the court makes a specific finding that there is no likelihood of further child abuse or neglect.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. at 571, 819 A.2d 1030 (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. 687, 706, 782 A.2d 332 (2001)). Accordingly, the Court of Appeals has recognized that courts have a higher degree of responsibility where abuse has been proven. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. at 706, 782 A.2d 332).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Once CINA proceedings have begun and a permanency plan has been established, the plan must be periodically reviewed \u201cto determine progress and whether, due to historical and contemporary circumstances, that goal [of the plan] should be changed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 582, 819 A.2d 1030. CJP \u00a7 3-823(h) provides, in pertinent parts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">(1) (i) Except as provided in subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of this paragraph, the court shall conduct a hearing to review the permanency plan at least every 6 months until commitment is rescinded or a voluntary placement is terminated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">(2) At the review hearing, the court shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">(i) Determine the continuing necessity for and appropriateness of the commitment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>(ii) Determine and document in its order whether reasonable efforts have been made to finalize the permanency plan that is in effect;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-4\">(iii) Determine the extent of progress that has been made toward alleviating or mitigating the causes necessitating commitment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">(iv) Project a reasonable date by which a child in placement may be returned home, placed in a preadoptive home, or placed under a legal guardianship;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">(v) Evaluate the safety of the child and take necessary measures to protect the child; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">(vi) Change the permanency plan if a change in the permanency plan would be in the child\u2019s best interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">(3) Every reasonable effort shall be made to effectuate a permanent placement for the child within 24 months after the date of initial placement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">The Court of Appeals has interpreted CJP \u00a7 3-823(h)(2)(vi) to mean that an existing permanency plan \u201cmay not be changed without the court first determining that it is in the child\u2019s best interest to do so.\u201d <em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. at 581, 819 A.2d 1030. Notably, under \u00a7 3\u2014823(h)(2)(iii), the review hearing court must \u201c[djetermine the extent of progress that has been made toward alleviating or mitigating the causes necessitating commitment.\u201d In evaluating the safety of the child and the continuing necessity for commitment, the Court of Appeals has instructed that, \u201c \u2018even upon substantial evidence of past abuse or neglect, it does not require a finding that future abuse or neglect is impossible or will, in fact never occur, but only that there is no likelihood \u2014 no probability \u2014 of its recurrence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 588, 819 A.2d 1030 (quoting <em>In re: Adoption No. 12612, </em>353 Md. 209, 238, 725 A.2d 1037 (1999)). In <em>In re Yve S., </em>the Court cautioned that such a high standard would require the judge to be \u201ca prophet or soothsayer and somehow \u2018know\u2019 that there will never be a future incident of abuse or neglect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 587-88, 819 A.2d 1030 (footnote omitted). Nevertheless, in a case where there is no evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>as to the cause of the abuse, we recognize the dilemma in measuring \u201cthe extent of progress that has been made toward alleviating or mitigating the causes necessitating commitment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">In the instant case, after the appalling injuries to the infant twins were exposed, a most troubling circumstance persisted through to the day of the April 7, 2015, hearing\u2014 there was still no explanation as to how the infants suffered their injuries. Only three events occurred since the August 28, 2014, <em>de novo </em>review hearing on exceptions: first, the passage of additional time, which is a relevant concern under CJP \u00a7 3-823(h)(3); second, the results of the parental fitness examination by Dr. Means which concluded that \u201call evidence supports that [the Parents] have more than adequate parenting abilities and are capable of providing a supportive, nurturing environment for their children\u201d; and finally, the existence of the second court-ordered polygraph examination of Mother that purportedly indicated deception. Still without any resolution as to what happened to the children, the juvenile court was faced with deciding whether to continue the permanency plan of a concurrent plan of reunification with the Parents and custody and guardianship with a relative. As noted above, under \u00a7 3-823(h) (2) (iii), the court must evaluate whether the cause of the abuse has been alleviated \u2014 a task made decidedly more onerous where the Parents provide no information and take no direct responsibility. Additionally, the court is under a statutory mandate to work towards \u201ca timely, permanent placement for the child[ren] consistent with the ehild[ren]\u2019s best interests.\u201d CJP 3-802(a)(7); <em>see also </em>CJP \u00a7 3-823(h)(3). Here, again it is clear that our statutes place a heightened responsibility on the juvenile court in cases such as this one to be pro-active in the protection of the well-being and interests of children who have been abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">C. Erroneous Reliance on Inherently Unreliable Polygraph Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">The Parents argue that the juvenile court \u201cabused its discretion by finding that reunification is not in the best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>interest of the children after admitting unreliable and incompetent testimony concerning the results of the polygraph testing and, considering the results in determining whether to change the permanency plan.\u201d The Parents maintain that the admission of polygraph evidence \u201cfalls outside the realm of even a \u2018relaxed\u2019 application of the Rules of Evidence^]\u201d They contend that their objection to the polygraph results was not waived and that their lay witness, who mentioned the polygraph in testimony, was not qualified or competent to testify regarding the polygraph results. The Department counters that consideration of the polygraph results did not prejudice the Parents because the court\u2019s decision to change the permanency plan was based on already adjudicated facts, and not the polygraph results.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">\u201cIt is well-settled in Maryland that the results of a polygraph test are inadmissible.\u201d <em>Murphy v. State, </em>105 Md.App. 303, 309, 659 A.2d 384 (1995) (citing <em>Guesfeird v. State, </em>300 Md. 653, 658, 480 A.2d 800 (1984); <em>Lusby v. State, </em>217 Md. 191, 194-95, 141 A.2d 893 (1958)); <em>see also Kelley v. State, </em>288 Md. 298, 302, 418 A.2d 217 (1980) (\u201c[U]ntil such time as the reliability of [polygraphs] has been appropriately established to the satisfaction of this Court, testimony which directly or indirectly conveys the results of such tests should not be admitted.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">In permanency plan review hearings, the court may decline to require strict application of the evidentiary rules, \u201cother than those relating to competency of witnesses.\u201d Md. Rule 5-101(c)(6); <em>see also In re Ashley E., </em>387 Md. 260, 293-94, 874 A.2d 998 (2005). However, even under the relaxed evidentiary rules that apply to administrative proceedings, this court has found that polygraph evidence is inadmissible because, \u201cthe evidence presented must be considered <em>\u2018competent.\u2019\u201d Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety and Corr. Serv. v. Scruggs, </em>79 Md.App. 312, 322-24, 556 A.2d 736 (1989) (emphasis in original) (determining that polygraph evidence was admitted in error and \u201cseverely prejudiced\u201d the appellee). Moreover, in a permanency plan hearing \u2014 notwithstanding that the Rules of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Evidence are not strictly applied \u2014 the court must still determine whether proffered evidence is \u201csufficiently reliable and probative to its admission.\u201d <em>In re Billy W., </em>387 Md. 405, 434, 875 A.2d 734 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">In <em>In re Rachel S., </em>the Anne Arundel County Department of Social Services received a complaint alleging the possible physical and sexual abuse of a child. 60 Md.App. 147, 149, 481 A.2d 520 (1984). An immediate shelter care hearing was held; however, the court ordered the case continued for five days (temporarily approving shelter care) to allow the alleged abusive father to take a polygraph examination. <em>Id. </em>at 149-50, 481 A.2d 520. When the hearing recommenced five days later, all parties stipulated that the father had passed the polygraph. <em>Id. </em>at 150, 481 A.2d 520. Notwithstanding that stipulation, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">The erroneous reliance upon the polygraph tests was itself sufficient error to flaw the proceedings. Even if all parties to the adjudication had agreed to accept the results of the polygraph testing, the long settled law in this state is that the technique is considered so inherently unreliable as to preclude the admission of such test results in a trial, civil or criminal. As was unequivocally stated in <em>Akonom v. State, </em>40 Md.App. 676, 680, 394 A.2d 1213 (1978):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">\u201cIt cannot logically be argued that a stipulation enhances in any significant way the inherent reliability of evidence produced by a so-called scientific process or art.... Thus, while we are generally reluctant to invalidate agreements entered into by the parties, we view this as one of the unusual occasions when we are obligated to do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 150, 481 A.2d 520.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">In <em>In re Shannon A., </em>this Court stated that the \u201c[a]ppellant cannot complain that his own trial conduct constitutes error,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>after \u201cit was appellant\u2019s counsel who first mentioned the word polygraph.\u201d 60 Md.App. 399, 410, 483 A.2d 363 (1984). However, that case concerned the admissibility of a statement made by a juvenile defendant to a police officer \u201cbetween polygraph tests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This Court did not retreat from the position that \u201cpolygraph results are inadmissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In that case, the appellant\u2019s contention was that his own trial counsel\u2019s mere mention of the word polygraph indirectly conveyed the results of the examination. <em>Id. </em>at 409-10, 483 A.2d 363. The argument was not (as it is here) that the Court was actually made aware of the results of the polygraph and considered those results in reaching its decision. Thus, in <em>In re Shannon </em>A, it was appropriate to discount the alleged error because it did not challenge a ruling, failure to act, or error on the part of the lower court. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Braun v. Ford Motor Co., </em>32 Md.App. 545, 548, 363 A.2d 562 (1976) (\u201cAppellate courts look only to the rulings made by a trial judge, or to his failure to act when action was required, to find reversible error.\u201d)). That is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Here, the court twice overruled the Parents\u2019 objections to testimony, elicited by the Department, that the reason for the change in permanency plan recommendation was the results of the polygraph examination. And, the very same information was elicited by Parents\u2019 counsel from another witness later in the hearing, resulting in the waiver of their earlier objections to the polygraph evidence. Nevertheless, under this Court\u2019s precedent, it was still error for the court to consider the results of the polygraph. <em>See In re Rachel S., </em>60 Md.App. at 150, 481 A.2d 520; <em>Akonom, </em>40 Md.App. at 680, 394 A.2d 1213. This is especially clear where this Court\u2019s precedent instructs that, even had all parties stipulated to the admissibility of the polygraph results, \u201cthe long settled law in this state is that the technique is considered so inherently unreliable as to preclude the admission of such test results in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>a trial, civil or criminal,\u201d and \u201creliance upon the polygraph tests [i]s itself sufficient error to flaw the proceedings.\u201d <em>In re Rachel S., </em>60 Md.App. at 150, 481 A.2d 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The Department cites to <em>Guesfeird v. State, </em>for the proposition that \u201cthere have been cases in Maryland in which references to lie detector tests were held not to be so prejudicial as to warrant reversal.\u201d 300 Md. at 659, 480 A.2d 800 (1984) (citing <em>Poole v. State, </em>295 Md. 167, 182-84, 453 A.2d 1218 (1983); <em>Lusby, </em>217 Md. at 195, 141 A.2d 893). Indeed, the Court of Appeals in <em>Guesfeird, </em>provided a non-exclusive list of factors that courts have considered in determining whether the introduction of polygraph evidence was prejudicial, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">whether the reference to a lie detector was repeated or whether it was a single, isolated statement; whether the reference was solicited by counsel, or was an inadvertent and unresponsive statement; whether the witness making the reference is the principal witness upon whom the entire prosecution depends; whether credibility is a crucial issue; whether a great deal of other evidence exists; and, whether an inference as to the result of the test can be drawn.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASk\"><em>Id. </em>at 659, 480 A.2d 800 (citations omitted). Notably, in <em>Guesfeird, </em>as in <em>In re Shannon A., </em>(discussed <em>supra), </em>the case involved a single reference to a polygraph examination that defense counsel feared would allow the fact-finder to infer a result. <em>Id. </em>at 656, 480 A.2d 800. Again, that is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">As discussed above, the references to the polygraph in this case were numerous and originated from the key witness for the Department and a witness for the Parents. Notwithstanding the fact that all involved clearly knew the results of the polygraph, a negative result could certainly have been inferred from the testimony of Ms. Lawson-Anderson\u2014 elicited by the Department and sustained over objection \u2014 that the Department removed reunification of the Parents and children from its recommendation after considering the results of the polygraph examination. Credibility was a central issue in this case. The Parents maintain that they never abused the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>children, but the juvenile court, with no plausible explanation for how the injuries occurred and with both Parents united in denying any knowledge, concluded that \u201cone or both parents have either abused the [children] or neglected them by failing to protect them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">It is abundantly clear, from the record and the court\u2019s May 1, 2015, orders that the juvenile court did consider the polygraph results in making the decision to remove reunification with the Parents from the permanency plan. As noted above, at the close of the April 7, 2015, hearing, the court remarked, \u201c[o]kay, so, that\u2019s \u2014 we know based on that testimony, that [Mother] failed the polygraph.\u201d Further, in its order, the court stated, \u201c[b]y eliciting testimony from the [Department] case worker, the objection to the polygraph exam results were waived and the Court can consider the results.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">We recognize that a polygraph examination is an important investigative tool, -widely used by law enforcement agencies and private industry, and we do not discourage its appropriate use. <em>See Akonom, </em>40 Md.App. at 683, 394 A.2d 1213 (citing <em>People v. Barbara, </em>400 Mich. 352, 255 N.W.2d 171 (1977); <em>U.S. v. Wilson, </em>361 F.Supp. 510, 514 (D.Md.1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">However, the juvenile court erred in considering the polygraph evidence in a court proceeding, <em>see In re Rachel S., </em>60 Md.App. at 150, 481 A.2d 520, and, under the facts of this case, that consideration was prejudicial. Accordingly, the improper consideration of the polygraph constituted a fatal error in the proceedings, and the court abused its discretion in changing the CINA permanency plan based, in part, on the consideration of that inadmissible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">We note that we have no criticisms or concerns regarding the juvenile court\u2019s analysis of the evidence that was <em>properly </em>before it. Nor do we criticize the weight the court gave to that evidence, for we give great deference to the credibility determinations of the juvenile court<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and recognize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>the heightened responsibility of the court in child abuse cases. Additionally, we do not find error in the Department\u2019s internal use of polygraph testing as part of its investigative process. Indeed, in the investigation of suspected child abuse, Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) 07.02.07.11 provides that \u201c[t]he local department may consider any available information regarding the family, individual, or child at issue.\u201d However, we must maintain the careful distinction between an investigative tool and evidence that has sufficient reliability for consideration in an adjudicative proceeding. To countenance the admission of inherently unreliable evidence, such as a polygraph test, would set a dangerous precedent, especially in cases like this, where a child has been abused and there is no direct evidence identifying the abuser, or the circumstances surrounding the occurrence of abuse. Certainly, where critical portions of the narrative are unavailable for the court\u2019s analysis (who committed the abuse and the surrounding circumstances), unreliable polygraph evidence should not substitute for what is missing \u2014 especially given that an abuser may be able to manipulate the test. <em>See United States v. Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. 303, 310 n. 6, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 140 L.Ed.2d 413 (1998) (\u201cEven if the basic debate about the reliability of polygraph technology itself were resolved, however, there would still be controversy over the efficacy of countermeasures, or deliberately adopted strategies that a polygraph examinee can employ to provoke physiological responses that will obscure accurate readings and thus \u2018fool\u2019 the polygraph machine and the examiner.\u201d). Therefore, it is only due to the court\u2019s improper reliance on the polygraph examination in reaching its decision \u2014 removing reunification from the permanency plan \u2014 that we vacate the May 1, 2015, orders and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>ORDERS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HOWARD COUNTY DATED MAY 1, 2015, IN CASES 13-1-13-50511, 13-1-13-50512, AND 13-1-13-50513, VACATED.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY HOWARD COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-8\">.
