After she was sentenced to 18 months, with all but six months suspended, appellant timely appealed and presents the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-10\">1. Did the motions court err in denying Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress a statement obtained in violation of <em>Miranda </em>?<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-11\">2. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in permitting Loss Prevention Officer Salley to narrate the events depicted in the Macy\u2019s closed-circuit camera footage?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">For the following reasons, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\n<em>Motions Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">On April 14, 2013, Thea Salley, a loss prevention agent with the Macy\u2019s Department store located in the Columbia Mall, testified that appellant and two juveniles were stopped by Macy\u2019s loss prevention agents as they exited the store carrying concealed merchandise. Because appellant fought with the loss prevention agents in the Macy\u2019s parking lot, the agents handcuffed her, for her safety as well as their own.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Appellant and the two juveniles were then escorted to the Macy\u2019s loss prevention office, located in an area of the store that otherwise was not accessible to the general public. Salley testified that the dimensions of the office was equal to half the size of the well in the courtroom, or approximately 20 feet by 20 feet. The room was well lit, and there were no police insignia located anywhere within the room. Further, there was one door to the office, and that door was closed during Salley\u2019s interview with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Salley stated that, as a loss prevention officer, she worked for Macy\u2019s, a retail store that is \u201cnot affiliated with any government organization.\u201d Salley testified that her office was \u201cnot a police department,\u201d and that loss prevention officers are not \u201cendowed with arrest powers,\u201d nor are they \u201cpolice officers themselves.\u201d According to Salley, during her six years at Macy\u2019s, she was never \u201caffiliated with any law enforcement agency\u201d and never worked for the Howard County Police Department or any other police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">When appellant and her two companions initially arrived in the office, they were met by Salley and three other Macy\u2019s loss prevention officers. At that time, while Salley was attempting to get everything \u201csorted out,\u201d appellant admitted that the two juveniles were under her care and that, according to Salley, \u201cshe was taking all the blame for anything that they \u2014 that the two juveniles did.\u201d Salley also testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-10\">Ms. Paige was frightened that the two juvenile teenagers that was with her, she was frightened that she would be in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>trouble by the parents of the children because they was under her custody. She was \u2014 they were hanging out with her is what she said and she wanted all the blame to go on herself because she didn\u2019t want the parents of the children to try to, you know, harm her or \u2014 and/or threaten her. So, she repeatedly said, \u201cI did it. I did everything. I did everything. Don\u2019t involve them. Don\u2019t get them in trouble.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">At a later point, Salley called the Howard County Police, informed them of the theft, and asked them to respond to the store. Salley testified that the police ordinarily were called anytime there was a shoplifting case where the value of the goods exceeded $50.00. Salley agreed that she called the police so that appellant would ultimately be charged in connection with the theft. She also stated that she had called Howard County Police about sixteen times in the past month and that equaled the average number of calls Macy\u2019s would make on a monthly basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Officer Kristian Bush, of the Howard County Police Department, arrived at approximately 2:10 p.m.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thereafter, at around 2:48 p.m., and after appellant\u2019s handcuffs had been removed, appellant signed a Macy\u2019s statement of admission form, a Macy\u2019s trespass notification form, and a Macy\u2019s civil demand notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Salley agreed that Officer Bush was present when these forms were signed. At the time, Officer Bush was standing near the door, up against a wall. Salley confirmed that Officer Bush did not handle the Macy\u2019s forms, and that she handed the forms over to appellant. In addition, Officer Bush never handcuffed appellant, nor did he ever threaten her. And, according to Salley, Officer Bush never spoke to appellant about the Macy\u2019s forms and never told her that she needed to talk in order to avoid arrest. Salley further testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>fied that she did not tell Officer Bush about appellant\u2019s earlier oral admission of guilt. After appellant signed the Macy\u2019s forms, she was temporarily transferred to the custody of Officer Bush, who released her shortly thereafter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">In addition to Salley, Officer Bush also testified at the motions hearing, but he provided very limited details about the interview with appellant. He confirmed that he met with Salley on the day in question and went to the loss prevention office. However, when asked if he saw Salley direct anyone to sign any papers in his presence, the officer replied that he was \u201cnot sure,\u201d and \u201cI didn\u2019t notice that.\u201d Officer Bush then concluded his brief testimony by stating: \u201cI believe the \u2014 the three suspects that were in custody signed papers, and I\u2019m not sure of the papers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">After testimony concluded, defense counsel moved to suppress any statements appellant made after Officer Bush arrived in the Macy\u2019s loss prevention office. Counsel\u2019s argument was that the presence of the police officer, as well as the other circumstances surrounding the interview, established that appellant was in custody when she signed the written admissions of guilt and that those statements should be suppressed. The State responded that any statements appellant made were not made to State agents because the Macy\u2019s employees were not working as agents of the police. Further, the State contended that Officer Bush was merely present and did nothing to either further the interview or to suggest that appellant was in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">In denying the motion to suppress, the circuit court found that, after Macy\u2019s employees observed an apparent shoplifting, they took appellant \u201cinto their custody based on a \u2014 what they observed.\u201d Appellant was handcuffed by Macy\u2019s personnel and then taken to the loss prevention office at the store. The court further found that there was no dispute that appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>gave an oral admission of guilt, and that statement was made before the police officer, Officer Bush, arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The circuit court then found that, after Officer Bush arrived, he did not take appellant into police custody, he did not handcuff her, he was not aware of the prior oral admission, and he did not make \u201cany inquiries of the defendant concerning any statement or \u2014 or the signing of any documents by the defendant.\u201d The court also found that, although Officer Bush was present in the loss prevention office when appellant signed the written admissions, he did not \u201cseem to be taking any sort of an active role\u201d in the investigation. In fact, the court found that Officer Bush \u201cwasn\u2019t entirely aware of exactly what the paperwork was\u201d and that \u201ctheir decision to present the paperwork to the defendant was not at Officer Bush\u2019s suggestion or direction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The circuit court then concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">So, clearly, you have custody, but it\u2019s not police custody. It\u2019s Macy\u2019s custody. And I don\u2019t find that \u2014 that the Macy\u2019s personnel were acting on behalf of Officer Bush or the Howard County Police Department. The Macy\u2019s personnel clearly are not state agents or actors. The arrest was by Macy\u2019s. No participation in the arrest by Officer Bush. The handcuffs were Macy\u2019s. The Macy\u2019s loss prevention room is not a Howard County Police facility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">There is no indication Officer Bush made any gestures or statements to the defendant or about the defendant within earshot of the defendant to manipulate her into signing the subject documents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">So, the \u2014 I find that the defense has not met its burden of demonstrating that there was a Howard County Police custody or interrogation by Howard County Police or some actors acting on the \u2014 for the benefit of the Howard County Police Department or for \u2014 or based on any sort of encourage [sic] or direction of the Howard County Police Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>So, I find that the defense has not been able to meet its initial burden of demonstrating that this was a police custody or police interrogation, and I\u2019ll deny your motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\n<em>Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">On April 14, 2013, at around 1:30 p.m., Salley was working as a loss prevention officer at the Macy\u2019s inside the Columbia Mall. While observing the broadcasts from the approximately 97 closed circuit televisions located throughout the store, Salley saw a man roaming around in the women\u2019s department. Testifying that this was \u201ckind of unusual,\u201d she watched the man approach three female individuals, which included appellant, a 14-year-old, and a 16-year-old. One of these three was carrying a large Downtown Locker Room bag, and another was carrying a black handbag.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> All three were making \u201crandom selections\u201d of merchandise from the racks without looking at either the price tag or the sizes of the respective items. They would drape this merchandise over their arms, concealing the contents of the bags. Salley identified appellant, in court, as one of these three individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Salley watched as appellant selected a leather jacket, a yellow shirt, and some leggings, and then threw them over her arm. Then, appellant and the other two juveniles went to the fitting rooms. There, all three of them went inside a single stall. Testifying that the stall was a \u201csmall room,\u201d Salley indicated that the three individuals remained in the stall for ten minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Salley provided more detail in court as she testified along with a recording of surveillance video that was played for the jury. After watching the man approach appellant and the other two juveniles, Salley watched them on multiple cameras, from multiple angles, walking around the women\u2019s department. Salley saw six items of merchandise in appellant\u2019s possession at this time, and she also testified that one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>other juveniles was carrying the large Downtown Locker Room bag. The three individuals continued walking around the department, working their way towards the fitting rooms, gathering merchandise along the way. After the man again appeared in the video nearby, appellant and the two juveniles then took \u201ca lot of merchandise\u201d into the handicapped stall located in the fitting room, where they remained for approximately ten minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Because there were no cameras in the fitting room stall, Salley left her post in the loss prevention observation room and went to the fitting room area. She then entered a stall that was located opposite the one occupied by appellant and the juveniles. Salley was able to see into this other stall because there were broken slats on the bottom of the door. As she crouched down to get a better view, Salley observed \u201cthe merchandise going into the black bag and the Downtown Locker Room bag.\u201d And, Salley specifically saw appellant placing items into the Downtown Locker Room bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Salley then testified that, while she was inside the adjacent stall, she heard the man she had seen before call out, and appellant and the two juveniles then emerged from their stall, exiting together and carrying a few items. After appellant and the juveniles placed a few of these items down, Salley saw that one of the other, unidentified juveniles was carrying the Downtown Locker Room bag. Over objection, Salley testified that the bag had been filled because it was larger than it was before the three of them first took the bag into the stall. After the appellant and the two juveniles walked away, Salley entered the stall in question and noticed that, although appellant originally entered with six items of merchandise, only two items remained behind.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Salley then emerged from the fitting room and watched as appellant proceeded past approximately twelve cash registers, without paying, towards a store exit. After appellant and her companions walked out the door, Salley called out a code on her radio that instructed other loss prevention officers to stop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>and detain appellant and her companions \u201c[b]ecause they left the store with merchandise that was unpaid for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Appellant was apprehended near the curb outside Macy\u2019s carrying the Downtown Locker Room bag. There ensued a \u201clot of tussling and fighting and profanity.\u201d Salley explained that she identified herself and told appellant that she needed to come back inside the store to discuss the merchandise, but appellant attempted \u201cto run and fight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Thereafter, after she was escorted to the loss prevention office, appellant verbally admitted that she stole the Macy\u2019s merchandise in question. Appellant also signed a Macy\u2019s trespass notice, a Macy\u2019s civil demand notice, and a Macy\u2019s statement of admission. The trespass notice forbade appellant from entering any Macy\u2019s for three years. And, the civil demand notice let appellant know the amount of restitution owed to Macy\u2019s for the stolen items.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">As for the Macy\u2019s statement of admission, that form not only listed the specific items of merchandise that had been taken, but also included appellant\u2019s admission that \u201cI did take merchandise and/or cash belong to Macy\u2019s valued at $673.98 without consent or permission and with the intent to permanently deprive Macy\u2019s of their property.\u201d Salley testified that she had personally witnessed appellant take many of the listed items while inside the store. She also saw appellant attempt to leave without paying for them. The items, with their anti-theft sensors still attached, were ultimately found inside the Downtown Locker Room bag. Salley further testified that the bag was lined with aluminum foil which was significant because lining a bag in this way could defeat the sensor alarms located near the exits of the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Appellant testified in her defense that her boyfriend, Brandon Wilder, drove her and the two other juveniles to the Columbia Mall on the date in question in order to buy clothes. Appellant agreed that she went into the fitting room with the two juveniles and watched as they tried on some of the clothes. Appellant had brought some of the items into the fitting room and then left some behind when the three of them left.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>After leaving the fitting room, appellant and the two juveniles met up with Wilder and then walked out of Macy\u2019s. Appellant testified that one of the two juveniles was carrying a bag at the time. Appellant denied leaving the store with anything in her hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">At that point, appellant was apprehended by three men. The three men were not in uniform, did not have identification badges, and did not identify themselves to her.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After the men told her she needed to go back inside Macy\u2019s, because someone had stolen merchandise, appellant complied, but the woman who had the bag resisted. Appellant maintained that she did not know about, and was not involved with, the shoplifting.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Appellant was taken to a small room, where she and the two juveniles were interviewed by three or four men, as well as Salley and a police officer. During the course of the interview, Salley gave appellant the forms and told her to sign them. Appellant testified that she had a prior theft case and had vowed never to steal again, so she initially refused to sign.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At that point, Salley told her that if she did not sign, she would be turned over to the police officer. Appellant, who was pregnant at the time, needed to go pick up her four-year-old daughter from school that afternoon, so she testified she agreed to sign the papers because \u201cI had no choice.\u201d She maintained that she did not steal anything from Macy\u2019s on the day in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">We shall include additional detail in the following discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">Appellant first contends the circuit court erred in denying the motion to suppress her written statements because she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>was in custody for <em>Miranda </em>purposes when she gave those statements. The State responds that appellant was not in custody because the Macy\u2019s loss prevention agents were not acting as State agents at the time of the encounter. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In reviewing the motions court\u2019s decision on a motion to suppress, we are limited to the facts developed at the hearing, <em>Hill v. State, </em>418 Md. 62, 67 n. 1, 12 A.3d 1193 (2011), viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party on the motion. <em>Robinson v. State, </em>419 Md. 602, 611\u201412, 19 A.3d 952 (2011); <em>accord Gonzalez v. State, </em>429 Md. 632, 647, 57 A.3d 484 (2012). We review the motions court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, but we make our own independent constitutional appraisal, \u201creviewing the relevant law and applying it to the facts and circumstances of this case.\u201d <em>State v. Luckett, </em>413 Md. 360, 375 n. 3, 993 A.2d 25 (2010) (citation omitted); <em>accord Moore v. State, </em>422 Md. 516, 528, 30 A.3d 945 (2011). The issue of whether a confession is voluntary presents a mixed question of law and fact, subject to <em>de novo </em>review, with deference given to the suppression court\u2019s factual findings. <em>Winder v. State, </em>362 Md. 275, 310-11, 765 A.2d 97 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">In Maryland, a confession may be admitted against an accused only when it has been \u201cdetermined that the confession was \u2018(1) voluntary under Maryland non-constitutional law, (2) voluntary under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and (3) elicited in conformance with the mandates of Miranda.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ball v. State, </em>347 Md. 156, 173-74, 699 A.2d 1170 (1997) (quoting <em>Hof v. State, </em>337 Md. 581, 597-98, 655 A.2d 370 (1995)); <em>accord Knight v. State, </em>381 Md. 517, 531-32, 850 A.2d 1179 (2004); <em>Smith v. State, </em>220 Md.App. 256, 273, 103 A.3d 1045 (2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>442 Md. 196, 112 A.3d 374 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Appellant\u2019s claim is grounded in an alleged <em>Miranda </em>violation. Pursuant to <em>Miranda </em>and its progeny, the police are required, when they detain a person for questioning in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>custodial setting, to inform the person of several rights including</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-4\">the right to remain silent, that anything the person says may be used in evidence, that the person has a right to consult with an attorney before responding to questioning, and that an attorney will be appointed if the person is indigent----[A]n inculpatory statement elicited in violation of that requirement is inadmissible in the State\u2019s case-in-chief. <em>See Dickerson v. U.S., </em>530 U.S. 428, 120 S.Ct. 2326, 147 L.Ed.2d 405 (2000).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-7\"><em>Phillips v. State, </em>425 Md. 210, 212, 40 A.3d 25 (2012) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">The <em>Miranda </em>requirements, however, apply only to custodial interrogation. <em>J.D.B. v. North Carolina, </em>564 U.S. 261, 131 S.Ct. 2394, 2401-02, 180 L.Ed.2d 310 (2011). This is due to the Supreme Court\u2019s recognition that \u201c[a]ny interview of one suspected of a crime by a police officer will have coercive aspects to it, simply by virtue of the fact that the police officer is part of a law enforcement system which may ultimately cause the suspect to be charged with a crime.\u201d <em>Oregon v. Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 495, 97 S.Ct. 711, 50 L.Ed.2d 714 (1977) (per curiam). Therefore, \u201cbefore a defendant can claim the benefit of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, the defendant must establish two things: (1) custody; and (2) interrogation.\u201d <em>State v. Thomas, </em>202 Md.App. 545, 565, 33 A.3d 494 (2011) (citation omitted), <em>aff'd, </em>429 Md. 246, 55 A.3d 680 (2012). <em>Accord Smith v. State, </em>186 Md.App. 498, 518, 974 A.2d 991 (2009), <em>aff'd, </em>414 Md. 357, 995 A.2d 685 (2010). And, the burden of \u201cshowing the applicability of the <em>Miranda </em>requirements,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>that there was custody and interrogation, is on the defendant. <em>Smith, </em>186 Md.App. at 520, 974 A.2d 991.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">In suggesting that appellant has not met her burden, the State contends that she was not in custody when she was interrogated by the Macy\u2019s loss prevention agents. Some commentators have addressed this issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-10\">The Supreme Court has emphasized that constitutional rights protect against governmental infraction. In 1986 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number><em>Colorado v. Connelly, </em>[479 U.S. 157, 107 S.Ct. 515, 93 L.Ed.2d 473 (1986) ], the Supreme Court ruled that, in order for a confession to be suppressed under the constitutional due process test of voluntariness, \u201ccoercive police activity is a predicate.\u201d The <em>Connelly </em>Court concluded: \u201cEven the most outrageous behavior by a private party seeking to secure evidence against a defendant does not make that evidence inadmissible under the Due Process clause.\u201d Some form of police interrogation is similarly required to trigger the <em>Miranda </em>protections of the Fifth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4z\">Jezic, et al., <em>Maryland Law of Confessions </em>\u00a7 10:1 at 437-38 (2014-2015 ed.) (footnotes omitted) (hereinafter <em>\u201cLaw of Confessions </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">And:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">In the <em>Miranda </em>case the Court defined interrogation as \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers.\u201d Because of this and also because of the general doctrine that state action is a prerequisite to application of constitutional protections, it is clear that <em>Miranda </em>does not govern interrogation by private citizens acting on their own.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">2 LaFave, Israel, et al., <em>Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 6.10(b) at 871-72 (3d ed.2007) (footnote omitted) (hereinafter <em>\u201cCriminal Procedure </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">There is little case law in Maryland addressing when or whether the <em>Miranda </em>advisements are necessary when it is alleged an encounter involves a non-State actor. In <em>Pratt v. State, </em>9 Md.App. 220, 263 A.2d 247 (1970), William C. McKinley worked as a security officer for Montgomery Ward, Incorporated, in Prince George\u2019s County. In fulfilling this role, McKinley swore an oath to perform his duties and was appointed by the Governor in order to protect the property of the establishment. <em>Id. </em>at 220, 263 A.2d 247. On October 8, 1970, McKinley saw Bernard Pratt climb onto a Montgomery Ward\u2019s department store\u2019s loading dock and start to move a box towards the edge. <em>Id. </em>at 221-22, 263 A.2d 247. After he hollered for Pratt to stop, a chase ensued inside the store, and Pratt, apparently carrying a box of stolen merchandise, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>ultimately stopped by McKinley and taken to the store security office. <em>Id. </em>at 222, 263 A.2d 247. The box contained a sewing machine worth approximately $170.00. <em>Id. </em>At trial before a jury, and over objection, McKinley testified that he asked Pratt \u201cif he was going to sell the sewing machine and he said no, he was going to keep it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The issue on appeal was whether McKinley was acting as a law enforcement agent such that admission of Pratt\u2019s statement was in violation of <em>Miranda. </em>The Court agreed with Pratt that the statement was improperly admitted. <em>Pratt, </em>9 Md.App. at 226-27, 263 A.2d 247. McKinley had testified that he was a sworn, and appointed, law enforcement officer, pursuant to then Sections 342-348 of former Article 23. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1957), Art. 23, \u00a7\u00a7 342-48 (superseded). Pertinent to its discussion, former Section 344 authorized policemen appointed under these provisions to exercise \u201call the authority and powers held and exercised by constables at common law and under the statutes of this State, and also all the authority and powers conferred by law on policemen in the City of Baltimore.\u201d Article 23 \u00a7 344 (superseded).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">This Court agreed that this designation of powers meant that McKinley was performing his duties as a State actor. The Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">\u201cIf an individual is possessed of state authority and purports to act under that authority, his action is state action. It is irrelevant that he might have taken the same action had he acted in a purely private capacity or that the particular action which he took was not authorized by state law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ais\"><em>Pratt, </em>9 Md.App. at 226, 263 A.2d 247 (quoting <em>Griffin v. State of Maryland, </em>378 U.S. 130, 135, 84 S.Ct. 1770, 12 L.Ed.2d 754 (1964)).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">This Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-9\">With regard to the issue of the admissibility of the statement, the court could not have properly concluded, on the evidence before it, other than that McKinley was appointed and qualified as a policeman as provided by law, and purported to act under that authority when he took appellant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>custody. We find it crystal clear that McKinley was a \u2018law enforcement officer\u2019 within the meaning of <em>Miranda.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">As the statement of appellant was obtained by a law enforcement officer initiating questioning of him while he was in custody without the employment of the procedural safeguards required by <em>Miranda, </em>its introduction in evidence was reversible error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-6\"><em>Pratt, </em>9 Md.App. at 226, 268 A.2d 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">The role of private security guards in Maryland has also been addressed in cases decided under the Fourth Amendment. For instance, in <em>Waters v. State, </em>320 Md. 52, 575 A.2d 1244 (1990), on the evening of May 16, 1988, while Paul Madden was working as a licensed security guard at a private establishment in Anne Arundel County, he accosted Waters, apparently at gunpoint, as Waters was leaning against a vehicle in the parking lot. During the encounter, Madden removed a beer can and a plastic bag containing a whitish substance from Waters\u2019s pocket. <em>Waters, </em>320 Md. at 54, 575 A.2d 1244. Madden called Anne Arundel County police, and Waters was arrested and charged with possessing cocaine. <em>Id. </em>at 54-55, 575 A.2d 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Waters moved to suppress the cocaine, contending that Madden was acting as an agent of the police and that the arrest and search were unlawful under the Fourth Amendment. <em>Waters, </em>320 Md. at 55, 575 A.2d 1244. Waters maintained that because privately licensed security guards, just like special police officers commissioned by the Governor, perform duties similar to those of regular police officers, he was subject to illegal state action. <em>Id. </em>at 56, 575 A.2d 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">The Court of Appeals disagreed and affirmed Waters\u2019s conviction. The Court began its analysis as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-10\">The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees the right of individuals to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures. It applies to actions by the State, <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 655, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 1691, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961), but generally does not apply to actions by private individuals. <em>United States v. Jacobsen, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>466 U.S. 109, 113, 104 S.Ct. 1652, 1656, 80 L.Ed.2d 85 (1984); <em>Burdeau v. McDowell, </em>256 U.S. 465, 467, 41 S.Ct. 574, 574, 65 L.Ed. 1048 (1921). Thus when a private individual obtains incriminatory matter from an accused, no matter how improperly, and such matter comes into the possession of the government without a violation of the accused\u2019s rights by governmental authority, the exclusionary rule does not prohibit its use at trial. <em>Bowers v. State, </em>298 Md. 115, 139-40, 468 A.2d 101 (1983); <em>Herbert v. State, </em>10 Md.App. 279, 284-85, 269 A.2d 430 (1970). A private search or seizure may, however, trigger Fourth Amendment protections if the private individual whose actions are in question, \u201cin light of all the circumstances of the case, must be regarded as having acted as an \u2018instrument\u2019 or agent of the state.\u201d <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 487, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 2048, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-5\"><em>Waters, </em>320 Md. at 56-57, 575 A.2d 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The Court distinguished between private individuals employed as \u201cspecial police officers\u201d appointed by the Governor pursuant to statute, and individuals licensed as security guards by the Maryland State Police. <em>Waters, </em>320 Md. at 57-59, 575 A.2d 1244. Special police officers have \u201c \u2018and may exercise, the powers of a police officer upon the property,\u2019 including the power to preserve the \u2018peace and good order\u2019 of the property and to make arrests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57, 575 A.2d 1244 (quoting Md.Code (1986 Repl.Vol.), Article 41, \u00a7 4-905 (repealed)). Security guards, in contrast, do not have arrest or other police powers. <em>Id. </em>at 58, 575 A.2d 1244. The Court explained that \u201c[w]ithout governmental powers, security guards are acting as private citizens when protecting property, and their private status is not altered because their interest in protecting property coincides with the public\u2019s interest in preventing crime generally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 59, 575 A.2d 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The Court concluded that Waters had not met his burden of establishing a Fourth Amendment violation. <em>Waters, </em>320 Md. at 59, 575 A.2d 1244. He also did not prevail because, \u201c[i]n the same vein, the burden of establishing government involvement in a private search rests on the party objecting to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>admissibility of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60, 575 A.2d 1244 (citations omitted). As Madden was a licensed security guard and there was no evidence that he \u201cwas working in collusion with the police at the time of the search, or otherwise acted as an instrument of the State in the performance of his duties,\u201d the Court of Appeals agreed that the evidence was admissible and that the motion to suppress was properly denied. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The commentators have further explained the distinction in Maryland law as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">Special police officers are deemed state agents in the performance of their responsibilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">Unlike special police officers, security guards are not vested with arrest or other police powers.... Courts in Maryland have therefore determined that such private security guards are not state agents unless they are working under the direction of, or in concert with, law enforcement officers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOA\"><em>Law of Confessions, </em>\u00a7 10:7 at 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">And:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-9\">[T]he courts have rather consistently held that such persons as security officers, store detectives, railroad detectives, insurance investigators, bank investigators, and private investigators are not required to comply with the <em>Miranda </em>procedures. A contrary result has sometimes been reached if the interrogator, though then serving private security functions, has been given police powers by a governmental unit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-10\"><em>Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 6.10(b) at 873.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">The record in this case persuades us that Salley and the other loss prevention officers at Macy\u2019s were private security guards, and were not special police officers, as that category of individual is understood under Maryland law. Salley did not have any arrest powers or other duties associated with typical law enforcement. Ordinarily in these circumstances, and as many courts recognize, private security guards are not required to give the <em>Miranda </em>warnings when interrogating an individual. <em>See </em>Woods <em>v. City Court of City of Tucson, </em>128 Ariz. 477, 626 P.2d 1109, 1110 (Ct.App.1981); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number><em>People v.

State, </em>615 So.2d 1265 (Ala.Crim.App.1992). In that case, Peoples entered a K-Mart with her two children and another unrelated juvenile child from her neighborhood. While she was in the shoe department, the unrelated juvenile was stopped on suspicion of shoplifting. Peoples was called to the front of the store and informed of these developments. <em>Peoples, </em>615 So.2d at 1265-66. After disavowing any responsibility for this other child, Peoples began to walk away but was stopped after store personnel noticed that she not only was wearing new shoes from the shoe department, but that their tags had been removed. <em>Id. </em>at 1266.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Peoples and her children were then taken to the store security office, where they were interviewed by three store employees and a police officer in a very small room that could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>barely accommodate that number. <em>Id. </em>The police officer had responded to the store earlier due to the reported shoplifting by the juvenile and was asked by the loss prevention manager to attend the interview with Peoples. <em>Id. </em>In the presence of this police officer, Peoples was questioned about the new shoes she was wearing, as well as other items. <em>Id. </em>After Peoples confessed to stealing the shoes, the police officer, who had been relatively quiet during the interview, then began to question Peoples for purposes of completing a police report. <em>Id. </em>Following this inquiry, the officer told Peoples to turn herself in at a later time because she had small children with her. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">On appeal, and after recognizing the general rule that the Fifth Amendment protections ordinarily do not apply to questioning by private citizens, the Alabama appellate court concluded that, under the facts of the case, Peoples should have been advised of her <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>Peoples, </em>615 So.2d at 1267. The Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">[I]n certain instances private conduct can become so entangled with government involvement that a reasonable person would find it difficult to distinguish one from another. In such a case, the question of whether one is entitled to the protections of <em>Miranda </em>cannot be answered merely by observing the relationship between the private citizen and the government official as they themselves see it. Our inquiry must focus on whether \u201cthe presence of the police and/or other circumstances indicate that the questioner is acting on behalf of the police.\u201d 1 W. LaFave &amp; J. Israel, supra, \u00a7 6.10(b), p. 141 (Supp.1991). \u201cIt is the impact on the suspect\u2019s mind of the interplay between police interrogation and police custody \u2014 each condition <em>reinforcing </em>the pressures and anxieties produced by the other \u2014 which creates \u2018custodial interrogation\u2019 within the meaning of <em>Miranda.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-7\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">The Court then held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>In the present case, the police officer\u2019s involvement in the appellant\u2019s interrogation was not insignificant. The record indicates that the officer was present throughout the process. He had recently assisted in the arrest of the youngster who had accompanied the appellant to the store and was then asked by an employee to remain in the security office during the detention and the questioning of the appellant. Furthermore, the physical surroundings and conditions of the interrogation certainly emphasized the officer\u2019s presence. Under these circumstances, the appellant could have reasonably concluded that she was not merely answering the questions of the K-Mart employees, but the questions of the police officer as well and that, for all practical purposes, a police investigation was in progress. Therefore, the appellant was entitled to be advised of her rights under <em>Miranda </em>before being questioned. The trial court erred in allowing the appellant\u2019s confession into evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">We conclude that <em>Peoples </em>is distinguishable. Unlike that case, Officer Bush\u2019s role in appellant\u2019s interview was very limited. He was not involved when appellant was stopped and handcuffed by Macy\u2019s employees. Nor did he interview appellant or ask her any questions. And there is no indication in the record that Officer Bush directed the private security guards in their actions in obtaining the written admissions from appellant. Thus, we conclude that the motions court was not clearly erroneous in ruling that Salley and the other Macy\u2019s employees were not agents of the State. And, we also conclude that Officer Bush\u2019s presence was not the equivalent of police custody so as to require the satisfaction of <em>Miranda. </em>Accordingly, the court properly denied the motion to suppress appellant\u2019s written statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Moreover, even if the court erred in admitting the written admissions, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because appellant confessed to the shoplifting before Officer Bush arrived. <em>See State v. Logan, </em>394 Md. 378, 388-91, 906 A.2d 374 (2006) (applying harmless error analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>to a <em>Miranda </em>violation but holding error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt); <em>see also Bartram v. State, </em>33 Md.App. 115, 153, 364 A.2d 1119 (1976) (\u201cIt is, of course, settled law that a <em>Miranda </em>error can, indeed, be harmless error\u201d) (citations omitted), <em>aff'd, </em>280 Md. 616, 374 A.2d 1144 (1977); <em>Cummings v. State, </em>27 Md.App. 361, 385 n. 5, 341 A.2d 294 (1975) (\u201cThat a <em>Miranda </em>violation can be harmless error is not to be doubted\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Here, in addition to testifying at the motions hearing that appellant confessed before Officer Bush arrived at trial, Salley was asked on direct examination, \u201cbeyond the signed statements, did [appellant] admit to stealing the items from Macy\u2019s?\u201d Salley testified, without objection, \u201cYes.\u201d We hold that any error in suppressing the written statements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt given that the jury heard evidence of appellant\u2019s confession, without objection. <em>See State v. Guidry, </em>496 So.2d 650, 653 (La.Ct.App.1986) (even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that a private security guard was acting as a law enforcement agent, the defendant\u2019s statement, \u201cI\u2019m guilty,\u201d was unsolicited and voluntary); <em>Sandone v. State, </em>394 S.W.3d 788, 794 (Tex.App.2013) (concluding that any error in admitting testimony about statements defendant gave to store\u2019s loss prevention officer was harmless where another witness testified to the same facts without objection).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Appellant next asserts that the circuit court erred in allowing Salley to narrate the events depicted in the surveillance video. Appellant\u2019s claim in this Court is that Salley offered improper lay opinion. The State responds that the issue was not properly preserved because these grounds were not raised in court, and that the issue is without merit in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Prior to hearing any specific testimony about the surveillance video recording of the incident, defense counsel objected on the grounds that there was no foundation for the video. A bench conference ensued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: (Indiscernible) any type of CD, any information to determine how it gets recorded, whether or not she did it. The foundation element is just not there at this point, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-4\">[PROSECUTOR]: I\u2019m not offering it for (indiscernible) right now. The objection is premature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\">THE COURT: And, can I ask you, is this the original CD or is this one that was made from the security system at the store?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Can we ask the witness that, Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">THE COURT: Okay. I just \u2014 if it\u2019s not the original then I\u2019d like to know who created it and how they did that and if the program that they used is reliable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">Subsequently, Salley testified that the video was recorded and kept in the ordinary course of business for Macy\u2019s, that she was a custodian of records for the store, that she watched the video in question, and that this video was consistent with what she personally observed on the day in question. When asked whether defense counsel wanted to conduct any further <em>voir dire, </em>counsel declined, stating \u201cI believe the foundation requirements have been fulfilled.\u201d The video was thereafter admitted into evidence without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">The State then received permission to publish the video to the jury. Just prior to playing the video, the following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-11\">BY [PROSECUTOR]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-12\">Q. Now, Ms. Salley, I\u2019m going to play the recording that\u2019s already in evidence as State\u2019s.

At several points while the video played, the State fast forwarded through the video, and defense counsel expressly stated that he had no objection so long as the video could be observed during that fast forwarding.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">Salley continued to testify, still without objection, that she saw appellant and the two other juveniles on the video as they stood together with the unidentified man. She testified as to another point in time when the three were observed on the video talking on cellphones and making selections in the women\u2019s department. Salley testified, again without objection, that she saw appellant in the video on the \u201ctop of the screen on the right.\u201d Salley testified further that appellant could be seen on the video on the \u201cleft side of the screen,\u201d carrying a pair of black Nike jogging pants. She also testified, without objection, to scenes during the video when: appellant was observed selecting a black and white athletic t-shirt; making more selections in the store, and then walking over to the fitting room and looking for an empty stall. Salley further stated, without objection, that the three individuals went into a stall together. The video then depicted the moment in time when Salley, herself, entered an adjacent stall in order to continue her surveillance from the store floor. Salley maintained that the video had not been altered or disturbed in any way, and that she was able to see appellant throughout the course of that video recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Salley then testified as follows on further direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">Q. Now, please detail for us once again what\u2019s in the recording.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">A. Right now the recording shows the gentleman come back to the stall with the three women that stall together [sic]. He called out to them.

And secondly, my job is to verify and identify anything that was left in the stall after they walked out of the stall.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-17\">Salley explained that appellant originally entered the stall carrying six items. After she inspected the stall, Salley determined that \u201c[f]our of the items that stood out to us during their selection were not in the stall at all.\u201d Two items remained behind, according to Salley.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-18\">Salley continued testifying about a second camera view of the incident, again without objection. Salley explained that the second recording offered \u201c[d]ifferent angles\u201d that showed \u201cdifferent people making selections.\u201d She provided details from that recording including, but not limited to, views of: appellant and her two female companions; appellant selecting a yellow shirt from the Nike section of the athletic area of the women\u2019s department; one of appellant\u2019s companions with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Downtown Locker Room bag; and, a picture of both the outside of the stall where all three had entered with merchandise, and an area in the fitting room just outside that same stall.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Salley also testified there was a third view of the encounter, and that view displayed similar scenes of appellant and the two juveniles congregating together throughout the store and entering and exiting the fitting room stall together. Salley testified, without objection, that a portion of the recording showed the three individuals exiting the store without paying for the merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Considering this record, we begin with Md. Rule 8-131 (a), which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">Ordinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court, but the Court may decide such an issue if necessary or desirable to guide the trial court or to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Additionally, Md. Rule 4-323(a) provides, again in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\">An objection to the admission of evidence shall be made at the time the evidence is offered or as soon thereafter as the grounds for objection become apparent. Otherwise, the objection is waived. The grounds for the objection need not be stated unless the court, at the request of a party or on its own initiative, so directs. The court shall rule upon the objection promptly....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">The purposes of these rules are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-11\">\u201c(a) to require counsel to bring the position of their client to the attention of the lower court at the trial so that the trial court can pass upon, and possibly correct any errors in the proceedings, and (b) to prevent the trial of cases in a piecemeal fashion, thus accelerating the termination of litigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number><em>Fitzgerald v.

We ordinarily would conclude that this issue is not preserved due to the overall absence of specific objections to Salley\u2019s testimony on the grounds raised for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">However, there was one instance where counsel raised a general objection. Pursuant to Md. Rule 4-323(a), if a party appeals a trial court\u2019s ruling on a \u201cgeneral\u201d objection to the admission of evidence, then that party is free to \u201cargue <em>any </em>ground against its inadmissibility.\u201d <em>See Johnson v.

This is so because Salley offered a similar opinion later during direct examination, without objection, when she testified that the video showed the Downtown Locker Room bag when it was smaller and then later again, when it was larger. Specifically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-13\">Q. And you mentioned earlier the bag was a smaller, sort of, state at this time. Was that the state you were talking about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-14\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-15\">Q. And when you will see this again, in this recording, will it be smaller, the same or larger?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>A. Larger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">In <em>Yates v. State, </em>429 Md. 112, 120-21, 55 A.3d 25 (2012), the Court of Appeals stated: \u201c[w]here competent evidence of a matter is received, no prejudice is sustained where other objected to evidence of the same matter is also received.\u201d (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also DeLeon v. State, </em>407 Md. 16, 30-31, 962 A.2d 383 (2008) (holding that a defendant waived an objection to what he claimed was irrelevant and highly prejudicial testimony about his purported gang affiliation because \u201cevidence on the same point [was] admitted without objection\u201d elsewhere at trial). Although defense counsel\u2019s general objection initially preserved a challenge to Salley\u2019s direct examination offering an opinion about the relative appearance of the Downtown Locker Room bag, that objection was waived when similar testimony came in later without objection. Accordingly, we are persuaded that this issue is not preserved for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Even if preserved, we conclude that appellant\u2019s claim is without merit. \u201cWe review a circuit court\u2019s decisions to admit or exclude evidence applying an abuse of discretion standard\u201d <em>Norwood v. State, </em>222 Md.App. 620, 642, 114 A.3d 267 (citing <em>Kelly v. State, </em>392 Md. 511, 530, 898 A.2d 419 (2006)), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 Md. 640, 120 A.3d 767 (2015); <em>see also Warren v.

State, </em>348 Md. 104, 121, 124, 702 A.2d 741 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">The issue presented concerns admission of Salley\u2019s opinions. By way of background information, Salley had been employed as a loss prevention officer at Macy\u2019s for six years. During that time, she attended yearly training sessions that taught her how to apprehend, escort, and detain individuals suspected of shoplifting. She testified that there were five \u201csteps\u201d that a loss prevention officer needed to observe prior to making an apprehension, and those steps were \u201centry, selection, continuous observation, concealment and exit.\u201d Her job at Macy\u2019s required her to view 97 closed circuit televisions throughout <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>the entirety of the store, except for the restrooms, the stalls inside the fitting rooms, and the employee lounge.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">On April 14, 2013, Salley was working in the Columbia Mall Macy\u2019s when she personally watched appellant, from the moment appellant first appeared in the women\u2019s department until she exited the door. Pertinent to this issue, Salley testified that she had reviewed the video prior to trial, and that the information recorded on the CD was a fair and accurate depiction of what transpired on the day in question. Macy\u2019s retained videos such as these in the ordinary course of business, and Salley agreed that she was a custodian of the specific video that was recorded in connection with this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Thereafter, during the playing of the recording, it was apparent that Salley had operated the surveillance cameras on the day in question. She testified that, at one point, she switched cameras while following the man and zoomed in on his movements as he approached the three individuals. Salley indicated there were three monitors that showed the different angles, and the video used the one monitor that focused on appellant and the two juveniles. She explained that she could move from one camera to any one of the 97 cameras at her disposal during the recording process by pressing a number associated with an individual camera feed. Salley further testified that there were 6 cameras in the athletic and couture section<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the women\u2019s department. Some of these 6 cameras were located over the registers, some were covert cameras, and some were inside black bubbles on the ceilings. Salley stated that these cameras could catch people stealing and could be used to exonerate those individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">We are persuaded that Salley\u2019s testimony, offering a narrative that described the events in the surveillance video, was based on Salley\u2019s personal knowledge of the events that unfolded. To the extent that Salley went beyond testifying to mere facts, any opinions she offered, including the opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>about the change in size of the Downtown Locker Room bag after appellant entered the fitting room stall with the two juveniles, were rationally based on her perception. We also conclude that the testimony, based as it was on Salley\u2019s six-year experience as a loss prevention agent, was helpful to a clear understanding of Salley\u2019s testimony and the determination of whether appellant knew about the shoplifting.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">In support of her argument, appellant cites <em>Moreland v. State, </em>207 Md.App. 563, 53 A.3d 449 (2012). We conclude that <em>Moreland </em>actually supports our decision. In that case, we decided that the lay witness testimony of a non-eyewitness police officer was \u201chelpful\u201d to the jury, and therefore, admissible because the officer had sufficient \u201csubstantial familiarity\u201d with the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 572-73, 53 A.3d 449; <em>see also Tobias v. State, </em>37 Md.App. 605, 616-17, 378 A.2d 698 (1977) (\u2018We find no abuse of discretion in allowing the authenticating witness to identify the people shown in the video tape____The jury saw the tape, and could judge for itself what it showed and whether Detective Battle\u2019s identifications were accurate\u201d). Likewise, Salley, who actually was an eyewitness to the events discussed herein, offered helpful testimony that was probative on the issue of criminal responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">We find additional support in <em>Cuzick v. Commonwealth, </em>276 S.W.3d 260, 266 (Ky.2009). In <em>Cuzick, </em>Officer Bradley Sapp was driving his marked police vehicle when he encountered Cuzick, who was driving the wrong way on a Kentucky roadway. <em>Id. </em>at 262. After activating his emergency equipment and turning around to pursue Cuzick, Officer Sapp stopped appellant momentarily. <em>Id. </em>However, while the officer approached Cuzick\u2019s vehicle on foot, Cuzick sped away from the traffic stop, again into oncoming traffic. <em>Id. </em>Officer Sapp resumed pursuit and, eventually accompanied by Officer Jason Faddasio and Corporal Michael Fleming, a high speed chase, reaching speeds in excess of 85 miles per hour, ensued. <em>Id. </em>Appellant\u2019s vehicle soon thereafter failed, and appellant was apprehended, charged, and convicted of multiple counts, including fleeing and evading police and resisting arrest. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>At trial, both Officer Sapp and Corporal Fleming testified to the events in question. <em>Cuzick, </em>276 S.W.3d at 265. During their respective testimonies, a video of that pursuit was played for the jury. In response to questioning, both officers described the images on that video as it related to their perspective of the underlying events. <em>Id. </em>An issue presented on appeal concerned admission of the officers\u2019s narrative that accompanied playing of the video recording. <em>Id. </em>at 264-65. In its discussion, the Supreme Court of Kentucky noted that it had previously addressed the issue of whether a police officer\u2019s narrative testimony during the playing of a crime scene video was improper lay testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 265. The Court had determined that the relevant test was whether the testimony complied with the Kentucky Rules of Evidence, more specifically, Kentucky Rule of Evidence (\u201cKRE\u201d) 701, governing lay opinion testimony and KRE Rule 602, concerning the requirement that testimony be based on personal knowledge. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Mills v. Commonwealth, </em>996 S.W.2d 473 (Ky.1999)). <em>Compare Milburn v. Commonwealth, </em>788 S.W.2d 253, 257 (Ky.1989) (allowing narrative testimony from in court witnesses providing \u201csimultaneous commentary\u201d of crime scene video), with <em>Fields v. Commonwealth, </em>12 S.W.3d 275, 280 (Ky.2000) (finding error in pre-recorded narrative video when such narration contained inadmissible hearsay).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>The Court stated that \u201cthe fulcrum of the matter upon which this issue turns, is whether the witness has testified from personal knowledge and rational observation of events perceived and whether such information is helpful to the jury. In short, does the testimony comply with the rules of evidence?\u201d <em>Cuzick, </em>276 S.W.3d at 265. The Court held that \u201c[w]hile a witness may proffer narrative testimony within the permissible confines of the rules of evidence, we have held he may not \u201cinterpret\u201d audio or video evidence, as such testimony invades the province of the jury, whose job is to make determinations of fact based upon the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 265-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Applying this test to the facts, the Supreme Court of Kentucky upheld the admission of the officers\u2019s narration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atk\">Here, the videos in question depicted the substance of a high-speed police chase, as captured from the in-car cameras. It is completely reasonable to conclude that the officers\u2019 testimony was not only beneficial to the jury in discerning what was happening on the video, but was in all likelihood necessary. Moreover, and importantly, the officers\u2019 testimony did not interpret the video. While the testimony was narrative in the sense that it sequentially followed the chronology of the tape, all statements were responsive in nature and were in answer to the Commonwealth\u2019s questions. Narrative testimony is not necessarily interpretive testimony <em>per se. </em>Here, the testimony was explicative of the officers\u2019 perception of the events occurring on the video as they perceived them during the police chase and provided further elucidation of matters of police procedure, etc., which were not readily identifiable from the video standing on its own. Thus, having reviewed the record and determined that the testimony was proper lay opinion testimony which was beneficial to the jury, we find no palpable error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 266 (internal citations omitted); <em>see also State v. Buie, </em>194 N.C.App. 725, 671 S.E.2d 351, 356 (2009) (noting cases where the Court had upheld admission of opinion testimony-narrating events in a surveillance video \u201cwhen their interpretations were based in part on firsthand observations\u201d); <em>People v. Hardy, </em>115 A.D.3d 511, 981 N.Y.S.2d 722, 723 (2014) (\u201c[I]t was permissible for the witnesses to explain matters depicted on the videotapes that they had personally participated in or observed\u201d), <em>leave to appeal denied, </em>23 N.Y.3d 1037, 993 N.Y.S.2d 251, 17 N.E.3d 506 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">In sum, and to the extent preserved, Salley\u2019s testimony in this case was based on her personal knowledge from having witnessed appellant\u2019s actions, real time, as appellant moved through the women\u2019s department at Macy\u2019s. That testimony explained facts on the video, including appellant\u2019s selection of various items, the conference of appellant and the two juveniles in one fitting room stall, and then the exit from the store without paying, while one of appellant\u2019s companions carried a \u201cfull\u201d Downtown Locker Room bag. To the extent that Salley offered opinions about these events, including that the bag looked larger after emerging from the crowded fitting room stall than when the appellant entered, we conclude that the testimony was rationally based on Salley\u2019s perceptions and were helpful for the jury to understand facts at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HOWARD COUNTY AFFIRMED.
