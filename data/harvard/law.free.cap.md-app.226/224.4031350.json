MOYLAN, JR., J.</author>\n<p id=\"AlM\">(Retired, Specially Assigned).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The subject is <em>res judicata. </em>The aberrational nuance is that we are dealing with two adjudications by an administrative agency. The appellant, Jonathan Smalls, received on April 19, 2007, a family child care certificate of registration (\u201cCertificate\u201d) from the Office of Child Care (\u201cOCC\u201d) of the Maryland State Department of Education (\u201cDepartment\u201d). The Department, that initially issued but then twice revoked that certificate, is the appellee. Before even getting to <em>res judicata, </em>the inevitable first question has to be, \u201cWhat is \u2018a family child care certificate of registration?\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The Significance of Registration</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">The case is controlled by Maryland Code, Family Law Article, Subtitle 5, \u201cChild Care, Foster Care.\u201d Section 5-501(e) defines a \u201cFamily child care home\u201d as \u201ca residence in which family child care is provided for up to 8 children.\u201d Subsection (c) defines a \u201cchild care provider\u201d as an \u201cadult who has primary responsibility for the operation of a family child care home[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">Section 5-552(a) goes on to provide that \u201ca family child care home ... may not operate unless it is registered.\u201d Section 5-505(a) further provides that \u201ca person shall be licensed by the Administration as a child care home before the person may exercise care, custody, or control of a minor child.\u201d Section 5-550.1 focuses specifically on the \u201cRegistration system.\u201d Subsection (b)(1), in pertinent part, sets out the \u201cpurpose\u201d of the registration requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-10\">\u201cb) <em>Purpose </em>\u2014 The purpose of registration of family care homes ... is to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-11\">(1) protect the health, safety, and welfare of children while they are in family child care[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Subsection (c) confirms the legislatively declared linkage between proper registration and the health and safety of the children:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-4\"><em>\u201cLegislative intent. </em>\u2014 The <em>system of registration is intended to promote </em>a high degree of flexibility in the regulation of family child care homes and large family child care homes <em>while assuring the health and safety of children who are cared for in family child care homes.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Section 5-515 deals with the suspension or revocation of a certificate of registration earlier granted. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">\u201cSubject to the hearing provisions of \u00a7 5-516 of this subtitle, <em>if a licensee violates any provision of this subtitle or of a rule or regulation adopted under this subtitle, the Administration may:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-8\">(1) suspend the license for a period not exceeding 1 year; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-9\">(2) <em>revoke the license.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">The reference to \u201ca rule or regulation adopted under this subtitle\u201d is a reference to COMAR regulations. It is COMAR 13A.15.13.07 that deals with the revocation of a certificate of registration. That section lists 14 separate regulations of which a certificate holder could be in violation. The first two are here pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-12\">\u201cA. <em>The office may revoke a certificate of registration if the:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-13\">(1) <em>Provider </em>or home <em>is in violation of one or more of the regulations under this subtitle </em>and the health, safety, or welfare of a child in the home is threatened;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-14\">(2) <em>Provider </em>misrepresented or <em>offered false information on the application or on any form or report required by the officelT</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-15\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-16\">A Preliminary Glimpse at the Issue Before Us</p>\n<p id=\"b250-17\">On February 4, 2010, the OCC notified the appellant that it intended to revoke his family day care certificate of regis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>tration. He appealed the revocation to the Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d). Following a full hearing, an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) upheld the revocation. The appellant sought further review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. In a Written Opinion and Order filed on January 24, 2011, Judge Sylvester Cox reversed the finding of the ALJ and reinstated the appellant\u2019s certificate of registration. The Department did not appeal that decision of the circuit court. That decision represented a final judgment on the merits. It was also the predicate for all that followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">On August 22, 2013, the OCC initiated a second attempt to revoke the appellant\u2019s certificate of registration. The appellant again appealed to the OAH. Following another full hearing on March 18, 2014, an ALJ rendered a decision on April 16, 2014 upholding the revocation of the appellant\u2019s certificate of registration. The appellant again appealed to the circuit court. On December 8, 2014, Judge Kendra Y. Ausby affirmed the decision of the ALJ. On this appeal, the appellant contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">1. <em>\u201cThe ALJ erred by denying appellant\u2019s motion for summary decision </em>when appellant was entitled to judgment, as a matter of law, <em>under the doctrines of </em>collateral estoppel and/or <em>res judicata </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">2. \u201cThe ALJ\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence and is erroneous as a matter of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Res Judicata</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\"><em>Res judicata </em>is a common law defense. Maryland\u2019s recognition of the defense, by express name, goes at least as far back as 1885 with <em>State v. Brown, </em>64 Md. 199, 1 A. 54 (1885). The Court of Appeals there quoted with approval from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Beloit v. Morgan, </em>74 U.S. 619, 19 L.Ed. 205, 7 Wall. 619, 622 (1868), which, in turn, had quoted with approval from the English decision of <em>Henderson v. Henderson, </em>3 Hare 100, 67 ER 313 (1843). In <em>State v. Brown, </em>64 Md. at 203, 1 A. 54 the Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>\u201cAccording to well-settled principles, <em>our decision in the first case finally determined, </em>as between the parties to the suit, <em>all matters then adjudicated. </em>As between these parties, <em>no matter then decided can ever again become the subject of controversy.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">(Emphasis supplied). See also <em>Archer v. State, </em>74 Md. 410, 22 A. 737 (1891).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Section 1 of the <em>Restatement of Judgments </em>(1942) described the aim or purpose of <em>res judicata:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">\u201cWhere a reasonable opportunity has been afforded to the parties to litigate a claim before a court which has jurisdiction over the parties and the cause of action, and the court has finally decided the controversy, <em>the interests of the State and of the parties require that the validity of the claim and any issue actually litigated in the action shall not be litigated again by them.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Professor Kenneth Culp Davis in his monumental <em>Administrative Law and Government </em>(1960), Ch. 18 \u201cRes Judicata,\u201d p. 343, emphasized society\u2019s interest in repose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-9\">\u201cThe main idea is that a party should have his \u2018day in court\u2019 \u2014 his chance to win his case \u2014 and that once the tribunal has made a final decision and the time for rehearing or appeal or further appeal has expired, the result of the case becomes binding and cannot be reopened; the decision becomes res judicata. <em>The reason for the doctrine of res judicata is that we don\u2019t want the court to have to consider the same claim over and over, and we don\u2019t want the defendant to have to defend over and over. </em>At some point in the presentation and determination of controversies, we want repose. <em>The objective of the doctrine of res judicata is repose.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">Administrative Decisions and Res Judicata</p>\n<p id=\"b252-12\">Both of the two sequential efforts by the OCC to revoke the appellant\u2019s certificate of registration led to respective hearings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>before the Office of Administrative Hearings, an administrative agency engaged in a quasi-judicial function. In this case, to be sure, both decisions by ALJ\u2019s were ultimately appealed to the Circuit Court and were ruled upon at that level. Lest there should be any doubt, however, as to whether the principles of <em>res judicata </em>apply with full vigor to decisions that were initially the quasi-judicial decisions of administrative agencies, a brief look at the undisputed case law may be appropriate. Although earlier Maryland decisions had, to be sure, strongly suggested that <em>res judicata </em>did not apply to decisions, even quasi-judicial decisions, of administrative agencies, the thorough-going analysis by the Court of Appeals in <em>Woodlaum Area Citizens Assn. v. Board of County Commissioners for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>241 Md. 187, 194-96, 216 A.2d 149 (1966), worked a dramatic correction of course and brought Maryland into line with the more enlightened and majority view through the nation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">In <em>Neifert v. Department of Environment, </em>395 Md. 486, 507, 910 A.2d 1100 (2006), the Court of Appeals well articulated the current law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\">\u201cAn administrative agency\u2019s decision is given preclusive effect based on three factors: (1) <em>whether the agency was acting in a quasi-judicial capacity, </em>(2) whether the issue presented to the circuit court was actually litigated before the agency, and (3) whether resolution of the issue was necessary to the agency\u2019s decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">(Emphasis supplied).

Shiflett, </em>325 Md. 684, 703-708, 602 A.2d 1191 (1992); <em>Sugarloaf Citizens Ass\u2019n v. Northeast Maryland Waste Disposal Authority, </em>323 Md. 641, 658 n. 13, 594 A.2d 1115 (1991); <em>Murray International Freight Corp. v. Graham, </em>315 Md. 543, 547-49, 555 A.2d 502 (1989); <em>White v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>282 Md. 641, 658, 387 A.2d 260 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>In <em>Seminary Galleria, LLC v. Dulaney Valley Improvement Ass\u2019n, </em>192 Md.App. 719, 735, 995 A.2d 1068 (2010), this Court, quoting <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments </em>(1982), \u00a7 83(1), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-4\"><em>\u201c[A] valid and final adjudicative determination </em>by an administrative tribunal <em>has the same effects </em>under the rules of res judicata, subject to the same exceptions and qualifications, <em>as a judgment of a court.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Claim Preclusion, Not Issue Preclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">As a cautionary guidepost along the way, we note that there is a pervasive tendency for advocates litigating a <em>res judicata </em>question reflexively to throw in collateral estoppel almost as a doctrinal bonus, and for other advocates, raising a collateral estoppel issue, to exhibit the same conditioned reflex with respect to <em>res judicata. </em>The two are not, it should be carefully noted, Tweedledum and Tweedledee. <em>Murray International Freight Corp. v. Graham, </em>315 Md. 543, 546-52, 555 A.2d 502 (1989). Unlike Castor and Pollux or Damon and Pythias, <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel may be separated. Indeed, they are far less confusing when they are kept carefully apart.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Just to clear away any possible clutter, therefore, let us point out that we are dealing on this appeal with <em>res judicata </em>and not with collateral estoppel. We are not here concerned with any factual decision on the ultimate merits so as to trigger issue preclusion under principles of collateral estoppel. <em>Janes v. State, </em>350 Md. 284, 295-307, 711 A.2d 1319 (1998). Our concern is only with claim preclusion, which does not depend on any factual decision on the merits and is as concerned with what might have been litigated as surely as it is with what actually was litigated. <em>MPC, Inc. v. Kenny, </em>279 Md. 29, 32-35, 367 A.2d 486 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\"><em>Res judicata, </em>moreover, is direct and not collateral. See <em>Klein v. Whitehead, </em>40 Md.App. 1, 13, 389 A.2d 374 (1978) <em>(\u201cRes judicata </em>is a direct estoppel, and collateral estoppel is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>what its name says it is.\u201d). In <em>John Crane, Inc. v. Puller, </em>169 Md.App. 1, 27, 899 A.2d 879 (2006), this Court starkly distinguished the respective concerns of the two doctrines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-4\">\u201c[T]he core concern of <em>res judicata </em>law is with the legal consequences of a final judgment in terms of <em>precluding the</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-5\"><em>subsequent relitigation of the same </em>case----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">\u201cBy contrast, the concern of collateral estoppel law is with <em>the preclusion of duplicative fact-finding.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">In <em>Burkett v. State, </em>98 Md.App. 459, 464, 633 A.2d 902 (1993), this Court stressed the essential difference between these two very different preclusive defenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-9\">\u201cCollateral estoppel is concerned with <em>the factual implications of an earlier litigation of a different case, </em>whereas <em>res judicata </em>is concerned with <em>the legal consequences of a judgment entered earlier in the same </em>case.... <em>Res judica-ta, </em>by contrast, is concerned with <em>the legal consequences of a judgment regardless of whether the judgment was based on the ultimate factual merits or on the basis of a legal ruling having nothing to do with the ultimate factual merits.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">At a very high (almost ethereal) level of abstraction, there is a rough similarity between the two preclusive defenses. Indeed, they each preclude something. Each defense effectively asserts, \u201cHaving done something once, you are precluded from doing it a second time!\u201d The two doctrines, however, then diverge sharply in identifying what that \u201csomething\u201d is that was done the first time around and also in defining what \u201chaving done\u201d something actually consists of. The failure to deal carefully with these critical distinctions can result in an utter breakdown in communication, as it threatened to do in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">The Department, as an example of what we are warning against, spends three pages of its appellate brief ostensibly refuting the appellant\u2019s defense of <em>res judicata. </em>The language of that refutation and the legal criteria invoked, however, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>exclusively from the world of collateral estoppel, a subject which is not before us in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">The Department argues that \u201cthe <em>issues </em>in the 2013 proceeding were not identical to those in the 2010 proceeding.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). Of course, they were not and they do not have to be for purposes of <em>res judicata. </em>It further argues, \u201cRes judicata, also called issue preclusion, bars relitigation of an issue.\u201d <em>Res judicata, </em>of course, is not issue preclusion. It is claim preclusion and it is not concerned with factual issues as factual issues. The Department\u2019s brief goes on, \u201cIssue preclusion does not require that the cause of action be the same, but it applies only with respect to issues of fact actually determined in the earlier proceeding.\u201d On the other hand, <em>res judicata, </em>which is before us in this case, does most definitely require that the causes of action be the same. <em>Res judicata </em>is not in the least concerned, moreover, with whether \u201cissues of fact [were] actually determined in the earlier proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The Department concludes, \u201c[Appellant] argues that the issues in both proceedings are identical. They are not.\u201d The Department makes a strong case that its second revocation attempt was not precluded by collateral estoppel. The appellant, for his part, has been just as undisciplined in framing his contention. As to both, the battle over collateral estoppel has been a tempest in a teapot. Both parties have been fighting a phantom that has nothing to do with this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Through the Looking Glass</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Just as a dispositive difference between <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel is the distinction between a factual issue and a legal claim or cause of action, a potentially even more gaping difference may be in the subsequent dispositions of those respective predicates. In collateral estoppel law, the factual issue must actually be resolved on its merits by the factfinder before it acquires any preclusive effect. In <em>res judicata </em>law, by contrast, it is a legal decision rather than a factual determination that concerns us. Unlike a factual determination, the legal decision, to enjoy preclusive effect, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>need not actually be made. It is enough that it could have been made. Therein lies a world of difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">Grammatically speaking, the language we use in discussing and analyzing collateral estoppel law should be in the indicative mood. We are interested in what is. We are concerned with the here and now. In discussing and analyzing <em>res judicata, </em>by contrast, we are not so earthbound. We may, of course, employ the indicative mood and all that it portends, but we may also, alternatively, switch into the subjunctive mood. We may inquire about what legal decision was actually made, but we may also speculate about legal decisions that were never made, but might have been. We are invited to step through Alice\u2019s looking glass into an alternative reality. This is a world that collateral estoppel cannot imagine.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">As Judge Levine explained for the Court of Appeals in <em>MPC v. Kenny, </em>279 Md. at 33, 367 A.2d 486:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">\u201cIf ... the two causes of action are the same, and res judicata is therefore applicable, <em>the first judgment would bar appellants, </em>as urged by appellee, <em>from raising any matters which could have been decided in that case.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\"><em>Alvey v. Alvey, </em>225 Md. 386, 390, 171 A.2d 92 (1961), speaks of the duty to raise in the first cause of action all matters that could there have been raised.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-9\">\u201c \u2018It will not do to say that the facts relied upon in the second bill were not alleged in the first bill, and could not, therefore, have been proved in the first case, for the answer is, <em>it was the appellant\u2019s duty to have either alleged them in the first case, or to have shown in this case some good reason\u2019for failing to do so.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-10\">\u2018We conclude that all questions of fact arising in connection with the present transaction between the appellant and the appellees have been litigated and determined in the first suit, <em>not only as to the matters and claims which were </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number><em>presented, in that suit, but also as to all matters that could have been presented but were not.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">In <em>Powell v. Breslin, </em>430 Md. 52, 64, 59 A.3d 531 (2013), the Court of Appeals reaffirmed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">\u201cJudge Allison\u2019s grant of summary judgment in <em>Powell I </em>was a final judgment on the merits at the time <em>it was </em>entered and, therefore, <em>was conclusive as to the matters decided in that case, as well as to \u2018all matters which with propriety could have been litigated in the first suit.\u2019\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Amb\">(Footnote omitted; emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">This Court articulated the same principle in <em>Seminary Galleria, LLC v. Dulaney Valley, </em>192 Md.App. at 735, 995 A.2d 1068, quoting <em>Whittle v. Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>211 Md. 36, 49, 125 A.2d 41 (1956):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">\u201c \u2018If the second suit is between the same parties and is upon the same cause of action, <em>a judgment in the earlier case on the merits is an absolute bar, not only as to all matters which were litigated in the earlier case, but as to all matters which could have been litigated.\u2019 \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">(Emphasis supplied). See also <em>Richman v. FWB Bank, </em>122 Md.App. 110, 152, 712 A.2d 41 (1998). <em>Res judicata </em>is concerned not only with what was, but with what could have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">Identifying a Claim or Cause of Action</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">As we prepare to focus in more tightly on whether the Department\u2019s first revocation attempt of 2010 precluded, as <em>res judicata, </em>its subsequent revocation attempt of 2013, two of <em>res judicata\u2019s </em>three elements pose no problem. In both of the legal proceedings under examination, the parties were the same \u2014 the appellant and the Department. In the first proceeding, moreover, there was a final judgment. When the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on January 24, 2011, reversed the decision of the administrative law judge and ruled that the evidence presented by the Department was not legally sufficient to justify its revocation of the appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>certification, the revocation action was dismissed. That was a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">What remains to be analyzed is whether the claim or cause of action that was brought by the Department in 2013 was the \u201csame\u201d as the claim or cause of action that had earlier been brought by the Department in 2010. Identifying a claim and then properly labeling it, neither too narrowly nor too broadly, is an exercise in conceptualization. It is hard to describe this process in laymen\u2019s terms, but if we can do so, it should be a major step in truly understanding the process. In attempting to organize an assortment of issues, large and small, into a logical outline, we must identify which issues are deserving of Capital Letters in the outline and then determine which broader issues are actually worthy of Roman Numerals. A tricky question may be whether a particular Capital Letter is simply a subdivision under a Roman Numeral or is an integral part of the Roman Numeral itself. That is a question, moreover, that is not always free of ambiguity. In sorting litigable issues into categories and in designating the categories, there inevitably is involved a certain degree of arbitrariness.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Maryland\u2019s first serious effort to articulate a workable test for determining whether two causes of action were the same for <em>res judicata </em>purposes was <em>MPC, Inc. v. Kenny, </em>279 Md. 29, 367 A.2d 486 (1977). Judge Levine\u2019s opinion, 279 Md. at 33, 367 A.2d 486, described the \u201csame evidence\u201d test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">\u201cCourts elsewhere have applied a variety of tests in determining whether two causes of action are the same for purposes of invoking res judicata. <em>The measure which seems to find favor with most courts, and one which we have applied, is whether the same evidentiary facts would sustain both </em>actions....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">\u201cAnalysis of the issues framed by these two cases in light of <em>the \u2018same </em>evidence\u2019 test demonstrates that a different cause of action is presented here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">(Emphasis supplied). Significantly, that opinion noted that \u201c[c]ourts elsewhere have applied a variety of tests\u201d in resolving this question of sameness.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>The seminal Maryland examination of what is the \u201csame claim\u201d for the purpose of <em>res judicata </em>was that made 10 years later by Judge Rodowsky in <em>Kent County Board of Education v. Bilbrough, </em>309 Md. 487, 525 A.2d 232 (1987). At the very outset, the <em>leitmotif </em>was sounded: \u201cThe question presented turns on the application to the facts of this case of the elusive concept, \u2018claim,\u2019 as used in the law of claim preclusion.\u201d 309 Md. at 489, 525 A.2d 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">In the <em>Bilbrough </em>case, this Court had relied on <em>MFC v. Kenny </em>and the \u201csame evidence\u201d test in holding that a plaintiffs second suit against the defendants was not barred by <em>res judicata. </em>The Court of Appeals did not reverse that holding <em>per se, </em>but it opined that undue reliance on the \u201csame evidence\u201d test might \u201cimproperly narrow the scope of a \u2018claim\u2019 in the preclusion context\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\"><em>\u201cAlthough we agree with the result reached </em>by the Court of Special Appeals, <em>we are concerned that sole reliance on the same evidence or required evidence analysis </em>to determine if the same claim is involved in two actions <em>may improperly narrow the scope of a \u2018claim\u2019 in the preclusion context.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">309 Md. at 494, 525 A.2d 232. (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">In then making a case for a broader scope to be afforded the term \u201cclaim,\u201d the opinion, 309 Md. at 494-96, 525 A.2d 232, explored the \u201cconsiderable evolution\u201d that claim preclusion had undergone in the course of the Nineteenth and early Twentieth Centuries, relying heavily on <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments, </em>\u00a7 24, comment a, at 197. The earlier rigidity had been caused in large measure by the law\u2019s equating of the terms \u201cclaim\u201d and \u201ccause of action,\u201d on the one hand, with the legendary rigidities once inherent in the forms of action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Judge Rodowsky, 309 Md. at 495, 525 A.2d 232, explained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Maryland had moved away from that earlier dependence on the forms of the action.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-4\"><em>\u201cThe Maryland law of claim preclusion has moved far enough from the influence of the common law forms of action </em>that it seems to be settled here that a mere change in the legal theory, applied to the same set of facts previously litigated, will not in and of itself avoid claim preclusion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The more flexible approach recommended by the American Law Institute in its <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments </em>is to equate the term \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201ccause of action\u201d for <em>res judicata </em>purposes with the notion of a \u201ctransaction.\u201d Determining what is and what is not a \u201ctransaction\u201d defies the application of any strict definition and requires a flexible or \u201cpragmatic\u201d approach. Section 24(2) of the <em>Restatement </em>emphasizes this essential flexibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\"><em>\u201cWhat factual grouping constitutes a \u2018transaction\u2019, and what groupings constitute a \u2018series,\u2019 are to be determined pragmatically, </em>giving weight to such considerations as <em>whether the facts are related in time, space, origin, or motivation, whether they form a convenient trial unit, </em>and <em>whether their treatment as a unit conforms to the parties\u2019 expectations </em>or business understanding or usage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">309 Md. at 498, 525 A.2d 232. (Emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">In approving this flexible or \u201ctransactional\u201d approach to identifying a claim or cause of action, the Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>made it clear that the transactional test \u201cdefies any attempt of abstract definitions which could be applied to all cases.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-4\"><em>\u201cWe therefore generally approve of the approach </em>to resolving the question of identity of claims <em>found in \u00a7 24 of the Restatement. </em>We also agree with the observation by Schopflocher, <em>supra, </em>21 Or. L.Rev. at 324 that <em>the \u2018pragmatic\u2019 test \u2018defies any attempt of abstract definition which could be applied to all cases. \u2019 </em>And Moore\u2019s <em>Federal Practice </em>at 361 doubts that the Restatement\u2019s substituting \u2018transaction\u2019 for \u2018claim\u2019 or \u2018cause of action\u2019 to describe the unit of litigation to which preclusive effect is given, \u2018[b]eyond thus fortifying the already developed principle that a plaintiff may not relitigate a claim for relief by switching legal theories ... would make any very material change in the practice in the federal courts.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">309 Md. at 499-500, 525 A.2d 232.

Bilbrough </em>and its use of the \u201ctransaction\u201d test to identify the critical claims or causes of action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">\u201cIn determining whether claims are the same for purposes of res judicata, <em>we have in the past sometimes utilized a \u2018same evidence\u2019 test. See MPC, Inc. v. Kenny, supra, </em>279 Md. at 33, 367 A.2d at 489. We have indicated, however, that the concept of a \u2018claim\u2019 is broad. <em>See, e.g., Edmonds [Edmunds] v. Lupton, </em>253 Md. 93, 252 A.2d 71 (1969) (defining a \u2018claim\u2019 as \u2018a group or aggregate of operative facts giving ground or occasion for judicial action, as distinguished from the narrow concept of a \u2018cause of action\u2019.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\"><em>\u201cRecently, </em>in <em>Kent County Bd. of Educ. v. Bilbrough, </em>309 Md. 487, 525 A.2d 232 (1987), <em>we adopted the \u2018transaction\u2019 test, as set forth in \u00a7 24 of the Restatement (Second) of Judgments, as the basic test for determining when two claims or causes of action are the same for purposes of res judicata.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">(Emphasis supplied).

It is clear that the identification of the claim or cause of action will no longer be made in terms reminiscent of assumpsit or replevin or trover.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">The Second Revocation</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">It was on August 22, 2013 that the OCC initiated its second attempt to revoke the appellant\u2019s certificate of registration. The ALJ\u2019s decision upheld the revocation. On appeal to the circuit court, the appellant interposed the defense of <em>res judicata, </em>claiming that the second cause of action was the same as that which had been tried and failed in 2010-11. In its letter of August 22, 2013, the OCC informed the appellant that it intended to revoke his current family child care certificate of registration. Under the heading: \u201cThis revocation action is based on the following,\u201d the OCC articulated two bases for its action. The first was two-pronged in that it referred to documents submitted by the appellant with respect to 1) his own training and also with respect to 2) the training of Conswello Randall, his sister who was the \u201cadditional adult\u201d assisting him in the home care operation. The charges were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">\u201cA review of the record revealed that you previously submitted Certificates of Completion reflecting that you and Ms. Randall completed ninety (90) classroom hours of Growth and Development, Curriculum and Classroom Management training on December 19, 2008 at First Connections, Inc. You also submitted Certificates of Completion reflecting that you and Ms. Randall completed forty-five (45) classroom hours of Infant and Toddler training on November 7, 2008 at First Connection, Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>\u201cOn June 25, 2013 and on July 25, 2013, the OCC received information from First Connection, Inc. reflecting that they conducted a review of their records and have determined that neither you nor Ms. Randall completed the ninety (90) hour Growth and Development nor the forty-five (45) [hour] Infant and Toddler training at First Connection, Inc. and that First Connection, Inc. did not issue Certificates of Completion to you or Ms. Randall. This places you in violation of COMAR 13A.15.06.02, Training Requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-4\">\u201cYou also submitted Certificates of Completion reflecting that you and Ms. Randall completed twenty (20) hours of Child Development and Guidance training through Care Courses on March 7, 2008.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">\u201cOn June 25, 2013 and on August 5, 2013, the OCC received information from The Care Courses School, Inc. According to the information received a staff member of The Care Courses School, Inc. reviewed their files and determined that the certificates of completion submitted by you and Ms. Randall were tampered with and are not valid. This places you in violation of COMAR 13A.15.06.02, Training Requirements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The second basis that the OCC gave for its intention to revoke the appellant\u2019s certificate of registration was an apparent conviction of the appellant for a larceny in New Orleans and his failure to notify the OCC thereof. The charge was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">\u201cThe OCC is aware of a felony conviction you sustained on April 25, 2013 in New Orleans for the thefl/stealing of Super Bowl tickets which led to a violation of probation hearing in Howard County, Maryland. That violation of Probation Hearing is currently scheduled for October 3, 2013. <em>You failed to notify the OCC about your arrest in New Orleans. This places you in violation of COMAR 13A.15.03.05, Notifications.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">Those charges were fully litigated at the March 18, 2014 hearing before ALJ Jennifer M. Carter Jones. The ALJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>found that the evidence did hot support the charge that the appellant had failed to notify the OCC that he had been convicted of larceny in New Orleans. The evidence also failed to support any violation of pertinent regulations on the part of Ms. Randall on the ground that she was not bound by the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">What was proved with respect to the appellant, however, was sufficient to establish that he lacked the required training to qualify for child care certification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">\u201cI find that <em>the Appellant\u2019s submission of fraudulent forty-five and ninety-hour training certificates merits the conclusion that the Appellant failed to complete the required training. </em>Certainly, <em>the appellant has submitted nothing indicating that he has done so. </em>In light of the essential nature of the Appellant\u2019s training requirements, <em>his failure to complete the required training </em>left him without important information, mandated by the OCC, about child care, and <em>threatened the health, safety, or welfare of children in the care of his family child care facility.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Because the appellant had failed to demonstrate the necessary qualifications as a trained and competent child care provider, the ALJ affirmed the decision of the OCC to revoke his certificate of registration. On appeal to the circuit court, Judge Ausby in turn affirmed that decision of the ALJ. The appellant now argues that this revocation should have been barred by <em>res judicata. </em>Whether that is true, of course, will depend upon whether that claim or cause of action that was litigated in the second revocation of 2013-14 was, using the transaction test, the same as that earlier litigated in the first revocation attempt of 2010-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">The First Revocation</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">We will now look back to the first claim. The appellant first received his certificate of registration on April 19, 2007. It was three years later that the first effort to revoke that registration was made with a letter to the appellant on Febru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>ary 3, 2010, announcing the OCC\u2019s intent to revoke. In giving its basis for the intended revocation, the OCC first laid out the general allegation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-4\"><em>\u201cThe OCC has also been notified that there has been an on-going investigation of your facility by the Department of Human Resources, Office of the Inspector General (OIG). </em>This investigation was prompted by allegations that you were providing fraudulent employment verifications for several individuals who expressed interest in having you provide child care services for them. These fraudulent employment forms were subsequently being submitted to DHR by you or by these individuals as alleged proof of employment for these parents applying for Purchase of Care (POC).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgF\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">In four subsequent paragraphs, the letter spelled out in much greater detail the circumstances of the ongoing fraudulent practice. A sixth paragraph then announced that it was on the basis of that fraudulent and criminal behavior that the OCC had decided to revoke the appellant\u2019s certificate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\"><em>\u201cBased on the findings of the OIG\u2019s investigation, the OCC has concerns about your care of day care children. </em>Your participation in preparing fraudulent documents to be used for the purpose of enabling these parents to be eligible to receive POC payments and your subsequent receipt of POC payments in many of these cases undermines the OCC\u2019s confidence in your ability to provide a safe environment for children. <em>Your participation in these fraudulent schemes was not only serious but intentional. </em>It raises reasonable doubt that you can provide for the welfare of children in your care.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">The appellant appealed that revocation decision and received a full two-day hearing before ALJ Brian Zlotnick on April 20 and May 5, 2010. The ALJ received in evidence 39 exhibits involving eight separate participants in the series of the fraudulent activities. Four witnesses testified for the OCC. The ALJ found that the appellant willfully and knowing<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>ly participated in a series of frauds. On that basis, the ALJ affirmed the decision of the OCC to revoke the appellant\u2019s certification. The entire hearing, from start to finish, focused on the evidence of fraud and on nothing else.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">On the appellant\u2019s appeal of the ALJ\u2019s decision to the circuit court, Judge Cox reversed the decision of the ALJ on the ground that the fraud <em>per se </em>did not prove that the appellant was a threat to the health, safety and welfare of the children in his charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">\u201cWe disagree with the ALJ\u2019s findings on this point and find that <em>evidence of fraud alone, </em>without threatening the health, safety and welfare of the children <em>is [in]sufficient to find that Petitioner is unable to safely operate a daycare facility </em>under COMAR 13A.15.18.07A(1) and (12). In light of the plain language of the regulation, which the Petitioner is alleged to have violated, <em>the evidence presented by the OCC was insufficient to sustain the revocation of Petitioner\u2019s license.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The Two Claims Were Not The Same</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">To determine whether two claims were the same, it is necessary to delineate what is the scope or extent or dimension of the claim that was the subject of the first litigation. As a guide, we are now using the notion of a transaction. Although the reference to a \u201ctransaction\u201d is helpful in giving modern meaning to the older terms of art \u201cclaim\u201d and \u201ccause of action,\u201d \u201ctransaction\u201d itself is a term of art. Its full legal significance to the law of <em>res judicata </em>does not, as a self-evident phenomenon, leap off the page into the untutored eye. To give meaning to that term of art, <em>Kent County v. Bilbrough, </em>309 Md. at 498, 525 A.2d 232 and 28 years of Maryland caselaw following <em>Bilbrough </em>have made it emphatically clear that we look to \u00a7 24(2) of the <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments, </em>at 196:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-9\">\u201c(2) <em>What </em>factual grouping <em>constitutes a \u2018transaction\u2019 </em>and what groupings constitute a \u2018series\u2019, are <em>to be determined </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number><em>pragmatically, </em>giving weight to such considerations as whether the facts are related in <em>time, space, origin, or motivation, whether they form a convenient trial unit, </em>or whether their treatment as a unit conforms to the parties\u2019 expectations or business understanding or usage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The Comment to \u00a7 24, <em>id., </em>goes on to articulate the rationale for turning to the transactional analogue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">\u201ca. <em>Rationale of a transactional view of claim. </em>In defining claim to embrace all the remedial rights of a plaintiff against the defendant <em>growing out of the relevant transaction (or series of connected transactions), this Section responds to modem procedural ideas </em>which have found expression in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and other procedural systems.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">The Comment, at 198-199, makes it clear that the identification of the pertinent transaction may defy a precise definition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANS\">\u201cb. <em>Transaction: application of a pragmatic standard. The expression \u2018transaction, </em>or series of connected transactions,\u2019 <em>is not capable of a mathematically precise definition; </em>it invokes a pragmatic standard to be applied with attention to the facts of the cases.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">(Emphasis supplied). As guidance in the identification of claims, <em>Kent County v. Bilbrough </em>has truly been a game changer.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">Based on this standard, we hold that the second revocation was not based on the same cause of action that was litigated in the first revocation. The second claim, therefore, was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>precluded on <em>res judicata. </em>Looking first at whether \u201cthe facts are related in time and space,\u201d the first revocation related to a series of deals or arrangements that the appellant entered into in the years 2008 and 2009 with a number of his child-care clients. The second revocation, by contrast, concerned the production of false documents by the appellant himself relating to his job training. The time period in question would have been largely prior to his initial certification on April 19, 2007. None of the evidentiary exhibits submitted or the witnesses called at the first revocation hearing would have had any relevance at the second revocation hearing. None of the evidentiary exhibits submitted or the witnesses called at the second revocation hearing would have had any relevance at the first revocation hearing. In terms of factual evidence, these two hearings were mutually exclusive and watertight. They dealt with totally different events (or transactions). With respect to this criterion, the Comment to \u00a7 24 of the Restatement, at p. 199, is particularly pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-4\">\u201cIn general, the expression [transaction] connotes a natural grouping or common nucleus of operative facts. Among the factors relevant to a determination whether the facts are so woven together as to constitute a single claim are their relatedness in time, space, origin or motivation, and whether, taken together, they form a convenient trial unit for trial purposes. <em>Though no single factor is determinative, the relevance of trial convenience makes it appropriate to ask how far the witnesses or proofs in the second action would tend to overlap the witnesses or proofs relevant to the first. If there is a substantial overlap, the second action should ordinarily be held precluded.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">(Emphasis supplied). In this case, there was absolutely no overlap.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">In terms of \u201corigin,\u201d the case against the appellant that led to the first revocation hearing originated externally. The OCC was notified that there was an investigation by the Department of Human Resources of the Inspector General. The case against the appellant that was presented at the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>revocation hearing was based on the investigation that had been conducted by the Department of Human Resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">By contrast, the origin of the case against the appellant that led to the second revocation hearing was exclusively internal. In April of 2013, two years after the first revocation matter was a <em>fait accompli, </em>the appellant submitted an application on behalf of a corporation owned by him, Developing Youth, for a child care center license. During the OCC\u2019s review of the application, it discovered that the appellant had submitted fraudulent documents in support of the application. The OCC denied the application. The appellant appealed that denial, but a hearing by the Office of Administrative Hearings affirmed the denial. The appellant did not appeal the ALJ\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">It was this April 2013 encounter with the appellant, occurring entirely after the first revocation hearing had become a memory, that alerted the OCC, particularly when considering it in light of the earlier proven cases of fraud, to the appellant\u2019s predilection for fraudulent practices. It was this alert, of internal origin, that triggered the OCC\u2019s investigation into the authenticity of the documents the appellant had earlier submitted to demonstrate his qualification for registration. What turned out to be the factual basis for the second revocation thus sprang from an internal origin, whereas the first revocation hearing, prompted by the Department of Human Resources, had an external origin. See <em>Patel v. HealthPlus Inc., </em>112 Md.App. 251, 274-75, 684 A.2d 904 (1996); <em>Gertz v. Anne Arundel County, </em>339 Md. 261, 270, 661 A.2d 1157 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\u201cOrigin,\u201d of course, as a concept not yet explored by the caselaw, might have a very different meaning. To the moralist, the origin of the appellant\u2019s bad behavior that lead to the first revocation hearing might be characterized as the deadly sin of avarice, a desire for money he had not legitimately earned. The behavior that was under scrutiny at the second revocation hearing, by contrast, might have originated in his desire to obtain an occupational position and its rewards for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>which he had not qualified. While the umbrella term of \u201csin\u201d could be a convenient common denominator for both, the primrose paths that the appellant\u2019s sin subsequently took toward the respective revocation hearings were diverse. So. A common origin or diverse origins? In the present Zeitgeist, now dominated by the transactional test, the diverse version would seem to be favored. This, on the other hand, may not even be what \u201corigin\u201d refers to.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">To the extent to which the Restatement\u2019s suggested factor of \u201cmotivation\u201d has some meaning separate and apart from the factor of \u201corigin,\u201d the motivation for the respective revocation hearings can readily be seen as different. The motivation for the second revocation hearing and the motivation for the antecedent examination of the authenticity of the appellant\u2019s documents offered in support of his initial application for certification was clearly the OCC\u2019s spontaneous desire to clear from its books a registrant who had consistently proved to be dishonest and deceitful. The motivation for the OCC to have initiated the first revocation hearing, on the other hand, may well have been what the OCC deemed to be its proper response to a complaint communicated to it by a sister agency. If \u201cmotivation\u201d refers to the appellant\u2019s motivation, or motivations, rather than that of the OCC, those motivations have already been discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Another factor suggested by \u00a7 24 of the <em>Restatement </em>is that of whether the facts \u201cform a convenient trial unit.\u201d The facts that were the basis for the first revocation \u2014 all of the evidence, all of the exhibits, and all of the testimony \u2014 were in and of themselves a \u201cconvenient trial unit\u201d for that revocation hearing. None of those facts, however, would have had any relevance at the second revocation hearing. Conversely, all of the facts introduced at the second revocation hearing constituted \u201ca convenient trial unit\u201d for that hearing. None of them, however, would have had any relevance at the first revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Had the two sets of facts been offered, however, at a single hearing, they would not have formed \u201ca convenient trial unit.\u201d There would simply have been two trials of two separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>issues playing under the same tent in an administrative double header. Instead of harmony, there would have been cacophony.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">The only common denominator between the first revocation and the second revocation was the relationship between the appellant and the OCC, to wit, the relationship between the registering agency and the registrant. <em>Kent County v. Bilb-rough, </em>309 Md. at 502, 525 A.2d 232, spoke directly to the inadequacy of such an ongoing relationship standing alone to establish identity between the otherwise disparate claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOD\"><em>\u201cIn order to accept petitioners\u2019 argument </em>in support of the summary judgment, <em>we would have to classify the entire employer-employee relationship between Bilbrough and the Board as the litigation unit. Only in that way would every allegation of a wrong occurring during the relationship become one \u2018claim.\u2019 </em>So expansive a rule of claim preclusion would have the effect of a compulsory joinder of claims in a plaintiff\u2019s complaint, a requirement which the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Maryland Rules have rejected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">When \u00a7 24 goes on to refer to the factor of the treatment of facts \u201cas a unit conforming] to the parties\u2019 expectations or business understanding or usage,\u201d it is referring to a factor that is simply inapplicable to the circumstances of this case. Much of <em>res judicata </em>law and much of the language in the caselaw dealing with claims and causes of action and transactions comes out of the context of commercial transactions and business dealings. An administrative appeal, such as the one before us in this case, is on the far periphery of that commercial world and the everyday language of that world does not always translate easily into the distant hinterland. The very word \u201ctransaction\u201d itself has a resounding commercial ring to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">In distinguishing between analysis at the <em>res judicata </em>core and analysis in the outer zones of the <em>res judicata </em>ionosphere, we are reassured to find ourselves in company with Kenneth Culp Davis, <em>Administrative Law and Government, </em>Ch. 18, \u201cRes Judicata,\u201d pp. <em>344-45:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number><em>\u201cAdministrative law must grapple not only with the problems of res judicata familiar to the judicial </em>system\u2014 identity of claims and issues, identity of parties, final decisions on the merits, <em>jurisdiction </em>\u2014 but <em>also with special problems growing out of the differences between the judicial process and the administrative process. </em>The principle of res judicata is designed for adjudication, typified by a court proceeding, and many perplexities of res judicata in administrative law concern nonjudicial or unclassifiable functions. Courts normally apply law to past facts which remain static \u2014 where res judicata operates at its best \u2014 but agencies often work with fluid facts and shifting policies. <em>The regularized procedure of courts conduces to application of the doctrine of res judicata; </em>administrative procedures are often summary, parties are sometimes unrepresented by counsel, and permitting a second consideration of the same question may frequently be supported by other similar reasons which are inapplicable to judicial proceedings. <em>The finality of unappealed judgements of courts is ordinarily well understood in advance, </em>whereas statutory pro-visions often implicitly deny finality or fail to make clear whether or when administrative action should be considered binding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-4\">\u201cAs a matter of principle, <em>it is completely clear that the reasons behind the doctrine of res judicata as developed in the court system are fully applicable to some administrative proceedings. The reasons against a second litigation between the same parties of the same claims or issues are precisely the same for some administrative determinations as they are for most judicial determinations. </em>The sound view is therefore to use the doctrine of res judicata when the reasons for it are present in full force, to modify it when modification is needed, and to reject it when the reasons against it outweigh those in its favor, and the courts generally follow this sound view.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Accordingly, virtually every Maryland appellate opinion that has sanctioned the application of res <em>judicata </em>to the decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>of administrative agencies has been careful to add the limiting language \u201cwhen the agency is acting in a quasi-judicial capacity.\u201d That limitation, however, was fully satisfied in the case now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">In any event, we are persuaded that the two claims litigated at the two revocation hearings were not, by the transaction test, the same claim. The litigation of the first claim, therefore, did not estop the prosecution of the second. In implicitly or explicitly so ruling, neither the administrative law tribunal nor the circuit court on review abused its discretion. If, on the other hand, the issues come to us <em>de novo </em>as a matter of law, we do not hesitate to hold that the two claims were not the same and that <em>res judicata </em>did not bar the second revocation. Whatever the standard of review, the result is the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The appellant\u2019s second contention will not detain us long. Looking through the circuit court decision to the decision of the ALJ, we hold that there was substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the ALJ. In her Opinion and Order of December 8, 2014, Judge Ausby reached the same conclusion. We readily adopt her ruling as our own.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">\u201cAs previously stated in this Opinion, for <em>each of the factual issues presented, the ALJ recounted the testimony and evidence presented and made an independent assessment as to the veracity and weight of each piece of evidence. </em>Additionally, the record contained enough evidence for the ALJ to assess the credibility of each witness, including the Petitioner, despite his failure to attend the hearing. <em>The Decision was deliberate, well-reasoned, and supported by the record evidence; therefore, reasoning minds can reach the same conclusion as the ALJ based on the facts here.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"aqc-dedup-0\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-7\">. Reversing <em>Knox v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>180 Md. 88, 23 A.2d 15 (1941).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b260-8\">. As Frederick William Maitland reminded us in <em>The Forms of Action at Common Law </em>(1909): \"The forms of action we have buried, but they rule us from their graves.\u201d Although there had been antecedent rumblings, the effective burial of the forms of action was the Judicature Act of 1873.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b261-10\">. Quite aside from the law of <em>res judicata, </em>the broadening of the concept of \"claim\u201d had been underway at least as early as 1968. As the Court of Appeals pointed out in <em>Edmunds v. Lupton, </em>253 Md. 93, 252 A.2d 71 (1969):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-11\">\"As Judge Singley recently stated, for the Court, in <em>White v. Land Homes Corp., </em>251 Md. 603, 610-11, 248 A.2d 159, 163 (1968), in construing the word \u2018claim\u2019 as used in both Maryland Rule 315 and Federal Rule 14 dealing with third-party practice:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-12\">\"[T]he concept of a \u2018claim\u2019 ... has been defined as a 'group or aggregate of operative facts giving ground or occasion for judicial action\u2019 as distinguished from the narrow concept of a \u2018cause of action.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b268-11\">. This newly emerging character of a multi-factored and fact-specific transactional test for identifying a claim or cause of action augurs at some future time for a standard of judicial review for this particular aspect of <em>res judicata </em>law that may be based on the \"abuse of discretion\" rather than being a <em>de novo </em>determination of a purely legal question. There is an obvious range of differing conclusions that argues for some degree of subjectivity or arbitrariness. Mercifully, that issue is not now before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
