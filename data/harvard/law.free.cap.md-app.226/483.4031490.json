Shortly after the statute took effect, Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (\u201cBGE\u201d) sought approval of a plan to accelerate the replacement of outdated gas distribution infrastructure and to begin imposing a customer surcharge during the initial implementation of the plan. The Public Service Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>approved the plan, subject to the condition that BGE could not implement the surcharge until it submitted additional information about the individual infrastructure projects that were to be undertaken in 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">The Circuit Court for Baltimore City affirmed the Commission\u2019s order after the Office of People\u2019s Counsel (\u201cOPC\u201d) petitioned for judicial review. On appeal, OPC contends: (1) that the Commission erred by authorizing BGE to collect estimated project costs before the completion of each project; and (2) that the Commission acted unlawfully by conditionally approving the plan before the Commission had evaluated the individual projects. We conclude that OPC has shown no basis for reversing the Commission\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">\n<em>Legislative Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">A. <em>Parties to this Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">This appeal involves three entities established by or regulated under the Public Utilities Article of the Maryland Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">The Maryland Public Service Commission is an independent unit in the executive branch of State government (PUA \u00a7 2-101(b)), with jurisdiction over public service companies that operate utility businesses within the State. PUA \u00a7 2-112(a). The Commission\u2019s primary duties are to \u201csupervise and regulate\u201d the companies subject to its jurisdiction to \u201censure their operation in the interest of the public\u201d and to \u201cpromote adequate, economical, and efficient delivery of utility services in the State without unjust discrimination^]\u201d PUA \u00a7 2-113(a)(1)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">BGE is a public service company regulated by the Commission.

A public service company ordinarily is not entitled to recover costs simply because the costs were incurred prudently; instead, the Commission normally requires the company to show that the costs relate to an asset \u201cused and useful\u201d in providing service. <em>E.g. Columbia Gas of Maryland, Inc. v. Pub. Serv.

Along with a rate increase application, Washington Gas Light sought approval of an \u201cAccelerated Pipe Replacement Plan,\u201d by which it would finance replacement of its aging gas infrastructure through a customer surcharge. <em>Id. </em>at 341, 378-79.

The Commission determined that the gas company could recover the costs of its plan by filing \u201cmore frequent rate cases\u201d to adjust the rate \u201cin smaller increments\u201d after the assets were placed in service. <em>Id. </em>at 342.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>C. <em>Enactment of the 2013 STRIDE Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Between 2011 and 2013, the General Assembly considered a series of bills that would empower the Public Service Commission to authorize gas companies to promptly recover infrastructure replacement costs through a customer surcharge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The 2013 General Assembly enacted \u201cAn Act Concerning Gas Companies \u2014 Rate Regulation \u2014 Infrastructure Replacement Surcharge.\u201d The proposal was commonly referred to as the Strategic Infrastructure Development and Enhancement (STRIDE) law. The law took effect on June 1, 2013. <em>See </em>2013 Md. Laws, ch. 161, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The legislation added section 4-210 to the Public Utilities Article. This new section includes an express statement of legislative intent: \u201cIt is the intent of the General Assembly that the purpose of this section is to accelerate gas infrastructure improvements in the State by establishing a mechanism for gas companies to promptly recover reasonable and prudent costs of investments in eligible infrastructure replacement projects separate from base rate proceedings.\u201d PUA \u00a7 4-210(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Pursuant to this section, a gas company may file \u201ca plan to invest in eligible infrastructure replacement projects\u201d accompanied by \u201ca cost-recovery schedule ... that includes a fixed annual surcharge to recover reasonable and prudent costs\u201d of those projects. PUA \u00a7 4-210(d)(1). A plan filed by a gas company must include: \u201c(i) a time line for the completion of each eligible project; (ii) the estimated cost of each project; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>(iii) a description of customer benefits under the plan; and (iv) any other information the Commission considers necessary to evaluate the plan.\u201d PUA \u00a7 4-210(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">The Commission is required to \u201ctake a final action to approve or deny the plan\u201d within 180 days after the gas company files the plan. PUA \u00a7 4-210(e)(1)(ii). The Commission \u201cmay approve a plan if it finds that the investments and estimated costs of eligible infrastructure replacement projects are: (i) reasonable and prudent; and (ii) designed to improve public safety or infrastructure reliability over the short term and long term.\u201d PUA \u00a7 4-210(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The term \u201c[eligible infrastructure replacement\u201d is defined as \u201ca replacement or an improvement in an existing infrastructure of a gas company that: (i) is made on or after June 1, 2013; (ii) is designed to improve public safety or infrastructure reliability; (iii) does not increase the revenue of a gas company by connecting an improvement directly to new customers; (iv) reduces or has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through a reduction in natural gas system leaks; and (v) is not included in the current rate base of the gas company as determined in the gas company\u2019s most recent base rate proceeding.\u201d PUA \u00a7 4-210(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The cost-recovery schedule associated with a plan must include a fixed annual surcharge, which may not exceed $2 per month for each residential customer, and which is capped pursuant to a formula for non-residential customers. PUA \u00a7 4\u2014210(d)(4)(i). After the approval of a plan, the gas company must file an annual reconciliation \u201cto adjust the amount of a surcharge to account for any difference between the actual cost of a plan and the actual amount recovered under the surcharge.\u201d PUA \u00a7 4-210(h).

PUA \u00a7 4-210(d)(3). Of central importance to the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>stant appeal is a statutory provision that specifies when the estimated project costs may be recovered through the surcharge. Subparagraph (d)(3)(ii) provides that the <em>\u201cestimated </em>project costs ... are collectible <em>at the same time </em>the eligible infrastructure replacement <em>is made.\u201d </em>PUA \u00a7 4\u2014210(d)(3)(ii) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">\n<em>Factual and Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">A. <em>BGE\u2019s Application</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">On August 2, 2013, one month after the effective date of the statute, BGE submitted an \u201cApplication ... for Approval of a Gas System Strategic Infrastructure Development and Enhancement Plan and Accompanying Cost Recovery Mechanism.\u201d According to the application, BGE wished to \u201caccelerate significantly\u201d the replacement of \u201cgas system assets that have reached the end of their useful life,\u201d in order to \u201cenhance safety and reliability for its customers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">BGE proposed to completely replace the oldest and most leak-prone components of its gas distribution system over a period of 30 years. The application stated that BGE planned to replace the entire population of five \u201casset classes.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to BGE, those assets had been installed many decades ago, in most cases more than 50 years earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>BGE planned to invest a total of $400 million during the initial five-year period from 2014 to 2018. BGE proposed a monthly surcharge of $0.32 per residential customer and $1.87 per non-residential customer, beginning February 2014. The surcharge would then increase each year until 2017, when it would be capped at $2 per month for residential customers and $11.55 per month for non-residential customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Upon receiving the application, the Commission suspended the proposed rates and initiated proceedings to evaluate the plan. OPC participated in the proceedings to represent the interests of ratepayers.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">B. <em>Hearing Before the Commission</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The parties presented testimony and arguments at an evi-dentiary hearing on November 12, 13, and 14, 2013, in accordance with PUA \u00a7 3-107 and COMAR 20.07.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">In support of the application, four BGE executives testified regarding the details of the proposed infrastructure replacements, the expected customer benefits, and the customer surcharge. According to BGE\u2019s witnesses, the five \u201casset classes\u201d described in the application represented only 21 percent of BGE\u2019s gas distribution system mileage, but had accounted for 73 percent of all gas leak repairs in 2012. BGE estimated that the plan would roughly double the existing rate at which BGE had been replacing its pipelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">BGE\u2019s proposal envisioned that customers would begin paying a surcharge on their monthly bills contemporaneously with, and in many cases after, its upgrades of the gas-delivery infrastructure. For example, the company expected to invest $65 million in its STRIDE projects in 2014 and to collect $3 million from customers that year. According to BGE, the total charges collected over five years would cover less than 10 percent of BGE\u2019s cumulative investments in the projects. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>company would then recover the remainder of the costs over the useful life of the replaced assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">OPC offered testimony from Dr. Karl Pavlovie, an energy industry consultant, who recommended that the Commission deny the application. Among other things, Dr. Pavlovie contended that BGE\u2019s plan was deficient in that it did \u201cnot identify or specify the investment costs\u201d for replacing the targeted assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Dr. Pavlovie opined that BGE\u2019s proposed cost-recovery mechanism would contravene the established ratemaking principle that \u201cinvestment cost recovery from rate payers does not begin until the associated assets are placed in service and used and useful.\u201d He interpreted language from PUA \u00a7 4-210(d)(3)(ii), stating that \u201cestimated project costs ... are collectible at the same time the eligible infrastructure replacement is made,\u201d to mean that \u201cproject costs can be included in the surcharge once a project is <em>completed,\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) According to Dr. Pavlovie, the surcharge should not be based on future cost projections, but \u201cshould be calculated on actual historical costs in a [12] month period and collected over the subsequent 12 month period.\u201d The foundation of his interpretation was his understanding that cost recovery under the new statute should be \u201cconsistent with the principles underlying the revenue requirement model[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Disputing Dr. Pavlovic\u2019s interpretation, BGE and its witnesses contended that the intent of the legislation was to accelerate improvements by providing for prompt cost recovery contemporaneously with the implementation of the projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">The Commission\u2019s staff also participated in the hearing pursuant to PUA \u00a7 3-104(e). A staff engineer commented that BGE\u2019s submissions were not detailed enough for staff to evaluate whether the plan met all statutory requisites for approval, because BGE had not identified specific projects to be implemented. The staff recommended that the Commission direct BGE to present a more detailed list of proposed 2014 projects within 30 days after an initial order, so that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Commission staff could ensure that each project met eligibility requirements. A BGE representative agreed to supply the remaining necessary information after the conclusion of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">C. <em>The Commission\u2019s Conditional Approval of the Application</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">On January 29, 2014, the final day of the 180-day period for consideration of the application <em>(see </em>PUA \u00a7 4\u2014210(e)(1)), the Commission issued Order No. 86147. The Commission set forth its findings and conclusions in a 40-page opinion that accompanied the order. The Commission declared: \u201c[W]e find that BGE\u2019s Application meets the requirements of [s]ection 4-210 and we conditionally grant the Company\u2019s request____We approve the proposed cost recovery surcharge subject to the requirements set forth in [s]ection 4-210 and this Order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The Commission nevertheless found BGE\u2019s submissions to be lacking in a few important respects. Specifically, the Commission found that the BGE had not sufficiently identified the \u201ctime line for completion of <em>each </em>eligible project\u201d and the \u201cestimated cost of <em>each </em>project\u201d pursuant to PUA \u00a7 4-210(d)(2)(i) and (ii). (Emphasis added.) As a result, the Commission could not yet determine whether the proposed investments and estimated costs were \u201creasonable and prudent\u201d to qualify for approval under PUA \u00a7 4-210(e)(3). The Commission wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-8\">According to BGE, the initial five year (2014-2018) estimated cost for its STRIDE Plan will be $400 million. BGE takes the position that each vintage asset class represents a \u201cproject.\u201d Thus, according to BGE, the timeline for each project ranges from three years for the Ski-Bar risers to 30 years for cast iron main and copper services. However, we conclude that the term \u201cproject\u201d in Section 4-210(d)(2) means something more specific, concrete and practical than a broadly outlined plan. In fact, the Company essentially concedes as much, since BGE agreed to file a detailed list of 2014 projects within 30 days of a Commission order approv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>ing its Plan, as Staff recommended, with the same level of detail as is found in the Company\u2019s annual gas distribution system report. In order for the Commission to conclude that each project is reasonable and prudent both from an infrastructure and cost standpoint, we condition approval of BGE\u2019s Plan ... upon a Commission review of the time line and costs for each of BGE\u2019s projects.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">The Commission directed BGE to file a list of projects to be initiated in 2014, along with the time lines and estimated costs for each project. The Commission gave BGE 30 days to file the list. It ordered that BGE could not implement the 2014 surcharge until after the Commission had approved the 2014 project list, time lines, and cost estimates. The Commission required BGE, each year thereafter, to submit information about projects for the upcoming year.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Addressing the question of statutory interpretation that had dominated much of the proceeding, the Commission concluded that BGE would not be required to await the completion of each infrastructure project before collecting the surcharge. The Commission recognized that \u201cthe new STRIDE statute represents a departure from traditional ratemaking principles.\u201d The Commission emphasized that the express legislative purpose was that \u201creasonable and prudent costs\u201d could be \u201crecovered \u2018separate from base rate proceedings.\u2019 \u201d Consistent with that reading, the Commission determined that the statutory provision \u201cthat estimated project costs \u2018are collectible at the same time the eligible infrastructure replacement is made\u2019 ... authorizes contemporaneous cost recovery at the time eligible infrastructure replacement work is being performed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The Commission clarified, however, that \u201cestimated project costs may not be recovered by the surcharge until BGE has begun making its initial STRIDE replacements.\u201d In a footnote, the Commission added that it anticipated that approval of those submissions would be completed \u201cat an Administrative Meeting after Staff and the Commission have had a reasonable time to review BGE\u2019s project filing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>At the conclusion of Order No. 86147, the Commission ordered that BGE\u2019s STRIDE plan was \u201capproved, subject to the acceptance by BGE of the conditions contained in this Order[.]\u201d The Commission also ordered BGE to notify the Commission within 30 days whether it would accept all conditions contained in the order. Finally, the Commission ordered that the plan would be denied if BGE failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">D. <em>Developments after the Conditional Approval</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">On February 21, 2014, BGE formally notified the Commission that it had accepted the conditions imposed by Order No. 86147. BGE submitted a list of 55 projects to be initiated in 2014, \u201cincluding project description, location, estimated cost, type of infrastructure replaced, risk assessment ..., estimated project completion date[,] and reasons for replacement.\u201d Citing changed circumstances since the initial application, BGE estimated a decrease in capital expenditures for 2014 projects. BGE also asked the Commission to authorize higher surcharges for residential customers and for most categories of non-residential customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Shortly thereafter, on February 27, 2014, OPC filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Both the Commission and BGE filed responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Meanwhile, OPC submitted comments to the Commission regarding BGE\u2019s 2014 projects. The parties again appeared at the Commission\u2019s administrative meeting on March 26, 2014, at which the Commission heard arguments, but did not receive any new sworn testimony. The Commission\u2019s staff announced that it had reviewed the project list and recommended that the Commission approve the completed application. The commissioners voted to approve the projects and to authorize BGE to impose the requested surcharges effective April 2014. The Commission issued a letter order after the meeting to formalize its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">In the action for judicial review in the circuit court, OPC challenged aspects of both Order No. 86147 and the March 26, 2014, letter order. Among other things, OPC contended that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>the Commission had erred by concluding that the statute authorized BGE to collect estimated project costs before the proposed projects were completed and by conditionally approving the plan before the Commission had received a list of projects. At a hearing on September 5, 2014, the circuit court issued an oral decision denying OPC\u2019s petition. On September 12, 2014, the circuit court entered an order affirming Order No. 86147.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">OPC noted a timely appeal from the circuit court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">\n<em>Questions Presented</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">OPC presents the following two questions, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">1.

OPC specifically contends that the Commission erred when it interpreted the statute as authorizing a gas company to recover estimated project costs after the initial implementation of the projects and before the completion of each project. OPC\u2019s challenge concerns the language of a provision describing the \u201cestimated costs\u201d included with a gas company\u2019s infrastructure replacement plan: \u201cThe estimated project costs ... are collectible at the same time the eligible infrastructure replacement is made.\u201d PUA \u00a7 4\u2014210(d)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">In a section of the opinion titled \u201cOPC\u2019s Objections,\u201d the Commission wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">OPC argued that project costs may not be included in the surcharge until projects are completed. The traditional rate base recovery models have only allowed utilities to collect revenues based upon assets that are currently used and useful. However, in this case there is legislation that specifically states that the estimated project costs \u201care collectible at the same time the eligible infrastructure replacement is made,\u201d and that reasonable and prudent costs shall be recovered \u201cseparate from base rate proceedings.\u201d The statute authorizes contemporaneous cost recovery at the time eligible infrastructure replacement work is being performed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>The parties disagree over the appropriate weight that should be given to this interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">Generally, \u201c[a] great deal of discretion is necessarily vested in the Commission in order that it may properly discharge its important and complex duties.\u201d <em>People\u2019s Counsel v.

Although this 2014 interpretation of the 2013 law had not yet been applied consistently over a long period of time, other relevant considerations indicate that the Commission\u2019s interpretation deserves deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">OPC asserts that the Commission provided \u201clittle (if any) elaboration in formulating its interpretation.\u201d According to OPC, \u201cthe Commission\u2019s discussion and interpretation \u2014 in its entirety \u2014 of ... PUA \u00a7 4-210(d)(3)(ii)\u201d consists of a single paragraph. We disagree that the Commission\u2019s analysis was so limited. Earlier portions of the opinion extensively discussed competing interpretations of the provision offered by the parties. The opinion included analysis of section 4-210 in its entirety, from which the Commission drew inferences regarding how the legislature intended to motivate gas companies to accelerate infrastructure replacements. The opinion later cited subparagraph (d)(3)(h) to support the conclusion that \u201cestimated project costs may not be recovered by the surcharge until BGE has begun making its initial STRIDE replacements[.]\u201d As a whole, the well-considered opinion provided a reasoned elaboration of this provision within its statutory context.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Further examination of the record reveals that the adversarial presentation of this issue sharpened the Commission\u2019s statutory analysis. In addition to written testimony regarding the meaning of the subparagraph, one of the commissioners examined OPC\u2019s witness, Dr. Pavlovic, regarding OPC\u2019s preferred interpretation. OPC\u2019s expert testified that the statute\u2019s reference to the \u201ctime\u201d when a gas company makes a replacement could refer to a number of things, including \u201cwhen the underlying asset is in the process of being put in the ground\u201d or \u201cnot until ... the asset is in the ground and functioning.\u201d He opined that the Commission should equate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>the time the eligible infrastructure replacement \u201cis made\u201d with the time that the replacement has been \u201cplaced in service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">The commissioner asked Dr. Pavlovic to explain why the statute would refer to the recovery of \u201cestimated\u201d costs if the gas company could not collect the costs until the replacement had been \u201cplaced in service,\u201d when the actual costs would already be known. Dr. Pavlovic commented that the reference to a cost estimate amounted to \u201can inconsistency or ambiguity as it were in the legislation.\u201d He encouraged the Commission to use its own expertise where the statute was \u201cunclear\u201d and to resolve the question by applying principles of the conventional recovery model. The commissioner, by contrast, expressed doubt that there would be any need for the new statute if the traditional cost-recovery principles continued to apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">[COMMISSIONER:] But coming back to your testimony, you would have liked the statute to have said placed in service before cost could be recovered?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">DR. PAVLOVIC: I would like the statute to have said placed in service, recovery \u2014 this provision is talking about the recovery. Recovery will begin when the asset is placed in service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">[COMMISSIONER:] I know you\u2019re not a lawyer, but a lot of your testimony deals with your view of the statute---That\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to clarify in my mind, if the statute wanted to say placed in service, it could have easily said placed in service. That\u2019s a pretty common phrase in utility regulation; is it not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-10\">DR. PAVLOVIC: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-11\">[COMMISSIONER:] Are you familiar at all with the concept that if somebody thinks part of the statute is ambiguous, that you have to try to read the statute as a whole so that no terms are rendered meaningless or incorrect?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-12\">DR. PAVLOVIC: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-13\">[COMMISSIONER:] So if we took your reading of the statute that the recovery only occurs after the asset is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>placed in service, what do we do with the estimated budget cost of that same subsection of the statute?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">After reading the language once more, Dr. Pavlovic commented, \u201cthe statute, it\u2019s difficult here.\u201d He concluded his answer by saying: \u201cI mean to square this provision with, as I said, what I understand to be the overall intent, which is to apply the traditional revenue requirement model to the recovery of this investment, but to \u2014 in a more timely manner, I can\u2019t make these completely consistent and I certainly admit that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Like the Commission\u2019s written explanation of its decision, the hearing transcript demonstrates that the agency engaged in a thorough reasoning process in formulating its interpretation. Normally, this Court owes deference when an agency has \u201ccarefully considered the statutory language during an adversarial adjudicatory proceeding and issued [a] formal, written opinion [ ] that detail[s] the reasons for reaching its conclusion,\u201d as long as the agency\u2019s interpretation does not clearly violate the wording of the statute. <em>Injured Workers\u2019 Ins. Fund v. Subsequent Injury Fund, </em>222 Md.App. 347, 357 n. 7, 112 A.3d 1092 (concluding that this Court normally would defer to an interpretation expressed by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission in written opinion after adversarial hearing, but ultimately holding that the relevant language unambiguously supported the agency\u2019s interpretation), <em>cert. granted, </em>443 Md. 234, 112 A.3d 1092 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Giving weight to the Commission\u2019s interpretation would be particularly appropriate here where even OPC, the party challenging the Commission\u2019s interpretation, advanced the position that the statute was ambiguous and encouraged the agency to use its expertise to determine the meaning of potentially ambiguous terms. <em>See Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Pub. Serv.

As compared to this Court, the Commission certainly possesses far greater expertise in deciding how to accomplish the legislative purpose of accelerating infrastructure improvements through a surcharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">We are unconvinced that the Commission\u2019s interpretation carries minimal or no authoritative weight. Because the Commission has \u201cclearly demonstrate^] that it has focused its attention on the statutory provisions in question, thoroughly addressed the relevant issues, and reached its interpretation through a sound reasoning process,\u201d its interpretation should \u201cbe accorded the persuasiveness due a well-considered opinion of an expert body.\u201d <em>Office of People\u2019s Counsel v.

Comm\u2019n, </em>305 Md. at 161-62, 501 A.2d 1307) (quotation marks omitted). As explained below, however, even upon a plenary review of this issue, we would arrive at the same answer as the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">B. <em>Meaning of Section 4-210(d)(3)(ii) of the Public Utilities Article</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">When interpreting a provision of the Public Utilities Article, as with any other statute, we first examine the ordinary meaning of the enacted language, \u201creading the statute as a whole to ensure that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory.\u201d <em>Peters v. Early Healthcare Giver, Inc., </em>439 Md. 646, 665, 97 A.3d 621 (2014) (quoting <em>Nichols v. Suiter, </em>435 Md. 324, 339, 78 A.3d 344 (2013)) (quotation marks omitted). A court may neither add nor subtract words to alter the meaning of statutory terms and must avoid forced or subtle constructions that limit or extend a statute\u2019s application. <em>See, e.g., Clipper Windpower, Inc. v. Sprenger, </em>399 Md. 539, 553, 924 A.2d 1160 (2007). \u201cIn every case, the statute must be given a reasonable interpretation, not one that is absurd, illogical, or incompatible with common sense.\u201d <em>Espina v. Jackson, </em>442 Md. 311, 322, 112 A.3d 442 (2015) (citations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>omitted); <em>Lockshin v. Semsker, </em>412 Md. 257, 276, 987 A.2d 18 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">OPC contends that the Commission violated these principles by \u201cimproperly substitut[ing] its own preferred words, phrases, and tenses that the Commission believed the General Assembly <em>should </em>have chosen.\u201d OPC highlights some differences between the words of PUA \u00a7 4\u2014210(d)(3)(ii) (\u201cestimated project costs ... are collectible at the same time the eligible infrastructure replacement is made\u201d) and words from the conclusion stated in the opinion: \u201cThe statute authorizes contemporaneous cost recovery at the time eligible infrastructure replacement work is being performed.\u201d According to OPC, the Commission \u201crewrote\u201d the provision to say that \u201cestimated project costs ... are collectible at the time the eligible infrastructure replacement work, including preconstruction planning, has begun or is being performed.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">But even as it criticizes the Commission for rewriting (or, more precisely, paraphrasing) the statutory language, OPC then goes on to offer its own paraphrase of PUA \u00a7 4-210(d)(3)(ii). According to OPC, subparagraph (d)(3)(ii) means that \u201cSTRIDE Project costs may <em>not </em>be collected from residential ratepayers in the STRIDE surcharge until (and unless) each STRIDE project for which ratepayers are being charged <em>has been \u2018made,\u2019 </em>or completed.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">OPC\u2019s analysis focuses most acutely upon a single word\u2014 \u201cmade.\u201d OPC asserts that \u201cthe verb \u2018made\u2019 \u201d was \u201cused in its simple past tense.\u201d Citing online dictionaries, OPC tells us: \u201c \u2018Made\u2019 means \u2018built, formed, or shaped in a particular way.\u2019 ... Further, \u2018made is the \u2018simple past tense and past partici-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>pie of \u2018make,\u2019 which means that it refers to something that has <em>already </em>been \u2018built, formed or shaped in a specified way.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">OPC\u2019s parsing of the sentence is flawed. An example of the verb \u201cto make\u201d used in the \u201csimple past tense\u201d is: \u201cThe gas company made a replacement.\u201d Subparagraph (d)(3)(ii), however, does not employ that formulation. Instead, the subpara-graph uses the word \u201cmade\u201d as a participle along with the present tense verb \u201cis\u201d \u2014 the estimated costs become collectible at the same time the replacement \u201cis made.\u201d In other words, subparagraph (d)(3)(ii) uses the verb \u201cto make\u201d in the present tense, but in the passive voice. A simplified example of that passive formulation is: \u201cThe replacement <em>is made </em>by the gas company.\u201d The active-voice equivalent of that sentence is: \u201cThe gas company <em>makes </em>the replacement,\u201d using the present tense. Translated from the passive to the active voice, the meaning of \u201cat the same time the eligible infrastructure replacement <em>is made </em>\u201d is substantially similar to \u201cat the same time the gas company <em>makes </em>the eligible infrastructure replacement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">OPC\u2019s interpretation might be accurate if the statutory language had employed the passive voice and the present perfect tense, so that it provided that estimated project costs become collectible at the same time \u201cthe eligible infrastructure replacement <em>has been </em>made.\u201d That reading, however, would not reflect the language as actually enacted, in the passive voice and present tense.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Our ultimate question of interpretation is to determine when the \u201cestimated project costs ... are collectible[.]\u201d PUA \u00a7 4-210(d)(3)(ii). The statute directs that those estimated costs may be collected \u201cat the same the eligible infrastructure replacement is made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Commission interpreted this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>phrase, within the statutory context, to mean that costs may be collected once a gas company <em>begins </em>making the infrastructure replacements. OPC contends that the only permissible reading of this sentence is that the gas company may not collect the costs until it <em>finishes </em>making the replacements.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Depending on the context, a reference to the \u201ctime\u201d something \u201cis made\u201d could refer to either the period of time during which something is being made (\u201cwe\u2019ll listen to music while dinner is made\u201d) or the point in time when the process of making something has been completed (\u201cdinner is made; let\u2019s eat\u201d). In subparagraph (d)(3)(ii), the potential ambiguity is resolved by the clarifying phrase \u201cat the <em>same </em>time.\u201d Under OPC\u2019s interpretation, the \u201ctime\u201d an infrastructure replacement \u201cis made\u201d represents a discrete instant: after that moment, the gas company may recover a surcharge, but before that moment, the company may not recover anything. The statute, however, contemplates that the surcharge will be paid not at one discrete time, but over a long period of time. Specifically, the surcharge \u201cshall be in effect for 5 years from the date of initial implementation of an approved plan,\u201d and the surcharge may continue for certain ongoing projects even after that five-year period. PUA \u00a7 4-210(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Under OPC\u2019s reading, a gas company would never be permitted to collect the costs \u201cat the same time\u201d the replacement <em>\u201cis </em>made\u201d; it could recover costs only after the replacement <em>has been </em>made or completed. The timing of the two actions (replacement and collection) would always be different and would never be \u201cthe same.\u201d OPC\u2019s interpretation at worst contradicts the meaning of the phrase \u201cat the same time,\u201d and at best renders that term meaningless.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under fundamental principles of construction, we must reject OPC\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>interpretation because it fails to account for the General Assembly\u2019s use of the word \u201csame.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Chow v. State, </em>393 Md. 431, 453-55, 903 A.2d 388 (2006) (rejecting interpretation of statute that would render word \u201ctransfer\u201d in statute meaningless or nugatory).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">Of course, to understand the meaning of statutory language, we must look beyond individual words and clauses to the larger context, including other surrounding provisions and the apparent purpose of the enactment. <em>See, e.g., Williams v. Peninsula Regional Med. Ctr., </em>440 Md. 573, 580-81, 103 A.3d 658 (2014) (citing <em>Lockshin, </em>412 Md. at 275-76, 987 A.2d 18). This additional context casts further doubt upon OPC\u2019s suggested interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">This sentence in PUA \u00a7 4\u2014210(d)(3)(ii) does not describe the collection of mere \u201ccosts,\u201d but the collection of \u201cestimated project costs\u201d that are to be included in an application. Subsection (d), which governs the contents of a plan filed by a gas company, specifies that a plan must include \u201ca cost-recovery schedule associated with the plan that includes a fixed annual surcharge on customer bills to recover reasonable and prudent costs of proposed eligible infrastructure replacement projects.\u201d PUA \u00a7 4\u2014210(d)(1)(ii). Subsection (d) is predominantly forward-looking. The gas company files a \u201cplan\u201d for \u201cproposed ... projects\u201d along with \u201cestimated\u201d costs. Overall, this language suggests that a surcharge reflecting estimated costs may be recovered before the gas company has completed all of the work and before the actual costs are known.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Other portions of the statute are explicitly backward-looking. Most notably, the statute requires a gas company, after the approval of a plan, to file an annual reconciliation \u201cto adjust the amount of a surcharge to account for any difference between the <em>actual cost </em>of a plan and the actual amount recovered under the surcharge.\u201d PUA \u00a7 4-210(h) (emphasis added). This feature of the statute strengthens the implication that the gas company can begin to recover its costs before it has completed all of the work and before the actual amount of the costs are known.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Subsection (d) is not the only provision to address cost collection. Elsewhere, the statute directs: \u201cA surcharge under this section shall be in effect for 5 years from the date of initial implementation of an approved plan.\u201d PUA \u00a7 4-210(g)(1)(i). Under the most reasonable reading of this sentence, a customer surcharge begins to take effect on the date that the gas company initially implements its plan. Under OPC\u2019s interpretation, the surcharge would not be \u201cin effect\u201d from the initiation of the approved plan, but would take effect much later, after the completion of projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">At best, OPC\u2019s reading is in substantial tension with many features of the statute. OPC\u2019s interpretation would render the word \u201csame\u201d in PUA \u00a7 4\u2014210(d)(3)(ii) essentially meaningless; it struggles to explain why the provision refers to \u201cestimated\u201d costs that would need to be adjusted to reflect the \u201cactual\u201d costs at the end of the year; and it substantially undermines the overlapping direction that the surcharge mechanism takes effect \u201cfrom the date of initial implementation[.]\u201d PUA \u00a7 4-210(g)(1)(i). By contrast, the Commission\u2019s interpretation is consistent with section 4-210 in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">C. <em>Effect of \u201cJust and Reasonable Rate\u201d De\u00f1nition of PUA \u00a7 4-101</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">OPC largely ignores the tension between its strained interpretation of subparagraph (d)(3)(ii) and the surrounding provisions. OPC does, however, encourage this Court to look beyond the statute and to infuse the reading of section 4-210 with other factors usually considered in the traditional rate-of-return regulatory model. We reject that approach because, by all objective indications, the STRIDE law represents a departure from that conventional model.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">OPC posits that, because a surcharge is a \u201crate,\u201d the surcharge must also meet the enumerated requirements of a \u201cjust and reasonable rate.\u201d Within the rate regulation title, the term \u201c \u2018just and reasonable rate\u2019 means a rate that: (1) does not violate any provision of [the Public Utilities AJrticle; (2) fully considers and is consistent with the public good; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>(3) ... will result in an operating income to the public service company that yields, after reasonable deduction for depreciation and other necessary and proper expenses and reserves, a reasonable return on the fair value of the public service company\u2019s property used and useful in providing service to the public.\u201d PUA \u00a7 4-101. In OPC\u2019s view, the language that \u201cestimated project costs ar\u00e9 collectible ... at the same time the eligible infrastructure replacement is made\u201d should be treated as restating the requirement of PUA \u00a7 4-101(3) that a public service company is authorized to earn a return on property that is \u201cused and useful\u201d in providing service to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">In response, the Commission argues that it makes little sense to attempt to \u201creconcile\u201d the new STRIDE surcharge mechanism with traditional recovery models. The Commission concedes that, in the traditional ratemaking context, the Commission \u201cdisfavors tracker surcharges\u201d that permit a utility to begin recovering costs from ratepayers immediately upon expenditure. The Commission argues, however, that the General Assembly \u201chas expressed a clear desire that the Commission deviate from that position\u201d when evaluating surcharges under the STRIDE law because the language of PUA \u00a7 4-210 makes it \u201cquite clear\u201d that \u201cthe STRIDE Act was intended as an exception to traditional ratemaking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">OPC\u2019s argument has a number of infirmities. First and foremost, the defined term \u201cjust and reasonable rate\u201d does not appear in section 4-210. The General Assembly easily could have incorporated the \u201cused and useful\u201d component by adding the defined term \u201cjust and reasonable rate\u201d to surcharge provisions of the STRIDE law. We must respect the legislature\u2019s choice not to do so. <em>See, e.g., Toler v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>373 Md. 214, 223-24, 817 A.2d 229 (2003) (explaining that decision to employ defined term in one section but different term in another part of statute dealing with same overall subject usually indicates that legislature intends two different meanings).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>The statute here conspicuously indicates the opposite of any intention to make the surcharge comport with the methods of traditional base rate cases. The General Assembly expressly stated its intent to \u201cestablish [ ] a mechanism for gas companies to promptly recover reasonable and prudent costs ... <em>separate from base rate proceedings.\u201d </em>PUA \u00a7 4-210(b) (emphasis added). The statute ensures this separation by prohibiting the Commission from \u201cconsidering] a revenue requirement or rate-making issue that is not related to the plan when reviewing a plan for approval or denial unless the plan is filed in conjunction with a base rate case.\u201d PUA \u00a7 4-210(e)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">The General Assembly established new and distinct standards for evaluating a request for a customer surcharge pursuant to the STRIDE law. Specifically, the STRIDE surcharge is designed \u201cto recover <em>reasonable and prudent costs </em>of proposed eligible infrastructure replacement projects.\u201d PUA \u00a7 4\u2014210(d)(1)(ii) (emphasis added). The \u201cinvestments and estimated costs\u201d recovered through the surcharge must be: \u201c(i) <em>reasonable and prudent; </em>and (ii) designed to improve public safety or infrastructure reliability over the short term and long term.\u201d PUA \u00a7 4-210(e)(3) (emphasis added). Section 4-210 does not guarantee the gas company a reasonable return on the fair value of assets used and useful in providing service, as in the traditional rate-of-return model; instead, it merely permits the gas company, between base rate cases, to recover certain \u201creasonable and prudent\u201d costs through surcharges that do not exceed a statutory maximum. The adjustments to scrutinize the replaced infrastructure under a traditional rate analysis do not occur until a post-approval rate case. <em>See </em>PUA \u00a7 4-210(d)(5)-(6); PUA \u00a7 4-210(g); PUA \u00a7 4-210(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The STRIDE law is not the first instance in which the General Assembly has established a rate mechanism procedurally and substantively distinct from conventional ratemaking. In <em>Office of People\u2019s Counsel v. Maryland Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>355 Md. 1, 733 A.2d 996 (1999), the Court of Appeals rejected the notion that rates set outside the traditional regulatory scheme must strictly satisfy the statutory criteria for \u201cjust and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>reasonable rates.\u201d In 1995, the General Assembly had enacted legislation authorizing an alternative method for setting telecommunications rates, to permit greater price flexibility than was provided by the traditional recovery model. <em>Id. </em>at 9, 733 A.2d 996. The 1995 statute (currently codified at PUA \u00a7 4-301) provided that, notwithstanding the statutory definition of just and reasonable rates, the Commission could regulate telephone companies through alternative forms of price regulation to ensure \u201caffordable and reasonably priced\u201d service. Pursuant to that statute, the Commission established telecommunications rates through a price-cap regulatory plan, which it considered to be a \u201c \u2018broader and more forward-looking measure of rate reasonableness\u2019 \u201d than the traditional rate-of-return measures. <em>Office of People\u2019s Counsel v. Maryland Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>355 Md. at 7, 11, 733 A.2d 996.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">OPC challenged that price regulation, contending that the \u201caffordable and reasonably priced\u201d criterion of the new statute was in addition to, rather than a substitute for, the definition of \u201cjust and reasonable rates.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20-21, 733 A.2d 996. Rejecting that view, the Court focused upon the statutory definition of \u201cjust and reasonable rates,\u201d which included the requirement that rates \u201c \u2018will result in an operating income to the public service company ... yielding ... a reasonable return upon the fair value of the company\u2019s property used and useful in rendering service to the public.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8-9, 733 A.2d 996 (quoting former art. 78, \u00a7 69(a)). The Court reasoned that this defined term \u201crequires a traditional rate analysis to be made from a specified comparison of costs, rates[,] and profits[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23, 733 A.2d 996. Those enumerated criteria for evaluating justness and reasonableness do not apply when the Commission regulates a utility by means of an alternative mode of regulation that does not use a traditional rate-of-return methodology. <em>Id. </em>at 23-24, 733 A.2d 996. The new statute\u2019s guarantee of \u201c \u2018affordable and reasonably priced\u2019 \u201d service acted as the \u201cequivalent\u201d of the general mandate that a utility charge \u201c \u2018just and reasonable rates.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24, 733 A.2d 996.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Similarly, in <em>Severstal Sparrows Point, LLC v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n of Maryland, </em>194 Md.App. 601, 620, 5 A.3d 713 (2010), this Court concluded that the definition of a \u201cjust and reasonable rate\u201d in PUA \u00a7 4-101 did not apply to another form of regulation \u201coutside the realm of traditional rate-of-return ratemaking.\u201d In that case, this Court construed a 1999 statute that obligated electricity suppliers to offer certain customers \u201c \u2018backstop\u2019 electricity supply, known as Standard Offer Service[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605, 5 A.3d 713. The statute required the service to be offered \u201cat a market price that permits recovery of the verifiable, prudently incurred costs to procure or produce the electricity plus a reasonable return.\u201d PUA \u00a7 7-510(c)(3)(ii)(2). In addition, the statute gave the Commission limited oversight to ensure that the price was procured \u201cin a manner that is designed to obtain the best price for residential and small commercial customers[.]\u201d PUA \u00a7 7-510(c)(4)(ii)(1). Ultimately, this Court concluded that the Commission erred when it attempted to graft elements of a traditional rate case onto this more abbreviated oversight process, controlled by statutory criteria other than section 4-101. <em>Severstal Sparrows Point, </em>194 Md.App. at 622-26, 5 A.3d 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Consistent with these authorities, we conclude that the Commission is not required to evaluate the justness and reasonableness of a customer surcharge under the 2013 STRIDE law based strictly on criteria that are associated with the traditional base rate recovery models. Section 4-210 authorizes a surcharge \u201coutside the traditional ratemaking process.\u201d <em>Severstal Sparrows Point, </em>194 Md.App. at 619, 5 A.3d 713 (citing <em>Office of People\u2019s Counsel v. Maryland Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>355 Md. at 23, 733 A.2d 996). The Code undoubtedly mandates that BGE charge \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d rates for its gas service. <em>See </em>PUA \u00a7 4-201; <em>Office of People\u2019s Counsel v. Maryland Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>355 Md. at 25, 733 A.2d 996. Yet, in this context, the requirements that costs recovered through the surcharge be reasonable, prudent, and otherwise in accordance with section 4-210 serve as the \u201cequivalent\u201d of that standard. <em>Office of People\u2019s Counsel v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number><em>Maryland Pub.

The Commission here correctly declined OPC\u2019s invitation to overwrite the STRIDE methodology with elements of the traditional rate-of-return methodology where neither the statutory language, nor the statutory scheme, nor logic compels the application of those principles here.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">D. <em>Confirmation Through Other Indicia of Legislative Intent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Even if we agreed that this statute were reasonably susceptible to the alternative interpretation offered by OPC, our next task would be to consult \u201cother indicia of legislative intent ..., including the relevant statute\u2019s legislative history, the context of the statute within the broader legislative scheme, and the relative rationality of competing constructions.\u201d Harri<em>son-Solomon v.

OPC\u2019s reading finds no support in these sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The Commission\u2019s construction is faithful to the express \u201cpurpose and intent\u201d of the General Assembly, which was \u201cto <em>accelerate </em>gas infrastructure improvements ... by establish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>ing a mechanism for gas companies to <em>promptly </em>recover reasonable and prudent costs ... <em>separate </em>from base rate proceedings.\u201d PUA \u00a7 4-210(b) (emphasis added). OPC\u2019s construction of the statute would do little to accomplish the General Assembly\u2019s stated aims. In contrast to OPC\u2019s, the Commission\u2019s interpretation represents a more reasonable method of accelerating a gas system overhaul because it allows substantially more prompt cost recovery than previously available under base rate proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Although there is little need to look beyond the pages of the Maryland Code to ascertain the meaning of this provision, other materials associated with this statute\u2019s legislative history confirm the Commission\u2019s interpretation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A summary of the law prepared by the Department of Legislative Services states: \u201cThe estimated project costs approved in the surcharge are collectible during the same time the eligible infrastructure replacement is being made.\u201d Fiscal and Policy Note for S.B. 8 (2013 Reg. Sess.), at 2. The report goes on to assess the probable effect of the legislation on ratepayers, operating under that assumption: \u201c[T]here is a mismatch between the recovery of infrastructure costs and the benefits from the infrastructure investment. As a result, it could be said that the risk of recovery for the company is <em>reduced </em>\u2014 i.e. shifted to ratepayers by virtue of the fact that ratepayers pay for the costs earlier.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. Because the Court of Appeals has often treated similar materials as persuasive evidence of the apparent intent of the General Assembly <em>(e.g. Gomez v. Jackson Hewitt, Inc., </em>427 Md. 128, 177-78, 46 A.3d 443 (2012); <em>Moore v. State, </em>388 Md. 623, 635-36 &amp; n. 4, 882 A.2d 256 (2005)), it would also be appropriate to do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">In addition to its \u201cplain language\u201d arguments, OPC rounds out its brief with some criticisms of the policy of allowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>utilities to begin recovering costs before assets have been placed in service. OPC and other interested parties presented these and other concerns to members of the General Assembly at a hearing of the Senate Finance Committee on January 7, 2013.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In our view, OPC\u2019s policy criticisms should be directed to the General Assembly, not to the Maryland courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">The essence of OPC\u2019s argument is that, by enacting these words \u2014 \u201cthe estimated project costs ... are collectible at the same time the eligible infrastructure replacement is made\u201d\u2014 the General Assembly prohibited gas companies from recovering estimated costs until after each project has been completed. Although OPC argues that that is \u201cplain\u201d to OPC, it was not plain to the Department of Legislative Services, or to the parties who protested to the General Assembly that the legislation would enable gas companies to begin charging customers before benefits accrued to those customers. Even Dr. Pavlovie, OPC\u2019s expert witness before the Commission, did not contend that the statute \u201cplainly\u201d or unambiguously dictates OPC\u2019s preferred result.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The statute neither says nor means that \u201ccosts may <em>not </em>be collected from residential ratepayers in the STRIDE surcharge until (and unless) each STRIDE project ... has been \u2018made,\u2019 or completed[.]\u201d Properly construed, \u201c[t]he statute authorizes contemporaneous cost recovery at the time eligible infrastructure replacement work is being performed.\u201d The Commission did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">As its first issue in this appeal, OPC challenged the correctness of an interpretation of the statute expressed in the Commission\u2019s opinion. OPC\u2019s second asserted grounds are nowhere near as clearly defined as the first. Throughout its brief and reply brief, OPC variously accuses the Commission of \u201cact[ing] unlawfully,\u201d \u201cexceeding] its statutory authority,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>\u201crefusing] to follow clear statutory mandates,\u201d ignoring \u201cprocedural requirements,\u201d making an \u201cimproper reading of the law,\u201d erring in \u201chow it applied [its] interpretations to the facts,\u201d and making a decision based on information that was \u201cnot in the evidentiary record[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">In considering these arguments, we are again guided by the standard of judicial review, under which \u201cCommission decisions are presumptively correct\u201d <em>(People\u2019s Counsel v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>52 Md.App. at 722, 451 A.2d 945), and the petitioner bears the burden to \u201cclearly show[ ]\u201d the Commission\u2019s decision to be unconstitutional, outside statutory authority, made on unlawful procedure, arbitrary or capricious, affected by legal error, or unsupported by substantial evidence. PUA \u00a7 3-203. To some extent, OPC\u2019s challenge concerns whether the Commission exceeded the regulatory powers vested in it by the General Assembly, powers which are \u201ctruly awesome[.]\u201d <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n of Maryland, </em>75 Md.App. 87, 99, 540 A.2d 820 (1988). The Commission not only has powers \u201cspecifically conferred by law\u201d but also \u201cthe implied and incidental powers needed or proper to carry out its functions,\u201d and those powers must be \u201cconstrued liberally.\u201d PUA \u00a7 2-112.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">OPC\u2019s characterization of this alleged error varies, but OPC does advance one unifying theme. According to OPC, \u201cthe Commission erred when it failed to follow the express language in PUA \u00a7 4-210(d)(1)(i) and (e)(3) by authorizing BGE to begin recovering estimated costs for an eligible infrastructure replacement even though it determined the plan had no \u2018projects.\u2019 \u201d OPC relies on subparagraph 4-210(d)(1)(i), which authorizes a gas company to file \u201ca plan to invest in <em>eligible infrastructure replacement </em>projects[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) OPC also points to paragraph (e)(3), which authorizes the Commission to approve a plan based on findings about \u201cthe investments and estimated costs of <em>eligible infrastructure replacement projects[.]\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) OPC argues that the STRIDE law \u201crequires the Commission to review \u2018projects\u2019 prior to approving a \u2018plan.\u2019 \u201d The Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>mission, by contrast, granted a preliminary approval of BGE\u2019s broader program, conditioned on subsequent annual reviews of those projects.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Although paragraph (a)(3) enumerates criteria for evaluating whether a project is an \u201celigible infrastructure replacement project,\u201d the statute does not describe what constitutes a \u201cproject.\u201d Instead, the definitions subsection states: \u201c\u2018Project\u2019 means an eligible infrastructure replacement project proposed by a gas company in a plan filed under this section.\u201d PUA \u00a7 4-210(a)(5). The statute defines a \u201c[p]lan\u201d within section 4-210 to mean \u201ca plan that a gas company files under subsection (d) of this section.\u201d PUA \u00a7 4-210(a)(4). By using these vague and self-referential definitions for \u201cproject\u201d and \u201cplan,\u201d the General Assembly indicated that it \u201cintended to entrust the formulation of specific standards to the technical expertise\u201d of the Commission. <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n of Maryland, </em>305 Md. at 159, 501 A.2d 1307. This contested proceeding presented the Commission with its first opportunity to articulate those standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">In its opinion, the Commission expanded upon the meaning of the term \u201cproject.\u201d BGE had taken the position that each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>\u201casset class\u201d qualified as a single \u201cproject.\u201d Operating on that assumption, BGE submitted time lines ranging from three years to 30 years for the replacement of the different asset classes, while providing total cost estimates for each of the initial five years of implementation. The Commission concluded that these general estimates were inadequate, explaining that \u201cthe term \u2018project\u2019 in [s]ection 4-210(d)(2) means something more specific, concrete[,] and practical than a broadly outlined plan.\u201d Put differently, the Commission concluded that BGE had provided information for five <em>categories </em>of projects, without identifying the individual projects within those categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The Commission \u201cagree[d] with OPC in its interpretation\u201d that the gas company must submit project costs and time lines for each project so that the Commission could \u201cestablish the reasonableness and prudence of the projects.\u201d The Commission declared that \u201cBGE must meet the statutory requirements to provide the costs and timeline for completion of each project <em>before </em>surcharge recovery may commence.\u201d Thus, contrary to OPC\u2019s assertion on appeal, the Commission did not authorize \u201cBGE to begin recovering estimated costs ... even though it determined the plan had no \u2018projects.\u2019 \u201d In fact, the Commission did the opposite. The immediate effect of Order No. 86147 was to prohibit BGE from imposing the surcharge as of January 29, 2014, subject to later review of a list of 2014 projects.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">OPC takes no issue with the Commission\u2019s conclusions about the level of specificity required for the \u201cprojects\u201d included with a gas company\u2019s plan, and OPC agrees with the conclusion that review of a project list, along with estimated costs and time lines, was necessary before authorizing the surcharge. Moreover, OPC has not disputed that BGE complied with the Commission\u2019s conditions when it submitted the necessary project list on February 21, 2014, which the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>mission subsequently reviewed and approved at the administrative meeting on March 26, 2014. For that reason, by the time that the Commission actually authorized BGE to begin collecting the customer surcharge, the substantive basis for OPC\u2019s objections no longer existed: BGE had identified \u201cprojects\u201d for 2014, and the Commission had reviewed the reasonableness and prudence of those projects as required by the statute. The same characteristic of Order No. 86147 to which OPC objects \u2014 the Commission\u2019s multi-step process for reviewing the plan \u2014 was precisely the feature that ensured that the ultimate decision would comport with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">OPC protests, however, that by inviting BGE to make \u201cafter-the-fact changes to its plan,\u201d the Commission \u201cprevented] full review prior to approval of the plan[.]\u201d OPC theorizes that \u201cthe project modifications and surcharge changes\u201d from BGE\u2019s filing on February 21, 2014, \u201camounted to amendments that should have been treated under the 120-day schedule provided for in paragraph (e)(2).\u201d Yet assuming that the Commission should have treated BGE\u2019s updated project list as an amendment, the Commission was not necessarily required to wait any particular period of time or to conduct a full hearing before acting on those amendments. The statute sets a 120-day maximum period for considering an amendment, not a 120-day minimum. <em>See </em>PUA \u00a7 4-210(e)(2) (\u201cWithin 120 days after a gas company files an amendment to an approved plan, the Commission shall take final action to approve or deny the amendment\u201d). The statute includes no specific requirement of a hearing on an amendment to a plan. In general, the Public Utilities law directs the Commission to \u201cinstitute and conduct proceedings reasonably necessary and proper to the exercise of its powers or the performance of its duties.\u201d PUA \u00a7 3-104(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">As illustrated by this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Building Owners and Managers Ass\u2019n of Metropolitan Baltimore, Inc. v.

In <em>BOMA, </em>at the conclusion of a conventional rate case, the Commission had authorized a \u201ctwo-step increase\u201d in BGE\u2019s electricity rates, granting an immediate rate increase and also authorizing BGE to file an amended rate schedule several months later when a new plant was expected to begin operation. <em>Id. </em>at 746, 614 A.2d 1006. The Commission directed the company to file revised tariff schedules, along with data necessary for the Commission to verify the reasonableness of the second rate increase. <em>Id. </em>at 766-77, 614 A.2d 1006. The Commission determined that it was unnecessary and against the public interest to require a separate and expensive proceeding that would only repeat much of the presentation from the first hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 766, 614 A.2d 1006. For that reason, the Commission accepted the final submissions as a compliance filing for an administrative meeting, giving the parties the opportunity to express their views without formal testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 767, 614 A.2d 1006.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">On appeal in <em>BOMA, </em>OPC contended that the Commission had acted arbitrarily, acted without substantial evidence, and deprived ratepayers of due process when it approved the second rate increase without a new proceeding and a full hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 768-69, 614 A.2d 1006. This Court rejected those arguments, holding that the Commission did not abuse its discretion or act unlawfully by refusing to require an entirely new, and largely duplicative, rate case. <em>Id. </em>at 771-72, 614 A.2d 1006. In light of the reasoning of <em>BOMA, </em>there is nothing inherently objectionable about the type of multi-step procedure used here by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">After a contested hearing in this case, the Commission had already determined, based on BGE\u2019s initial submissions, that projects to replace assets in the categories targeted by BGE would qualify as eligible infrastructure replacement projects and would improve public safety and infrastructure reliability. The Commission required more information to reach a conclusion as to whether \u201ceach proposed project [wa]s reasonable and prudent both from an infrastructure and cost standpoint,\u201d in accordance with PUA \u00a7 4-210(e)(3). Having already reviewed the company\u2019s overarching program, the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>decided to make those remaining determinations through a series of abbreviated proceedings, first by reviewing the projects and estimated costs for 2014, followed by review of annual filings in each of the subsequent four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">OPC argues that, under these circumstances, such a \u201cconditional approval\u201d was unlawful, and that the Commission\u2019s only option was to deny BGE\u2019s application. In essence, OPC asks this Court to invalidate the Commission\u2019s approval of the 2014 projects and surcharge and to send all parties back to the beginning of the process. OPC concludes: \u201cif BGE wishes to proceed again under \u00a7 4-210 for recovery of these costs, the parties should be provided an opportunity to determine what, if any, of BGE\u2019s projects meet the statutory requirements, and then, and only then, may the Commission determine if it wishes to approve a plan and whether a surcharge crafted in accordance with \u00a7 4-210 may be imposed upon customers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The Commission has already provided that relief (\u201can opportunity to determine what, if any, of BGE\u2019s projects meet the statutory requirements\u201d) through its multi-step approval. The process devised by the Commission eliminated unnecessary delay, while also ensuring that ratepayers would not pay surcharges in 2014 and in subsequent years until after the Commission had determined that the proposed projects and estimated costs were reasonable and prudent. We see no unlawfulness or abuse of discretion in the Commission\u2019s informed decision to invite BGE to amend its proposals and to review those amendments at an informal administrative meeting, rather than to require an entirely new proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court, which affirmed the decision of the Public Service Commission. OPC has not clearly shown that the Commission based its decision on an error of law or that the decision was otherwise unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.

Although the Commission has rejected several requests from utilities to approve surcharges to recover costs contemporaneously with improvements, in 2013 the Commission authorized Pepeo, an electric <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>distribution company, to impose a \"tracker\u201d surcharge mechanism to finance accelerated projects to improve grid resiliency. On an appeal resulting from that decision, this Court affirmed the Commission's order without reaching the issue of whether the Commission has exceeded its statutory authority in approving the surcharge, as that issue had not been raised before the Commission. <em>Maryland Office of People's Counsel v.

The opinion does not mention cost recovery during a \"preconstruction planning\u201d phase. OPC\u2019s inaccurate characterization is not based upon the language of the opinion but upon certain testimony from BGE witnesses. Later in the opinion, the Commission specifically clarified that estimated costs \"may not be recovered by the surcharge until BGE has begun making its initial STRIDE replacements,\u201d which we interpret to mean that BGE may not recover the costs until construction work has begun.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b529-7\">.

At the judicial review hearing, the circuit court judge proposed the following hypothetical: \u201cSuppose I said to my granddaughter, \u2018Be quiet while the fudge is made.' \u201d Counsel for OPC replied that \"in that context,\u201d he \"would concede\u201d that the word \"while\u201d is a \"durational term,\u201d which implies that the sentence refers to the time the fudge \u201cis being made.\u201d Much like the word \"while,\u201d the phrase \"at the same time\u201d conveys the duration of the action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b537-7\">. BGE argues that the \"used and useful\u201d component of the \"just and reasonable rate\u201d definition does not prohibit the Commission from authorizing concurrent surcharges before assets are placed in service. BGE points out that \"[t]he meaning and the concept of the words \u2018used and useful in rendering service to the public\u2019 have been held to have a certain elasticity since the phrase first came into use.\u201d <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>McQuaid, 220 </em>Md. 373, 379, 152 A.2d 825 (1959). Thus, even in an ordinary rate case, the rate-setting body might be able to consider certain assets that, although not currently in use, are \"likely to be placed in service within the period for which the rates are fixed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380, 152 A.2d 825. According to BGE, the surcharges approved by the Commission comport with PUA \u00a7 4-101(3) because there is \"some measure of certainty\u201d that the assets not currently in use \u201cwill in fact be coming into use shortly!.]\u201d <em>Bldg.

As a result of our holding that PUA \u00a7 4\u2014210 authorizes a surcharge separate from the ordinary rate setting process, it is unnecessary to decide the extent to which the Commission, pursuant to its ordinary ratemaking powers, may approve contemporaneous surcharges based on cost projections.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b538-6\">. Even where the words of a statute make its meaning clear, courts may consider legislative history and other external manifestations of legislative intent to confirm the correctness of the interpretation. <em>See, e.g., Guttman v.

In its brief, BGE has argued that this Court should not reach the merits of the second question on appeal. BGE contends that any issues related to approval of the 2014 project list are now moot because the Commission failed to take a second \"appeal\u201d after the Commission issued the March 26, 2014, letter order. This argument is misplaced. Order No. 86147, which expressly contemplated further proceedings before the ultimate approval of the surcharge, \"was at least arguably not a final reviewable order without the implementing Letter Order.\u201d <em>Mid-Atlantic Power Supply Ass\u2019n v. Maryland Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>143 Md.App. 419, 458, 795 A.2d 160 (2002). The arguably premature filing of OPC\u2019s petition, however, did not limit the circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction. Because a petition for judicial review is not an \"appeal\u201d but an original action, the time requirements for filing a petition for judicial review are not jurisdictional. <em>Kim v. Comptroller of Treasury, </em>350 Md. 527, 535, 714 A.2d 176 (1998). Consequently, the circuit court had the power to grant appropriate relief from both orders, even if the January 29 order was not a final order for the purpose of judicial review, because the Commission issued the letter order before any proceedings took place in the circuit court. <em>See id. </em>at 534-36, 714 A.2d 176; <em>see also ABF Freight Sys., Inc. v. Gilchrist, </em>125 Md.App. 419, 424-26, 725 A.2d 631 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b542-6\">.
