(\u201cCB Financial\u201d). After the merger agreement was announced, Larry Sutton, appellant, a former shareholder of FedFirst, filed a lawsuit against the two companies. He sought to enjoin the merger, alleging that: (1) FedFirst\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>directors breached fiduciary duties owed to FedFirst\u2019s shareholders; and (2) CB Financial aided and abetted the \u201cbreaches of fiduciary duty in connection with the Proposed Acquisition.\u201d On September 19, 2014, the circuit court dismissed Mr. Sutton\u2019s direct claims with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">On appeal, Mr. Sutton presents one multi-part question for our review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which we have reorganized and reworded, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-6\">1. Did the circuit court err in granting the motion to dismiss the claims against the directors of FedFirst?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">2. Did the circuit court err in granting the motion to dismiss the claims against CB Financial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">CB Financial and FedFirst present an additional question for our review, which we have reworded and rephrased slightly, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-9\">Should this Court dismiss this appeal as moot because the merger between FedFirst and CB Financial, which has now been consummated, cannot be undone, leaving Mr. Sutton with no relief that the Court can order?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the appeal is not moot, and we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Ase\">The Merger Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">On April 15, 2014, FedFirst and CB Financial announced that the two corporations had executed a merger agreement that, if approved by the stockholders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock, would result in the merger of FedFirst and CB Financial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The merger agreement provided that FedFirst shareholders would receive either $23.00 in cash or 1.1590 shares of CB Financial common stock in exchange for each FedFirst share. The FedFirst shareholders could elect to receive cash or stock, or a combination thereof, subject to the requirement in the agreement that 65% of the total shares of FedFirst would be exchanged for CB Financial stock and 35% would be exchanged for cash.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mr. Sutton\u2019s complaint estimated that the value of the merger was approximately $54.5 million dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Pursuant to the merger agreement, FedFirst President and Chief Executive Officer Patrick G. O\u2019Brien would become the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Community Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of CB Financial through which CB Financial conducted its operations. Fed-First directors John J. LaCarte, John M. Swiatek, Richard B. Boyer, and Mr. O\u2019Brien would join the board of directors of CB Financial. The stockholders were advised that some of FedFirst\u2019s officers and directors obtained interests in the merger that were not shared by stockholders generally. For example, all outstanding stock options would be terminated and the holders of the stock options would receive a cash <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>payment equal to the number of shares multiplied by the amount by which $23.00 exceeded the \u201cexercise price\u201d of the stock option. Cash payments for directors included the following: Patrick G. O\u2019Brien (President and CEO) $446,314; Richard B. Boyer (Vice President) $193,958; Jamie L. Prah (Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer) $199,996; Henry B. Brown III (Senior Vice President and Chief Lending Officer) $161,862. Cash payments to all non-employee directors (5 persons) totaled $538,708.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">Moreover, the agreement accelerated the vesting of Fed-First restricted stock awards, resulting in restricted stock awards becoming \u201cfully vested upon the occurrence of a change in control and each share of restricted stock will be converted into 1.1590 shares of CB common stock.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, with respect to Exchange Underwriters, Inc., an insurance agency in which FedFirst owned 80% equity interest and Mr. Boyer owned 20% interest, FedFirst would buy out Mr. Boyer\u2019s 20% interest prior to the closing of the merger, and Mr. Boyer would continue to be employed as Chief Executive Officer of the company following the merger.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The Merger Agreement also included covenants that protected CB Financial\u2019s interests and encouraged the completion of the merger. Initially, FedFirst agreed that it would not initiate, solicit, or knowingly encourage any other acquisition proposals (e.g., a merger or tender offer). The agreement, however, did not preclude FedFirst from considering unsolicit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>ed offers, as long as they were \u201csuperior proposals.\u201d Moreover, FedFirst agreed to promptly</p>\n<blockquote id=\"at-dedup-0\">notify CB of such inquiries, proposals or offers received by, any such information requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with FedFirst or any of its representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms and conditions of any inquiries, proposals or offers.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Finally, \u201cin order to induce CB to enter into this Agreement, and to reimburse CB for incurring the costs and expenses related to entering into this Agreement and consummating the transactions contemplated,\u201d the agreement included a termination fee of $2,750,000, which FedFirst agreed to pay in the event that it terminated the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The S-4 Registration Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">On June 13, 2014, CB Financial filed a Registration Statement (Form S-4) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d). On July 28, 2014, CB Financial filed an amended S-4 with the SEC (hereinafter \u201cthe S-4\u201d), which was more than 300 pages long and included a plethora of information about the companies and the proposed merger. It included, <em>inter alia, </em>the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-8\">\u2022 A letter to stockholders of FedFirst explaining the proposed transaction and advising that the approval of the merger agreement required the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Fed-First common stock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-9\">\u2022 A summary providing a description of the two companies and the highlights of the merger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>\u2022 A detailed discussion of the risks associated with the merger (e.g., the price of CB Financial stock may decrease after the merger, and/or \u201cFedFirst stockholders will have reduced ownership and voting interest after the merger\u201d) and risks related to CB Financial (e.g., \u201cChanges in interest rates may reduce CB\u2019s profits and impair asset values\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-4\">\u2022 Selected historical financial information for both companies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-5\">\u2022 A description of the special meeting of the stockholders during which the stockholders would vote on the merger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The S \u2014 4 also included a detailed chronological account of the negotiation of the merger. It explained that, in January 2013, Patrick G. O\u2019Brien, President and Chief Executive Officer, of FedFirst, met with Barron P. McCune, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of CB, at Mr. McCune\u2019s invitation, to discuss a possible business combination of their two institutions. No price or other terms were discussed at this meeting. In February 2013, Mr. O\u2019Brien and Mr. LaCarte met with FedFirst\u2019s financial advisor, Mufson Howe Hunter, \u201cto examine the current [Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (\u201cM &amp; A\u201d) ] market in the bank and thrift industry and review the financial characteristics of a possible business combination between CB and FedFirst.\u201d In March, the FedFirst board of directors discussed the issue and \u201cobserved that there were many compelling strategic business reasons for a combination with CB, including their complementary market areas and similar corporate cultures.\u201d FedFirst did not, however, pursue a transaction with CB or any other company at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"ab-dedup-0\">In August, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">[T]he FedFirst board of directors met to discuss its strategic alternatives. Representatives of Mufson Howe Hunter were present at the meeting, as was a representative of Kilpatrick Townsend <em>&amp; </em>Stockton LLP, outside legal counsel to FedFirst. Representatives of Mufson Howe Hunter reviewed with the directors bank and thrift stock market trends; compared key balance sheet and profitability met<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>rics of FedFirst to those of comparable companies in Pennsylvania; examined FedFirst\u2019s historical and projected financial performance; provided an update on the M &amp; A market in the bank and thrift industry; reviewed with the directors the financial characteristics of a possible business combination between CB and FedFirst; and identified potential acquirers of FedFirst, evaluated their likely interest, and analyzed their capacity to pay based on certain transaction assumptions. Legal counsel reviewed with the directors their fiduciary duties in the context of a business combination with another company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">In September, the FedFirst board of directors \u201cauthorized Mufson Howe Hunter to contact three selected parties regarding their interest in a possible business combination with FedFirst.\u201d It \u201cdetermined that the business risks resulting from awareness in the local banking community of FedFirst\u2019s interest in a business combination outweighed the benefit of contacting additional companies that were unlikely to have the interest or ability to complete a transaction with FedFirst.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Amh\">By October, FedFirst had received responses from each of the three companies. The first company (Bank A) initially indicated that it had an interest in acquiring FedFirst, but by November, Bank A lost interest in pursuing a merger with FedFirst. Because \u201cnone of the other parties considered by FedFirst were likely to be more interested in a business combination with FedFirst than CB, FedFirst decided to restart discussions with CB.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">After further discussions with CB Financial, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">On February 14, 2014, CB provided FedFirst with a nonbinding letter of interest for a business combination between the two companies. CB proposed the merger of FedFirst into CB valued at $21.80 per share of FedFirst common stock, with the exchange of 65% of the outstanding shares of FedFirst common stock for shares of CB common stock and the remaining 35% exchanged for cash. CB conditioned the transaction on FedFirst purchasing from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Mr. Boyer his 20% minority interest in Exchange Underwriters prior to closing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">On February 27, 2014, FedFirst delivered its mark-up of the letter of interest and communicated its view on the value of the merger consideration, which was that the merger consideration should be increased to a value of $23.00 per share. On March 6, 2014, CB agreed to increase the value of the merger consideration to $23.00 per share, and on March 7, 2014 delivered a revised letter of interest..... During the course of negotiations, the parties also discussed the method of calculating the exchange ratio and agreed that the exchange ratio would be determined at the time of signing the definitive merger agreement by dividing $23.00 by the volume-weighted average price of CB common stock over the prior 20 trading-day period. CB did not agree to FedFirst\u2019s request to reduce the termination fee from 5% of the transaction value to 4% of the transaction value, but did agree to make the termination fee reciprocal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The directors discussed the proposal and consulted with legal counsel. They ultimately voted to accept the letter of interest, and the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">On March 28, 2014, Luse Gorman Pomerenk <em>&amp; </em>Schick, PC, special counsel for CB delivered an initial draft of the merger agreement. Over the ensuing days, the parties negotiated the terms of the merger agreement and ancillary documents. In particular, the parties negotiated the various representations and warranties to be made by each of them, the terms of the covenants that restrict the activities of the parties pending completion of the merger, including the \u201cno-shop\u201d provision that restricts the ability of FedFirst to seek alternative transaction proposals, the treatment of various employee benefit plans and agreements, and the expense limitation on director and officer liability insurance. The parties also discussed the details with respect to the composition of CB\u2019s board of directors following the merger, agreed that CB would take action to amend its articles of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>incorporation to eliminate pre-emptive rights in connection with future share issuances, worked out the details with respect to the purchase of the minority interest in Exchange Underwriters, and agreed that the listing of CB common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market would be a condition to closing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">On April 14, 2014, the FedFirst board of directors met to consider the merger agreement. Representatives of Mufson Howe Hunter presented a financial analysis of the transaction and gave its opinion that \u201cthe consideration to be received by the stockholders of FedFirst under the merger agreement [was] fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of FedFirst common stock.\u201d The board of directors then unanimously approved the definitive merger agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">That same day, on April 14, 2014, the CB Financial board of directors unanimously approved the definitive merger agreement, and the merger agreement was executed by officers of FedFirst and CB Financial. A joint press release was issued, announcing the execution of the merger agreement and the terms of the merger.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">After providing the events leading to the merger, the S-4 set forth a discussion of FedFirst\u2019s reasons for the merger, stating that the FedFirst board of directors \u201cunanimously determined that the merger agreement [was] in the best interests of FedFirst and its shareholders.\u201d The S-4 listed a number of factors considered, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">\u2022 [the Board\u2019s] belief that the merger will result in a stronger commercial banking franchise with a diversified revenue stream, strong capital ratios, a well-balanced loan portfolio and an attractive funding base that has the potential to deliver a higher value to FedFirst\u2019s shareholders as compared to continuing to operate as a stand-alone entity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-9\">\u2022 the expanded possibilities, including organic growth and future acquisitions, that would be available to the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>bined company, given its larger size, asset base, capital, market capitalization and footprint;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-4\">\u2022 [ ] that the value of the merger consideration for holders of FedFirst common stock at $28.00 per share, represents a premium of 15% over the $20.06 closing price of Fed-First common stock on NASDAQ on April 10, 2014, which is the most recent date on which FedFirst common stock traded prior to April 14, 2014;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-5\">\u2022 [the opinion of the independent financial advisor that the merger consideration was fair];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">\u2022 [ ] that the merger consideration consists of a combination of CB common stock and cash and that FedFirst shareholders will be given the opportunity to elect the form of consideration that they wish to receive, giving FedFirst shareholders the opportunity to participate as stockholders of CB in the benefits of the combination and the future performance of the combined company generally;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">\u2022 [ ] that upon completion of the merger FedFirst shareholders will own approximately 42% of the outstanding shares of the combined company;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-8\">\u2022 the perceived limited opportunities for a strategic partnership with another financial institution, at a similar or higher price, having characteristics that would achieve the benefits for FedFirst stockholders that the board believes will be achieved through the merger with CB; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-9\">\u2022 the equity interest in the combined company that Fed-First\u2019s existing shareholders will receive in the merger, which allows such shareholders to continue to participate in the future success of the combined company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">The S-4 contained further information, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>\u2022 A summary of the Fairness Opinion provided by Mufson Howe Hunter &amp; Company LLC, FedFirst\u2019s financial ad-visor, including the financial data upon which Mufson Howe Hunter relied to render its opinion (the full text of the Fairness Opinion was attached to the end of the S-4).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">\u2022 A description of the consideration stockholders would receive in the merger, including detailed hypothetical examples regarding how the two types of consideration (cash and stocks) would be apportioned based on the potential elections of FedFirst stockholders.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">\u2022 A section discussing the \u201cInterests of Certain Persons in the Merger that are Different from Yours,\u201d which described the unique benefits received by FedFirst\u2019s officers and directors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">\u2022 A discussion of the management of CB Financial and the roles of FedFirst\u2019s officers and directors after the merger, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>including detailed information about compensation and benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-5\">\u2022 The Agreement and Merger Agreement (provided in full in Annex A of the S-4).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">On April 21, 2014, Mr. Sutton filed a class action and derivative lawsuit against FedFirst, its seven individual directors, and CB Financial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Mr. Sutton asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\">In any situation where the directors of a publicly traded corporation undertake a transaction that will result in either a change in corporate control or a break-up of the corporation\u2019s assets, the directors have an affirmative fiduciary obligation to act in the best interests of the company\u2019s shareholders, including the duty to obtain maximum value under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">He alleged that the individual directors</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJd\">violated, and are violating, the fiduciary duties they owe to [Mr. Sutton] and the other public shareholders of FedFirst, including their duty of candor and duty to maximize shareholder value. As a result of the Individual Defendants\u2019 divided loyalties, [Mr. Sutton] will not receive adequate, fair or maximum value for their FedFirst common stock in the Proposed Acquisition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">Mr. Sutton also alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that the deal included \u201cpreclusive deal mechanisms which effectively discourage other bidders from making successful topping bids,\u201d and \u201cthe Proposed Acquisition will allow CB Financial to purchase FedFirst at an unfairly low price while availing itself of FedFirst\u2019s significant value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">The first count of the amended complaint alleged a breach of fiduciary duty against the individual defendants. It asserted that the directors had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>initiated a process to sell FedFirst that undervalues the Company and vests them with benefits that are not shared equally by FedFirst\u2019s public shareholders. In addition, by agreeing to the Proposed Acquisition, Defendants have capped the price of FedFirst at a price that does not adequately reflect the Company\u2019s true value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Mr. Sutton sought to have the court enjoin the vote on the merger, stating that the plaintiff had no adequate remedy at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The second count alleged that CB Financial and FedFirst aided and abetted the individual directors\u2019 breach of fiduciary duty. In that regard, it alleged that CB Financial \u201cknowingly assisted the Individual Defendants\u2019 breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with the Proposed Acquisition, which, without such aid, would not have occurred,\u201d and as a result, Mr. Sutton \u201cwill be damaged in that [he has] been and will be prevented from obtaining a fair price for [his] shares.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The third count sought declaratory relief. Mr. Sutton requested a declaration that: (1) the vote should be enjoined, (2) the proposed acquisition was unlawful and unenforceable and the merger agreement \u201cand/or the transactions contemplated thereby, should be rescinded and the parties returned to their original position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">In the Prayer for Relief, the amended complaint stated, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands injunctive relief, in his favor and in favor of the Class, and against the Defendants, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-9\">A. Declaring that this action is properly maintainable as a class action, certifying Plaintiff as Class representative and certifying his counsel as class counsel and derivative counsel;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-10\">B. Declaring and decreeing that the Proposed Acquisition was entered into in breach of the fiduciary duties of the Individual Defendants and is therefore unlawful and unenforceable, and rescinding and invalidating any merger agreement or other agreements that Defendants entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>into in connection with, or in furtherance of, the Proposed Acquisition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-4\">C. Preliminarily and permanently enjoining Defendants, their agents, counsel, employees and all persons acting in concert with them from consummating the Proposed Acquisition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\">D. Directing the Individual Defendants to exercise their fiduciary duties to obtain a transaction that is in the best interests of FedFirst\u2019s shareholders;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">E. Imposing a constructive trust, in favor of Plaintiff and the Class, upon any benefits improperly received by Defendants as a result of their wrongful conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">F. Awarding Plaintiff the costs and disbursements of this action, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 and experts\u2019 fees; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-8\">G. Granting such other and further equitable relief as this Court may deem just and proper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">On June, 19 and 20, 2014, FedFirst (the company and the individual directors) and CB Financial, respectively, filed motions to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. FedFirst provided five arguments in its motion: (1) Mr. Sutton lacked standing to bring a direct claim against Fed-First\u2019s Board for breach of fiduciary duties; (2) Mr. Sutton failed to overcome the business judgment rule; (3) Mr. Sutton\u2019s allegations of omissions in the Registration Statement failed to meet Maryland\u2019s materiality standard; (4) the Fed-First Board was under no duty to maximize shareholder value; and (5) to the extent that Mr. Sutton alleged that FedFirst aided and abetted the individual directors\u2019 alleged breaches of fiduciary duties, Mr. Sutton failed to adequately allege any elements of an aiding and abetting claim against FedFirst.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> CB Financial reiterated some of FedFirst\u2019s arguments in its motion, and it argued that, even if there was a breach of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>fiduciary duty by the directors of FedFirst, Mr. Sutton had not alleged any specific facts from which it could be inferred that CB Financial \u201cknowingly participated\u201d in such a breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">On July 29, 2014, after CB Financial filed the S-4 with the SEC, Mr. Sutton filed an amended complaint, adding the allegation that the S-4 \u201comits material information about the Proposed Acquisition that must be disclosed to FedFirst\u2019s shareholders to enable them to make a fully informed decision.\u201d On August 12, 2014, FedFirst filed an amended motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">On September 2, 2014, Mr. Sutton voluntarily dismissed his derivative claim, leaving only his direct claim. On September 17, 2014, Mr. Sutton filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, requesting that the court enjoin FedFirst from holding a shareholder vote on the proposed merger. On September 18, 2014, the court heard argument on the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss. In an order dated September 19, 2014, the circuit court dismissed Mr. Sutton\u2019s direct claims, with prejudice. On October 17, 2014, Mr. Sutton filed a Notice of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">On January 14, 2015, the circuit court issued its Memorandum Opinion. The court explained that it was granting the motions to dismiss for the following reasons: (1) Mr. Sutton \u201cfailed to assert a direct injury necessary to bring [a] direct claim\u201d because he \u201cfailed to demonstrate how the alleged injury [was] \u2018separate and distinct\u2019 from that suffered from other shareholders\u201d; (2) <em>Shenker v. Laureate Education, Inc., </em>411 Md. 317, 983 A.2d 408 (2009), \u201conly applies in the limited context of a cash-out merger that will result in a change of control, which [was] not contemplated by the Proposed Transaction,\u201d and therefore, the case does not provide Mr. Sutton with a direct cause of action against the FedFirst Board for breach of common law duties of candor and maximization of shareholder value; (3) even if Mr. Sutton could maintain his direct claim against the FedFirst Board, his allegations were insufficient to rebut the presumptions afforded to the directors by the business judgment rule; (4) \u201cthe alleged omissions in the Registration Statement are wholly immaterial\u201d; and (5) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Mr. Sutton \u201cfailed to allege an underlying breach of fiduciary duty,\u201d and therefore, his \u201caiding and abetting claims fail as a matter of law.\u201d On January 15, 2015, Mr. Sutton filed an amended notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Post-Dismissal Events</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Mr. Sutton did not move to stay the merger pending his appeal, and the parties have represented that, on October 31, 2014, FedFirst and CB Financial completed the merger.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On November 7, 2014, CB Financial filed a motion to dismiss the appeal as moot, arguing that, \u201cbecause the merger has now occurred, there is no relief that this Court can order, rendering [Mr.] Sutton\u2019s appeal moot.\u201d On November 10, 2014, FedFirst filed a similar motion to dismiss, arguing that Mr. Sutton \u201cdid not move to stay the Circuit Court\u2019s order,\u201d the merger has already been completed, \u201cFedFirst ceased to exist as an entity,\u201d \u201cthe consideration has been distributed to FedFirst shareholders,\u201d and therefore, Mr. Sutton\u2019s \u201cappeal is moot because there is no effective remedy which this Court can provide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">On November, 21, 2014, Mr. Sutton filed an opposition to the motions to dismiss, arguing that the \u201cconsummation of the merger does not make it impossible for the trial court to grant the relief requested.\u201d He argued that, even if the merger could not be undone, he \u201cmade clear in his complaint that he would seek damages that he ... suffered as a result of Defendants\u2019 conduct.\u201d In an order filed on December 16, 2014, this Court denied appellees\u2019 motions with leave to seek that relief in their briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Additional facts will be discussed as necessary in the discussion that follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Mootness</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">Before addressing the merits of Mr. Sutton\u2019s claims, we address appellees\u2019 argument in their initial motions, and reiterated in their briefs, that this case should be dismissed because it is moot. \u201cA case is moot when there is no longer an existing controversy when the case comes before the Court or when there is no longer an effective remedy the Court could grant.\u201d <em>Prince George\u2019s Cnty. v. Columcille Bldg. Corp., </em>219 Md.App. 19, 26, 98 A.3d 1043 (2014) (quoting <em>Suter v. Stuckey, </em>402 Md. 211, 219, 935 A.2d 731 (2007)). \u201cThis Court does not give advisory opinions; thus, we generally dismiss moot actions without a decision on the merits.\u201d <em>Green v. Nassif, </em>401 Md. 649, 655, 934 A.2d 22 (2007) (quoting <em>Dep\u2019t of Human Res., Child Care Admin. v. Roth, </em>398 Md. 137, 143, 919 A.2d 1217 (2007)). \u201cIn rare instances, however, we \u2018may address the merits of a moot case if we are convinced that the case presents unresolved issues in matters of important public concern that, if decided, will establish a rule for future conduct.\u2019\u201d <em>Roth, </em>398 Md. at 143-44, 919 A.2d 1217 (quoting <em>Coburn v. Coburn, </em>342 Md. 244, 250, 674 A.2d 951 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Appellees argue that this Court \u201cshould dismiss this appeal as moot because the only meaningful relief sought by the amended complaint \u2014 enjoining the merger \u2014 cannot be granted because the merger has already occurred and cannot be unwound.\u201d They assert: \u201cFedFirst\u2019s Merger into CB Financial was finalized in October 2014 and the proceeds have been distributed to the shareholders. There is nothing more that this Court can do, other than find that the appeal is moot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">If Mr. Sutton\u2019s sole claim for relief was to enjoin the merger, we would agree that the appeal was moot. In that regard, <em>National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Tucker, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>300 Md. 156, 476 A.2d 1160 (1984), is instructive. In <em>Tucker, </em>two students of Johns Hopkins University filed a complaint and motion for injunction against the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), arguing that, pursuant to the NCAA\u2019s bylaws, they had not \u201cused up one of their four seasons of eligibility for intercollegiate competition by participating in Fall lacrosse scrimmages prior to transferring to Hopkins.\u201d 300 Md. at 157, 476 A.2d 1160. The circuit court granted the students\u2019 motion for an injunction, ordering the NCAA to allow them to play for the remainder of the season. <em>Id. </em>at 158, 476 A.2d 1160. The NCAA noted an appeal, but by the time the case was heard by the Court, the season had ended. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal, stating: \u201c[S]imply put, the season is over. Accordingly, because the only question before us is the appropriateness of the issuance of the interlocutory injunction, we hold that the appeal is moot.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 159, 476 A.2d 1160.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">Other cases reiterate the rule that, once the act sought to be enjoined has occurred, any appeal of the issue is moot. <em>See Hagerstown Reprod. Health Servs. v. Fritz, </em>295 Md. 268, 271, 454 A.2d 846 (appeal from injunction prohibiting abortion moot where abortion performed), <em>cert. denied, </em>463 U.S. 1208, 103 S.Ct. 3538, 77 L.Ed.2d 1389 (1983); <em>Banner v. Home Sales Co. D., </em>201 Md. 425, 428, 94 A.2d 264 (1953) (\u201c[T]he general rule is \u2018that the court should confine itself to the particular relief sought in the case before it, and refrain from deciding abstract, moot questions of law which may remain after that relief has ceased to be possible.\u201d) (quoting <em>Montgomery Cnty. v. Maryland-Washington Metro. Dist., </em>200 Md. 525, 530-31, 92 A.2d 350 (1952)).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">In <em>Brill v. General Industrial Enterprises, Inc., </em>234 F.2d 465 (3d Cir.1956), the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit addressed an issue similar to the one presented here. In that case, stockholders of a corporation sought to enjoin a shareholder vote on the sale of the corporation\u2019s physical assets, asserting that the sale price was inadequate. <em>Id. </em>at 467. The trial court dismissed the complaint, and the sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 468. The appellate court dismissed the appeal, explaining that \u201can appeal from a decree dismissing a complaint seeking an injunction, or refusing to grant an injunction, will not disturb the operative effect of such a decree, and where the act sought to be restrained has been performed, the appellate courts will deny review on the ground of mootness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Mr. Sutton recognizes these mootness principles. He concedes that he \u201ccan no longer enjoin the Stockholders\u2019 vote on the Transaction or the Closing,\u201d but he contends that the case is not moot because \u201cthe trial court can order the unwinding of the merger transaction or grant other relief ... if the case is remanded.\u201d With respect to such \u201cother relief,\u201d Mr. Sutton asserts that, although \u201crescission of the [transaction (versus rescissory damages) is admittedly unlikely, it is plausible that, on remand, [he] will convince the Circuit Court to \u2018impose a constructive trust,\u2019 \u201d in his favor \u201cupon any benefits improperly received by [appellees] as a result of their wrongful conduct.\u201d He further asserts that, although no monetary damages claims appear in the <em>ad damnum </em>section of the complaint, there was \u201cexplicit reference to [his] claim of damages\u201d throughout the complaint, and on remand, the court has \u201cthe power ... to allow an award of money in the form of compensatory damages and/or rescissory damages for [a]ppellant\u2019s direct injury.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">Unwinding the Merger</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">With respect to the argument that this case is not moot because the circuit court on remand could \u201cunwind\u201d the merger between FedFirst and CB Financial, Mr. Sutton raised this contention in his response to appellees\u2019 initial motion to dismiss the appeal, which he adopts by reference in his brief. In his brief, he concedes that this relief \u201cis admittedly unlikely,\u201d but he has not abandoned the claim, so we will address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Mr. Sutton contends that, in his complaint, he requested that the court rescind the merger agreement. Accordingly, he contends his claim to rescind the agreement, and therefore any resulting merger, preserves a remedy precluding this court from dismissing this case as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Neither party cites any Maryland case addressing whether, or under what circumstances, a court can \u201cunwind\u201d a completed corporate merger. Accordingly, we look to other courts for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Delaware courts addressing this issue repeatedly have held that, once a merger is consummated, it generally is impracticable for it to be undone.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> For example, in <em>McMillan v. Intercargo Corporation, </em>768 A.2d 492, 500 (Del.Ch.2000), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Delaware Court of Chancery stated: \u201cHaving unsuccessfully attempted to obtain an injunction against the consummation of the merger, the metaphorical merger eggs have been scrambled. Under our case law, it is generally accepted that a completed merger cannot, as a practical matter, be unwound.\u201d Similarly, in <em>In re Lukens Inc. Shareholders Litigation, </em>757 A.2d 720, 728 (Del.Ch.1999), <em>aff'd sub nom. Walker v. Lukens, Inc., </em>757 A.2d 1278 (Del.2000), the court explained: \u201c[Plaintiffs\u2019 demand for rescission of the transaction is plainly futile. ... [I]t goes without saying that at this juncture it is \u2018impossible to unscramble the eggs.\u2019 Money damages [are] the only possible form of relief available.\u201d <em>Accord Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., </em>457 A.2d 701, 714 (Del.1983) (concluding that a \u201clong completed\u201d cash-out merger was \u201ctoo involved to undo\u201d); <em>Coggins v. New England Patriots Football Club, Inc., </em>397 Mass. 525, 492 N.E.2d 1112, 1119 (1986) (rescission of a merger is inequitable and not feasible where the merger had long been completed and \u201cthe interests of the corporation and of the plaintiffs will be furthered best by limiting the plaintiffs\u2019 remedy to an assessment of damages\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Based on this case law, it is clear that the unwinding of a long-ago completed corporate merger generally is not practicable. Although that determination, in some cases, would be one for the trial court, several appellate courts have concluded, on the facts of the case, that rescission is not a viable remedy. <em>See Bank of New York Co. v. Northeast Bancorp, Inc., </em>9 F.3d 1065, 1066 (2d Cir.1993); <em>Coggins, </em>492 N.E.2d at 1119. We similarly conclude here. In light of the representation that the agreement involved a 54.5 million dollar merger, with more than two million shares of publicly traded stock and an integration of corporate management, that occurred almost a year ago, we hold that rescission is not a potential remedy that would preclude a finding that the appeal is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Rescissory Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Although rescission is not practicable, there is a possibility that, if Mr. Sutton prevailed on his claim, he could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>awarded rescissory damages. In <em>In re Orchard Enterprises, Inc. Stockholder Litig., </em>88 A.3d 1, 38 (Del.Ch.2014), the Court of Chancery of Delaware explained: \u201cRescissory damages are \u2018the monetary equivalent of rescission\u2019 and may be awarded where \u2018the equitable remedy of rescission is impractical.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Strassburger v. Earley, </em>752 A.2d 557, 579-81 (Del.Ch.2000)). <em>Accord Cinerama, Inc. v. Technicolor, Inc., </em>663 A.2d 1134, 1144 (Del.Ch.1994), <em>aff'd, </em>663 A.2d 1156 (Del.1995). The court explained: \u201c[T]he <em>Weinberger </em>court held that when a merger has been successfully challenged, the possible forms of monetary relief include an out-of-pocket measure of damages equal to what a stockholder would have received in an appraisal, <em>viz., </em>the fair value of the stockholder\u2019s shares.\u201d <em>Orchard Enter., </em>88 A.3d at 40. Because rescissory damages in lieu of actual rescission is a possible form of relief if Mr. Sutton were to prevail on his claims, we hold that this case is not moot. Accordingly, we proceed to address Mr. Sutton\u2019s claims on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Substantive Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Mr. Sutton contends that the circuit court erred in granting the motions to dismiss filed by FedFirst and CB Financial. We will address the claims with respect to each of the appellees separately. Before doing so, however, we will address the proper standard of review of a motion to dismiss and discuss generally shareholder lawsuits against corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\"> \u201cA trial court may grant a motion to dismiss if, when assuming the truth of all well-pled facts and allegations in the complaint and any inferences that may be drawn, and viewing those facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, \u2018the allegations do not state a cause of action for which relief may be granted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Latty v.

CA \u00a7 2-405.1(a) provides that directors must perform their duties in good faith in a manner that he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation, and \u201c[w]ith the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> These duties, however, are \u201cto the corporation and not, at least directly, to the shareholders.\u201d <em>Werbowsky, </em>362 Md. at 599, 766 A.2d 123.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Because director fiduciary duties relating to management do not extend to shareholders, a shareholder generally does not have a direct action against the directors, and any action taken against the directors requires the shareholder to file a derivative action. <em>Wasserman, </em>197 Md.App. at 609-10, 14 A.3d 1193. As the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Waller v. Waller, </em>187 Md. 185, 189-90, 49 A.2d 449 (1946):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>It is a general rule that an action at law to recover damages for an injury to a corporation can be brought only in the name of the corporation itself acting through its directors, and not by an individual stockholder, though the injury may incidentally result in diminishing or destroying the value of the stock. The reason for this rule is that the cause of action for injury to the property of a corporation or for impairment or destruction of its business is in the corporation, and such an injury, although it may diminish the value of the capital stock, is not primarily or necessarily a damage to the stockholder, and hence the stockholder\u2019s derivative right can be asserted only through the corporation. The rule is advantageous not only because it avoids a multiplicity of suits by the various stockholders, but also because any damages so recovered will be available for the payment of debts of the corporation, and, if any surplus remains, for distribution to the stockholders in proportion to the number of shares held by each.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The Court of Appeals has explained a shareholder\u2019s derivative action as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">\u201cThe nature of the derivative proceeding is two-fold. First, it is the equivalent of a suit by the shareholders to compel the corporation to sue. Second, it is [a] suit by the corporation, asserted by the shareholder on its behalf, against those liable to it. The corporation is the real party in interest and the shareholder is only a nominal plaintiff. The substantive claim belongs to the corporation.... The proceeding is typically brought by a minority shareholder, because a majority or controlling shareholder can usually persuade the corporation to sue in its own name.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-7\"><em>Werbowsky, </em>362 Md. at 599, 766 A.2d 123 (quoting 13 William Meade Fletcher et al., <em>Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations </em>\u00a7 5941.10 (1995 Rev.

That the plaintiff suffered his or her injury in common with all other shareholders is not determinative of whether the injury suffered is direct or indirect. <em>See Tooley v.

The Court rejected the argument that, pursuant to CA \u00a7 2-405.1, shareholder claims against directors for breaches of fiduciary duty may be pursued only by a derivative action. <em>Id. </em>at 335-36, 983 A.2d 408. The Court agreed with <em>Shenker\u2019s </em>argument that, although \u00a7 2-405.1 addresses duties involving the management of the business of the corporation, such as the decision whether a corporation should be sold, which are enforceable only by the corporation, there are additional common law duties that are triggered once a decision to sell the corporation has been made that are personal to the shareholders and give a direct cause of action to the shareholders. <em>Id. </em>at 337, 983 A.2d 408. The Court of Appeals held that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">where corporate directors exercise non-managerial duties outside the scope of \u00a7 2-405.1(a), such as negotiating the price that shareholders will receive for their shares in a cash-out merger transaction, <em>after the decision to sell the corporation already has been made, </em>they remain liable directly to shareholders for any breach of those fiduciary duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 328-29, 983 A.2d 408 (emphasis added). The Court held that, \u201cin a cash-out merger transaction where the decision to sell the corporation already has been made, shareholders may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>pursue direct claims against directors for breach of then-fiduciary duties of candor and maximization of shareholder value.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 342, 983 A.2d 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The Scope of <em>Shenker</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">The argument in the parties\u2019 briefs primarily addresses the significance of the holding in <em>Shenker. </em>Indeed, FedFirst states that \u201c[t]his appeal turns on whether the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Shenker </em>applies to this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">The circuit court similarly relied on <em>Shenker. </em>In granting the motion to dismiss, the court agreed with Mr. Sutton \u201cthat under <em>Shenker </em>a shareholder may, under certain circumstances, bring direct claims against a corporation\u2019s board of directors for breaches of common law duties of candor and maximization of shareholder consideration.\u201d The court concluded, however, that Mr. Sutton\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2\">reliance on <em>Shenker </em>is misguided. <em>Shenker </em>only applies in the limited context of a cash-out merger that will result in a change of control, which is not contemplated by the Proposed Transaction. <em>Shenker </em>does not permit individual shareholders to bring direct claims against corporate directors for breaches of these common law duties in a non-cash-out merger transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>In support of its conclusion that the Court intended to so limit its holding, the circuit court pointed to footnote 3 in the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion in <em>Shenker, </em>finding that the footnote \u201cexpressly distinguish[ed] a cash-out merger from a traditional stock-for-stock merger.\u201d Accordingly, the court determined that Mr. Sutton did not have a claim against FedFirst, or CB Financial for aiding and abetting, with regard to a breach of the common law duties of candor and maximization of shareholder value.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Mr. Sutton argues that the circuit court\u2019s conclusion in this regard was erroneous. He asserts that the court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACA\">erroneously held that directors of publicly traded Maryland corporations owe no common law fiduciary or other duty to maximize stockholder value and no common law fiduciary duty of candor directly to the stockholders when considering, negotiating and then recommending to the stockholders the sale of their company at a particular dollar value per share when any of the consideration those stockholders will receive for their personal property in the sale is in the form of stock in the acquiring entity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">He contends that, once the directors make the decision that the company is for sale, they act, not only as a director engaged in managing the business of the unsold corporation, but also as an agent trustee, with the non-managerial common law duty to maximize shareholder value and to disclose all material information regarding how maximization was pursued. Mr. Sutton contends that the circuit court erred in deciding that a direct action can be brought by a shareholder only \u201cif 100% of the consideration the stockholders of the target company will receive consists of cash.\u201d He asserts that, although the Court in <em>Shenker </em>\u201cdiscussed its holding numerous times in the context of the facts[,] where the consideration was all cash, in other statements, <em>Shenker </em>expressly did not restrict its holding to cash-out transactions.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>FedFirst argues that <em>\u201cShenker </em>does not apply to this case,\u201d and therefore, \u201cthe FedFirst Board owed no duty of candor above or apart from their statutory fiduciary duties under the Maryland General Corporation Law.\u201d It asserts that the circuit court \u201ccorrectly held that the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Shenker </em>applied only in the limited context of a cash-out merger that resulted in a change of control, and that the [m]erger in this case was not a cash-out merger and there was no change in control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">Given the parties\u2019 contentions, it is clear that a thorough analysis of the decision in <em>Shenker </em>is warranted. In that case, shareholders of Laureate Education, Inc. (\u201cLaureate\u201d), a publicly-held Maryland corporation, challenged a cash-out merger transaction between Laureate and several private equity investors. <em>Shenker, </em>411 Md. at 326, 983 A.2d 408. The Court described the mechanics of the transaction in issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay\">Laureate announced on 3 June 2007 that it accepted an increased offer from Investor Respondents to acquire Laureate at a price of $62 per share by way of a tender offer and second-step (or \u201cshort-form\u201d) merger, a process where<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>by Investor Respondents would purchase, at a price per share equal to the offer price, a number of newly issued shares of Laureate\u2019s common stock sufficient to provide the Investor Respondents with ownership of one share more than 90% of the total shares outstanding and then, by virtue of their 90% ownership, convert all remaining shares of Laureate\u2019s common stock into the right to receive the same price paid per share in the tender offer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 331, 983 A.2d 408.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Several shareholders objected to the deal and filed a direct lawsuit against Laureate\u2019s board of directors, arguing that the directors breached their fiduciary duties owed to the plaintiff shareholders, and the private investors aided and abetted the directors. <em>Id. </em>at 330-32, 983 A.2d 408. The circuit court granted Laureate\u2019s motion to dismiss on the ground that CA \u00a7 2-405.1(g) prevented a direct action against the corporate directors for alleged violations of fiduciary duties, stating that the directors\u2019 duties are owed only to the corporation.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Shenker, </em>411 Md. at 332, 983 A.2d 408. This Court affirmed, \u201cholding that directors of Maryland corporations owe no common law fiduciary duties directly to their shareholders and that, in a cash-out merger transaction, any claims shareholders may have against directors for breach of fiduciary duties must be brought derivatively on behalf of the corporation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 333, 983 A.2d 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The Court of Appeals reversed. <em>Id. </em>at 354, 983 A.2d 408. Although it agreed that CA \u00a7 2-405.1(a) \u201cgoverns the duty of care owed by directors when they undertake managerial decisions on behalf of the corporation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 338, 983 A.2d 408, it disagreed that \u00a7 2-405.1(a) was the sole source of duties owed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>by corporate directors, <em>id. </em>at 335, 983 A.2d 408. The Court held \u201cthat \u00a7 2-405.1(a) does not provide the sole source of directorial duties, and that other, common law fiduciary duties of directors remain in place and may be triggered by the occurrence of appropriate events.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 339, 983 A.2d 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">The question presented in this case is what constitutes \u201cappropriate events\u201d that trigger common law duties of directors to shareholders. This is important because a critical factor in determining whether a shareholder has a direct, as opposed to a derivative, action against the directors is whether there is a duty to the shareholder individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">We previously have explained that <em>Shenker </em>has \u201ca narrow application.\u201d <em>Wasserman, </em>197 Md.App. at 620, 14 A.3d 1193. FedFirst agrees, but it argues that <em>Shenker\u2019s </em>holding regarding the common law duties of directors to stockholders is limited to one situation, i.e., a cash-out merger. We disagree that the decision is so limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">To be sure, the specific holding of <em>Shenker </em>was confined to the facts of the case, \u201ca cash-out merger transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 336, 983 A.2d 408. The language in <em>Shenker </em>as a whole, however, indicates that the principles set forth were not limited to that specific factual scenario.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Instead, the Court held that the common law fiduciary duty of directors \u201cmay be triggered by the occurrence of appropriate events.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 339, 983 A.2d 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">In discussing the events that would trigger common law duties that give rise to a direct stockholder action, the Court focused on the scenario where corporate directors act outside their typical managerial duties after the decision is made to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>sell the corporation. In determining that CA \u00a7 2-405.1 did not control in that case, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-4\">When directors undertake to negotiate a price that shareholders will receive in the context of a cash-out merger transaction, however, they assume a different role than solely \u201cmanaging the business and affairs of the corporation.\u201d Duties concerning the management of the corporation\u2019s affairs change after the decision is made to sell the corporation. <em>See Revlon, Inc. v. MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings, Inc., </em>506 A.2d 173, 182 (Del.1986) (noting that, once sale became inevitable, \u201c[t]he directors\u2019 role changed from defenders of the corporate bastion to auctioneers charged with getting the best price for the stockholders at a sale of the company\u201d). Beyond that point, in negotiating a share price that shareholders will receive in a cash-out merger, directors act as fiduciaries on behalf of the shareholders. As a result of the confidence and trust reposed in them during the price negotiation, their ability to affect significantly the financial interests of the shareholders, and the inherent conflict of interest that arises between directors and shareholders in any change-of-control situation, the common law imposes on those directors duties to maximize shareholder value and make full disclosure of all material facts concerning the merger to the shareholders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-5\"><em>Skenker, </em>411 Md. at 338-39, 983 A.2d 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The Court of Appeals noted that its decision was consistent with the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Revlon, Inc. v. MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings, Inc., </em>506 A.2d 173 (Del.1986). The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">In that case, the Delaware Supreme Court held that, where it is clear that the board has determined that the corporation is for sale or sale is a foregone conclusion, the duty of the directors \u201cchanged from the preservation of [the corporation] as a corporate entity to the maximization of the company\u2019s value at a sale for the stockholders\u2019 benefit.\u201d <em>Revlon, </em>506 A.2d at 182. The court noted that, at this point, the \u201cdirectors\u2019 role changed from defenders of the corporate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>bastion to auctioneers charged with getting the best price for the stockholders at a sale of the company.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-6\"><em>Shenker, </em>411 Md. at 340, 983 A.2d 408. The Court of Appeals explained that <em>\u201cRevlon </em>and the duties that it described are aimed at the duties involved in a situation where sale of the corporation is a foregone conclusion and the primary remaining interests are those of the shareholders in maximizing their share value in a sale.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341, 983 A.2d 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The Court concluded that CA \u00a7 2-405.1 did not supersede the common law duties \u201cin Maryland, including those characterized in <em>Revlon, </em>that, when faced with an inevitable or highly likely change-of-control situation, corporate directors owe their shareholders fiduciary duties of candor and maximization of shareholder value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It held that, \u201c[o]nce the threshold decision to sell Laureate was made, Board Respondents owed fiduciary duties of candor and maximization of shareholder value to Petitioners, common law duties not encompassed or superseded by \u00a7 2-405.1(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, pursuant to <em>Shenker, </em>the events triggering the common law duties of maximization of value and candor, which are owed to a shareholder and permit a direct action, are when \u201cthe decision is made to sell the corporation,\u201d the \u201csale of the corporation is a foregone conclusion,\u201d or the sale involves \u201can inevitable or highly likely change-of-control situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338, 341, 983 A.2d 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">The Court of Appeals did not, in <em>Shenker </em>or in any subsequent case, explain what factual scenarios satisfy the above triggering events. Accordingly, in assessing whether the Fed-First directors had duties of maximization of value and candor owed to the shareholders in the merger transaction here, we look to other jurisdictions for guidance. In particular, because the Court of Appeals relied on the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Revlon, </em>we look to the decisions of the Delaware courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">The Delaware Supreme Court has made clear that not every corporate combination triggers a duty to maximize shareholder value. <em>See Paramount Commc\u2019ns v. Time Inc., </em>571 A.2d 1140, 1151 (Del.1989) <em>(Revlon </em>duties do not arise simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>because a company is \u201cin play\u201d or \u201cup for sale.\u201d). In <em>Time, </em>the court held that the Time Board did not put the corporation up for sale, or make the dissolution of the corporate entity inevitable, and therefore trigger <em>Revlon </em>duties, merely by entering into a merger agreement with Warner Communications, Inc., even where the agreement contained a \u201cno-shop\u201d clause and other structured safety devices to protect the agreement. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Rather, the <em>Revlon </em>duties have been held to apply in only limited circumstances. To date, <em>Revlon </em>duties have been found to apply only in the following scenarios:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-6\">(1) \u201cwhen a corporation initiates an active bidding process seeking to sell itself or to effect a business reorganization involving a clear break-up of the company,\u201d <em>Paramount </em>[, 571 A.2d at 1150]; (2) \u201cwhere, in response to a bidder\u2019s offer, a target abandons its long-term strategy and seeks an alternative transaction involving the break-up of the company,\u201d <em>id.; </em>or (3) when approval of a transaction results in a \u201csale or change of control,\u201d <em>[Paramount Commc\u2019ns v.] QVC [Network Inc.], </em>637 A.2d [34,] 42-43, 47 [ (Del.1993) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-7\"><em>Arnold v. Soc\u2019y for Sav. Bancorp, Inc., </em>650 A.2d 1270, 1289-90 (Del.1994). We thus address these facts in the context of the claims raised in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">FedFirst</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">Applicability of <em>Revlon/Shenker </em>Duties</p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">In assessing whether <em>Revlon </em>duties, referred to by the Court of Appeals in <em>Shenker, </em>apply to the directors in the case, we note that there is no allegation that FedFirst initiated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>an active bidding process or abandoned a long-term strategy to seek to break up the company. Rather, the directors merely explored options for a potential merger, which they would then present to the stockholders for approval.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">These facts do not support a conclusion, pursuant to <em>Shenker, </em>411 Md. at 338, 341, 983 A.2d 408, that <em>Revlon </em>duties applied because \u201cthe decision [had been] made to sell the corporation\u201d or \u201cthe sale of a corporation [was] a foregone conclusion.\u201d <em>See Arnold, </em>650 A.2d at 1290 <em>(Revlon </em>duties applicable to directors \u201cseeking to sell\u201d the corporation apply in the context of the directors \u201cinitiat[ing] an active bidding process\u201d); <em>Time, </em>571 A.2d at 1151 (directors did not put corporation up for sale or make dissolution of the company inevitable merely by entering into a merger agreement). The only potential rationale raised for finding a <em>Revlon </em>duty to maximize shareholder value, therefore, involves whether the transaction involved a \u201chighly likely change-of-control situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341, 983 A.2d 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">In that regard, the Delaware courts have addressed when a merger, other than a cash-out merger, constitutes a \u201cchange of control\u201d that triggers <em>Revlon </em>duties. In <em>Equity-Linked Investors, LP v. Adams, </em>705 A.2d 1040, 1055 (Del.Ch.1997), the court determined that <em>Revlon </em>duties apply in a stock-for-stock merger where there is \u201cno tomorrow for the shareholders (no assured long-term)\u201d because the stock received is subject to the control of a single individual or associated group who has majority control over the merged entity. <em>Id. </em>By contrast, in the context of a stock-for-stock merger where control of the merged entity will remain in a large, fluid, public market, <em>Revlon </em>duties do not apply because there is no change-of-control. <em>See Arnold, </em>650 A.2d at 1290 (No \u201csale or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>change of control\u201d triggering <em>Revlon </em>duty to maximize value in stock-for-stock merger when \u201c \u2018[c]ontrol of both [companies] remain[s] in a large, fluid, changeable and changing market.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>QVC, 637 </em>A.2d at 47). <em>Accord In re Santa Fe Pacific Corp. S\u2019holder Litig., </em>669 A.2d 59, 71 (Del.1995) (plaintiff failed to state a claim that the board had a duty to seek the best value where the board was committed to a stock-for-stock merger and plaintiff failed to allege that control of the company after the merger would not remain in a large, fluid, changing market); <em>Krim v. ProNet, Inc., </em>744 A.2d 523, 528 (Del.Ch.1999) <em>(\u201cRevlon </em>duties are not triggered when ownership remains with the public shareholders and no change of control results.\u201d). <em>See also </em>James J. Hanks, <em>Maryland Corporation Law, </em>\u00a7 6.6A at 195 (\u201cA sale of the business for cash\u2014 whether through merger, sale of assets or otherwise \u2014 will always result in a change of control. Conversely, a stock-for-stock merger will not be a change of control so long as there is no single stockholder or affiliated group of stockholders who did not have effective voting control of the target <em>before </em>the transaction but who will hold a majority of the voting power of the combined company <em>after </em>the transaction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">In <em>QVC, </em>the Delaware Supreme Court explained why a stock-for-stock merger does not result in a change of control where the remaining corporation is owned by a \u201cfluid aggregation of unaffiliated voters.\u201d 637 A.2d at 46. In that regard, it noted its prior decision in <em>Time, </em>571 A.2d at 1150, where it approved the Chancellor\u2019s conclusions regarding when a change of control occurs, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-6\">Surely under some circumstances a stock for stock merger could reflect a transfer of corporate control. That would, for example, plainly be the case here if Warner were a private company. But where, as here, the shares of both constituent corporations are widely held, corporate control can be expected to remain unaffected by a stock for stock merger. This in my judgment was the situation with respect to the original merger agreement. When the specifics of that situation are reviewed, it is seen that, aside from legal technicalities and aside from arrangements thought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>enhance the prospect for the ultimate succession of [Nicholas J. Nicholas, Jr., president of Time], neither corporation could be said to be acquiring the other. Control of both remained in a large, fluid, changeable and changing market.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-5\">The existence of a control block of stock in the hands of a single shareholder or a group with loyalty to each other does have real consequences to the financial value of \u201cminority\u201d stock. The law offers some protection to such shares through the imposition of a fiduciary duty upon controlling shareholders. But here, effectuation of the merger would not have subjected Time shareholders to the risks and consequences of holders of minority shares. This is a reflection of the fact that no control passed to anyone in the transaction contemplated. The shareholders of Time would have \u201csuffered\u201d dilution, of course, but they would suffer the same type of dilution upon the public distribution of new stock.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-6\"><em>QVC, </em>637 A.2d at 46-47 (quoting <em>Paramount Commc\u2019ns Inc. v. Time Inc., </em>No. 10866 (Del.Ch. July 17, 1989)). The Court explained that a key reason behind imposing <em>Revlon </em>duties is concern regarding actions where the shareholder\u2019s voting power is diminished. <em>Id. </em>at 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Here, Mr. Sutton does not allege, for good reason, that control of the company after the merger would not remain in a large, fluid, changing market. Thus, the merger did not result in a \u201csale or change of control.\u201d <em>Arnold, </em>650 A.2d at 1270. Unlike the scenario involved in the cash-out merger transaction in <em>Shenker, </em>FedFirst\u2019s shareholders in this case, by virtue of the stock portion of the merger agreement, have a continuing interest, including voting power, in the combined company, and they can participate in the future successes of CB Financial.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Accordingly, there was no \u201csale or change of control,\u201d and <em>Revlon </em>duties were not triggered in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>2.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Direct Action By Stockholders</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Although the Court of Appeals in <em>Shenker </em>recognized an exception to the general rule that a shareholder must bring a derivative action when challenging a merger transaction, the exception was limited to situations where \u201cthe decision [was] made to sell the corporation,\u201d \u201cthe sale was a foregone conclusion,\u201d or the sale involved \u201can inevitable or highly likely change-of-control situation.\u201d 411 Md. at 338, 341, 983 A.2d 408. None of these scenarios are presented here where the directors merely entered into a merger agreement involving a stock-for-stock transaction in which the combined corporation continued to remain in a large, fluid, public market in which FedFirst\u2019s stockholders were left with a continuing interest in CB Financial.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Rather, given the circumstances of the merger agreement here, the FedFirst directors were acting pursuant to their managerial duties, and the duties owed were those set forth in CA \u00a7 2-405.1, i.e., to perform in good faith, in the best interest of the corporation, and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person would use. With respect to those duties, the directors were entitled to the business judgment rule, which provides that the officers acted in good faith and in the best interests of the corporation, and any claim regarding an alleged breach of those duties was required to be brought derivatively on behalf of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>The <em>Shenker </em>exception that allows a shareholder to bring a direct action based on the common law \u201cnon-managerial\u201d duties of candor or maximization of value does not apply here. Accordingly, Mr. Sutton did not have a direct shareholder action against the directors, and because he dismissed his derivative action, the circuit court properly granted the motion to dismiss Mr. Sutton\u2019s claim against FedFirst and its directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">CB Financial \u2014 Aiding and Abetting</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">CB Financial argues that \u201cthe circuit court correctly held that the Amended Complaint failed to state a claim for \u2018aiding and abetting\u2019 against CB Financial because there was no underlying breach of fiduciary duties.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">As the Court of Appeals has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-9\">One of the requirements for tort liability as an aider and abettor is that there be a \u201cdirect perpetrator of the tort.\u201d Thus, civil aider and abettor liability, somewhat like civil conspiracy, requires that there exist underlying tortious activity in order for the alleged aider and abettor to be held liable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-10\"><em>Alleco Inc. v. Harry &amp; Jeanette Weinberg Found., Inc., </em>340 Md. 176, 200-01, 665 A.2d 1038 (1995) (citations omitted). As previously indicated, we have concluded that Mr. Sutton did not state a cognizable cause of action against the FedFirst directors for breach of fiduciary duties. Accordingly, his claim against CB Financial for aiding and abetting any such breach similarly fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">In any event, even if the claim against the FedFirst directors survived, Mr. Sutton failed to state a claim against CB Financial. To state a claim for aiding and abetting a non-fiduciary, a plaintiff must allege, <em>inter alia, </em>facts that the aider and abettor \u201cknowingly and substantially assisted] the principal violation.\u201d <em>Holmes v.

It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-5\">The allegations made by Petitioners fail to demonstrate that the actions taken by Investor Respondents, alleged to have aided and abetted Board Respondents\u2019 breach of fiduciary duties, were anything more than \u201cthose normally attendant to a private entity pursuing the private acquisition of a public corporation.\u201d The crux of Petitioners\u2019 allegations seem to pin their claim on the restrictive nature of the merger agreement presented by Investor Respondents to Board Respondents. We fail to see how merely offering an agreement containing penalties if Board Respondents solicited or accepted competing bids for Laureate rises to the level of encouraging or inciting Board Respondents\u2019 alleged breach of their fiduciary duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-6\"><em>Id. </em>We similarly conclude here.

Here, because the circuit court resolved the issues raised in Count III, seeking declaratory relief, in Counts I and II, asserting claims against FedFirst and CB Financial, the resolution of the count seeking declaratory relief was moot.

In his amended complaint, Mr. Sutton argued that this provision was one of three \"preclusive deal protection mechanisms\u201d that unduly benefitted CB Financial. He argued that the information regarding any \"superior proposals\u201d that FedFirst was to provide to CB Financial, which included the material terms of the offer, was designed to give CB Financial \"matching rights,\u201d providing \"CB Financial the ability to top the superior offer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b84-8\">.

Because cash elections were oversubscribed (the merger agreement limited cash exchanges to 35% of FedFirst\u2019s outstanding shares), those shareholders who elected to receive cash were compensated with cash for approximately 55% of their FedFirst shares with the remainder being traded for CB Financial shares. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b92-5\">.

Due to the majority\u2019s controlling position in the target company, it may force any minority shareholders to surrender their shares and accept the cash payment, effectively eliminating their interest in the target company (and leaving them with no subsequent interest in the acquiring company). Such a cash-out merger stands in contrast to a traditional merger, in which shareholders of the target company trade in their shares in exchange for shares in the acquiring company. <em>See generally </em>James J.
