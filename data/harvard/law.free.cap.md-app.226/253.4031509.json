Appellant was charged by indictment with three counts of narcotics law violations, (Md.Code (2002, 2013 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 5-612 of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cCrim. Law?\u201d), Crim. Law, \u00a7 5-602(2), and Crim. Law, \u00a7 5-601), as a result of the large amounts of heroin and drug paraphernalia discovered in his apartment. Thereafter, appellant filed a motion for an evidentiary hearing to suppress information contained in the affidavit. Following a two-day motions hearing, the motion was denied. Appellant subsequently entered a conditional guilty plea pursuant to Md. Rule 4-242(d)(2) and received a ten-year sentence without parole. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Appellant presents one question for our review, which has been divided into subparts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">1. Did the [circuit] court err in denying [appellant\u2019s] Motion to Suppress?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">A. By trespassing onto the curtilage of [appellant\u2019s] apartment to have a [K-9] dog investigate the contents of his apartment[,] did police violate [appellant\u2019s] Fourth Amendment rights[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-10\">B. Did [appellant] have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the curtilage around his apartment door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-11\">C. Did the affidavit in support of the search warrant contain misleading factual information as well as uncorroborated information provided by a confidential source not shown to be reliable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>D. After redacting all of the unlawfully obtained information from the warrant application, did probable cause to search [appellant\u2019s] apartment exist?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the decision of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">On August 26, 2013, the circuit court issued a search and seizure warrant for appellant\u2019s apartment located in Cockeys-ville, Maryland, in response to an affidavit authored by Baltimore City Police Officer, Jai Etwaroo (\u201cOfficer Etwaroo\u201d). The affidavit was largely predicated on information received from confidential informants,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who alleged that heroin was located in appellant\u2019s apartment, as well as information provided by an acquaintance of appellant, Anthony Thomas Hall (\u201cMr. Hall\u201d), regarding appellant\u2019s alleged drug-related activities. The affidavit also included information discovered through an on-going police investigation, in which appellant was an alleged target.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Members of the Baltimore County Police Department\u2019s Narcotics Unit, in conjunction with the Baltimore City Police Department\u2019s Northeast District Operation Unit/Flex, executed the search warrant for appellant\u2019s apartment. The search was initiated by a positive alert received from a K-9 dog in the area in front of appellant\u2019s apartment door. Upon entry, detectives encountered appellant in the hallway of his apartment and subsequently discovered large amounts of heroin and drug paraphernalia within the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">On September 16, 2013, appellant was indicted for possession of a large quantity of heroin, possession with intent to distribute, and possession of heroin, in violation of Crim. Law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 5-612, 5-602(2), and 5-601. On December 23, 2013, appellant filed a motion requesting an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the search warrant was supported by probable cause. A two-day motions hearing was held before the circuit court on November 3 and 5, 2014. Officer Etwaroo testified on behalf of the State. Appellant, Mr. Hall, and Stephen Andersen (\u201cMr. Andersen\u201d), a licensed private investigator and former Maryland State Police officer hired by appellant\u2019s counsel, were witnesses for the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Officer Etwaroo testified regarding a conversation that he had with Mr. Hall shortly after his arrest on June 4, 2013, in which Mr. Hall disclosed the alleged drug-related activities of appellant,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the information provided by the confidential informants, the events that occurred prior to obtaining a search warrant, and the manner in which the warrant was executed. During Mr. Hall\u2019s testimony, he recanted the statements allegedly made during his conversation with Officer Etwaroo. Mr. Hall denied ever speaking to Officer Etwaroo after his arrest on June 4th and stated that several references in the affidavit were not true. Mr. Hall also pointed to several inaccuracies contained in the affidavit regarding his arrest for an unrelated charge. However, the circuit court concluded that Mr. Hall\u2019s contentions were not credible.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Mr. Andersen testified regarding the security features of appellant\u2019s apartment building. Mr. Andersen also recounted that during an interview with Mr. Hall, he denied ever speak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>ing with Officer Etwaroo. The contents of the interview were subsequently memorialized in a ten-page affidavit written by Mr. Andersen and signed by Mr. Hall.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">On November 5th, after considering the evidence and testimony of the witnesses, the judge denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress. Thereafter, appellant entered a conditional guilty plea<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to the count of possession with intent to distribute heroin (Crim.Law, \u00a7 5-602(2)). On March 2, 2015, appellant was sentenced to a ten-year term of incarceration without parole and granted an appeal bond. Appellant noted a timely appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Additional facts shall be provided, <em>infra, </em>to the extent they prove relevant in addressing the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">In <em>Carter v. State, </em>178 Md.App. 400, 408-09, 941 A.2d 1222 (2008), this Court articulated the standard followed by a judge issuing a warrant and the standard of review exercised by an appellate court reviewing the same. We opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">Our review of the judge\u2019s decision to issue the search warrant[ ] is limited to whether there was a substantial basis for concluding that the evidence sought would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>discovered in the place described in the application for the warrant. The substantial basis standard involves something less than finding the existence of probable cause, and is less demanding than even the familiar \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 standard by which appellate courts review judicial fact finding in a trial setting. Furthermore, [t]he judge\u2019s determination that probable cause exists is entitled to great deference. The issuing judge\u2019s probable cause determination is a practical, common-sense decision based on analyzing the affidavit in light of the totality of the circumstances. [Thus,] [an] after-the-fact scrutiny by an appellate court regarding the sufficiency of an affidavit should not take the form of <em>de novo </em>review. A [warrant-issuing judge\u2019s] determination of probable cause should be paid great deference by reviewing courts. Doubtful or marginal cases should be resolved in favor of the judge\u2019s decision to issue the warrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">(internal citations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Moreover, when reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress evidence, \u201cwe confine ourselves to what occurred at the suppression hearing. We view the evidence and inferences that may be reasonably drawn therefrom in a light most favorable to the prevailing party on the motion, here, the State.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. State, </em>429 Md. 632, 647, 57 A.3d 484 (2012) (citation omitted). Furthermore, \u201c[w]e extend great deference to the findings of the motions court as to first-level findings of fact and as to the credibility of witnesses, unless those findings are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Brown v. State, </em>397 Md. 89, 98, 916 A.2d 245 (2007) (citation omitted). \u201cThe [court\u2019s] legal conclusions, however, are not afforded deference, and are reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d Swift v. State, </em>393 Md. 139, 155, 899 A.2d 867 (2006) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">\n<em>I. Substantial Basis for Probable Cause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">Appellant contends that the affidavit in support of the search warrant contained misleading factual information, as well as uncorroborated information provided by a confidential source that was not shown to be reliable. Appellant relies on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number><em>State v. Lee, </em>330 Md. 320, 624 A.2d 492 (1993) and asserts that \u201c[t]he <em>Lee </em>case is particularly instructive with regard to [appellant\u2019s] case\u201d because the affidavit in both cases failed to establish the confidential source\u2019s basis of knowledge, veracity, or reliability. However, appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Lee </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">\u201cWhether information provided by an unidentified informant supports a finding of probable cause depends on a practical, non-technical \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 approach that considers the informant\u2019s veracity, reliability, and basis of knowledge.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>330 Md. at 326, 624 A.2d 492 (citations omitted); <em>accord West v. State, </em>137 Md.App. 314, 329, 768 A.2d 150 (2001). <em>See generally, Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 233, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983). Appellant faded to demonstrate that under the totality of the circumstances, the informants\u2019 basis of knowledge, veracity, or reliability was lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The affidavit in <em>Lee, </em>330 Md. at 323, 624 A.2d 492, stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">Frederick Roy Lee reportedly lived in a mobile home on Route 3, Pine Hollow Road, in Rawlings; 2) a confidential informant, or C.I. # 18-2970, had that day informed the police that Lee possessed the illegal drug LSD; 3) the informant stated that Lee \u2018is supposedly receiving\u2019 more of the drug on the same day; 4) \u2018[t]his C.I. is aware of Freddy Lee being in possession of LSD th[r]ough another individual [the informant\u2019s brother] who has indicated that he can purchase LSD for the C.I.\u2019; 5) the confidential informant would arrange to have this \u2018unwitting\u2019 individual purchase LSD from Lee at about 11:30 p.m. that evening; 6) Lee had been convicted of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute in September 1988; and 7) the Cumberland City Police Department had received two anonymous reports in October 1991 that Lee was involved in the distribution of LSD.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">In support of its conclusion that there was no substantial basis for probable cause based upon the information contained in the affidavit, the Court of Appeals in <em>Lee, </em>observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Taking all of the circumstances into account, and with due deference to the issuing [judge\u2019s] determination, we hold that probable cause did not exist to search Lee\u2019s mobile home. The factual predicate set out in [the] application for a warrant, to which we must conf\u00edne our review, consisted essentially of a second-hand rumor: the officer merely recounted information about Lee passed through the informant from his brother. The affidavit did not assert that the informant had previously given police truthful and reliable information about criminal activity. The affidavit did not assert that the informant\u2019s brother was truthful and reliable. The affidavit did not explain how the brother obtained the incriminating information about Lee. The affidavit did not describe how the brother concluded he could buy drugs from Lee.... The affidavit failed entirely to address either factor in the instant case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 326-27, 624 A.2d 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The circumstances of <em>Lee </em>are inapposite to the case before us. First, the initial information supplied by informant # 1 was not predicated on second-hand knowledge. The affidavit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-7\">During the month of May, 2013[,] your affiant, BPD members, <em>received information from a confidential source </em>about black males known as APPLE and [appellant] who sell large amounts of heroin and/or cocaine throughout Baltimore City. <em>For the remainder of this affidavit the confidential source will be referred to as [informant </em># <em>1]. </em>[Informant # 1] explained that APPLE drove a white in color Lexus and lived on St. George\u2019s Avenue by Woodbourne Avenue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">(emphasis added). Thus, unlike <em>Lee, </em>where the affidavit consisted of essentially secondhand rumor recounting information about Lee passed through the informant from his brother, the affidavit in the instant case consisted of information directly from the confidential informant. <em>Cf. West, </em>137 Md.App. at 331-32, 768 A.2d 150 (stating that the affidavit fails to mention whether the concerned citizens\u2019 whose information provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>was used in the affidavit, are speaking from first-hand knowledge received through their own sense or merely passing on information they heard from others). Accordingly, appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>West </em>is also misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Additionally, unlike the affiant in <em>Lee, </em>Officer Etwaroo demonstrated that informant # 1 had previously provided truthful and reliable information, and also explained how the incriminating information was obtained. As the State noted, \u201c[t]he warrant-issuing judge knew from the affidavit that this same confidential informant\u2019s tips had already reliably led to [Mr.] Hall\u2019s arrest on June 4, 2013.\u201d The affidavit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aud\"><em>Information obtained from [informant # 1] and investigation by BPD members [led] to the arrest of [Mr. Hall], On June 4, 2013 at approximately 1115 hrs [Mr. Hall], DOB 1.12.74, AKA \u201cAPPLE\u201d was arrested in reference to a Search and Seizure warrant conducted at 4924 St. Georges Avenue Baltimore, Maryland. [Mr. Hall] is a convicted murderer and was in possession of approximately one half kilogram of heroin and approximately $54,000 [] U.S. Currency. After being read his Miranda rights, [Mr. Hall] explained to your [a]jfiant that an individual by the name of [appellant] sells a large amount of heroin and cocaine throughout Baltimore City. [Mr. Hall] further explained that [appellant] drives a silver Mercedes Benz in the area of Loch Raven and Joppa Road. [Mr. Hall] advised that [appellant] meets clients off Padonia Road by an apartment complex which is also where he believes [appellant] has an apartment that he uses to store narcotics. </em>[Appellant] was further identified using police databases as Shaun Donte Lindsey (M/B/DOB 2-19-71). [Appellant] is a known convicted felon with multiple arrests for [controlled dangerous substances]. [Appellant] has an OPEN arrest warrant issued by the District Court of Baltimore City under D130452803. Armed with this information [y]our [a]ffiant began an investigation into [appellant].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Recounting information provided during an encounter with informant # 2 in August 2013, the affidavit further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>During the middle of August 2013[,] your affiant met with [informant # 2] [ ]. During this meeting we ascertained that [appellant] was now in possession of [a] large amount of heroin and was now about to begin distributing same throughout Baltimore City. [Informant # 2] advised Officers that [appellant] has been laying low (NOT SELLING NARCOTICS) because his best friend APPLE was arrested while in possession of a large amount of heroin. [Informant # 2] explained that [appellant] was laying low because he believed APPLE, ... was snitching (TELLING LAW ENFORCEMENT INFORMATION) about [appellant\u2019s] heroin distribution organization. [Informant # 2] advised that [appellant] knew this to be true because APPLE has a terrible criminal record to include murder and APPLE pled guilty to only five years for this arrest. [Informant # 2] explained that [appellant] believed there was no way APPLE could have only got a five year sentence without his cooperation with Law Enforcement. Due to APPLE\u2019S arrest [informant # 2] advised that [appellant] would run, flee or take off at the first sign of police presence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">Today, August 26[th][,]2013, your affiant received information that [appellant] was heavy and on deck (IN CURRENT POSSESSION OF A LARGE AMOUNT OF NARCOTICS). Your affiant also received information that [appellant] was going to conduct a large narcotics transaction at 7:00 am (August 27, 2013) where the bulk of [appellant\u2019s] heroin would be sold to another source. Baltimore City Police learned that [appellant] was currently operating a silver Mercedes Benz with Maryland registration [ ]. Your affiant was able to locate this vehicle while it was traveling Northbound on Loch Raven crossing Joppa Road.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The information supplied by both informants later corroborated with the evidence discovered during execution of the warrant. The information supplied also coincided with the evidence Officer Etwaroo obtained through police investigation. In the affidavit, Officer Etwaroo further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Using police databases, your affiant was able to determine that the Mercedes was registered to Ellen Hinton. Your affiant knows that drug distributors often utilize vehicles registered in other people\u2019s names to avoid being identified by the police. Your affiant conducted further investigation using police databases and determined that Hinton and [appellant] have both utilized the address of 4617 W. Forest Park MD in the past and now [appellant] was using the address of 10 Queensbridge Court Apt. K, Coekeysville, MD----This address was given to CBIF by [appellant] on 11/27/2012 when he was last arrested. This information corroborated information that your affiant received [from Mr. Hall] that [appellant] has an apartment near Padonia Road.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Although there is little evidence in the record establishing the veracity, reliability, and basis of knowledge of informant # 2, this circumstance is not fatal to the sufficiency of the affidavit. The information supplied by informant # 2 was only <em>confirmatory </em>of the information previously supplied by informant # 1 and the information Officer Etwaroo discovered through police investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">In light of the foregoing, appellant failed to discredit the informants\u2019 veracity, reliability, and basis of knowledge. <em>See State v. Coley, </em>145 Md.App. 502, 531, 805 A.2d 1186 (2002) (crediting the information contained in the affidavit because \u201cthe officers used a \u2018past, proven, and reliable\u2019 [informant] who proffered direct statements involving [Coley\u2019s] [controlled dangerous substance] distribution history and place of residence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">We also reject appellant\u2019s further argument that \u201c[e]very fact [Officer] Etwaroo attributed to the confidential source is nothing more than a conclusory statement.\u201d There are few, <em>if any, </em>statements in the affidavit that can be considered conclu-sory. In the affidavit, Officer Etwaroo recounted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-10\">Using police databases, your affiant was able to determine that the Mercedes was registered to Ellen Hinton. <em>Your affiant knows that drug distributors often utilize vehicles </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number><em>registered, in other people\u2019s names to avoid being identified by the </em>police....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">Attempting to further my investigation your affiant followed [appellant\u2019s] vehicle onto the ramp leading to interstate 695 Westbound. While following this vehicle it continuously changed speeds and lanes dramatically. <em>Based upon your affiant\u2019s training and expertise and what your affiant learned from veteran officers your affiant believed this vehicle was showing characteristics of an individual who is attempting to detect or observe a follow or tail. Your affiant knows that major narcotic distributors utilize this technique in order to avoid police detection and[/]or rival narcotic distributors attempting to rob them....</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\"><em>Your affiant believes that this behavior </em>[unidentified persons entering the apartment of a suspected narcotic dealer and leaving after only visiting for a few minutes] <em>is indicative of narcotics trafficking....</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Assuming these averments are conclusory, appellant\u2019s argument still fails. In <em>West, </em>137 Md.App. at 323-24, 768 A.2d 150, this Court analyzed the Fourth Amendment\u2019s probable cause requirement relative to conclusory statements contained in an affidavit. In that case, we opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-9\">Although the Supreme Court has determined that more than conclusory statements are required in order for an affidavit to be sufficient ground for probable cause, it has stated that a flexible, common-sense standard best serves the purposes of the Fourth Amendment....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-10\">The process does not deal with hard certainties, but with probabilities. Long before the law of probabilities was articulated as such, practical people formulated certain common-sense conclusions about human behavior; jurors as factfinders are permitted to do the same \u2014 and so are law enforcement officers. <em>Finally, the evidence thus collected must be seen and weighed not in terms of library analysis </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number><em>by scholars, but as understood by those versed in the field of law enforcement.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Officer Etwaroo\u2019s assertions were based upon his training, experience, and expertise with arrests, searches, and seizures relative to violations of narcotics laws, obtained during his tenure as a Baltimore City police officer. <em>See Agurs v. State, </em>415 Md. 62, 88, 998 A.2d 868 (2010) (stating that because of the officers\u2019 significant training, experience, and expertise, their assertions \u201cdrug dealers often store drugs, cash, records, and other evidence of drug law violations in their residences[,]\u201d has significance in determining \u201cwhether there is substantial basis to conclude police will actually find evidence at a drug dealer\u2019s home.\u201d). A common-sense approach in reviewing the affidavit under <em>West, </em>reveals that Officer Etwaroo\u2019s assertions were reasonable under the circumstances and entitled to deference. <em>See Coley, </em>145 Md.App. at 530-31, 805 A.2d 1186 (giving deference to officers\u2019 assertion that in their experience, persons engaged in drug law violations are likely to store contraband and documents related to drug activity at their residences).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Appellant further avers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">Not once during his surveillance of [appellant] on August 26 did [Officer] Etwaroo witness any illegal behavior. Indeed he testified that \u2018[i]t could be fair to say\u2019 that he witnessed no illegal activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">We are not persuaded. In <em>Dixon v. State, </em>133 Md.App. 654, 695, 758 A.2d 1063 (2000), this Court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-9\"><em>[P]robable cause in the context of an informant\u2019s tip depends on some combination of the substance of the tip and corroborative observation by law enforcement of the suspect\u2019s activities, some of which may appear innocent on its face. </em>In the case of a confidential informant, as opposed to an anonymous one, evidence as to the informant\u2019s demonstrated reliability is also vital. <em>See [Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 244 n. 13, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983) ] (acknowledging that \u2018innocent behavior frequently will pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>vide the basis for a showing of probable cause; to require otherwise would be to <em>sub silentio </em>impose a drastically more rigorous definition of probable cause than the security of our citizens[ ] demands\u2019); <em>Draper v. United States, </em>358 U.S. 307 [79 S.Ct. 329, 3 L.Ed.2d 327] (1959); <em>see also United States v. McCraw, </em>920 F.2d 224, 227-28 (4th Cir.1990) (stating that combination of tips from reliable confidential informant and first-hand corroborative observation of suspicious activity by law enforcement provided probable cause to arrest); <em>United States v. Shepherd, </em>714 F.2d 316, 317 (4th Cir.1983) (same) []; <em>Birchead v. State, </em>317 Md. 691, 703-04 [566 A.2d 488] (1989) (concluding that search warrant was supported by probable cause when tips from anonymous informants were combined with corroborative observations by police).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Accordingly, Officer Etwaroo\u2019s testimony that he did not witness any illegal activity during surveillance of appellant, is of no consequence. Appellant further argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">Not only did [Officer] Etwaroo mislead the issuing judge about the number of confidential sources providing him information, he also [misled] the judge through several material omissions. For instance, the affidavit leads one to believe that [Mr.] Hall, when arrested, voluntarily offered [Officer] Etwaroo information about [appellant] when, in fact, as [Officer] Etwaroo testified, [Mr.] Hall began providing information after [Officer] Etwaroo told him that \u2018you know [the police] are only here because of [appellant],\u2019 and ... told him to \u2018put us onto [appellant] and we\u2019ll leave you alone.\u2019 Had the issuing judge been made aware of the fact that [Mr.] Hall was offered assistance by the police during his arrest ... the judge may have found the claimed information provided by [Mr.] Hall was suspect----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-9\">Further, [Officer] Etwaroo wrote in his affidavit that \u2018as of [11:00 p.m.]\u2019 [appellant] had not come out of his apartment during the surveillance.[] Also included in the affidavit is the fact that the K-9 unit arrived at 10:45 p.m. Yet [Officer] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Etwaroo testified that he \u2018stayed [at the scene] \u2018til I got relieved about 10 o\u2019clock, to go write [ ] the search warrant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX\">Appellant\u2019s arguments here are similarly unpersuasive. As the State noted, \u201c[appellant] raised some of these same points in support of his <em>Franks </em>claim,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but [ ], he has since abandoned that claim on appeal.\u201d Thus, appellant\u2019s arguments were \u201cpulverized by the [circuit] court\u2019s express finding that it credited the officer\u2019s testimony precisely because he took responsibility for and explained\u201d the imperfections in the affidavit. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">During the November 2014 motions hearing, the circuit court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">THE COURT: Okay. I did listen very carefully ... to the testimony, because I felt like it \u2014 this case truly came down to it, and I did have to make some credibility assessments. And it really comes down to [Officer Etwaroo] ... and Mr. Hall. And I do think [Officer Etwaroo] was very honest in that he admitted his warrant was not the most technically perfect warrant it could have been.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">In denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, the court further concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">THE COURT: I believe that Mr. Hall spoke to [Officer Etwaroo], and that [he] used that information in his appliea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>tion for the warrant. So, I think that our \u2014 the <em>Franks </em>doesn\u2019t apply here, because I don\u2019t think that Mr. Hall\u2019s information given to [Officer Etwaroo] needs to be excised from that warrant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-4\">THE COURT: So, combining that with what I found to be Mr. Hall\u2019s kind of incredible recanting of what is in the warrant, I\u2019m denying [appellant\u2019s] motions [ ] \u2014 to suppress in this ease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">We remain cognizant of this Court\u2019s role in reviewing the determinations of an issuing judge\u2019s decision to issue a search warrant, and the deference afforded to same. <em>See Carter, </em>178 Md.App. at 409, 941 A.2d 1222 (\u201c[An] after-the-fact scrutiny by an appellate court regarding the sufficiency of an affidavit should not take the form of <em>de novo </em>review. A[n] [issuing judge\u2019s] \u2018determination of probable cause should be paid great deference by reviewing courts.\u2019 \u201d). Thus, we reject appellant\u2019s attempt to \u201crevive\u201d his arguments regarding the alleged inconsistencies or omissions in the affidavit, which were appropriately considered and rejected by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">We also reject appellant\u2019s argument that \u201cthe affidavit is written to lead one to believe there is only one confidential source; however, [Officer] Etwaroo testified that there were, in fact, two confidential sources.\u201d Appellant failed to demonstrate how this fact negated the credibility of the informants or the judge\u2019s finding of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">We conclude that a practical, common-sense approach in light of the totality of the circumstances, supports the issuing judge\u2019s determination that probable cause existed. In addition to the truthful and reliable information supplied by the informants, coupled with police investigation, which later corroborated with the information supplied by the informant, Officer Etwaroo also observed suspicious behavior prior to receiving a positive alert from the K-9 dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">The affidavit indicated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Your affiant followed this vehicle to an apartment complex located on Queensbridge Court in Cockeysville, MD. The vehicle parked and a black male exited the vehicle. Your affiant was able to positively identify this individual as [appellant]. When [appellant] exited the Mercedes, he looked around for approximately [twenty] seconds before going back into his vehicle and then exiting with a black bag. [Appellant] then walked [into] the apartment building at 10 Queensbridge Court and ascended the stairs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">Your affiant then watched from a covert location 10 Queens-bridge Court, monitoring the traffic flow into the apartment building, to see if [appellant] would exit apartment K with the heroin that [informant # 2] stated [appellant] would be supplying in Baltimore City. As of 2300 hours [appellant] has not emerged from apartment K. During the time your affiant was observing [appellant\u2019s] apartment, your affiant observed two [black males] enter the apartment building and enter apartment K, which is located on the third floor of the apartment building and enter same. Your affiant observed the two male[s] then leave after only visiting for a few minutes. Your affiant believes that this behavior is indicative of narcotics trafficking. Your affiant did not want to stop the two males that exited [appellant\u2019s] apartment to protect the integrity of this investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Regarding a discussion concerning suspicious behavior, the opinion of <em>Bailey v. State, </em>412 Md. 349, 382, 987 A.2d 72 (2010), is instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">[I]t is \u2018impossible for wholly innocent factors to combine into a suspicious conglomeration unless there are concrete reasons for such an interpretation.\u2019 The [lawful behaviors displayed during surveillance of appellant are] [] innocent factor[s] without context, but the totality of the circumstances may lead to a conclusion that the lawful [behaviors are] associated with a criminal purpose. <em>[CJontext matters: actions that may appear innocuous at a certain time or in a certain place might very well serve as a harbinger of criminal activity under different circumstances. </em>In the cases in which courts held that ... lawful [activity] consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>tuted probable cause for a belief that contraband or criminal activity were present, the surrounding circumstances strongly suggested that [it] was associated with criminal activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">(internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Thus, the behavior observed by Officer Etwaroo, considered together with the evidence of record, further supports the conclusion that there was a sufficient basis for the judge to find probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Appellant further contends that in \u201c[e]xcising the illegally obtained [K-9] dog alert, the warrant is unsupported by probable cause.\u201d Specifically, \u201c[g]iven the insufficiency of the remaining information ... there was an insufficient basis to find probable cause to issue a search warrant ... and the evidence must be suppressed.\u201d Alternatively, appellant asserts, \u201c[e]ven if the information from the claimed dog alert is included, the affidavit still does not provide a sufficient basis for probable cause as the state failed, ... to establish the reliability of the dog.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Because we concluded, <em>infra, </em>that the area outside of appellant\u2019s apartment door was not curtilage and that appellant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy therein, appellant\u2019s argument that the K-9 alert was illegally obtained evidence that must be excised from the affidavit, fails. We further conclude that appellant\u2019s argument regarding the reliability of the K-9 dog was not preserved on appeal. Therefore, we decline to address that argument. Under the totality of the circumstances, the affidavit afforded the warrant-issuing judge with a substantial basis to find probable cause that appellant\u2019s apartment contained illegal drugs, without consideration of the K-9 alert.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Accordingly, we need not consider whether the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule barring the admission of illegally obtained evidence applies. However, assuming otherwise, the exclusionary rule would still not apply because Officer Etwaroo reasonably relied on the affidavit in good faith. We look to the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion in <em>Patterson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number><em>v. State, </em>401 Md. 76, 930 A.2d 348 (2007), for guidance. In <em>Patterson, </em>the Court of Appeals outlined the four limitations to the good faith exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">(1) the [judge] was misled by information in an affidavit that the officer knew was false or would have known was false except for the officer\u2019s reckless [disregard for the truth; (2) the [judge] wholly abandoned his detached and neutral judicial role; (3) the warrant was based on an affidavit that was so lacking in probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable; and (4) the warrant was so facially deficient, by faffing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seized, that the executing officers cannot reasonable presume it to be valid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 104, 930 A.2d 348 (citing <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 923, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984)). However, none of these circumstances are present in the case at bar. The record is devoid of any evidence demonstrating that the warrant-issuing judge was misled<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> by information contained in the affidavit that Officer Etwaroo knew or would have known was false, apart from the officer\u2019s reckless disregard for the truth. The record is also devoid of any evidence indicating that the warrant-issuing judge abandoned his detached and neutral judicial role in issuing the warrant or that the warrant was facially deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Under the third exception, the exclusionary rule would not apply because the evidence demonstrates that Officer Etwaroo reasonably relied on the warrant in good faith. <em>See generally, Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405 (1984). In <em>Patterson, </em>401 Md. at 106-07, 930 A.2d 348, the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>This exception under <em>[United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984) ] requires the application of an objective test of a police officer\u2019s good faith reliance on the search warrant. The objective test requires that officers, exercising professional judgment, could have reasonably believed that the averments of their affidavit related to a present and continuing violation of law, not remote from the date of their affidavit, and that the evidence sought would be likely found at [the place identified in the affidavit]. The affidavit cannot be so \u2018bare bones\u2019 in nature as to suggest that the issuing judge acted as a \u2018rubber stamp\u2019 in approving the application for the warrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">(internal citation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">An affidavit is considered bare bones when it lacks \u201cindicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable,\u201d or \u201ccontains wholly conclusory statements [] lacking] the facts and circumstances from which a [judge] can independently determine probable cause.\u201d <em>See Patterson, </em>401 Md. at 107, 930 A.2d 348 (quoting <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 923, 104 S.Ct. 3405; <em>United States v. Laury, </em>985 F.2d 1293, 1311 n. 23 (5th Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">These deficiencies are not present in Officer Etwaroo\u2019s affidavit. As we determined, <em>supra, </em>the affidavit contained several objective facts from which a judge could reasonably conclude that there was probable cause to search appellant\u2019s apartment. Additionally, the averments in the affidavit were not conclusory and any alleged deficiencies contained in the affidavit was <em>acknowledged and refuted as immaterial </em>to the circuit court\u2019s determination that probable cause existed. In exercising his professional judgment, Officer Etwaroo reasonably believed that the averments outlined in the affidavit related to appellant\u2019s present and continuing violation of the law and that the evidence sought would likely be found in appellant\u2019s apartment. <em>See generally Patterson, </em>401 Md. at 108-10, 930 A.2d 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>\n<em>II.

IV. <em>See generally Florida v. Jardines, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 1409, 1414, 185 L.Ed.2d 495 (2013). Accordingly, \u201c[w]hen \u2018the Government obtains information by physically intruding\u2019 on persons, houses, papers, or effects, \u2018a \u2018search\u2019 within the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment\u2019 has \u2018undoubtedly occurred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Under the Fourth Amendment, \u201cthe home is first among equals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, \u201c[a]t the Amendment\u2019s \u2018very core\u2019 stands \u2018the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Silverman v. United States, </em>365 U.S. 505, 511, 81 S.Ct. 679, 5 L.Ed.2d 734 (1961)). \u201cWe therefore regard the area \u2018immediately surrounding and associated with the home\u2019 \u2014 what our cases call the curtilage \u2014 as \u2018part of the home itself for Fourth Amendment purposes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jardines, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1414. \u201c[The curtilage] is \u2018intimately linked to the home, both physically and psychologically,\u2019 and is where \u2018privacy expectations are most heightened.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1415.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">In defining the extent of a home\u2019s curtilage, courts look to four factors: 1) \u201cthe proximity of the area claimed to be curtilage to the home[;]\u201d 2) \u201cwhether the area is included within an enclosure surrounding the home[;]\u201d 3) \u201cthe nature of the uses to which the area is put[;]\u201d and 4) \u201cthe steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observation by people passing by.\u201d <em>See United States v.

Accordingly, \u201ca police officer not armed with a warrant may approach a home and knock, precisely because that is \u2018no more than any private citizen might do.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1416.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Citing the factors enumerated in <em>Dunn, </em>480 U.S. 294, 107 S.Ct. 1134 appellant avers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">As noted in the search warrant [ajffidavit, the canine \u2018scanned the door to apartment K.\u2019 Obviously then, the officer controlling the canine was standing in front of [appellant\u2019s] apartment door located on the third floor. Thus, the proximity of the area to the inside of [appellant\u2019s] apartment was the width of the door separating the two....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">The second and third <em>Dunn </em>factors also show that the area immediately outside [appellant\u2019s] apartment is curtilage. While generally, the hallway area outside of an apartment door is not \u2018included within an enclosure surrounding the home, ... here, those areas, as well as the entire building, are secured by locks and a buzzer system, they are indeed enclosed. And the \u2018nature of the uses to which the area is put,\u2019 also warrants finding that the area is protected by the Fourth Amendment. Often apartment dwellers will keep decorations, bicycles, and shoes outside their apartment door.[]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-8\">The final factor, the steps taken to protect the area from observation by people passing by, is probably satisfied in a secured multi-unit apartment building even more so than a single family dwelling where the porch and the yard, ... are generally open to view____ The whole point of the locked door and buzzer system is to keep uninvited visitors away from the apartment units as well as the common areas____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">Although the area outside of appellant\u2019s door was in close proximity to the apartment, appellant has not demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>strated that the circumstances before us satisfy the factors outlined in <em>Dunn. See Dunn, </em>480 U.S. at 302, 107 S.Ct. 1134 (stating that the barn\u2019s substantial distance located 50 yards from the fence surrounding the house and 60 yards from the house itself, \u201csupports no inference that the barn should be treated as an adjunct of the house.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Additionally, although the area within the apartment building was equipped with a lock and a buzzer system, it was unclear whether entry into the building was, in fact, \u201csecure.\u201d In addressing the propriety of the K-9 dog alert, the circuit court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">As both sides have acknowledged, no one knows how anyone got into that building, with the dog or the Officer. The door could have been propped open---- They knew that they didn\u2019t have the right to exclusive possession of that hallway, so I do think the K-9 sniff further bolsters the warrant, and further lends credibility to it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">These facts are fatal to appellant\u2019s argument that the area outside of his apartment door was enclosed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Dunn, </em>480 U.S. at 302, 107 S.Ct. 1134 (holding that \u201cit is also significant that respondent\u2019s barn did not lie within the area surrounding the house that was enclosed by a fence[,]\u201d which plainly demarked the area that is part of the house, but also \u201ca distinct and separate portion of the ranch.\u201d). <em>See also Oliver v. U.S., </em>466 U.S. 170, 182, n. 12, 104 S.Ct. 1735, 80 L.Ed.2d 214 (1984) (concluding that \u201cfor most homes, the boundaries of the curtilage will be clearly marked; and the conception defining the curtilage \u2014 as the area around the home to which the activity of home life extends \u2014 is a familiar one easily understood from our daily experience.\u201d). Moreover, assuming the hallways were considered \u201cenclosed\u201d within the building, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>where tenants and authorized visitors can access only with keys or through the buzzer system, this may only establish that the area was not \u201cprivate,\u201d as appellant alleges.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Appellant\u2019s arguments relative to the third and fourth <em>Dunn </em>factors are unpersuasive. Both factors suggest that curtilage \u2014 where an expectation of privacy is most heightened \u2014 is within an area where the individual maintains some form of <em>exclusive control. </em>This is contrary to the circumstances in the case at bar because common areas, such as the hallways of a multi-unit apartment building, are generally not areas in which a tenant is deemed to have \u201cexclusive control.\u201d <em>See generally Dunn, </em>480 U.S. at 302-03, 107 S.Ct. 1134 (noting that respondent was the owner of the barn, which was within his exclusive control). <em>See Grymes v. State, </em>202 Md.App. 70, 94-95, 30 A.3d 1032 (2011) (noting the consensus amongst federal circuit court cases in support of our holding that tenants of multi-unit apartment buildings do not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in the common hallways and areas of the buildings due to lack of exclusive possession therein). <em>See also </em>Carol A. Chase, <em>Cops, Canines, and Curtilage: What Jardines Teaches and What It Leaves Unanswered, </em>52 Hous.

Relative to the third factor, appellant asserts that because apartment dwellers store items such as \u201cdecorations, bicycles, and shoes\u201d outside of their apartment door, the area is curti-lage. However, this argument is unpersuasive. The fact that these items are stored within those \u201coutside\u201d areas strongly suggests that they were not being used for intimate activities within one\u2019s home. <em>See Dunn, </em>480 U.S. at 302-03, 107 S.Ct. 1134.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>We also reject appellant\u2019s final contention that the existence of a lock and buzzer system in the apartment building indicates that steps were taken to protect the area from observation by passerbys. In contrast, appellant\u2019s own testimony revealed that the area was observable by a passerby and thus, the lock and buzzer system functioned as a security mechanism, rather than one ensuring privacy. <em>See Dunn, </em>480 U.S. at 303, 107 S.Ct. 1134 (holding that \u201c[n]othing in the record suggests that the various interior fences on respondent\u2019s property had any function other than that of the typical ranch fence; the fences were designed and constructed to corral livestock, not to prevent persons from observing what lay inside the enclosed areas.\u201d). Thus, we agree with the State\u2019s conclusion that \u201c [considering the [K-9] dog-sniff [alert] only fortifies the conclusion that the affidavit afforded the warrant-issuing judge a substantial basis to find probable cause[]\u201d because appellant failed to demonstrate that the K-9 dog alert occurred within the curtilage of his home.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Moreover, because the area outside of appellant\u2019s door was within a common area, he did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the same. <em>See Grymes, supra. </em>Courts tasked with resolving the issue before us have historically held that tenants of a multi-unit dwelling do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the common areas therein. <em>See </em>Chase, <em>Cops, Canines, and Curtilage: What Jardines Teaches and What It Leaves Unanswered, supra, </em>at 1309 (explaining that the great weight of authority of federal appellate courts from nine circuits maintain that a tenant of a multi-unit dwelling does not have an expectation of privacy in common areas of that dwelling).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Thus, appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>McDonald v. United States, </em>335 U.S. 451, 69 S.Ct. 191, 93 L.Ed. 153 (1948) and its progeny in support of his argument, is misplaced. Although the Court held that the officers violated McDonald\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights by climbing through the landlord\u2019s room and then peering into a transom above McDonald\u2019s apartment door within a common hallway, the Court\u2019s holding was predicated on the existence of an unlawful breaking and entering. <em>Id. </em>at 453-56, 69 S.Ct. 191. Justice Jackson elaborated on this threshold finding in his concurring opinion, in which he stated, \u201c[b]ut it seems to me that each tenant of a building, <em>while he has no right to exclude from the common hallways those who enter lawfully, </em>does have a personal and constitutionally protected interest in the integrity and security of the entire building against unlawful breaking and entry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 458, 69 S.Ct. 191 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Unlike <em>McDonald, </em>the evidence in the instant case does not demonstrate that the detectives gained entry through an unlawful breaking and entering, because it is unknown whether the main door to the apartment building was locked at the time of their entry. This severely undermines appellant\u2019s remaining contentions relative to his reasonable expectation of privacy in the area outside of his apartment door. Accordingly, we decline to address appellant\u2019s further arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY IS AFFIRMED.

And he\u2019s like, [], [appellant]. And I\u2019m, like, well, put us onto [appellant], and we\u2019ll leave you alone. So he began to talk[] [about appellant, relative to the information recited in Officer Etwaroo\u2019s affidavit].</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b282-9\">. The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-10\">But contrast, Mr. Hall contradicted himself on the stand a few times. First, he was ready to admit, yes, I wrote that [ten-page affidavit]. Then, oh, no, no, no, I didn\u2019t write all [ten] pages; I just signed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>bottom. His story changed a bit on the stand. He did adopt the, I think, ... the Investigator\u2019s version of events. The Investigator wrote the affidavit for him, and that may have been by necessity given Mr. Hall\u2019s current [imprisonment]. But at either rate, I did find [Officer Etwaroo] to be a more credible witness than Mr. Hall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-11\">I believe that Mr. Hall spoke to [Officer Etwaroo], and that [he] used that information in his application for the warrant.... So, combining that with what I found to be Mr. Hall\u2019s kind of incredible recanting of what is in the warrant, I\u2019m denying [appellant's] motions [] \u2014 to suppress in this case.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b283-12\">. Pursuant to Md. Rule 4-242(d)(2), \"[w]ith the consent of the court and the State, a defendant may enter a conditional plea of guilty. The plea shall be in writing and, ... the defendant may reserve the right to appeal one or more issues specified in the plea that (A) were raised by and determined adversely to the defendant, and, (B) if determined in the defendant\u2019s favor would have been dispositive of the case. The right to appeal under this subsection is limited to those pretrial issues litigated in the circuit court and set forth in writing in the plea.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b293-9\">. A <em>Franks </em>claim is raised by a defendant who seeks to challenge the sufficiency of the information proffered in an affidavit supporting a search warrant. In <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978), the Supreme Court addressed <em>Franks' </em>right to challenge the truthfulness of certain factual statements made in the affidavit supporting the warrant to search his apartment for evidence related to his state conviction for rape, kidnapping, and burglary. In reversing the state supreme court\u2019s decision affirming <em>Franks\u2019 </em>conviction, the Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-10\">Where [a] defendant makes [a] substantial preliminary showing that [a] false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with the reckless disregard for the truth, was included by [the] affiant in [a] search warrant affidavit, and if [an] allege[d] false statement is necessary to [the] finding of probable cause, [the] Fourth Amendment requires that [a] hearing be held at defendant\u2019s request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 155-56, 98 S.Ct. 2674. This evidentiary hearing was subsequently coined a <em>\u201cFranks </em>hearing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b297-8\">. Although the circuit court acknowledged the alleged deficiencies in Officer Etwaroo's affidavit during the motions hearing, it nonetheless determined that they were not fatal to his warrant application. We acknowledge, as appellant counters in his reply brief that \"[a] <em>Franks </em>hearing is not a prerequisite to arguing that the good faith doctrine\u201d applies. However, we reject this argument because contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, Officer Etwaroo did not \"carelessly, recklessly, and dishonestly\u201d prepare the affidavit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b301-10\">. Similar to the circuit court\u2019s conclusion, we also note that it is unclear from the record how the detectives gained entry into appellant\u2019s building that evening, or whether the main entry door of the building was locked or unlocked. Officer Etwaroo\u2019s testimony during the motions hearing reveals only that at the time of the detectives' entry and subsequent K-9 dog alert, he was offsite obtaining the search warrant and unsure of how they gained entry into the building.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b303-6\">. Since we conclude that the area outside of appellant's apartment door was not curtilage, and thus not in a constitutionally protected area, we decline to address appellant's argument that the police investigation was accomplished through an unlicensed physical intrusion. <em>See Jar-dines, supra </em>(outlining the standard of review that is followed once it is determined that a police investigation took place in a constitutionally protected area).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
