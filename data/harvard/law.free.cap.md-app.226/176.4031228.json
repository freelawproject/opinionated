The order authorized Potomac Electric Power Company (\u201cPepeo\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), another appel-lee, to: (1) increase its rates for the distribution of electricity by $27,883,000; and (2) impose a Grid Resiliency Charge (\u201cGRC\u201d) to contemporaneously recover costs associated with the Advanced Priority Feeders Project.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Appellants, AARP Maryland (\u201cAARP\u201d) and the Maryland Office of the People\u2019s Counsel (\u201cOPC\u201d) filed separate petitions for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, challenging, <em>inter alia, </em>the decision on the GRC. Pepeo sought judicial review of the decision to increase its rates by $27,883,000, as opposed to the $60.8 million requested, arguing that the decision to award a return on equity (\u201cROE\u201d) of 9.36%, as opposed to 10.25 %, was erroneous. On November 14, 2014, the circuit court affirmed the Commission\u2019s decision to fund the GRC, but it reversed the Commission\u2019s decision on the ROE and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">On appeal, the parties present several questions for our review,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which we have combined and rephrased slightly, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">1. Did the circuit court err in finding that the Commission\u2019s decision to permit Pepeo to impose a Grid Resiliency Charge on customers was within its broad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>statutory authority, not arbitrary and capricious, and supported by substantial evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-4\">2. Did the circuit court err in finding that the Commission did not act reasonably when setting Pepco\u2019s ROE?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm in part, and reverse in part, the judgment of the circuit court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Background on Public Utility Regulation</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Maryland Code (2010 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7\u00a7 2-101, 2-113 and 4-102 of the Public Utilities Article (\u201cPU\u201d), set forth the power of the Public Service Commission to supervise and regulate public service companies and the rates that they may charge customers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 2-112 states, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-9\">(b) <em>General powers. </em>\u2014 (1) The Commission has the powers specifically conferred by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-10\">(2) The Commission has the implied and incidental powers needed or proper to carry out its functions under this division.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-11\">(c) <em>Liberal construction. </em>\u2014 The powers of the Commission shall be construed liberally.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">The rate that the Commission sets, and that public utilities may charge, must be a \u201cjust and reasonable rate for the regulated services.\u201d PU \u00a7\u00a7 4\u2014102(b), 4-201. A \u201cjust and reasonable rate\u201d is defined as a rate that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-13\">(1) does not violate any provision of [the Public Utilities] article;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>(2) fully considers and is consistent with the public good; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-4\">(3) except for rates of a common carrier, will result in an operating income to the public service company that yields, after reasonable deduction for depreciation and other necessary and proper expenses and reserves, a reasonable return on the fair value of the public service company\u2019s property used and useful in providing service to the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">PU \u00a7 4-101. This rate is \u201cdesigned to yield to [a public utility] a \u2018revenue requirement\u2019 sufficient to pay its prudent expenses and to allow it the opportunity to earn a fair return on investments.\u201d <em>Office of People\u2019s Counsel v. Maryland Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>355 Md. 1, 7-8, 733 A.2d 996 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">In <em>Maryland People\u2019s Counsel v.

The property value minus depreciation yields the rate base. The public service company\u2019s required revenue is derived after adding the operating expenses to the product of the rate of return times the rate base. Just and reasonable rates are then set from this revenue figure taking into consideration the public\u2019s interest in receiving adequate and efficient service. Traditionally, a just and reasonable rate was that rate which produced the required revenue figure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">More recently, this Court stated that the rate that a public utility may charge is determined by</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-10\">examining the utility\u2019s income and expenses during a test year, calculating the rate base (the fair value of the property used and useful in rendering service) during that year, determining the utility\u2019s cost of capital (its required rate of return), and then multiplying that rate of return <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>against the rate base.

In 2011, the Maryland General Assembly passed the Maryland Electricity Service Quality and Reliability Act\u2014Safety Violations, requiring the Commission to adopt stricter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>regulations regarding utility performance. HB 391 (Reg.Sess.2011) (enacting PU \u00a7\u00a7 7-213, 13-201, 13-202). On April 17, 2012, the Commission held a rule making session, Rule Making 43 (\u201cRM43\u201d), and adopted revisions to the Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) that established minimum service quality and reliability standards for Maryland\u2019s electric companies. <em>See </em>COMAR 20.50.12.01-12. Among other provisions, RM43 included a requirement that the electric utilities report on three reliability indexes: the Customer Average Interruption Duration Index (\u201cCAIDI\u201d); the System Average Interruption Duration Index (\u201cSAIDI\u201d); and the System Average Interruption Frequency Index (\u201cSAIFI\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It also requires that utilities demonstrate compliance with minimum standards established by the Commission. <em>See </em>COMAR 20.50.12.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">In 2012, Governor Martin O\u2019Malley issued Executive Order 01.01.2012.15, establishing the Grid Resiliency Task Force, which was charged with evaluating methods for improving the resiliency and reliability of Maryland\u2019s electric distribution system and assessing \u201cwhat steps can be taken to strengthen Maryland\u2019s electric distribution to better withstand the stresses that come with severe weather events.\u201d <em>Weathering the Storm: Report of the Grid Resiliency Task Force </em>6 (Sep. 24, 2012), <em>available at </em>http://perma.ee/LBB4-YAH6.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Task Force was created in response to \u201cthe potential impact of climate change on regional weather patterns and the prolonged power outages brought by recent hurricanes, blizzards, and the Derecho.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">On September 24, 2012, the Task Force issued its report, recommending, <em>inter alia, </em>that Maryland\u2019s electric utilities \u201ctemporarily go above and beyond their requirements under RM43 in order to jumpstart the improvements and enable Marylanders to see real results in a compressed time frame\u201d (Recommendation # 2). Recognizing that acceleration of reliability improvements would place a financial burden on utilities, the Task Force recommended that the Commission \u201cauthorize contemporaneous cost recovery through a tracker-like mechanism\u201d to permit electric utilities to recover costs \u201cexclusively for these accelerated and incremental investments and expenses.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Task Force stated that \u201cany tracker recovery mechanism must include significant oversight and approval by the PSC\u201d and would require the utility to \u201cproject, with some degree of certainty, the costs of the various resiliency measures to be undertaken in advance of PSC approval of the plan.\u201d This would allow \u201ctransparency surrounding the process, as well as oversight on the costs to be collected from ratepayers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Pepco\u2019s Application</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">On November 30, 2012, Pepeo, a public service company that provides electric distribution services to approximately 530,000 customers in Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>ties, filed an Application for Adjustments to its Retail Rates for the Distribution of Electric Energy. It stated that, \u201cin order to maintain and enhance its infrastructure and implement cost-effective distribution technologies, Pepeo must continue to make substantial investments in infrastructure and must have a reasonable opportunity to recover its costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">In April 2013, pursuant to its authority under PU \u00a7 4-204, the Commission held a hearing. The hearing lasted ten days, and twelve parties participated: Pepeo, OPC, AARP, the Commission\u2019s Technical Staff (\u201cStaff\u2019), Montgomery County, Town of Somerset in Chevy Chase, Mayor and Council of Rockville, City of Gaithersburg, U.S. General Services Administration (\u201cGSA\u201d), Maryland Energy Administration (\u201cMEA\u201d), POWERUPMONTCO of Montgomery County, and Apartment and Office Building Association of Metropolitan Washington (\u201cAOBA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Pepeo requested a rate increase of $60,827,000, with an increase in the ROE from 9.31% to 10.25%. It sought to increase its revenue through multiple adjustments.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> With respect to rate base, which represents the investments the Company has made in plant and equipment to provide electric service, and operating income, which is derived from the revenues the Company receives minus the reasonable costs incurred in providing service, Pepeo proposed three separate reliability plant ratemaking adjustments (\u201cRMA\u201d). Specifically, Pepeo proposed \u201cRMA1,\u201d which \u201cannualizes the effect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>reliability projects completed in the test year\u201d; \u201cRMA2,\u201d which \u201creflects the effect of reliability plant that was added to Electric Plant in Service (\u201cEPIS\u201d) from January through March 2013\u201d; and \u201cRMA3,\u201d which \u201creflects the impact of reliability projects that are projected to be placed in service between April and December of 2013, up to twelve months after the test year.\u201d <em>See </em>Order No. 85724, at 10-11.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">With respect to the ROE, Pepeo stated that, at the current rates, its current adjusted ROE was 4.71%, a level \u201cfar below its authorized [ROE] as set by the Commissioner.\u201d Pepeo requested a ROE of 10.25%.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Separate from the requested adjustments to the base rates, Pepeo asked to establish a surcharge tracker, the GRC, which would \u201cenable Pepeo to accelerate investment in infrastructure in a condensed time frame consistent with Recommendation Two of the Grid Resiliency Task Force.\u201d The Commission summarized Pepco\u2019s request as a $192 million surcharge, consisting of \u201cthree specific reliability projects: $17 million for Accelerated Vegetation Management; $151 million for Selective Undergrounding of six feeders;[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] and $24 million for an Accelerated Priority Feeders project to accelerate the hardening of 24 feeders over two years.\u201d Joseph F. Janocha, Manager of Rate Economics for Pepeo Holdings, Inc. (\u201cPHI\u201d), testified that the GRC was \u201cintended to be a short term mechanism ... to initially recover costs associated with a specific, limited group of projects,\u201d and it included a final reconciliation procedure to resolve any discrepancy between the estimated revenue requirement, i.e., the amount Pepeo expected to spend on accelerated reliability/resiliency improvement projects, and the amount Pepeo actually spent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>improving infrastructure and installing assets. Any discrepancy would \u201cbe reflected in the reconciliation process and customers would be appropriately credited, including interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Public Service Commission Order No. 85724</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">On July 12, 2013, the Commission issued Order No. 85724, a 166-page order addressing Pepco\u2019s rate increase application. With respect to Pepco\u2019s rate base and operating income, the Commission found that RMA1 and RMA2 represented additions to plants in service through March 2013, which Pepeo updated for actual spending. Therefore, it determined that those reliability projects should be reflected in the rate base, and it increased the rate base accordingly. With respect to RMA3, which it deemed to be a mere forecast of anticipated spending that was not a known and measurable adjustment, the Commission rejected this proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">In addressing Pepco\u2019s proposed ROE, the Commission stated that it was guided by the principles of <em>Bluefield Waterworks &amp; Implement Co. v. Public Service Commission of West Virginia, </em>262 U.S. 679, 692, 43 S.Ct. 675, 67 L.Ed. 1176 (1923) and <em>Federal Power Commission v. Hope Natural Gas Co., </em>320 U.S. 591, 603, 64 S.Ct. 281, 88 L.Ed. 333 (1944), which require that a return be sufficient to attract capital on reasonable terms, maintain the utility\u2019s financial integrity, and provide an opportunity to obtain a revenue comparable to other investments carrying similar risks. Addressing the evidence before it, the Commission concluded that a ROE of 9.36% was just and reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Finally, with respect to the GRC, the Commission approved the proposal, in part. It approved only the Accelerated Priority Feeders project, subject to the conditions that Pepeo: (1) provide additional detail for each feeder to be improved; (2) submit a revised calculation of revenue requirement that excluded the two rejected projects; (3) submit a base rate case petition that coincided with the projected completion of the approved project; and (4) submit an annual report regarding the status and costs of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>In sum, the Commission rejected Pepco\u2019s request for a rate increase of $60,827,000, but it authorized Pepeo to file revised rates for an increase in revenue of $27,883,000. It stated that this revenue increase would have an impact on the average residential customer\u2019s monthly bill of 2.19% or $2.41. The Commission also approved the GRC proposal with respect to the Acceleration Priority Feeders component, subject to the conditions specified.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Proceedings in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">After the Commission issued its order, Pepeo, Montgomery County, AARP, and OPC, filed separate petitions for judicial review, which were consolidated. In total, the parties challenged nine separate decisions of the Commission, including its decisions setting Pepco\u2019s ROE and authorizing Pepeo to implement the GRC.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">On November 14, 2014, after hearing argument, the circuit court issued its Order and Memorandum Opinion. The court affirmed the Commission on eight of the issues, including the GRC. It reversed the Commission\u2019s decision regarding the ROE, however, remanding to the Commission \u201cto make more specific findings regarding the impact of improved service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>reliability and the BSA [bill stabilization adjustment] in calculating Pepco\u2019s ROE.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">On December 15, 2014, and December 19, 2014, OPC and AARP, respectively, filed notices of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">\u201cWe review decisions of the Commission as \u2018consistent with the standard of review applicable to all administrative agencies.\u2019 \u201d <em>Columbia Gas of Maryland, Inc. v.

In support, both OPC and AARP argue that the Commission exceeded its statutory authority to approve the GRC because it was not a \u201cjust and reasonable rate.\u201d OPC additionally argues that the Commission \u201cacted arbitrarily and capriciously when it abandoned the \u2018known and measurable\u2019 standard for reliability projects and adopted the \u2018accelerated and incremental\u2019 standard.\u201d And AARP argues that the Commission\u2019s decision to approve the GRC was not reasonable because there was not substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>evidence that Pepeo would have suffered financial strain without the GRC surcharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Pepeo contends that appellants\u2019 argument that the Commission lacked the statutory authority to approve the GRC is not properly before this Court because it was not raised before the Commission. In any event, Pepeo asserts, the Commission had the statutory authority to approve the GRC \u201cpursuant to its plenary rate-making authority under PU \u00a7 4-101.\u201d Pepeo further disputes OPC\u2019s argument that the decision to approve the GRC was arbitrary and capricious, asserting that the Commission provided a reasoned analysis for its approval of the GRC. With respect to AARP\u2019s argument that the approval of the GRC was not supported by substantial evidence of financial strain, Pepeo asserts that such a finding was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The Commission contends that it had authority to authorize the GRC under its \u201cbroad powers\u201d pursuant to PU \u00a7 2-112(b)(2). It further argues that its decision was not arbitrary and capricious, asserting that it provided several valid reasons for approving the GRC. With respect to AARP\u2019s argument that \u201cthe Commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously because \u2018there was no substantial evidence presented showing that Pepeo would encounter any financial strain ... without the benefit of the GRC,\u201d the Commission asserts that AARP is applying the wrong test. It argues that the proper test is \u201cjust and reasonable,\u201d not a showing of financial strain.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">In support of its GRC proposal, Pepeo submitted the testimony of three company witnesses: Frederick J. Boyle, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of PHI, William M. Gausman, Senior Vice President of Strategic Initiatives for PHI, and Mr. Janocha, Manager of Rate Economics for PHI. Mr. Boyle explained that Pepco\u2019s rate increase application included accelerated service reliability programs that addressed recommendations set forth by the Grid Resiliency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Task Force. He testified that Pepeo would not accelerate these proposed projects without the GRC:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-4\">These accelerated expenditures are incremental to the Company\u2019s base capital and operating cost plans. Absent the Grid Resiliency Charge, the Company, while meeting its current reliability standards, will not perform these projects in this time frame. As the Task Force acknowledged, taking on this added level of investment will impose \u201cundue financial pressure on the utilities,\u201d and therefore the Task Force recommended that the Commission authorize contemporaneous cost recovery through a tracker-like mechanism for the accelerated investments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">After discussing in more detail each of the three proposed accelerated reliability projects, Mr. Boyle noted that \u201cthe proposed Grid Resiliency Charge will appear as a separate line item on customers\u2019 bills.... If the charges are approved, the monthly bill impact for a residential customer using 1,000 kWh per month would be $0.96 in 2014; $1.70 in 2015 and $1.93 in 2016.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Mr. Boyle explained that the GRC \u201cin no way affects the Commission\u2019s ability or authority to conduct a prudence review of Grid Resiliency Charge investments and expenses, and \u2014 as with any other investment or expense \u2014 ultimately determine to exclude or reduce recovery for any item that the Commission deems imprudent.\u201d He also discussed Pepco\u2019s proposed \u201ctrue-up\u201d process, which would result \u201cin customers[] paying for the actual amount of the project based on when the asset was actually placed into service.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>On cross-examination, Mr. Boyle explained that, although Pepco\u2019s GRC proposal indicated the company\u2019s intent to keep the GRC in effect for three years, Pepeo would nonetheless continue to collect the GRC until Pepeo brought its next rate case. Mr. Boyle conceded that Pepeo had not yet committed to a specific date on which the company would initiate another rate ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Mr. Gausman\u2019s direct testimony was similar to Mr. Boyle\u2019s testimony. Most notably, Mr. Gausman testified that, without the GRC tracker, the company would not perform the proposed projects on an accelerated schedule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-5\">Performing these projects on the accelerated schedule is not included in the Company\u2019s scope of work to meet its SAIFI and SAIDI performance requirements under the Service Quality and Reliability Standards. The company is prepared to perform these projects to address the acceleration recommended in the Task Force Report. However, as discussed by Company Witness Boyle and as discussed further, the Company cannot take on the additional investment on top of the significant financial commitment that has already been made. Additional investments to further accelerate the reliability standards can only be made with approval of the Grid Resiliency Charge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Mr. Janocha testified that the GRC, \u201cPepco\u2019s proposed tracker mechanism,\u201d was based on recommendations of the Task Force report. He explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">The company is proposing a recovery mechanism associated only with incremental accelerated investments and expenses associated with the reliability projects discussed by Company Witness Gausman. The Grid Resiliency Charge will be incorporated into the tariff through a new tariff rider, which is provided as Schedule (JFJ)-6. The Grid Resiliency Charge would be in effect for approximately three years beginning in January 2014.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Mr. Janocha also described how the GRC was calculated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-9\">The revenue requirement and resulting charge included in the Grid Resiliency Charge Rider are calculated using pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>jected cost data including, but not limited to: the actual costs of engineering, design and construction; the cost of removal (net of salvage) and property acquisition; and actual labor, materials, and capitalized Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC). The Company will track the capital investments individually for each project through a separate work order in a Construction Work in Progress (CWIP) account and record a monthly accrual of AFUDC which will be included in the CWIP balance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-4\">The revenue requirement includes a return on investment and return of investment through depreciation based on the capital costs. The revenue requirement also includes a provision for the recovery of accelerated tree trimming expenses, which the Company proposes to amortize over two years beginning in January 2014.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Mr. Janocha noted that the GRC would be subject to deferred accounting. Pepeo would track the differences between actual and forecasted expenditures through a \u201cmonthly over/under recovery calculation.\u201d \u201cThe deferred balance would be reconciled upon termination of the Grid Resiliency Charge.\u201d Pepeo proposed to file an \u201cannual report showing the status of each project, tasks completed, percentage of projects completed, and actual expenditures to date.\u201d Mr. Janocha then discussed how the GRC rates would be developed for each of Pepco\u2019s tariff rate schedules. As with Pepco\u2019s other witnesses, Mr. Janocha stated that the GRC charge would terminate when it filed its next rate case after all the GRC projects are \u201cplaced into service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">In his rebuttal testimony, Mr. Janocha responded to concerns regarding the use of projected costs, as well as the argument that the Commission had rejected similarly structured surcharges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">The nature of the costs being recovered through the Grid Resiliency Charge and the mechanism developed for cost recovery have features that distinguish it from either a forecasted test year or the previously presented surcharge mechanisms. First, the Grid Resiliency Charge is intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>to be a short term mechanism intended to initially recover costs associated with a specific, limited group of projects presented in this proceeding. Ultimately, the long term recovery of the capital investment would be through base distribution rates. By contract, the Reliability Investment Recovery Mechanism proposed by the Company in Case No. 9286 was designed as a more long term mechanism, intended as an initial recovery mechanism for a wide range of reliability investments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-4\">Second, the nature of the projects included for recovery through the Grid Resiliency Charge are such that electric plant is placed in service on essentially a continuous basis from the outset of each project. The Grid Resiliency Charge accounts for this by calculating an annual revenue requirement using an average rate base. Consequently, on an annual basis, customers are effectively paying for infrastructure as it is being placed into service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Mr. Janocha reiterated that customers would pay only for investments actually put into service:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">[T]he proposed deferred accounting mechanism provides a level of customer protection through which customers will ultimately have paid only for approved electric plant that is placed in service. The Grid Resiliency Charge mechanism includes a final reconciliation of the forecasted revenue requirement to the actual revenue requirement associated with electric plant actually placed into service. Additionally, all investment associated with the Grid Resiliency Charge will be subject to review in a future base distribution case. Any costs that may be disallowed will be reflected in the reconciliation process and customers would be appropriately credited, including interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">In opposition to Pepco\u2019s GRC proposal, OPC submitted testimony from two witnesses: David E. Dismukes, Consulting Economist with the Acadian Consulting Group, and Peter J. Lanzalotta, Principal with Lanzalotta &amp; Associates LLC. Mr. Dismukes recommended that the Commission reject the Company\u2019s GRC proposal, asserting that it was \u201cpremature, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>inconsistent with the recommendations included in the Governor\u2019s Resiliency Task Force Report, includes a number of inherent mechanism design flaws, and is inconsistent with prior Commission precedent on infrastructure trackers.\u201d With respect to his prematurity argument, Mr. Dismukes stated that, there were \u201ca number of prerequisite investigations that must be completed before a true resiliency-based set of standards can be established for Maryland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">With respect to his assertion that the GRC proposal had \u201cinherent mechanism design flaws,\u201d Mr. Dismukes stated that the proposed GRC contained a number of \u201cadministrative deficiencies,\u201d including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\">1) The \u201cdefined term\u201d of the program is ambiguous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">2) The GRC revenue requirement will be developed on a projected rather than actual basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">3) The Company does not explain how or when the prudence of its investments will be evaluated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-8\">4) The Company\u2019s proposed annual reporting process is insufficient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-9\">5) The GRC proposal does not include any ratepayer protections. Further, \u201ccoupling\u201d the BSA with the proposed GRC could create capital inefficiencies and lead to a string of ever-increasing surcharges (for both BSA-allowed revenue losses and GRC-allowed capital investments).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-10\">6) The GRC has no sunset provisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">Mr. Dismukes asserted that the GRC proposal was inconsistent with prior Commission precedent, stating that the Commission had addressed several similar infrastructure cost recovery mechanisms, and it had rejected each one. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ate\">The consistent theme in each of these rejections has included the Commission\u2019s belief that its current regulatory structure is adequate in addressing reliability investment needs, and the position that the practical implementation of investment cost trackers, projected rate base, or forward test years can likely result in greater inefficiencies, disincen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>tives, and harm than the problems these proposals are purportedly designed to correct. The Commission should defer any decision on issues like the GRC, and how to incorporate the accelerated and incremental resiliency and reliability investments proposed by the Task Force, until a comprehensive investigations of these opportunities, has been conducted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">At the hearing before the Commission, Mr. Dismukes agreed that the Commission was not precluded by precedent from approving the GRC. He stated, contrary to OPC\u2019s position on appeal that the Commission lacked statutory authority to approve the GRC, that the \u201cCommission can do whatever it wants in the public interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Mr. Lanzalotta similarly recommended that the Commission reject all three of Pepco\u2019s proposed GRC projects, asserting that Pepeo had \u201cnot demonstrated that such work [would] successfully improve reliability during major outage events.\u201d He discussed specific reasons why various aspects of the GRC proposal failed to ensure reliability improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">AARP submitted testimony from one witness, Ralph C. Smith, Senior Regulatory Utility Consultant with Larkin &amp; Associates, PLLC, in opposition to Pepco\u2019s GRC proposal. Mr. Smith asserted that \u201cPepeo has merely stated that it cannot undertake additional reliability projects without its new proposed surcharge. However, Pepeo has not proven this.\u201d Mr. Smith recommended that the Commission reject Pepco\u2019s GRC proposal, stating that his position was \u201cprimarily based on an opposition to piecemeal ratemaking, surcharges and riders that seek recovery of costs outside of traditional base rates, a concern that has been shared by this Commission as reflected in its decisions on such proposals in the past.\u201d He further stated that he had \u201cadditional concerns regarding the specific details of Pepco\u2019s proposed [GRC].\u201d Noting that a \u201cutility is obligated to provide reasonable service and to invest in the maintenance and reliability of its distribution system as a normal duty.\u201d Mr. Smith stated that Pepeo had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>failed to document adequate reasons why a specific rider is needed to continue or expand its program of investments and tree trimming expenditures that is needed to deliver adequate and reasonable reliability of electric distribution service. Nor has the Company presented adequate cost-benefit analysis to justify its proposed additional charges to ratepayers for this surcharge. Relying on a surcharge for recovery of costs also unbalances the traditional regulatory process and rewards the Company by allowing rate recovery and financing costs for selected expenditures made between rate cases, and without the balanced review of all elements of the utilities revenue requirement that would occur in a rate case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Mr. Smith further asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">Pepeo has a line of credit to $350 million (for which Maryland ratepayers are being charged) and that existing credit line supports Pepco\u2019s access to low-cost temporary financing sources, such as commercial paper, that have a cost rate far below some of the long-term capital source such as Pepco\u2019s shareholder equity. The existence of Pepco\u2019s short-term borrowing sources and the lower finance costs associated with such sources should be considered in addressing whether and how Pepeo could finance authorized Grid Resiliency expenditures between rate cases, and also for determining the financing cost rate that should be applied if a new surcharge were to be authorized in the current case,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Anu\">(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">After considering all the evidence presented regarding Pep-co\u2019s GRC proposal, the Commission rendered its decision. The Commission began by explaining the \u201cbackdrop\u201d for its decision, as well as its general view on accelerated reliability work:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">As far back as August 2010, the reliability and resiliency of Maryland\u2019s electric distribution infrastructure has been one of the major focuses of this Commission. Since then we have departed from our traditional ratemaking principles by allowing end-of-test year reliability plant and three month <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>post-test year reliability spending adjustments in rate cases. In several of the rate cases since then we have been asked to approve a concurrent surcharge for proposed reliability projects, but to date we have found those proposals lacking. Last year, following the power outages throughout the State caused by the Derecho storm, the [Task Force] appointed by the Governor recommended that such reliability spending surcharges may be appropriate. It is with this backdrop that we consider in this case Pepco\u2019s proposed Grid Resiliency Charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-4\">The Company has identified specific infrastructure improvements that would produce accelerated and incremental reliability benefits. These projects, by virtue of their incremental benefits, are designed to exceed the scope of the utility\u2019s plan to realize their RM43 annual performance standards. We find that a properly defined tracker proposal, when aligned with specific and measurable milestones and expenditures, can be appropriate to support the projects that are required to address the immediate challenges to improving reliability in Maryland. Although the proposals for trackers presented to us to date have been lacking in certain areas, the need for accelerated reliability work coupled with an aligned cost recovery mechanism is in our view justified, and indeed beneficial to ratepayers, under certain circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">The [Task Force] Report stated that accelerated reliability cost recovery would be \u201cexclusively for accelerated and incremental investments and expenses.\u201d Hence, a paramount question for us in deciding whether to grant the Company\u2019s GRC Proposal is whether, on this current record, we find that the proposed projects are accelerated and incremental to what is required to meet the current minimum reliability standards. And if so, the next question is whether the level of increased reliability and resiliency gained warrant a departure from Commission precedent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The Commission then addressed Pepco\u2019s GRC proposal. With respect to the Advanced Priority Feeders, the only proposal at issue here, the Commission stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Company Witness Gausman stated that the priority feeders chosen under the GRC Proposal include \u201coutage data <em>without exclusions </em>for major events.\u201d (emphasis added). Currently, the Company takes corrective action on the poorest performing 3% of feeders, identified by a methodology that <em>excludes </em>major storm events. We find that the remediation to the priority feeders will provide cost effective incremental reliability benefits to the end users associated with feeders particularly prone to outages due to major storm events. The fact that this Accelerated Priority Feeders project includes 24 feeders <em>in addition </em>to the 55 feeders already in the 2013 base construction plan satisfies the acceleration component of the GRC.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Accordingly, the Commission approved Pepco\u2019s GRC proposal with respect to the Advanced Priority Feeders component, subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\"><em>First, </em>because this is a new tool we are considering undertaking for accelerated reliability work, we are obligated to the State and to the ratepayers to closely monitor the success and effectiveness of such a mechanism. To accomplish this, a tracker proposal must specifically identify a list of qualifying projects, a timeline, and interim milestones. The project descriptions must contain sufficient detail so as to track progress and related costs, and a commitment that any deviation from the project list requires further Commission approval. We recognize that the Company has supplied this information to some degree for the GRC. In this case, however, we direct the Company to provide additional detail for each feeder that includes the following: (1) a description of the proposed hardening work; (2) a performance objective for each project; (3) incremental milestones and estimated costs for each feeder project; and (4) estimated total costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\"><em>Second, </em>we also recognize that Company Witness Janocha laid the foundation for a detailed cost recovery mechanism and rate design in his discussion of a new tariff rider. We approve this methodology for calculating the revenue requirement and resulting charge under the GRC Rider. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>However, since we do not approve either the Vegetation Management or Selective Undergrounding components of the Company\u2019s GRC proposal at this time, we direct the Company to submit a revised calculation of revenue requirement to set the initial rates specific to the approved list of qualifying feeder projects as described by Witness Janocha. We note that the GRC cost recovery in 2014 attributed to priority feeders is estimated to be $0.06 per month for a typical residential customer. Given that the GRC would be limited in scope to the Accelerated Priority Feeders project, we decline to adopt the Company\u2019s proposed incentive structure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-4\"><em>Third, </em>we share the concerns and criticism by several of the other parties with respect to the lack of a sunset date and certain other consumer protection measures in the GRC proposal design. To this end, we direct the Company to submit a base rate case petition that aligns with the projected completion date of the qualifying projects, and stipulate that the qualifying projects and GRC revenues are subject to full review in the next base rate case following the completion of these projects. At that time, if the net capitalized amount of the qualifying projects is deemed reasonable and prudent, such costs will be rolled into the rate base resulting in termination of the GRC mechanism.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\"><em>Lastly, </em>we agree with concerns raised by several parties to the case that the Company\u2019s proposal in its current form does not contain assurances that expenditures will be just and reasonable. To this end, we direct the Company to provide an annual report to the Commission and Staff which includes: (1) the status of each project and respective milestones completed; (2) actual money spent to date on each project and respective milestone; (3) the reconciliation of projected costs and recoveries that includes a true-up calculation of over- and underrecoveries; and (4) a proposed rate for the GRC for the subsequent year, including bill impact estimates. Following the annual report submission, the Commission will issue an order to establish the Compa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>ny\u2019s proposed new annual GRC adjustment for the following year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The Commission then discussed why it denied the Accelerated Vegetation Management component of the GRC, as well as the Selective Undergrounding project. It then concluded by stating that it \u201cconditionally approve[d] [Pepco\u2019s] GRC proposal, limited in scope to its Advanced Priority Feeders component.\u201d Order No. 85724, at 159-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">On appeal, the circuit court affirmed the Commission\u2019s decision to allow the GRC, concluding that PU \u00a7 2\u2014112(b)(2) grants the Commission \u201cimplied and incidental powers needed or proper to carry out its functions\u201d and PU \u00a7 2-112(c) states that \u201cthe powers of the Commission shall be construed liberally.\u201d The court stated that the Commission \u201ccarefully considered Pepco\u2019s GRC proposal and based its decision on the testimony of the various witnesses,\u201d it \u201cprovided a reasoned explanation of partially granting Pepco\u2019s GRC request, and explained why it was willing to impose this surcharge, which it had previously declined to do in prior rate cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Statutory Authority to Approve the GRC</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">OPC and AARP argue that the Commission did not have statutory authority to approve the GRC. In particular, they assert that, pursuant to PU \u00a7 4-101, the Commission is authorized to approve rates only if they are \u201cjust and reasonable,\u201d and one requirement of just and reasonable rates is that the rate will result in an operating income that yields \u201ca reasonable return on the fair value of the public service company\u2019s property used and useful in providing service to the public.\u201d PU \u00a7 4-101(3). They assert that the Commission exceeded its statutory authority when it authorized cost recovery through the GRC because it authorized collection of a return on property before it was in service, and therefore, before it was \u201cused and useful\u201d in providing service to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Pepeo contends that this argument is not properly before this Court because appellants did not raise it before the Commission. In support, Pepco cites <em>Brodie v. Motor Vehicle Administration of Maryland, </em>367 Md. 1, 785 A.2d 747 (2001), for the proposition that \u201ca reviewing court will not consider a statutory interpretation argument unless [it] was presented to the agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">AARP does not dispute that it did not raise the issue of the Commission\u2019s authority to approve the GRC, but it asserts that this Court can address the issue nevertheless.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In support, it cites Md. Rule 8-131(a), asserting that \u201cissues about the jurisdiction of the trial court over the subject matter may be 'raised in and decided by the appellate court whether or not raised in and decided by the trial court.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">We agree with Pepeo that the issue whether the Commission exceeded its statutory authority in approving the GRC is not properly before this Court. In <em>Brodie, </em>367 Md. at 2, 785 A.2d 747, the Court of Appeals was presented with a single question: \u201c[W]hether the MVA was authorized to revoke a driver\u2019s license that already had been revoked.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court concluded that it was unable to address the question because that issue was raised for the first time in the circuit court. <em>Id. </em>at 3-4, 785 A.2d 747. The Court noted the general rule that, in an action for judicial review of an adjudicatory decision by an administrative agency, a reviewing court ordinarily</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">\u201cmay not pass upon issues presented to it for the first time on judicial review and that are not encompassed in the final decision of the administrative agency. Stated differently, a ... court will review an adjudicatory agency decision solely on the grounds relied upon by the agency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 4, 785 A.2d 747 (quoting <em>Dep\u2019t of Health v. Campbell, </em>364 Md. 108, 123, 771 A.2d 1051 (2001)). The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Since Brodie\u2019s entire challenge to the administrative decision was based on an issue not raised before the agency, the Circuit Court should have affirmed the administrative decision without reaching the issue. <em>Dept. of Health v. Campbell, supra, </em>364 Md. at 123-124, 771 A.2d at 1060 (\u201cBecause the issue ... [was] presented to the Circuit Court for the first time and never raised ... [before] the Administrative Law Judges, that court erred in\u201d ruling upon the issue). Likewise, we shall uphold the decisions below without reaching the only issue presented to us.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><em>Id. Accord Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n of Maryland v.

Indeed, as indicated, Mr. Dismukes, OPC\u2019s witness, stated that, with respect to the GRC, the Commission could \u201cdo whatever it wants in the public interest.\u201d Because the parties did not raise before the Commission the argument they raise on appeal, i.e., that the Commission did not have the statutory authority to approve the GRC, we will not address the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">We do not agree with AARP that this issue involves a question of jurisdiction that can be raised at any time. The Commission\u2019s <em>subject matter jurisdiction </em>to consider electric utility rate adjustments is not being challenged, but rather, the challenge is whether the statutory scheme permitted the Commission to approve the GRC, a \u201ctracker\u201d surcharge. In <em>Brodie, </em>367 Md. at 3-4, 785 A.2d 747, the Court of Appeals held that a challenge to the statutory authority of an administrative agency to take a certain action would not be reviewed by the appellate court if that argument was not made to the administrative agency. That holding compels our conclusion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>We turn, therefore, to the issues that are preserved for this Court\u2019s review.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Arbitrary and Capricious</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">OPC argues that \u201cthe Commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously\u201d in affirming the GRC. It asserts that, \u201cwithout any valid reason, [the Commission] contradicted three years of its own previous decisions imposing a \u2018known and measurable\u2019 standard\u201d on future test-year expenditures.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It contends that the Commission ignored traditional utility rate-making principles, and instead, it \u201cadopted an \u2018accelerated and incremental\u2019 standard for the GRC.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The Commission has broad powers under the Public Utilities Article to regulate utility rates. <em>See </em>PU \u00a7\u00a7 2-112, 2-113, 4-102. As this Court has explained, the \u201conly statutory imperative is to construct and approve just and reasonable rates ... which, among other things, fully consider and are consistent with the public good.\u201d <em>Bldg. Owners &amp; Managers Ass\u2019n of Metro. Baltimore, Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n of Maryland, </em>93 Md.App. 741, 762, 614 A.2d 1006 (1992) (citation and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">As appellees note, the terms \u201cknown and measurable\u201d are not included in the statute. OPC, therefore, does not allege in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>this argument that the Commission did not have authority to approve the GRC in the absence of costs that are known and measurable. Rather, OPC claims that the \u201cknown and measurable\u201d standard is what the Commission has used for reliability projects, in this case with the RMA3 and in previous cases, and the Commission\u2019s failure to do so in approving the GRC renders its decision arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">OPC acknowledges that the Commission may have some discretion to determine if a rate is \u201cjust and reasonable.\u201d It argues, however, that the Commission does not have discretion \u201cto arbitrarily adopt standards which appear to be irrational, inconsistent with previous agency decisions and enunciated policies adopted in prior cases regarding matters within its discretion, and without any adequate explanation for the inconsistency.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The Commission acknowledges that it previously has stated \u201cthat costs based only upon estimates are not known and measurable,\u201d and it has denied recovery for such costs. Both the Commission and Pepeo, however, assert that the decision to approve the GRC in this, case was not arbitrary because the proposal was different from those other cases, and there were circumstances justifying the different result here. The Commission states that the proposal here was based on more specific, verifiable estimates of costs through prior proposals. Moreover, Pepeo notes that, unlike other proposals, the Commission approved the GRC only after imposing conditions, which included detailed reporting by Pepeo and a sunset, at which time the Commission would make a determination \u201cwhether the expenditures were prudent.\u201d Moreover, both the Commission and Pepeo assert that the Commission gave a reasoned analysis why it approved the surcharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">As OPC notes, in <em>Harvey v. Marshall, </em>389 Md. 243, 302-03, 884 A.2d 1171 (2005), the Court of Appeals stated that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>agency action may be \u201c \u2018arbitrary or capricious\u2019 if it is irrationally inconsistent with previous agency decisions.\u201d Here, for the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the decision to approve the GRC was not arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">The parties agree that, in recent years, the Commission has rejected requests for surcharges, and it typically has denied recovery for estimated costs that are not \u201cknown and measurable.\u201d That does not, however, render the Commission\u2019s decision in this case arbitrary, for a couple of reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">First, the Commission\u2019s prior decisions were based on the specific facts of those cases, not a hard-and-fast rule that surcharges based on estimated expenses could never be approved. <em>See, e.g., In re Delmarva Power &amp; Light Co., </em>100 Md.P.S.C. 435, 443 (Dec. 30, 2009) (Case No. 9192, Order No. 83085) (\u201c[A]s a <em>general rule </em>\u201d the Commission is <em>\u201creluctant </em>to deviate from the costs and revenues incurred in a test year,\u201d but a \u201cpossible exception to the test year principle is reliability plant investment,\u201d which would depend on \u201cthe nature of the improvements and the revenue they generate.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>In re Delmarva Power &amp; Light Co., </em>102 Md.P.S.C. 236, 241 (Jul. 8, 2011) (Case No. 9249, Order No. 84170) (\u201c[N]ew and different circumstances might persuade [the Commission] to deviate from the principles that have driven our recent decisions not to allow infrastructure surcharges.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Second, a change in circumstances occurred. In 2012, the Derecho and Superstorm Sandy, and the power outages that ensued, revealed weaknesses in the electric grid infrastructure and the need to make accelerated repairs to achieve a more reliable system.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> One of the recommendations issued by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Task Force was to \u201callow a tracker cost recovery mechanism for accelerated and incremental investments.\u201d To improve resiliency, the Task Force recommended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-4\">Allowing utilities to recover costs through a tracker-like mechanism for the accelerated and incremental investment. Given that these investments would be above and beyond what is contemplated by the enhanced RM43 regulations, the Task Force believes that it would be appropriate to provide more contemporaneous cost recovery for these additional expenses. The tracker mechanism would not apply to the normal investment required to meet the enhanced RM43 regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The Commission made clear that this was the context in which its decision was made. It clearly explained its rationale for approving the GRC in this case, when it had denied requests for a surcharge in the past. It stated that, \u201calthough the proposals for trackers presented to us to date have been lacking in certain areas, the need for accelerated reliability work coupled with an aligned cost recovery mechanism is in our view justified, and indeed beneficial to ratepayers, under certain circumstances.\u201d The Commission noted that the GRC involved \u201cspecific infrastructure improvements that would produce acceleration and reliability benefits,\u201d which were designed to exceed Pepco\u2019s annual performance standards. It further found that \u201cthe remediation to the priority feeders will provide cost effective incremental reliability benefits to the end users associated with feeders particularly prone to outages due to major storm events.\u201d Accordingly, it approved Pepco\u2019s GRC proposal with respect to the Advanced Priority Feeders component, subject to conditions, set forth <em>supra, </em>that allowed the Commission to monitor the effectiveness of the GRC, including an annual report providing a reconciliation of projected costs and recoveries.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Thus, the Commission explained the reason why it departed from its prior practice of denying recovery of estimated costs that were not \u201cknown and measurable.\u201d In light of the circumstances, including \u201cthe need for accelerated reliability work,\u201d as well as the mechanism to monitor the cost-effectiveness of the tracker, we agree with the circuit court that the Commission did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in approving the GRC.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Substantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">AARP\u2019s next argument stems from the statement by the Commission that it was granting \u201ca limited rate increase and the partial GRC <em>due to the financial strain </em>of Pepco\u2019s increased reliability spending, and only while demanding specific and measurable improvements in Pepco\u2019s reliability performance exceeding those set forth in our present COMAR standards.\u201d (Emphasis added.). It asserts that there was \u201cno substantial evidence in the record to suggest Pepeo would have suffered any financial strain by making the $24 million of improvements in its feeder project without the imposition of the GRC surcharge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Pepeo and the Commission argue that AARP\u2019s focus on financial strain is misplaced. Pepeo asserts that \u201c[n]o statute, regulation or Commission precedent requires the Commission to make a finding that a company would suffer undue financial pressure by undertaking a project on an accelerated basis without contemporaneous recovery through a tracker.\u201d Rather, Pepeo contends, \u201cunder its plenary ratemaking authority, the Commission has the discretion to consider all relevant factors in determining whether to approve the GRC as a just and reasonable rate.\u201d Similarly, the Commission argues that the \u201ctest for whether the Commission can impose the GRC surcharge is not whether Pepeo can demonstrate financial strain if it is compelled to complete the $24 million without cost recovery but whether the GRC surcharge meet[s] the definition of a just and reasonable rate under PU[ ] \u00a7 4-101.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>We agree with appellees. To be sure, this Court has said that the traditional formula for ratemaking \u201censures that the utility can \u2018make ends meet.\u2019 \u201d <em>Heintz, </em>69 Md.App. at 87, 516 A.2d 599. The required analysis, however, is whether approved rates are \u201cjust and reasonable.\u201d Where, as here, the issue is whether a company should be permitted a surcharge to provide $24 million in reliability improvements that go above and beyond the legal requirements, the question is whether the requested surcharge is \u201cjust and reasonable,\u201d not whether the company has the ability to borrow the money to make these voluntary improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">Under the circumstances here, the Commission found that, with the appropriate monitoring and regulatory mechanisms in place, it was just and reasonable to compensate Pepeo for the financial burden of accelerating reliability projects in accordance with the recommendations in the Task Force report. There was substantial evidence in the record to find that the GRC was a just and reasonable charge. The circuit court properly rejected appellants\u2019 contention to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Return on Equity</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">OPC\u2019s next argument involves the Commission\u2019s determination granting Pepeo a ROE of 9.36%. It asserts that the Commission\u2019s determination regarding the ROE was supported by substantial evidence, and therefore, \u201cthe circuit court\u2019s decision should be reversed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Pepeo argues that the \u201ccircuit court correctly ruled that the Commission\u2019s ROE award was arbitrary and capricious and not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d It asserts that, although \u201c[t]he Commission framed the question presented to be whether anything had changed since the 2011 Rate Case, it then proceeded to ignore undisputed record evidence of what had changed in awarding a 9.36% ROE.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">As indicated, Pepeo requested a ROE of 10.25%. This was an increase from the 9.31% ROE that the Commission awarded in a Rate Case filed in 2011. <em>See In re Potomac Electric Power Co., </em>103 Md.P.S.C. 293 (Jul. 20, 2012) (Case No. 9286, Order No. 85028). Robert B. Hevert, Managing Partner of Sussex Economic Advisor, LLC, summarized his analysis regarding his 10.25% ROE recommendation, stating that he began with a review of the Commission\u2019s Order No. 85028 in the 2011 Rate Case. He explained that, in \u201ckeeping with the Commission\u2019s preference for the use of multiple analytical methods, [he] relied on three widely-accepted approaches: the Constant Growth Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model; two forms of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM); and the Bond Yield Plus Risk Premium approach.\u201d He stated that his \u201crecommendations and conclusions consider the Company\u2019s relatively small size and the extent to which the [BSA] mechanism may have a measurable effect on Pepco\u2019s Cost of Equity,\u201d and that he \u201ccalculated the costs of issuing common stock, and reflected those flotation costs in [his] estimate of the Company\u2019s Cost of Equity.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Mr. Hevert noted that the Commission had adjusted Pepco\u2019s ROE 50 basis points in the 2011 Rate Case as a result of the BSA. He argued that there should be no such adjustment in this case in light of subsequent orders by the Commission that diluted the rate-stabilizing effect of the BSA. Mr. Hevert stated that, \u201c[i]n the vast majority of cases, utility commissions have not made explicit adjustments to the authorized ROEs in response to the implementation of decoupling mechanisms,\u201d and therefore, he did not believe an adjustment of 50 basis points to Pepco\u2019s ROE was appropriate. He stated that a \u201cdownward adjustment of 10 basis points to, at most 25 basis points may be supported.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Subsequently, one Commissioner asked: \u201c[W]hat is the justification that indicates returns should increase really just kind of four months after we set a return of 9.31 percent ... what market indicators have revised so drastically\u201d to support Pepco\u2019s proposed increase? Mr. Hevert stated that he relied on a case giving another utility a 9.81% ROE, and then, \u201cbecause there was the 50 basis point adjustment for the BSA, that would put us at 10.31 percent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Commission Brenner later questioned Mr. Hevert about what had changed since Pepco\u2019s last rate case, in which the Commission set the ROE at 9.31%. Mr. Hevert acknowledged that interest rates were about the same, and the level of market volatility was \u201cabout the same as it was before.\u201d He continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">So I agree with you that the capital markets are not materially different than they were when the order came out. Certainly the data is different, certainly composition of some of the proxy groups are different____So when I put all those things together, I do think that the required return still would be in that range beginning with 10.25 percent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">Charles King, President Emeritus at Snavely King Majoros &amp; Associates, Inc., testified on behalf of OPC regarding the appropriate ROE. Mr. King explained that, under the current statutory and common law scheme,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>there are essentially three standards for determining an appropriate return on equity from the standpoint of the equity owners of a regulated utility. The first is the \u201ccomparable earnings\u201d standard, i.e., that the earnings must be \u201ccommensurate with the returns on investments in other enterprises having corresponding risks.\u201d The second is that earnings must be sufficient to assure \u201cconfidence in the financial integrity of the enterprise,\u201d and the third is that they must allow the utility to attract capital.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Using a \u201cclassic DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) procedure,\u201d Mr. King evaluated a selection of comparison utility companies and calculated a mean and median ROE of 9.61% and 9.34% respectively. With respect to the BSA, Mr. King agreed that the 50-basis point adjustment \u201cmight be too high,\u201d noting that the risk-reducing effect of the BSA had been eroded by the Commission\u2019s decision \u201cnot to incorporate the effects of major storms into that tracker. Without the assurance that the revenue lost from service interruptions resulting from major weather events, the BSA loses a portion of its risk-reducing potential.\u201d Mr. King ultimately recommended a ROE of 9.1% if the GRC was not approved and a ROE between 8.19 and 8.85% if the GRC was approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The Commission\u2019s Staff presented testimony from Dr. Ozlen D. Luznar, Regulatory Economist in the Commission\u2019s Division of Electricity, who recommended that a ROE for Pepeo \u201cbe set at 9.36% ... to earn a just and reasonable return to provide reliable service to its customers.\u201d With respect to the BSA, Dr. Luznar stated that, although the Commission in the past had approved a \u201c50 basis [point] adjustment to the final ROE due to the risk mitigating effects of the BSA,\u201d it recently had noted \u201cthe risk mitigating limitations of the BSA in the current regulatory environment.\u201d Accordingly, Dr. Luznar did not make an adjustment for the BSA in arriving at his recommended ROE of 9.36%.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The Commission, in making its decision regarding the ROE, noted that it had issued a decision addressing Pepco\u2019s application for a rate increase approximately four months prior to the application at issue here. In that case, it \u201cfound Pepco\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>request for a 10.75% ROE \u2018excessive and totally unjustified,\u2019 \u201d noting \u201cthat Pepeo faced minimal risk because of its status as a monopoly provider of electric distribution service, its lack of ownership of any generating facilities, and its stable service territory.\u201d It further \u201cfound that the low interest rate environment that existed at the time of the Order provided Pepeo with ample opportunity to attract necessary capital at reasonable rates.\u201d After considering the economic factors Pepeo faced at the time, the Company\u2019s need for capital, and its poor service reliability performance at the time, the Commission granted Pepco, in Case No. 9286, a ROE of 9.31%.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">The Commission turned to the present case. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">The obvious question in this case, therefore, regarding Pepco\u2019s request for a 10.25% ROE is, what has changed in less than one year since we last established a just and reasonable ROE, that now might justify a higher return?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">Pepeo has not demonstrated any significant changes in the economic environment faced by the Company. It is still a monopolistic provider of electric distribution service that operates in a stable service territory. Its customer base is heavily residential, which alleviates the risk of large scale closures or relocations faced by utilities operating in heavily dense commercial or industrial service territories. It does not own generation, which reduces the danger of market price fluctuations and environmental compliance issues faced by generation owners. Moreover, while the Company has taken certain actions to improve its reliability service, it is noteworthy that only four months passed between our determination on July 20, 2012 that Pepco\u2019s ROE should be 9.31%, and the Company\u2019s current filing for a new rate case on November 30, 2012.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">Pepeo is currently facing a low-interest rate environment, regardless of whether the cause is Federal Reserve policy, a continued slow recovery from a historic recession, or both. Given Pepco\u2019s predilection for filing rate cases frequently with the Commission, we see no logic in inflating Pepco\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>ROE today, during a time of historic low interest rates, based on speculation that those rates could increase sometime beyond the Company\u2019s likely rate effective period. Moreover, as Mr. Hevert and Mr. King testified, PHI had no difficulty raising a significant quantity of capital in its recent debt issuances. To the contrary, the Company generated $450 million of new long-term debt between April 2012 and March 2013. For that reason, OPC argues that Pepco\u2019s current ROE of 9.31% should be viewed as a ceiling on any ROE award. While we may not agree with OPC\u2019s strict ceiling, we do agree that Pepeo has demonstrated its access to necessary capital on reasonable terms through its recent debt issuances and capital infusions, and conversely has not demonstrated a need for an increase in its ROE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u201cFinding no significant factors that justified] a radical departure from the ROE previously granted to Pepeo,\u201d the Commission addressed the methodologies utilized by the parties to evaluate a just and reasonable ROE for Pepeo. The Commission then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">Considering all of the methodologies presented, we will accept Staffs recommended ROE of 9.36% as just and reasonable. In reaching this conclusion, we are guided by the principles of <em>Bluefield Water Works </em>and <em>Hope Natural Gas, </em>which require a return that is sufficient to attract capital on reasonable terms, maintain the financial integrity of the utility, and provide an opportunity to achieve a level of revenue commensurate with that available in other investments of similar risk. Both OPC and AOBA advocated for a lower ROE (9.1% and 9.3%, respectively), while Pepco\u2019s 10.25% proposal is anomalously high in relation to the other recommendations and well above the 9.31% ROE approved by the Commission less than one year ago.[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Order No. 85724, at 105-06 (footnotes omitted). The Commission explained that its approval of a 9.36% ROE included flotation costs, i.e., \u201cexpenses associated with the sale of new issues of common stock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">The Commission then stated that it would \u201cnot reduce Pepco\u2019s ROE by a specific amount because of its [BSA].\u201d It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-5\">The BSA was designed to account for changes in electricity usage due to variations in weather and state-mandated energy-efficiency and conservation programs, and to remove the disincentive a utility would otherwise have to promote such programs, which, in the absence of the BSA, could reduce the company\u2019s sales revenue. In Pepco\u2019s last rate case, we upheld a 50 basis point reduction to the Company\u2019s ROE as a result of the previous approval of Pepco\u2019s BSA. The BSA stabilizes Pepco\u2019s earnings by decoupling its distribution revenues from its volumetric sales, thereby helping ensure recovery of the Company\u2019s revenue requirement and reducing regulatory lag. Without the BSA, \u201cPepeo would see more dramatic swings in its earnings than currently.\u201d Because of those benefits, OPC and AOBA argue that Pepco\u2019s current ROE award should be reduced by a similar amount.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">As noted by Pepeo and Staff, however, we have recently issued two orders in Case No. 9257 that have somewhat altered the Company\u2019s risk as it relates to decoupling. In Order No. 84653, we determined that Maryland utilities with BSAs, including Pepeo, will be prohibited from collecting lost utility revenue through their decoupling mechanisms if the utilities are unable to restore service to their customers within 24 hours of the onset of a Major Storm. We stated that the BSA suspension will exist for the time period beginning 24 hours after the onset of a Major Storm and continuing until all Major Storm-related interruptions are restored. In the more recent Order No. 85177, we determined that utilities will be prevented from collecting decoupling revenue even during the first 24 hours of a Major Outage Event. As a result of these orders, the risk-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>reducing benefits of the BSA to Pepeo are somewhat diminished, and the rationale for an explicit reduction in the ROE less certain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 106-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The Commission then noted that, in a prior order issued on February 22, 2013, it had found that, although the BSA \u201cserves to limit the risk, and therefore the appropriate ROE,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 108 n. 463, given \u201cthe issuance of Order Nos. 84653 and 85177, and the greater prevalence of BSAs in electric utility proxy groups ... \u2018a strict basis point reduction of 50 points may no longer be warranted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108. The Commission then concluded: \u201cWe find so here as well. We will not reduce Pepco\u2019s ROE by an express amount as a result of its BSA, though we will, as in BGE\u2019s proceeding, consider the BSA as one of many relevant variables that informs our determination of a just and reasonable return.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The circuit court reversed the Commission\u2019s decision on the ROE, stating that the Commission framed the issue as \u201cwhat has changed\u201d since Pepco\u2019s last rate case, in which the Commission penalized Pepeo with a 100-point basis reduction, 50 points for the BSA and 50 points for service problems, but the Commission then \u201cfailed to make findings about improvements Pepeo had made to service or how much the BSA should reduce the ROE in the current case.\u201d The circuit court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">Had the Commission simply based its ruling on the evidence presented at the April 2013 evidentiary hearings, then [ ] under the deferential substantial evidence test, the [c]ourt would likely uphold the Commission\u2019s decision. But the Commission instead linked its decision in this case to the prior 2011 rate case while ignoring evidence of Pepeo\u2019s service reliability improvements and not specifying how the BSA would impact Pepco\u2019s ROE beyond being a \u201crelevant factor\u201d in the Commission\u2019s discretion. The Commission therefore failed to act reasonably.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Accordingly, the circuit court reversed on this issue and \u201cremand[ed] the case to the Commission with instructions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>make more specific findings regarding the impact of improved service reliability and the BSA in calculating Pepco\u2019s ROE.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Just and Reasonable Rate</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">OPC contends that the Commission\u2019s determination regarding the ROE was supported by substantial evidence, and therefore, the circuit court\u2019s decision should be reversed. It asserts that the circuit court exceeded its \u201cscope of review in speculating that the Commission\u2019s decision somehow incorporated a 50 basis point (0.5%) penalty that was imposed upon Pepeo in its prior rate case ... for providing poor service,\u201d but a review of the record reveals that the Commission\u2019s decision \u201cwas based upon, and supported by, the expert evidence in <em>this </em>case.\u201d OPC states that there are only two questions involved in review of the Commission\u2019s determination regarding the ROE: (1) \u201cwas there substantial evidence to support the Commission\u2019s determination that Pepeo should be authorized a 9.36% return on equity?\u201d; and (2) \u201cis the final rate afforded to Pepeo just and reasonable, or, not so low as to be confiscatory?\u201d OPC asserts that, if the answer to both questions is yes, the Commission\u2019s decision was proper and the circuit court\u2019s decision should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Pepeo argues that the circuit court \u201ccorrectly ruled that the Commission\u2019s ROE award was arbitrary and capricious and not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d It notes that, in 2011, the Commission awarded it a 9.31% ROE, which was the result of a full percentage point reduction, a 50 basis point penalty for service reliability issues and a 50 basis point reduction to account for the \u201crisk reducing effects of the BSA.\u201d It argues that, \u201cwithout these two 50 basis point reductions, the Commission in 2011 would have awarded Pep-eo an ROE of 10.31%,\u201d as opposed to 9.31%. Pepeo contends that, although \u201cthe Commission framed the question presented to be whether anything had changed since the 2011 Rate Case, it then proceeded to ignore undisputed record evidence of what had changed in awarding a 9.36% ROE.\u201d In particular, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Pepeo states that the Commission: (1) \u201cignored the undisputed evidence of Pepco\u2019s dramatically improved service quality and failed to make any findings as to service quality\u201d; and (2) \u201cfailed to explain or make findings regarding the BSA\u2019s impact on the ROE it awarded,\u201d asserting that the Commission\u2019s \u201cstatement that it was taking the BSA into account in establishing [the] ROE cannot be reconciled with the testimony of the Staff witness Dr. Luznar whose specific recommendation the Commission expressly adopted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">In assessing the parties\u2019 contentions, it is important to keep in mind the purpose of the ROE, as well as the scope of judicial review of the Commission\u2019s determination regarding this factual issue. As indicated, utilities are entitled to a rate that will yield a reasonable return on the value of property used to render service:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">A public utility is entitled to such rates as will permit it to earn a return on the value of the property which it employs for the convenience of the public equal to that generally being made at the same time and in the same general part of the country on investments in other business undertakings which are attended by corresponding risks and uncertainties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-6\"><em>Bluefield Waterworks, </em>262 U.S. at 692, 43 S.Ct. 675. Whether a rate of return is reasonable depends on many circumstances, including the money market, business conditions, and the amount of risk involved. <em>Id. </em>at 693, 43 S.Ct. 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">In <em>Federal Power Commission, </em>320 U.S. at 603, 64 S.Ct. 281 the United States Supreme Court made clear that judicial review of a Commission ratemaking order focuses on whether the rate order is \u201cjust and reasonable.\u201d The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar\">Under the statutory standard of \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 it is the result reached not the method employed which is controlling. It is not theory but the impact of the rate order which counts. If the total effect of the rate order cannot be said to be unjust and unreasonable, judicial inquiry under the Act is at an end. The fact that the method employed to reach that result may contain infirmities is not then impor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>tant. Moreover, the Commission\u2019s order does not become suspect by reason of the fact that it is challenged. It is the product of expert judgment which carries a presumption of validity. And he who would upset the rate order under the Act carries the heavy burden of making a convincing showing that it is invalid because it is unjust and unreasonable in its consequences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 602, 64 S.Ct. 281 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The Court of Appeals similarly has recognized the discretion of the Commission in determining the rate of return, as well as \u201cthe limited nature of our role on judicial review.\u201d <em>Potomac Edison Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>279 Md. 573, 581, 369 A.2d 1035 (1977). As long as the ROE is within \u201cthe zone of reasonableness,\u201d judicial scrutiny in the ratemaking process ends. <em>Id. </em>at 582-83, 369 A.2d 1035.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Here, there is no argument that the rate approved, including the ROE, was not in the zone of reasonableness. Rather, the argument is a procedural one, i.e., that the Commission framed the issue as what had changed since the last rate proceeding, but then it failed to address why the previous 100 basis point reduction was inapplicable to the present case. We do not agree that there was any impropriety here.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">To be sure, the Commission discussed the prior rate case that was decided approximately one year earlier, but it did so in the context of the economic factors relevant to addressing the appropriate ROE in this case. The Commission found that there were not \u201csignificant changes in the economic environment,\u201d noting that Pepeo still was \u201ca monopolistic provider of electric distribution service that operates in a stable service territory,\u201d its customer base was \u201cheavily residential, which alleviates the risk of large scale closures or relocations faces by utilities operating in heavily dense commercial or industrial service territories,\u201d Pepeo was facing a \u201clow-interest rate environment,\u201d and it had generated \u201ca significant quantity of capital in its recent debt issuances.\u201d In light of those factors, the Commission found that there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>showing justifying \u201ca radical departure from the ROE previously granted to Pepeo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">The Commission then turned to the testimony of the witnesses, who \u201cprovided similar analytical methods for evaluating a just and reasonable ROE.\u201d It rejected OPC\u2019s argument that, because Pepeo had not demonstrated a need for an increase in its ROE, the 9.31% current rate should be the ceiling, and it rejected Pepco\u2019s \u201canomalously high\u201d proposal of 10.25%, noting that Pepco\u2019s unreasonable \u201cuse of weighting factors and overreliance on generation-owning utilities\u201d in its proxy group contributed to its excessive proposal, as did its proposal for flotation costs using a premise that the Commission repeatedly had rejected. Instead, the Commission accepted the recommendation of Dr. Luznar of a 9.36% ROE as just and reasonable. In so finding, the Commission noted that Pepeo was entitled to \u201ca return that is sufficient to attract capital on reasonable terms, maintain the financial integrity of the utility, and provide an opportunity to achieve a level of revenue commensurate with that available in other investments of similar risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Applying the principles of judicial review of a decision of the Commission on the rate of return, we cannot say that the decision here was arbitrary or unsupported by substantial evidence. The Commission set forth the factors that it considered in arriving at the ROE, and there was substantial evidence to support its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Pepeo contends, however, that the decision was defective because the Commission stated that it adopted the ROE recommended by Dr. Luznar, but Dr. Luznar did not include any reduction for the BSA in her recommended 9.36% ROE, whereas the Commission did take the BSA into account as a \u201cvariable.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The Commission clearly explained that, although it previously had upheld a 50 basis point reduction to the ROE as a result of the BSA because it helped to stabilize a utility\u2019s earnings, its recent orders preventing the collection of lost revenue after a major storm had diminished the risk-reducing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>benefits of the BSA. Nevertheless, the Commission stated that, although the BSA did not warrant a reduction of the ROE \u201cby an express amount,\u201d the BSA would be considered \u201cas one of many relevant variables that informs our determination of a just and reasonable return.\u201d The Commission noted that its decision in this case was similar to that in a previous case, where it found that the BSA, although limited by recent orders, continues to \u201climit the risk, and therefore the appropriate ROE.\u201d We perceive no abuse of discretion by the Commission in considering the BSA as a factor in determining a just and reasonable return for Pepeo.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">In sum, appellants have failed to show that the 9.36% ROE awarded was not just and reasonable based on this evidence presented to the Commissioner. Accordingly, the decision should be upheld, and the circuit court erred in reversing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.
