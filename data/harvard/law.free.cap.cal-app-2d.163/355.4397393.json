J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZO\">Thomas Jackson was charged by information in Count I with selling, furnishing and giving away a preparation of heroin on February 25, 1957; in Count II, with selling and furnishing a substance falsely represented to be a narcotic on March 2, 1957; and in Count III, with the commission of a like offense on March 5,1957. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11500, 11502.) It was also alleged that defendant had suffered two previous felony convictions and had served terms of imprisonment therefor in state prison. Jackson pleaded not guilty and denied the prior convictions. Trial was to the court. As shown by the reporter\u2019s transcript the court found defendant guilty as charged in the information. As shown by the clerk\u2019s transcript he was found guilty on Count III and the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>also found to be true the allegations of the prior convictions. Jackson\u2019s application for probation was denied. The court dismissed Counts I and II of the information and sentenced defendant to state prison on Count III for the term prescribed by law. Jackson appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The evidence consisted of that received at the preliminary hearing and additional evidence introduced at the trial. Bart Natisin, a Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s deputy assigned to the narcotics detail, was the chief witness for the People. The following is the substance of his testimony. On February 25, 1957, the officer listened to a telephone conversation between defendant and a female informant over the ear piece of the latter\u2019s telephone. Natisin stated that he heard the informer tell Jackson that she \u201chad a cat who would like to score and who had $25.00 to go.\u201d In the officer\u2019s expert opinion, the word \u201ccat\u201d signified a person familiar with narcotics and the word \u201cscore\u201d meant to purchase a narcotic; the phrase \u201c$25.00 to go\u201d referred to the agreed purchase price. At about 2:30 p. m., Natisin and the informer drove to the corner of Santa Barbara Avenue and Figueroa Street in the city of Los Angeles, where they met defendant. Jackson said to the informant: \u201cLet\u2019s take a walk and get the bread [i.e., the money] first.\u201d Defendant and the informer walked away; they were gone for a few minutes. Upon their return, they got into the officer\u2019s car. Defendant handed a small bindle to the informer, who gave it to Natisin. The bindle was proved to contain heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">At about 3:30 p. m. on March 2, 1957, Natisin and the informant drove to the corner of 60th Street and Western Avenue in Los Angeles. Defendant arrived shortly thereafter and said: \u201cLet\u2019s take a walk.\u201d Jackson departed, accompanied by the informer. The latter returned after a few minutes and told Natisin that defendant wanted the rest of his money. Natisin walked over to Jackson\u2019s ear, which was parked around the corner. Defendant said: \u201cThe stuff is by your foot, right at the rear of the ear.\u201d The officer retrieved a small package from the ground beside the car and gave defendant $5.00. He then asked Jackson whether he could buy a half ounce of heroin. Defendant said that \u201cthe stuff would be real good\u201d and told the officer to telephone him. Inside the package retrieved by Natisin was a white powder which was proved not to contain a narcotic.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">On March 5, 1957, Officer Natisin telephoned defendant and arranged to meet him that afternoon. Around 3 :30 p. m. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>the officer drove to the Better Foods Market at Santa Barbara and Western Avenues in Los Angeles and parked on the parking lot. He had in his possession $175 in currency. Defendant drove onto the lot, parked, and walked toward Natisin\u2019s car. As Jackson approached, the officer saw him drop a small package beside the left rear tire of another car. Natisin handed defendant $75, got out of his car, picked up the bindle, and left a $100 bill in its place. The bindle contained a white powder which was proved to be milk sugar. The three packages purchased by the officer were received in evidence without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Officer Natisin testified on cross-examination that the informant had been arrested for a narcotics violation prior to February 25th and that he was aware of that fact at the time he first met defendant. He also stated that the informant began her telephone conversation with defendant by saying: \u201cThis is Julie.\u201d She did not give her last name to defendant. This testimony was elicited over the objections of the deputy district attorney that it involved confidential information. In arguing that the information was not confidential, defendant\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cWell, the defendant knows the informant, so it couldn\u2019t be confidential.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Jackson was arrested at his home in the late afternoon of March 5th by J. R Stroh, a Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s deputy and several other officers. The officers had neither a search warrant nor a warrant for defendant\u2019s arrest. Officer Stroh testified that he had furnished Officer Natisin with $175 in currency earlier the same day. The bills were of the following denominations: One $100 bill, five $10 bills and five $5.00 bills. Stroh dusted the bills with anthracine powder, a fluorescent substance, before giving them to Natisin and made a note of the serial numbers. About $200 was found on defendant\u2019s person after his arrest. Stroh tested the money with an ultra-violet light and found traces of fluorescent powder on bills of the same denominations as those he had given to Natisin. There were also traces of powder on Jackson\u2019s hands. The officer compared the serial numbers of the bills discovered in defendant\u2019s pockets with the numbers of the bills he had previously given to Natisin; they were identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Upon being questioned by the officers, Jackson said that a \u201ccat\u201d had given him the $200 found on his person. Stroh asked him \u201cFor what?\u201d and defendant replied \u201cYou know.\u201d The officers then asked Jackson whether he had any narcotics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>paraphernalia and defendant said that he did. Jackson led them to the bathroom and showed them some hypodermic needles and some packages of powder; one of the packages was proved to contain heroin while the others were proved to contain milk sugar. When asked how much heroin he was selling and how much he was using, defendant told the officers: \u201cMan, I use as much as I can sell.\u201d The needles and powders found in defendant\u2019s home were received in evidence without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">With respect to the prior convictions, the People introduced in evidence certified copies of official records showing that one Thomas Jackson had previously been convicted of two felonies and had served terms of imprisonment therefor in a California state prison. It was stipulated that defendant was the person named in the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Defendant testified that he did not sell any heroin to Officer Natisin. He did not give any packages to the officer. On two or three occasions, he was approached by Natisin and a Miss Julie Smith, whom he already knew. Miss Smith introduced Natisin to defendant; Natisin asked him if he could arrange to obtain narcotics, but Jackson refused. Defendant stated that he had between $60 and $80 on his person at the time of his arrest. The money belonged to him and he did not get it from the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">As we said earlier, the court found defendant guilty of the three offenses alleged in the information, but dismissed the charges involving the transactions occurring February 25th and March 2nd.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Upon request for appointment of counsel on the present appeal, the court referred the matter to the Los Angeles Bar Association Committee on Criminal Appeals for report to the court as to possible merit in the appeal. The matter was assigned to a member of the committee who has made written report to the court stating that the record had been examined and that in the opinion of the attorney it disclosed no valid ground of appeal. After we had examined the record, the request for appointment of counsel was denied. Defendant was duly so advised and his time to file a brief was substantially extended. No brief has been filed. In accordance with our practice, we have made a thorough study of the record. We have discovered no insufficiency of the evidence and no error at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">Section 11502 of the Health and Safety Code provides in material part: \u201cEvery person who agrees, consents, or . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>offers to unlawfully sell, furnish, ... or give any narcotic to any person, . . . and then sells, delivers, furnishes, . . . or gives, . . . any other liquid, substance, or material in lieu of any narcotic shall be punished by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than one year, or in the state prison for not more than 10 years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The evidence was sufficient to establish that defendant committed a violation of the statute on March 5, 1957. The testimony of the deputies warranted the court in finding that defendant agreed to sell a half ounce of heroin to Officer Natisin, that the officer gave defendant $175 for the narcotics, and that Jackson gave the officer in exchange a substance which proved to be milk sugar. Although defendant denied selling anything to Natisin, his testimony created only a conflict in the evidence, which was resolved against him by the trier of fact. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pastrana, </em>136 Cal.App.2d 358 [288 P.2d 568].)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Defendant was represented by counsel at the trial and his counsel did not object to the introduction in evidence of the substance he sold to Natisin or the narcotics paraphernalia taken from his home. In the absence of a proper objection in the trial court, the admissibility of the evidence may not be questioned on the appeal. (3 Cal.Jur.2d 634.)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">Wood (Parker), J., and Vall\u00e9e, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
