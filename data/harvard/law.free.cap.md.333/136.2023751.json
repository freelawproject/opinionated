BELL, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">This appeal and cross-appeal from the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, which dismissed all but one of the claims before it, require this Court to determine whether the insurer under an \u201cexcess\u201d or \u201cumbrella\u201d personal liability policy that includes automobile liability excess coverage must offer in writing to the insured uninsured motorist coverage up to the limits of the excess automobile liability coverage. That inquiry focuses on Maryland Code (1957,1991 Repl.Vol.) Art. 48A, \u00a7 541(c)(2) and (f). This case also presents the issue whether, by alleging the failure of the insurer and its agent to advise the insured that he could purchase uninsured motorist coverage equal to the liability coverage of the \u201cexcess\u201d or \u201cumbrella\u201d policy, the appellants stated a cognizable claim in negligence against the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">While appellant Christine Popham (\u201cChristine\u201d) was a passenger, an automobile driven by Michael Paul Dowling was involved in a one car accident. As a result, Christine suffered serious and permanent injuries and incurred more than $40,-000 in medical expenses. The automobile driven by Dowling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>was insured by the Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund (\u201cMAIF\u201d), with personal injury liability coverage limits of $20,000/$40,000. Christine was an additional insured on two insurance policies issued to her father, appellant Douglas G. Popham (\u201cPopham\u201d) by appellee State Farm Mutual Insurance Co., Inc. (\u201cState Farm\u201d). One, a family automobile insurance policy, provided uninsured motorist insurance coverage, in the same amount as its liability coverage, of $100,000/ $300,000. The other, an \u201cexcess\u201d personal liability insurance policy, contained liability coverage of $1,000,000, but no uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The appellants sued State Farm and its agent, appellee Walter Menage (\u201cMenage\u201d). As to State Farm, relying on Maryland Code (1957, 1991 RepLVol.) Article 48A, \u00a7 541(c)(2), they sought a declaration that they were entitled to uninsured motorist liability insurance coverage under the umbrella policy in the same amount as the liability coverage it provided. In another count, they alleged that both appellees negligently failed to comply with their common law duty to advise Pop-ham, \u201cin writing and in a reasonably commercial manner\u201d of the right to purchase in connection with the umbrella policy, uninsured motorist insurance coverage in the same amount as the liability coverage that policy offered.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The appellees moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> each count of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>appellants\u2019 complaint pertaining to them. The trial court granted the motion following a hearing, ruling that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfQD\">it is the finding by this Honorable Court that the personal liability umbrella policy or excess policy issued by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company to Douglas Popham is a motor vehicle liability policy as contemplated by Art. 48A, \u00a7 541(c), and as such it would ordinarily be subject to Art. 48A, \u00a7 541(c)(2), which would require the insurer to provide written notice to the insured of the opportunity to purchase uninsured motorist coverage in an amount equal to the liability limits of the policy; however, this Court further finds that the legislative intent of Art. 48A, \u00a7 541(f), which states that \u201cPolicies of insurance that have as their primary purpose to provide coverage in excess of other valid and collectible insurance or qualified self-insurance <em>may </em>include uninsured motorist coverage as provided in subsection (c) of this section\u201d (emphasis supplied), is that umbrella or excess policies were not to be included in the definition of motor vehicle liability insurance policies, or, alternatively, was to create an exclusion or exemption to the requirements of \u00a7 541(c)(2)....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Finding no just cause for delay, it entered final judgment in favor of the appellees pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-602(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>The appellants timely appealed to the Court <em>of </em>Special Appeals and the appellees cross-appealed, challenging the finding that an excess or umbrella insurance policy is a motor liability policy as contemplated by Art. 48A, \u00a7 541(c). We granted certiorari on our own motion prior to consideration by the Court of Special Appeals in order to consider the issues raised by the appeal and cross-appeal, 329 Md. 22, 616 A.2d 1286.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Unless an appeal is from a final judgment, the appellate court does not acquire subject matter jurisdiction to review it. <em>Sisk &amp; Son v. Friendship Packers, </em>326 Md. 152, 158, 604 A.2d 69, 72 (1992); <em>Estep v. Georgetown Design, </em>320 Md. 277, 282, 577 A.2d 78, 80 (1990). A judgment is final if it is \u201cso far final as to determine and conclude the rights involved in the action, or to deny to the party seeking redress by the appeal the means of further prosecuting or defending his rights and interests in the subject matter of the proceeding.\u201d <em>In Re Buckler Trusts, </em>144 Md. 424, 427, 125 A. 177, 178 (1924). <em>See also Baltimore City Department of Social Services v. Stein, </em>328 Md. 1, 10, 612 A.2d 880, 884 (1992); <em>Sigma Repro. Health Center v. State, </em>297 Md. 660, 665, 467 A.2d 483, 485 (1983); <em>Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Company v.

In other words, in addition to being intended as an unqualified, final disposition of the matter in controversy, <em>Friendship Packers, </em>326 Md. at 159, 604 A.2d at 72; <em>Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. at 41, 566 A.2d at 773, \u201c[t]he judgment must settle the rights of the parties, thereby concluding the cause of action.\u201d <em>Estep v. Georgetown Leather Design, </em>320 Md. 277, 282, 577 A.2d at 80-81 (1990). <em>See also Stein, </em>328 Md. at 9-10, 612 A.2d at 884; <em>Wilde v. Swanson, </em>314 Md. 80, 84, 548 A.2d 837, 839 (1988); <em>Houghton v. County Commissioners, </em>305 Md. 407, 412, 504 A.2d 1145, 1148, on reconsideration, 307 Md. 216, 513 A.2d 291 (1986); <em>Highfield Water Company v. Washington Sanitary District, </em>295 Md. 410, 415, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>456 A.2d 371, 373 (1983); <em>Schultz v. Pritts, </em>291 Md. 1, 6, 432 A.2d 1319, 1322 (1981). Of course, the clerk must make a proper record of the judgment in accordance with Maryland Rule 2-601. <em>Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. at 41, 566 A.2d at 773. And, when the judgment does not adjudicate all of the claims of the parties, the court must act in accordance with Maryland Rule 2-602(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Waters v. U.S.F. &amp; G., </em>328 Md. 700, 707, 616 A.2d 884, 887 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">As we have seen, the trial court entered final judgment pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-602(b). When it did so, however, there was pending the claim against Dowling and both the appellants\u2019 motion for reconsideration, filed within three days of the court\u2019s oral ruling, and the appellees\u2019 motion to strike the motion for reconsideration. The docket reflects that the court has not yet ruled on either motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">When it ruled orally, the court contemplated, and so advised counsel, that it would sign an order, embodying that ruling, to be submitted by the appellees\u2019 counsel. Clearly, the oral ruling was not, and could not be, a final judgment. <em>See Waller v. Maryland Nat'l Bank, </em>332 Md. 375, 377-80, 631 A.2d 447, 448-49 (1993); Maryland Rule 2-602(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This raises the question whether unresolved motions filed in response to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>ruling not yet final are impediments to appeal when that ruling subsequently is made final when the court signs an order embodying it and containing the certification required by Maryland Rule 2-602(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Both the motion for reconsideration and the answering motion to strike related to an opinion of the court not yet embodied in a judgment. While the finality of a judgment, otherwise final, is lost when a party files a motion pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-533, 2-534, or 2-535, within ten days of its entry, <em>Alitalia Linee Aeree Italiane v. Tomillo, </em>320 Md. 192, 200, 577 A.2d 34, 38 (1990); <em>B &amp; K Rental v. Universal Lift, </em>319 Md. 127, 132, 571 A.2d 1213, 1215-16 (1990); <em>Yarema v. Exxon Corp., </em>305 Md. 219, 241 n. 19, 503 A.2d 239, 250 n. 19 (1986) ; <em>Unnamed Att\u2019y v. Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n, </em>303 Md. 473, 486, 494 A.2d 940, 946 (1985), no such effect obtains when a motion to reconsider is filed in connection -with an opinion, or non-final order, of the trial court. This is so because no appeal lies from the opinion of a trial court which is not embodied in a judgment. <em>Gluckstern v. Sutton, </em>319 Md. 634, 650, 574 A.2d 898, 906 <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 950, 111 S.Ct. 369, 112 L.Ed.2d 331 (1990); <em>Billman v. Maryland Deposit Ins. Fund, </em>312 Md. 128, 132, 538 A.2d 1172, 1174 (1988); <em>Doehring v. Wagner, </em>311 Md. 272, 274, 533 A.2d 1300, 1301 (1987); <em>Administrator, Motor Vehicles Administration v. Vogt, </em>267 Md. 660, 665, 299 A.2d 1, 3-4 (1973); <em>Alberstadt v. Alberstadt, </em>257 Md. 552, 553, 263 A.2d 535, 535-36 (1970); <em>Hudson Building Supply Company v. Stulman, </em>258 Md. 304, 307, 265 A.2d 925, 926 (1970). When the court entered final judgment, taking the action challenged by one side, but urged by the other, it rendered moot both the motion to reconsider and the motion to strike. Therefore, neither did, or could, affect the finality of that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Maryland Code (1957, 1990 Cum.Supp.) Article 48A, \u00a7 541(c)(2), in effect at the time of the accident, in pertinent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>part, provided:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">In addition to any other coverage required by this subtitle, every policy of motor vehicle liability insurance issued, sold, or delivered in this State after July 1, 1975 shall contain coverage, in at least the amount required under Title 17 of the Transportation Article, for damages which the insured is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of bodily injuries sustained in an accident arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of such uninsured motor vehicle. <em>There shall be offered in writing to the insured the opportunity to contract for higher amounts than those provided under Title 17 of the Transportation Article if these amounts do not exceed the amounts of the motor vehicle liability coverage provided by the </em>policy____ (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Section 541 was added to the Insurance Code in 1972. <em>See </em>Ch. 73, Acts of 1972. Subsection (c) did not, at that time, however, contain a provision comparable to that emphasized above. It was amended by Ch. 510, Acts of 1981. In addition to breaking the subsection down into paragraphs, that amendment added a provision to subsection (c)(2) requiring insurers to make \u201cavailable to the insured the opportunity to contract for higher amounts than those provided under Title 17 of the Transportation Article if these amounts do not exceed the amount of the motor vehicle liability coverage provided by the policy.\u201d That language remained unchanged until 1989, when the word \u201cavailable\u201d was replaced with \u201coffered in writing.\u201d <em>See </em>Ch. 542, Acts of 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Subsection (f) was added to section 541 in 1983, along with subsection (e). <em>See </em>Ch. 656, Acts of 1983. Unchanged since its enactment, it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">(f) <em>Uninsured motorist coverage in policies providing coverage in excess of other insurance. </em>\u2014 Policies of insurance that have as their primary purpose to provide coverage in excess of other valid and collectible insurance or qualified self insurance may include uninsured motorist coverage as provided in subsection (c) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">The trial court found both that a personal liability insurance policy providing motor vehicle liability coverage is a motor vehicle liability policy and that, by enacting section 541(f), the Legislature either intended that such policies not be motor vehicle liability policies or that they be excluded or exempted from the requirements of section 541(c)(2). Neither the appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>lants nor the appellees was completely satisfied with that ruling. Relying on <em>Cohen v. American Home Assurance Co., </em>367 So.2d 677 (Fla.App.1979) and <em>Southern American Insurance Co. v. Dobson, </em>441 So.2d 1185 (La.1983), the appellants are in total agreement with the trial court\u2019s ruling that umbrella or excess policies providing motor vehicle liability coverage fall within the definition of motor vehicle liability policy. The appellants adamantly disagree, however, that the Legislature intended to exempt such policies from the requirements of subsection (c)(2). Among the reasons they proffer for that disagreement is that, had the Legislature wanted to exempt umbrella or excess policies, it could, and would, have done so more directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Appellees agree with the trial court that, in enacting section 541(f), the Legislature intended to exclude umbrella or excess policies from the reach of subsection (c)(2). They do not accept, however, that an excess or umbrella policy is a motor vehicle liability insurance policy. When the nature and purpose of each is considered, they argue, there is a clear distinction between an umbrella or excess insurance policy and a motor vehicle liability insurance policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">A motor vehicle liability insurance policy is specific in providing protection or certain coverages to identified or defined insureds using the described vehicle, or in some instances, a non-owned vehicle and, as such, only insures against the risks of loss arising from the use and maintenance of the specific motor vehicle.... On the other hand, an umbrella or excess policy is procured by an insured to provide insurance coverage in excess of other \u201cunderlying\u201d insurance policies.... It is not tied to a specific automobile (and may not provide any automobile related coverage), but is designed to protect the insured against catastrophic losses.... An umbrella policy \u201cassumes a risk of much less frequent occurrence, <em>i.e., </em>the risk of judgments in excess of primary policy limits, and accordingly carries premiums which reflect the lesser magnitude of this risk.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqg\">Appellees\u2019 Brief at 4-5 (citations omitted). The appellees support their position with cases applying the Delaware and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Alabama statutes. <em>See, e.g., O\u2019Hanlon v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Company, </em>639 F.2d 1019 (3rd Cir.1981); <em>Trinity Universal Insurance Company v. Metzger, </em>360 So.2d 960 (Ala.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Determining the correctness of the trial court\u2019s findings presents questions of statutory construction. We recently reviewed some of the principles of statutory construction in <em>G.E.I.C.O. v. Insurance Commissioner, </em>332 Md. 124, 630 A.2d 713 (1993). Noting that the primary goal of statutory construction is discerning the legislative intent, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">We begin our search for legislative intent with the words of the statute to be interpreted, <em>Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 145-46, 626 A.2d 946, 950 (1993); <em>State v.

Context may include related statutes, pertinent legislative history and \u201cother material that fairly bears on the ... fundamental issue of legislative purpose or goal----\u201d <em>Kaczorowski, </em>309 Md. at 515, 525 A.2d at 632-33.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 131, 630 A.2d at 717. <em>See also State v. Thompson, </em>332 Md. 1, 6-7, 629 A.2d 731, 734 (1993). Statutes which are a part of a statutory scheme are to be construed together and in light of the statutory scheme, <em>State v. Crescent City Jaycees Foundation, Inc., </em>330 Md. 460, 468, 624 A.2d 955, 959 (1993); <em>State v. Bricker, </em>321 Md. 86, 93, 581 A.2d 9, 12 (1990), and harmonized to the extent possible. Neither should be read, however, \u201cso as to render the other or any portion of it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>meaningless, surplusage, superfluous, or nugatory.\u201d <em>G.E.I.C.O. v. Insurance Commissioner, </em>332 Md. at 132, 630 A.2d at 717. <em>See Tracey v. Tracey, </em>328 Md. 380, 387, 614 A.2d 590, 594 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">The appellants note that, by its literal terms, \u00a7 541(c)(2) applies to \u201cevery policy of motor vehicle liability insurance.\u201d It does not distinguish between those policies that provide primary coverage and those that provide excess coverage. They submit that a personal liability umbrella or excess policy which provides motor vehicle liability coverage is as much a motor vehicle liability insurance policy as is a primary policy providing such coverage. Consequently, say appellants, such a policy is within the plain language of subsection (c)(2). This is the rationale utilized by the Supreme Court of Louisiana in <em>Dobson, </em>441 So.2d at 1190. <em>See also Cohen, </em>367 So.2d at 681-82; <em>St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company, Inc. v. Goza, </em>137 Ga.App. 581, 224 S.E.2d 429, 431 (1976). <em>But see </em>8C Appleman, <em>Insurance Law &amp; Practice, </em>\u00a7 5071.65, at 107 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The <em>Dobson </em>court alternatively held that the policy or purpose underlying Louisiana\u2019s uninsured motorist statute mandated the same result. 441 So.2d at 1191. The court noted the evolution of the statute from one \u201callowing only limited recovery to the innocent victim to [one] permitting the insured to choose the maximum limits of his uninsured motorist coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This rationale, too, applies equally to section 541. Like the Louisiana statute, although subsection (a) requires that every policy of motor vehicle liability insurance contain the minimum required liability coverage, subsection (b) permits an insurer to issue liability coverage in excess of that amount. Section 541(c)(2) then not only requires uninsured motorist coverage \u201cin at least the amounts required under Title 17 of the Transportation Article,\u201d but it also provides a mechanism whereby an insured may contract for additional uninsured motorist coverage up to the amount of liability coverage provided by the policy. Moreover, it does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>so, as we have seen, without differentiating between primary and umbrella policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The cases upon which the appellees rely reason that the uninsured motorist provision applies only to the basic policy, the umbrella policy being for the purpose of covering only catastrophic occurrences. <em>See, e.g., Metzger, </em>360 So.2d at 961-62; <em>O\u2019Hanlon, </em>639 F.2d at 1027 (excess umbrella coverage is merely supplementary to the underlying policy, which must provide the insured with the benefits required under the uninsured motorist statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Not all \u201cvalid and collectible insurance or qualified self-insurance\u201d is automobile liability insurance. Consequently, not every policy of insurance whose primary purpose is to provide coverage in excess of such insurance need include uninsured motorist coverage as provided in section 541(c)(2). It is only when it is to complement automobile liability insurance coverage that excess coverage in that regard would be required. Thus, the appellants argue, that the purpose of section 541(f) could be to make sure that where automobile liability coverage is offered on an excess basis, the insured has the same opportunity to effect uninsured motorist coverage, and to the same extent, as in the case of a primary automobile liability policy. In other words, subsection (f) may be interpreted simply as making clear that where motor vehicle liability insurance is offered on an excess basis, the provisions of section 541(c), including subsection (c)(2), would apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">The appellees point out that subsection (f) uses the term \u201cmay,\u201d rather than \u201cshall.\u201d They reason that, because the provision is permissive, not mandatory, insofar as uninsured motorist coverage is concerned, the decision to provide such coverage is at the option of the insurer. Moreover, if subsection (c)(2) encompasses an excess policy providing automobile liability coverage, then appellees suggest that interpreting subsection (f) as proposed by the appellants would be redundant and that the legislative intent in enacting subsection (f) would have been to exclude umbrella or excess liability policies providing motor vehicle liability coverage from the require-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>merits of \u00a7 541(c)(2).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Along with subsection (f), Ch. 656 enacted subsection (e), which exempted from the coverage required by subsection (c)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEqE\">a policy of liability insurance that insures a motor vehicle that is not subject to registration under \u00a7 13-402 of the Transportation Article, because it is not driven on a highway or it is exempt under \u00a7 13^f02(c)(10) of the Transportation Article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Enactment of that subsection seems to have been the <em>raison d\u2019etre </em>of the bill, as reflected by the Bill Analysis of House Bill 1294, prepared by the Department of Legislative Reference for the Senate Economic Affairs Committee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">\n<em>CAPSULE SUMMARY:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">This bill exempts from Maryland\u2019s mandatory uninsured motorist coverage those vehicles not subject to registration because they are not driven on highways or are exempt under \u00a7 13.402(c)(10).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-9\">\n<em>SUMMARY OF CHANGES:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-10\">A new subsection exempts from mandatory uninsured motorist coverage vehicle not subject to registration because they are not driven on highways or are exempt under \u00a7 13.402(c)(10);</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">the Report of the Senate Economic Affairs Committee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae1\">\n<em>LEGISLATIVE INTENT:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-12\">The intent and purpose of this bill is to exempt from this State\u2019s mandatory uninsured motorist coverage vehicles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>which are not subject to registration because they are not driven on the highway and to exempt snowmobiles;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">and a letter, dated February 24, 1983, from the Deputy Executive Director of MAIF to John Lang, III, the Supervisory Analyst in the Department of Fiscal Services. According to a memo, dated January 13, 1983, from David L. Hill, Senior Attorney, subsection (f) was \u201cthrown in ... to take care of \u2018umbrella\u2019 policies for Jim\u2019s benefit.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nothing in the file sheds any light on what \u201cto take care of \u2018umbrella\u2019 policies\u201d was intended to mean. The only other document in the files reflecting on subsection (f)\u2019s purpose is a draft of the bill which shows the deletion of the phrase, \u201cbut need not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">To decide appellants\u2019 contentions concerning a statutorily imposed duty on an insurer of excess automobile liability, it is only n\u00e9cessary that we interpret subsection (f). The meaning and scope of subsection (c)(2) may be left for another day. We hold that subsection (f) permits, but does not require, the excess insurer to offer uninsured motorist coverage, It appears that the problem faced by the person drafting subsection (f) was the breadth of subsection (c)(2). The latter could be interpreted to apply to excess insurance over underlying automobile liability. But, without regard to the correct interpretation of subsection (c)(2), subsection <em>(f) </em>frees excess automobile liability coverage from the rules of subsection (c)(2) and makes uninsured motorist excess coverage optional with the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Thus, by the operation of subsection (f), the automobile liability excess insurer may or may not make available uninsured motorist coverage as part of its excess policies. If that coverage is made available, the excess insurer may, but is not obliged by virtue of (c)(2) to, offer that coverage in writing. If uninsured motorist coverage is made available by an excess insurer as part of an excess policy, that coverage may, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>need not, be made available up to the limits of the third party liability coverage of the excess policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">It follows that there was no statutory duty on the appellees to offer in writing to Popham $1,000,000 of uninsured motorist coverage with the excess policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">It is well settled in Maryland that, \u201clike conventional agents, an insurance agent must exercise reasonable care and skill in performing his duties. And if such a representative fails to do so, he may become liable to those, including his principal, who are caused a loss by his failure to use standard care.\u201d <em>Bogley v. Middleton Tavern, </em>288 Md. 645, 650, 421 A.2d 571, 573 (1980). <em>See Canatella v. Davis, </em>264 Md. 190, 206, 286 A.2d 122, 130 (1972); <em>Lowitt v. Pearsall Chemical, </em>242 Md. 245, 253, 256, 219 A.2d 67, 72-74 (1966); <em>Hampden Roads v. Boston Insurance Company, </em>150 F.Supp. 338, 343 (D.Md.1957); 3 Couch on Insurance Second, \u00a7 25:37, at 335 (1960). Thus, \u201c|w]hen an agent possessing authority to bind an insurer as the principal with respect to designated types of insurance, negligently, but without violating express instructions of his principal, binds that principal in a manner different from that expressed in the issued policy,\u201d <em>Bogley, </em>288 Md. at 651, 421 A.2d at 574, the agent is liable to his or her principal for such damage as his or her actions may have caused. The principal may sue the agent, either in contract or for negligence in the performance of the duty imposed by the contract. Couch, \u00a7 25:46, at 356-62; 16 Appleman, Insurance Law and Procedure, \u00a7\u00a7 8831 &amp; 8841 (1968). Moreover, unless there is evidence suggesting bad faith, disloyalty or dishonesty on the part of the agent toward the insured, an insured is entitled to place trust and confidence in the insurance agent. <em>Dimeo v. Burns, Brooks &amp; McNeal, Inc., </em>6 Conn.App. 241, 504 A.2d 557, 559 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">In order to recover in a negligence action against the appellees, the appellants must prove that the appellees owed them a duty of care, that the duty was breached, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>breach was the proximate cause of the appellants\u2019 injury. The duty the appellants allege the appellees breached in this case is similar to the one they argued was prescribed by section 541(c)(2), namely, to offer an insured an opportunity to obtain additional uninsured motorist coverage in the same amount as the liability coverage provided.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The appellees argue that the duty imposed by section 541(c)(2) is statutory, rather than common law. Noting that the court in <em>Libby v. G.E.I.C.O., </em>79 Md.App. 717, 725, 558 A.2d 1236, 1240 (1989), when addressing the issue of an insurer\u2019s duty under that section, makes no mention of a common law duty, they submit that the trial court properly dismissed count two of the complaint. The appellants, on the other hand, perceive a different kind of duty. They assert that section 541(c)(2) does not create the duty. Rather, the obligation to use reasonable care and skill is what the common law duty requires, and section 541(c)(2) merely provides a standard against which to judge whether the agent and the insurer exercised the requisite degree of skill and care. <em>See Gross v. Sussex, Inc., </em>332 Md. 247, 259, 630 A.2d 1156, 1163 (1993). Thus, the argument proceeds, it was not the agent\u2019s failure to notify Popham, in writing, that he could acquire additional uninsured motorist coverage up to the limit of the liability coverage in the policy, that constituted the breach of duty, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>rather it was his failure fully and properly to advise Popham concerning uninsured motorist coverage, including its relationship to liability coverage and of the consequences of having an insufficient amount of such coverage or to recommend, attempt to procure, and offer to the insured, an appropriate amount of uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Although it is not a model of clarity, the complaint in effect alleges (1) that Popham purchased an excess or umbrella liability insurance policy from State Farm through its agent Menage, (2) that State Farm and Menage owed Popham a duty to exercise reasonable skill and care in seeing to his insurance needs, which included seeing that Popham obtained an appropriate amount of uninsured motorist coverage, (3) that the appellees breached this duty when \u201cthey failed to advise the Plaintiff ... as required by the <em>Annotated Code of Maryland </em>and as required by the exercise of their legal duty of reasonable care ...,\u201d and (4) that the appellants were damaged by their breach of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">We have already held that, by enacting section 541(f), the Legislature intended that the decision to provide uninsured motorist coverage in an excess or umbrella policy be optional with the insurer. This, as we noted previously, disposes of Popham\u2019s contention that the appellees breached a duty \u201crequired by the <em>Annotated Code of Maryland.\u201d </em>It remains to be determined whether they breached a duty \u201crequired by the exercise of their legal duty of reasonable care.\u201d That determination depends upon the existence of evidence that State Farm opted to offer uninsured motorist coverage in an excess or umbrella policy. Popham provided evidence to that effect in his Motion for Reconsideration. That evidence consisted of a bulletin issued by State Farm, enclosing forms and a form letter.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>In this case, Menage procured an excess or umbrella policy providing motor vehicle liability insurance presumably in the amount Popham requested. He did not, however, Popham alleges, offer Popham, orally or otherwise, an opportunity to contract for the same amount of uninsured motorist coverage. Because it appears that State Farm offered excess uninsured motorist coverage, to the extent that allegation encompasses Menage\u2019s failure to advise Popham concerning uninsured motorist coverage, including telling him that he could obtain an equal amount of uninsured motorist coverage as liability coverage, a trier of fact could conclude that Menage failed to exercise the requisite skill and care of an insurance agent in that regard. And, since Menage is a captive agent for State Farm, <em>see </em>Art. 48A, \u00a7 166; <em>American Casualty Company of Reading, Pa. v. Ricas, </em>179 Md. 627, 631, 22 A.2d 484, 487 (1941) (distinguishing insurance broker or solicitor from insurance agent);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>see also </em>Art. 48A, \u00a7 166,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> he could bind State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Farm, and, so, his negligence is attributed to State Farm. <em>Hankins v. Public Service Mutual Insurance Company, </em>192 Md. 68, 81, 63 A.2d 606, 612 (1949); <em>Ricas, </em>179 Md. at 632-33, 22 A.2d at 487-88; <em>Medical Mutual Liability Insurance v.

Moreover, \u201c \u2018the general rule is that the corporate officers <em>or agents </em>are personally liable for those torts which they personally commit, or which they inspire or participate in, even though performed in the name of an artificial body.\u2019 \u201d <em>Metromedia, </em>327 Md. at 520, 610 A.2d at 794 (emphasis added), quoting <em>Tedrow v. Deskin, </em>265 Md. 546, 550-51, 290 A.2d 799, 802-03 (1972). Consequently, the complaint sets forth a cause of action in negligence against both Menage and State Farm.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT DISMISSING THE DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTION AFFIRMED; JUDGMENT DISMISSING THE NEGLIGENCE ACTION REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR </em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>\n<em>MONTGOMERY COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

The State Farm form letter advised the insured that \"[t]he law of your state requires that this coverage be offered and an acceptance or rejection be made by every policyholder.\u201d That State Farm may have interpreted the statute erroneously does not change the fact that it did, in fact, offer excess uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b278-5\">. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">Authorities everywhere agree that an insurance agent, so far as the insurer is concerned, is a person expressly or implicitly authorized to represent it in dealing with third parties in matters relating to insurance, and an insurance solicitor, or broker, is one who acts as a middleman between the assured and the insurer, and who solicits insurance from the public under no employment from any special company, but having secured an order, either places the insurance with a company selected by the assured, or in the absence of any selection by him, then with a company selected by the broker. Ordinarily, the relation between the insured and the broker is that between principal and agent. An insurance broker is ordinarily employed by a person seeking insurance, and when so employed, is to be distinguished from ordinary insurance agent, who is employed by insurance companies to solicit and write insurance by, and in the company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-7\"><em>Ricos, </em>179 Md. at 631, 22 A.2d at 487.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b278-8\">.

The appellees' argument that there could be no cause of action against Menage because Menage is State Farm\u2019s captive agent fails to take account <em>of Bogley v. Middleton Tavern, </em>288 Md. 645, 650, 421 A.2d 571, 573 (1980) and <em>Lowitt v. Pearsall Chemical Corp., </em>242 Md. 245, 253-56, 219 A.2d 67, 72-74 (1966). It also fails to take account of the fact that it is Menage, himself, who committed the act, notwithstanding that it was committed on behalf of State Farm. <em>See Metromedia, </em>327 Md. at 520, 610 A.2d at 795.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
