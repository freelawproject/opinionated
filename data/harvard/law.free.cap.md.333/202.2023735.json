Under \u00a7 10B-7 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Montgomery County Code (1984, 1993 Supp.) (M.C.C.), that county imposes a charge on common ownership communities to fund certain programs, hereinafter described. The issue in this case is whether the charge authorized by local law violates the prohibitions of public general law.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Montgomery County is a \u201chome rule\u201d county, having adopted a charter pursuant to Maryland Constitution, art. XIA. Chapter 33 of the Montgomery County Laws of 1990 enacted M.C.C. Chapter 10B, \u201cCommon Ownership Communities.\u201d Common ownership communities are therein defined to include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\">\u201c(1) a development subject to a declaration enforced by a homeowners\u2019 association, as those terms are used in state law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">(2) a condominium, as that term is used in state law; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">(3) a cooperative housing project, as that term is used in state law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">\u00a7 10B-2(b). Chapter 10B created a Commission on Common Ownership Communities (the Commission) which is charged with examining conditions in common ownership communities and making recommendations from time to time regarding conditions \u201cwhich may result in unmet community, resident, or public needs.\u201d \u00a7 10B-6. Chapter 10B also established an Office of Common Ownership Communities (the Office) within the county\u2019s Department of Housing and Community Development. \u00a7 10B-4. Tasks of this Office relate to assisting these communities in providing services to their residents, such as developing manuals that describe available government resources and assisting with dispute resolution. \u00a7 10B-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">Each common ownership community in Montgomery County must register annually with the Commission. \u00a7 10B-7(a)(1). \u201cThe governing body of a homeowners\u2019 association, the council of unit owners of a condominium, and the board of directors of a cooperative housing corporation are responsible for compliance with [\u00a7 10B-7(a) ], including the payment of any registration fee.\u201d \u00a7 10B-7(a)(3). Failure to register constitutes a Class A violation, which carries a maximum $500 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>fine under \u00a7 1-19, and makes the community ineligible for the Office\u2019s assistance in dispute resolution. \u00a7 10B-7(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">To fund Commission dispute resolution and technical assistance activities, the County Executive is authorized, by regulation, to set various fees and charges. \u00a7 10B-7(b). By regulation, the County Executive set a registration fee of $1.00 per unit for January 1, 1991, through June 30, 1991, and a registration fee of $2.00 per unit for fiscal year 1992. Mont. County Reg. 56-90 AM (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">On April 15, 1991, Dumont Oaks Community Association, Inc., together with four (later six) other homeowners\u2019 associations and thirteen condominium associations (collectively, Dumont Oaks), requested the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to enter a declaratory judgment invalidating this fee. Dumont Oaks alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that RP \u00a7\u00a7 ll-122(b) and 11B-104(b) prohibit a county from enacting such a law, and that, as provided in Md. Const. art. XI-A, \u00a7 3, these public general laws supersede the locally imposed fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">RP \u00a7 ll-122(b) is part of the Maryland Condominium Act, codified as RP Title 11. In Title 11 \u201ccondominium\u201d is defined as \u201cproperty subject to the condominium regime established under this title.\u201d \u00a7 ll-101(e). Section 11-122 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">\u201c(a) The provisions of all laws, ordinances, and regulations concerning building codes or zoning shall have full force and effect to the extent that they apply to property which is subjected to a condominium regime and shall be construed and applied with reference to the overall nature and use of the property without regard to the form of ownership. A law, ordinance, or regulation concerning building codes or zoning may not establish any requirement or standard governing the use, location, placement or construction of any land and improvements which are submitted to the provisions of this title, unless the requirement or standard is uniformly applicable to all land and improvements of the same kind or character not submitted to the provisions of this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>(b) Except as otherwise provided in this title, a comity, city, or other jurisdiction may not enact any law, ordinance, or regulation which would impose a burden or restriction on a condominium that is not imposed on all other property of similar character not subjected to a condominium regime. Any such law, ordinance, or regulation, is void. Except as otherwise expressly provided in \u00a7\u00a7 11-130, 11-138, 11-139, and 11-140 of this title, the provisions of this title are statewide in their effect. Any law, ordinance, or regulation enacted by a county, city, or other jurisdiction is preempted by the subject and material of this title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">The Maryland Homeowners Association Act is RP Title 11B. Section 11B-I04(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">\u201cA local government may not enact any law, ordinance, or regulation which would:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">(1) Impose a burden or restriction on property which is part of a development because it is part of a development.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArC\">In Title 11B a development is \u201cproperty subject to a declaration.\u201d \u00a7 11B \u2014 101(f)(1). A declaration is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">\u201can instrument ... that creates the authority for a homeowners association to impose on lots, or on the owners or occupants of lots, or on another homeowners association, condominium, or cooperative housing corporation any mandatory fee in connection with the provision of services or otherwise for the benefit of some or all of the lots, the owners or occupants of lots, or the common areas.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">\u00a7 11B \u2014 101(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">Concluding, <em>inter alia, </em>that RP \u00a7\u00a7 11 \u2014 122(b) and 11B-104(b) did not prohibit the charge, the circuit court granted the county\u2019s motion for summary judgment and declared \u00a7 10B-7 valid and enforceable. Dumont Oaks appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed in an unreported opinion. Relying on <em>Rockville Grosvenor, Inc. v. Montgomery County, 289 </em>Md. 74, 422 A.2d 353 (1980), the intermediate appellate court held that, although the challenged fee is a burden, it is imposed on property of similar character and is therefore not discriminatory. Rejecting the argument of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>fee challengers that apartment complexes were not subjected to this registration fee, the court concluded that, while both types of housing may be high density, \u201cthey are dissimilar in the essential characteristic that is the basis of the County legislation \u2014 the form of ownership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">We granted the petition for certiorari of Dumont Oaks. The issue raised in that petition limits the asserted grounds for invalidating the registration fee to violations of RP \u00a7\u00a7 11-122(b) and 11B-104 by omitting apartment complexes from the imposition of the fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Both Dumont Oaks and Montgomery County invoke <em>Rock-ville Grosvenor </em>in support of their conflicting positions. Before this Court in that case were three aspects of a Montgomery County ordinance regulating the conversion of apartment complexes to condominiums: (1) reimbursement toward relocation expenses of tenants who were displaced; (2) a right of first refusal to tenants\u2019 organizations prior to any sale of rental property to a condominium converter; and (3) filing with the county sixty days advance notice of prospective unit sales. <em>Id. </em>at 85, 422 A.2d at 360. The issue was whether these features of the local law conflicted with what was then the Horizontal Property Act (HPA), Md.Code (1974, 1980 Cum.Supp.), RP \u00a7\u00a7 11-101 through 11-128.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Of particular relevance to the case before us is our holding that the relocation expense reimbursement requirement conflicted with the HPA. <em>Id. </em>at 95, 422 A.2d at 364. In so holding, we rejected an argument that HPA \u00a7 11-120(b), now RP \u00a7 11 \u2014 122(b), was confined to zoning and building laws. <em>Id. </em>at 90, 422 A.2d at 362. Because property owners were required to reimburse tenants who were displaced by \u201cinvoluntary termination of any tenancy which results from a condominium conversion,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 93, 422 A.2d at 364, relocation cost reimbursement was a burden on a condominium. <em>Id. </em>at 94, 422 A.2d at 364. Because the reimbursement requirement did not apply to conversions of rental units to a cooperative or other use, it imposed a burden on condominiums not imposed on property of similar character. <em>Id. </em>at 95, 422 A.2d at 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>The opinion in <em>Rockville Grosvenor </em>traced the HPA to its origins in a report of the Condominium Revision Committee of the Real Property, Planning and Zoning Section of the Maryland State Bar Association. <em>Id. </em>at 86, 422 A.2d at 360. Dumont Oaks relies on a portion of that bar association report that reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-4\">\u201c \u2018Some counties are using the popularity of the consumer\u2019s interest in condominiums to impose regulations that are different than the ones applicable to apartment buildings. There is no basis in reason or fact for such a distinction when it is remembered that a condominium is merely a different form of ownership of title to the same structure. For instance, the Committee does not believe a county should impose a more stringent fire rating on the walls of a building merely because the unit owners <em>own </em>an interest in the units.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 86-87, 422 A.2d at 360. The above-quoted comment concerns building and zoning laws. They are the subject of present RP \u00a7 11-122(a), formerly \u00a7 11-120(a). Discussing that subsection in <em>Rockville Grosvenor </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">\u201cA special rule is stated in subsection (a). To the extent that laws concerning budding and zoning apply to property which is subjected to a condominium regime, such laws have full force and effect, but they are subject to the rule of interpretation for condominiums under which they are \u2018construed and applied with reference to the overall nature and use of the property without regard to the form of ownership.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 91, 422 A.2d at 362-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">The regulatory scheme and registration charge involved in the instant matter do not concern building and zoning requirements. The registration charge must be tested by the rule of subsection (b) of RP \u00a7 11-122. Under that, subsection <em>Rock-ville Grosvenor </em>does not require determining whether other property is \u201cof similar character\u201d to that \u201csubjected to a condominium regime\u201d by comparing physical characteristics, for example, whether other property is improved by a budding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>or complex of buildings designed for multiple family occupancies in separate dwelling units.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">The ordinance involved in <em>Rockville Grosvenor </em>was a response to the reduction in the inventory of rental housing then available in Montgomery County. The starting point of the regulation there involved was rental housing that would be leaving the rental market. The ordinance, however, required tenant relocation expenses to be reimbursed only if the tenant\u2019s unit would no longer be available because of a conversion of the apartment complex to a condominium. Dwelling units leaving the rental market because of conversion to the cooperative housing format, or because the property would be used for commercial purposes, were not covered by the ordinance. <em>Rockville Grosvenor, </em>289 Md. at 95, 422 A.2d at 364. Based on the subject matter of the ordinance involved in <em>Rockville Grosvenor, </em>the class comprising \u201cproperty of similar character\u201d which was involved there was \u201capartment house[s] or apartment complex[es, whose owners refuse] to renew leases of tenants who desire to continue to rent[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Within that class, the ordinance regulated only conversions to condominiums. This limitation ran afoul of the statutory prohibition against discrimination in HPA \u00a7 ll-120(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">In the case before us the class with which the Montgomery County Council was concerned in enacting Chapter 10B is common ownership communities. The County Council has not focused exclusively on condominiums in addressing the concerns underlying Chapter 10B and its registration charge. Other forms of common ownership communities, including cooperatives and homeowners associations, are included. <em>See </em>\u00a7 10B-2(b). In the context of Chapter 10B, apartment complexes are not \u201cproperty of similar character.\u201d Technical assistance and dispute resolution for common ownership communities can be viewed as dissimilar to the relations between landlords and tenants. <em>Compare </em>M.C.C. Chapter 29, \u201cLandlord-Tenant Relations\u201d <em>with </em>M.C.C. Chapter 10B, \u201cCommon Ownership Communities.\u201d The registration charge does not violate RP \u00a7 ll-122(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>The conclusion which we have reached is consistent with an opinion by the Attorney General of Maryland to the County Attorney for Montgomery County, 75 Op.Att\u2019y Gen. 1095 (1990) [Opinion No. 90-031, June 20, 1990]. That opinion addressed Montgomery County Council Bill No. 44-89 which was enacted and codified as M.C.C. Chapter 10B. After discussing the ordinance involved in <em>Rockville Grosvenor, </em>the Attorney General opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-4\">\u201cHere, by contrast, Bill No. 44-89 does not distinguish among types of community ownership properties. Condominiums, cooperatives, and homeowners association^] are treated alike. To be sure, the dispute resolution mechanism and associated fees will not apply to apartment complexes, which certainly have their share of disputes. But, in our view, the County Council is not precluded by State law from the legislative judgment that landlord-tenant disputes are so different in kind from disputes in a common ownership community that, for this purpose, rental facilities are not \u2018property of similar character.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1099.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Dumont Oaks also argues that the registration charge violates RP \u00a7 11B-104(b), a provision of the Maryland Homeowners Association Act. The prohibition in RP Title 11B is phrased differently from that in the Condominium Act. Section 11B-I04(b)(l) reads: \u201cA local government may not enact any law ... which would [i]mpose a burden or restriction on property which is part of a development because it is part of a development.\u201d The short answer to Dumont Oaks\u2019s argument is that homeowners associations are included in Chapter 10B because they are common ownership communities, and not because they are homeowners associations. The regulation of Chapter 10B is concerned with a larger problem, and embraces a larger class, than homeowners associations.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">A longer answer to the argument is found in the legislative history of RP \u00a7 11B-104(b)(1). The Maryland Homeowners Association Act was introduced in the 1987 session of the General Assembly as Senate Bill 96 and was enacted as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>Chapter 321 of the Acts of that year. As introduced, proposed \u00a7 11B-I04(b)(l) would have provided that \u201c[a] local government may not enact any law ... which would [ijmpose a burden or restriction on property which is part of a development that is not imposed on all other property of a similar character which is not part of a development[.]\u201d Thus, as introduced, the prohibition in the Homeowners Association Act would have been phrased in the same way as the prohibition in the Condominium Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Senate Bill 96 was amended, however, at the request of the Maryland Department of State Planning. That agency proposed substitution of the language \u201cbecause it is part of a development,\u201d for the language, \u201cthat is not imposed on all other property of a similar character which is not part of a development.\u201d The amendment was prompted by a \u201cconcern that the [original bill] language is overly broad and may have unintended impacts on [local planning directors\u2019] ability to use certain innovative and important zoning techniques,\u201d including particularly, cluster development. Letter from Assistant Secretary, Maryland Department of State Planning to Hon. Anne S. Perkins and Hon. Howard A. Denis (March 5, 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The registration charge under M.C.C. \u00a7 10B-7 and Regulation 56-90 AM (1991) does not directly affect the planning or zoning of any common ownership community. Absent any such impact, the purpose of RP \u00a7 11B \u2014 104(b)(1) is the same as that of RP \u00a7 ll-122(b). The Attorney General has described RP \u00a7 11B-I04(b)(l) as a \u201cversion of the same prohibition\u201d found in RP \u00a7 11 \u2014 122(b). 75 Op.Att\u2019y Gen. at 1097. Construing RP \u00a7 11B-I04(b)(l) in accordance with its purpose produces the same construction which we have applied to RP \u00a7 ll-122(b). \u201c[0]ther property of similar character\u201d is included in M.C.C. Chapter 10B. The registration charge under M.C.C. Chapter 10B does not violate the prohibition of RP \u00a7 11B-I04(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.
