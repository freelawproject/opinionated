There was evidence that the men forced one of the victims to open a safe and took $1,100 in cash and jewelry valued at $2,800 to $3,000. The investigation by the police pointed to Marquette James Coley as one of the gang involved. He was arrested and taken to the Criminal Investigations Division of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department where he was interrogated on 31 May 1990 by Detective Kenneth O\u2019Berry. O\u2019Berry obtained the following statement from Coley:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-6\">May 18,1 was at a Graduation party in the neighborhood of Indian Queens with Rodney Smith and Chuck Holton. In another car was Kevin Sumpter, Valeo and Derrick Simmons. We had just got [to] the party when it was ending. So Me, Rodney, and Chuck were on our way home until we saw my buddy James Stephens. James was coming from around his girlfriend house and said, it was a party somewhere around her house. So Me and Chuck got out the car with Rodney and got in the car with James. We went looking for the party but could not find the Party. So we came over my house and sat in the front and talked for a little while.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">This narrative was in Coley\u2019s handwriting. Then O\u2019Berry posed particular questions to Coley:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-8\">(Q) Who\u2019s [sic] party was it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-9\">(A) I\u2019m not sure, I think maybe Dawn (Q) What time was the party?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-10\">(A) We got there at about 12:00 A.M.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-11\">(Q) Where is Indian Queens?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-12\">(A) Near Oxon Hill Middle School.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-13\">(Q) Who attended the party with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>(A) Me Rodney Smith, Chuck Holton, In another car was Kevin Vale Sumpter, Derrick Simmons, and Valeo (unknown last name).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-4\">(Q) Do you know anything about a robbery which occurred on 5-18-90 at 7287 Woodhollow 211 N.

Pursuant thereto, an Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County filed an eleven count indictment the next day, jointly charging Coley, Simmons, and Jackson with armed robbery and related offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Coley\u2019s statement is the heart of the appeal before us. Simmons was separately tried by a jury in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County and found guilty of robbery with a deadly weapon, the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony, robbery, and burglary. He was duly sentenced and noted an appeal from the judgments. We granted certiorari on our own motion before decision by the Court of Special Appeals, 332 Md. 480, 632 A.2d 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">During the course of the State\u2019s case at Simmons\u2019s trial, the prosecutor told the court at the bench that the State\u2019s next witness was Coley. It appeared that at a former trial of Simmons, which resulted in a hung jury, Coley refused to testify, even though at the time he had accepted a plea offer in exchange for his guilty plea, had been sentenced, and the period for appeal had expired. The judge presiding at the prior trial ordered him to testify and held him in contempt when he refused to comply. The prosecutor told the court that she had just spoken to Coley and he stated that he did not intend to testify. Therefore, she said, \u201cwhat the State wants to do is to introduce into evidence the statement that was made by Mr. Coley at the time of his arrest.\u201d After a brief recess, it was decided to ascertain, out of the presence of the jury, if Coley would testify. Defense counsel said he did not object to this procedure but made clear his objection to the admission of the statement if Coley refused to testify. Coley\u2019s statement was marked as State\u2019s Exhibit No. 5 for identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>While waiting for Coley to be returned to the courtroom, defense counsel stressed his objection to the admission of the statement. When Coley appeared, he refused even to take the oath much less testify. He declaimed: \u201cI\u2019m not taking an oath. I\u2019m not going to testify.\u201d Threatened with being held in contempt for failure to take the oath, Coley said he had been all over that at the prior trial. He resisted strong pressure by the judge and despite repeated attempts to swear him refused to take the oath. During all this, counsel were fervidly arguing the issue. The judge finally said that the State could authenticate the statement. The jury was brought back in and O\u2019Berry testified as to the obtaining of the statement. The next thing that happened was that the State rested and the defense moved for a judgment of acquittal. The motion was denied and the court recessed for the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The next day, defense counsel reminded the court that it had not ruled on the admission of the statement. The court allowed counsel to reargue the issue further. As it was apparent that the judge was going to admit the statement in evidence, defense counsel asked for a mistrial and if the motion was denied, counsel requested a motion to strike O\u2019Berry\u2019s testimony. Both motions were denied. The judge indicated that he had intended to admit the statement the day before. But, the court said: \u201c[S]o the record is mighty clear now, the State\u2019s Exhibit 5 is admitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-9\">In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">The Confrontation Clause of Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights proclaims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>That in all criminal prosecutions, every man hath a right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him....<footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The Supreme Court has accepted hearsay as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">\u201ctestimony in court, or written evidence, of a statement made out of court, the statement being offered as an assertion to show the truth of matters asserted therein, and thus resting for its value upon the credibility of the out-of-court asserter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-8\"><em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 U.S. 530, 543 n. 4, 106 S.Ct. 2056, 2063 n. 4, 90 L.Ed.2d 514 (1986), quoting E. Cleary, <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 246, p. 584 (2d ed. 1972). Coley\u2019s statement, offered by the State as substantive evidence against Simmons, was hearsay. The basic rule is that hearsay is not admissible. If the language of the Confrontation Clauses were taken literally, any statement made by a declarant not at the trial would be excluded. <em>See Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 63, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2537, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980). But the Supreme Court has consistently held that the Confrontation Clause \u201cdoes not necessarily prohibit the admission of hearsay statements against a criminal defendant....\u201d <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 813, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 3145, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990). <em>See Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 U.S. at 543-544, 106 S.Ct. at 2063-2064; <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 63, 100 S.Ct. at 2537. The Supreme Court has declared that it cannot be seriously doubted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>\u201cthe right of cross-examination is included in the right of an accused in a criminal case to confront the witnesses against him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-5\"><em>Lee, </em>476 U.S. at 539, 106 S.Ct. at 2061, quoting <em>Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 404, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 1068, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965). In <em>.Roberts, </em>however, \u201cthe Court held that cross-examination of a hearsay declarant can be dispensed with when a party demonstrates: (1) the necessity of introducing the out-of-court statement, and (2) the out-of-court statement bears adequate indicia of reliability.\u201d <em>Chapman v. State, </em>331 Md. 448, 455, 628 A.2d 676 (1993), citing to <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 65-66, 100 S.Ct. at 2538-2540. <em>See Moon v. State, </em>300 Md. 354, 367, 478 A.2d 695 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1207, 105 S.Ct. 1170, 84 L.Ed.2d 321 (1985). The first prong of the <em>Roberts </em>approach was construed as requiring the showing of the unavailability of the declarant or a demonstration of unsuccessful good faith efforts to secure the declarant\u2019s presence. <em>Chapman, </em>331 Md. at 467, 628 A.2d 676. Then, in <em>United States v. Inadi, </em>475 U.S. 387, 106 S.Ct. 1121, 89 L.Ed.2d 390 (1986), the Court declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-6\"><em>Roberts </em>cannot fairly be read to stand for the radical proposition that no out-of-court statement can be introduced by the government without a showing that the declarant is unavailable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-7\"><em>Id. </em>475 U.S. at 394, 106 S.Ct. at 1125. It held that the unavailability of a conspirator need not be shown to admit a coconspirator\u2019s hearsay declaration made during the course of the conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>475 U.S. at 399-400, 106 S.Ct. at 1128-1129. In <em>White v. Illinois, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 112 S.Ct. 736, 116 L.Ed.2d 848 (1992), the Court again indicated that the unavailability requirement established in <em>Roberts </em>does not apply to all forms of hearsay. <em>Id. </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 112 S.Ct. at 741-742. The Court explained that \u201cthe Confrontation Clause does not require an initial showing of unavailability prior to admitting out-of-court statements which are spontaneous declarations or are made for the purposes of attaining medical diagnosis or treatment as substantive evidence for the State\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>331 Md. at 469-470, 628 A.2d 676, citing to <em>White, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>\u2014 U.S. at-, 112 S.Ct. at 743. Thus, <em>Chapman </em>concluded, \u201cit appears that the Supreme Court has emphasized that <em>Roberts </em>contemplated a rule of necessity, not one of availability.\u201d 331 Md. at 470, 628 A.2d 676. So, in <em>Chapman, </em>we held that the unavailability of the makers of reliable business records was not a prerequisite for the admission of these records.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Where the rule of necessity has been satisfied, the second prong of the Roberts approach is triggered, namely, that the hearsay declaration be reliable. \u201cReliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. at 2539. We pointed out in <em>Chapman, </em>331 Md. at 457, 628 A.2d 676:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-7\">Where the hearsay in question falls within a \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d hearsay exception \u201cno independent inquiry is required.... \u201d <em>Bourjaily v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 171, 183, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 2782, 97 L.Ed.2d 144, 157 (1987).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b679-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b679-13\">The objection of defense counsel to the admission of Coley\u2019s statement was on the grounds that it was hearsay and that it violated Simmons\u2019s right to confront the witnesses against him bestowed by the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The judge\u2019s ruling that the statement was admissible was based on the penal interest exception to the hearsay rule. He made no specific findings but \u201cconclude[d] that the tests set forth in <em>Adkins </em>have been met.... \u201d <em>Adkins v. State, </em>72 Md.App. 493, 531 A.2d 699 (1987), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>316 Md. 1, 557 A.2d 203 (1989), discussed the penal interest exception as recognized by the Supreme Court and this Court. <em>Id., </em>72 Md.App. at 502-504, 531 A.2d 699. <em>Adkins </em>referred to the test described in <em>State v. Standifur, </em>310 Md. 3, 17, 526 A.2d 955 (1987) for the admissibility of a declaration against penal interest against both a hearsay and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Confrontation Clause objection. The trial judge believed that Coley\u2019s statement was indeed inculpatory and against Coley\u2019s penal interest and that a declaration against penal interest was a \u201cwell founded\u201d hearsay exception thereby inferring reliability without more. The judge opined that, although the reasoning in <em>Adkins </em>was applicable to this case, Coley\u2019s statement was admissible \u201cfor more reasons than are set forth in ... <em>Adkins.\u201d </em>Those additional reasons, the judge declared, arose because the court and the jury were involved in a search for the truth. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-5\">And the jury is entitled to hear relevant, probative information. In fact, it\u2019s necessary for the jury to hear relevant, probative information. For them not to hear it is a denial of the principles concerning the search for the truth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Of course, the ascertainment of the truth is the alpha and omega of every criminal trial. But under our system of criminal justice, the search for the truth is not always the decisive criterion for admissibility of evidence and at times suffers some restraints. This is so when the evidence, although relevant and probative and tending to disclose the truth, infringes on personal rights. For example, when a confession, otherwise freely and voluntarily given and plainly relevant and probative, is inadmissible for the failure of the authorities to comply with the dictates of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Or when contraband, although certainly relevant and probative, is inadmissible because the search for it and the seizure of it offended the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The point is that although the consideration by the jury of Coley\u2019s statement may have helped the jurors determine Simmons\u2019s guilt or innocence that fact, as such, plays no part in the question of its admissibility.. Rather, the password is the \u201creliability\u201d of the hearsay declaration, not whether it is harmful or helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">Before us, the State, in its brief and at oral argument, conceded that the penal interest exception to the hearsay rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>is not a firmly rooted one. It said: \u201cThe declaration against interest exception is a fairly recent exception to the hearsay rule,\u201d citing <em>Standifur, </em>310 Md. at 9-10, 526 A.2d 955.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlC\">[WJhere hearsay statements are admitted under an exception which is not considered \u201cfirmly rooted,\u201d then they are \u201cpresumptively unreliable and inadmissible for Confrontation Clause purposes\u201d and must be excluded, at least absent a \u201c \u2018showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-5\"><em>Chapman, </em>331 Md. at 457, 628 A.2d 676. <em>See Lee, </em>476 U.S. at 543, 106 S.Ct. at 2063; <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. at 2539.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">These guarantees of trustworthiness must be such that the evidence is \u201cat least as reliable as evidence admitted under a firmly rooted hearsay exception\u201d so as to assure \u201cthat adversarial testing would add little to its reliability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdS\"><em>Chapman, </em>331 Md. at 457, 628 A.2d 676, quoting <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 821, 110 S.Ct. at 3149.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">The prosecutor established that Coley was \u201cunavailable.\u201d As we have seen, Coley was brought into the courtroom and although he was physically present and seated on the witness stand, he flatly refused to testify. Not subject to cross-examination, he was \u201cunavailable\u201d with respect to the hearsay exception and the Confrontation Clause. The rule of necessity was satisfied. <em>See California v. Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 168 n. 17, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 1940 n. 17, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970); Fed.Rule Evid. 804(a)(1); 2 John William Strong, <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 253 (4th ed. 1992); <em>Lee, </em>476 U.S. at 550-551, 106 S.Ct. at 2067 (Blackmun, J. dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Because the penal interest exception is not a firmly rooted one does not mean that Coley\u2019s statement is therefore inadmissible. But for it to be admissible the burden is on the State to establish that it is cloaked with \u201cindicia of reliability.\u201d This means that there must be a \u201cshowing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. at 2539; <em>Lee, </em>476 U.S. at 543, 106 S.Ct. at 2063. The Supreme Court has declined \u201cto endorse a mechanical test for determining \u2018particularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u2019 under the [Confrontation] Clause,\u201d <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 822, 110 S.Ct. at 3150, although it noted that the courts have considerable leeway in their consideration of appropriate factors to determine the existence of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. <em>Id. </em>One of the factors which a court may not consider, however, is other corroborative evidence. It once was that a statement of the defendant could be looked to in establishing the reliability of the hearsay statement. The \u201cinterlocking\u201d nature or meshing of the codefendant\u2019s and defendant\u2019s statements could be considered in determining whether the hearsay statement enjoyed the required \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>See Lee, </em>476 U.S. at 543-546, 106 S.Ct. at 2063-2065; <em>Cruz v. New York, </em>481 U.S. 186, 192-194, 107 S.Ct. 1714, 1718-1720, 95 L.Ed.2d 162 (1987). In <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 110 S.Ct. 3139, the Supreme Court jettisoned such use of corroborative evidence. The Court made clear that although \u201c \u2018particularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u2019 must be shown from the totality of the circumstances,\u201d the only relevant circumstances are \u201cthose that surround the making of the statement and that render the declarant particularly worthy of belief.\u201d <em>Id., </em>497 U.S. at 819, 110 S.Ct. at 3148. <em>See id., </em>497 U.S. at 820, 110 S.Ct. at 3149. The Court was not persuaded that \u201cevidence corroborating the truth of a hearsay statement may properly support a finding that the statement bears \u2018particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>497 U.S. at 822, 110 S.Ct. at 3150. In sum:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>[H]earsay evidence used to convict a defendant must possess indicia of reliability by virtue of its inherent trustworthiness, not by reference to other evidence at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Y</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Applying the teachings of the Supreme Court as they evolved from <em>Lee </em>through <em>Roberts, Wright </em>and <em>White, </em>and, in the light of our <em>Chapman </em>and <em>Standifur, </em>we proceed to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in admitting Coley\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">We note first that Coley\u2019s statement is not now challenged on the ground that it was involuntary. Second, although the trial court and the State were of the view that Coley\u2019s statement was against his penal interest while Simmons believed that it was not, we need not decide whether it did or did not meet the stringent test set out in <em>Standifur </em>which must be established by the proponent to qualify a statement as a declaration against penal interest. <em>See Standifur, </em>310 Md. at 17, 526 A.2d 955. The State now recognizes that a declaration against penal interest is not a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule, a view in which we are in complete accord. Coley\u2019s statement implicated Simmons as well as Coley. Therefore, as a threshold requirement, the statement had to be marked by particularized guarantees of trustworthiness sufficient to overcome the presumption that it was unreliable. We do not believe that the required particularized guarantees of trustworthiness were shown under the restraints imposed by <em>Wright </em>in determining them.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">The State, claiming that Coley\u2019s statement was admissible, asserts that <em>Wright\u2019s </em>rejection of corroborative evidence \u201cshould not be applied in this case for several reasons.\u201d First, it said, <em>Wright\u2019s </em>discussion of confessions \u201cwas dicta by a bare majority.\u201d Second, there was a \u201cstrong dissent\u201d representing four of the five Justices. Third, \u201cthe Supreme Court in cases specifically concerned with confessions has indicated that corroborating circumstances are a valid consideration,\u201d citing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number><em>Lee </em>and <em>Cruz. </em>Fourth, the State avers, this Court in <em>Bailey v. State, </em>327 Md. 689, 700-701, 612 A.2d 288 (1992) \u201crecognized the permissibility of examining corroborating circumstances.\u201d. We are by no means persuaded by those reasons. First, we do not deem the <em>Wright </em>rejection of corroborating evidence to be dicta. Second, that there was a \u201cstrong dissent\u201d is of no matter. A majority of the court were in agreement that the use of corroborating evidence to establish the reliability of a hearsay declaration was improper. Third, the majority of the Court, as we have seen, shot down its prior holdings that corroborating evidence could be used. Fourth, <em>Bailey </em>is clearly distinguishable and is not contrary to <em>Wright. </em>The State goes on to look to the testimony of the victims as corroborating Coley\u2019s statement. This it may not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The State then takes the position that even if corroborating evidence may not be used, Coley\u2019s statement was admissible \u201cbecause of the indicia of reliability surrounding the taking of the statement.\u201d \u201cOne valid consideration,\u201d the State urges, \u201cis the willingness of [Coley] to talk to the police.\u201d The State declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">Coley voluntarily confessed to the police. There was no suggestion that Coley was in any way threatened, coerced, or induced into making the statement. Indeed, the waiver of rights form was introduced into evidence, demonstrating a voluntary and knowing relinquishment of the right to remain silent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">This may be so, but it does not go far in establishing the reliability of the statement. A statement\u2019s spontaneity is an important factor in determining reliability under the Confrontation Clause. <em>See State v. Cook, </em>135 N.H. 655, 610 A.2d 800, 806 (1992), citing <em>Dutton v. Evans, </em>400 U.S. 74, 89, 91 S.Ct. 210, 220, 27 L.Ed.2d 213 (1970). Coley\u2019s statement was clearly not spontaneous. He was taken into custody, confronted with the crimes, transported to the Criminal Investigations Division of the Police Department, placed in a six-foot by eight-foot interview room containing a table and a couple of chairs, and interrogated by Officer O\u2019Berry. The first part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>his statement was a narrative in his handwriting which made no mention whatsoever of the robbery. It was only upon specific questions posed by O\u2019Berry that Coley discussed the robbery, and then obviously with reluctance.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The State urges that \u201c[a]nother valid consideration is an examination of the \u2018age, education, background, experience and condition of the declarant,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Standifur, </em>310 Md. at 12, 526 A.2d 955. Coley was 18 years of age at the time he made the statement. He was in the 12th grade of Friendly High School, could read and write and did not appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. All of this indicates that Coley knew exactly what he was doing but it does not establish that what he told the police was the truth. His character tended to make his statement suspect. He was streetwise and willingly joined the gang to commit the crimes. He had no compunction about participating \u2014 \u201cit sounded easy, it was peer pressure, just knock on the door.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Another factor the State suggests is the motive of the confessor. Did he desire to mitigate his own involvement or to overstate the involvement of the person he implicated? A \u201creality of the criminal process,\u201d the Supreme Court noted in <em>Lee, </em>476 U.S. at 544-545, 106 S.Ct. at 2064-2065, is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABq\">that once partners in a crime recognize that \u201cthe jig is up,\u201d they tend to lose any identity of interest and immediately become antagonists, rather than accomplices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">\u201cTaking on the full blame for a minor role in an offense ... does little to demonstrate trustworthiness because the declarant still has the motive to shift the blame to others so as to receive a lesser penalty.\u201d <em>United States v. Flores, </em>985 F.2d 770, 782 (5th Cir.1993). Coley admitted only to playing a minor role \u2014 knocking on the door; he denied taking anything, and put the weapons used in the hands of other members of the gang. Asked if the others took anything he replied, \u201cnot that I know of.\u201d He curried favor with the police by verifying the identity of Simmons. The police knew that Simmons had participated. Coley refused to give the name of another participant the police did not know about because he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>\u201cwant to snitch on anyone.\u201d This, Simmons suggests, \u201ccuts against the State in two ways.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-5\">First, it suggests that Coley repeated the name to please the police while avoiding having to reveal his confederates\u2019 identities. Second, the State is prohibited from arguing that this makes the confession more reliable, because it bootstraps the other independent evidence in the case, [a victim\u2019s] identification of Simmons, evidence which the <em>Wright </em>Court said cannot be used to make a showing of \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">We are not persuaded by the reasons advanced by the State that Coley\u2019s statement was admissible. From our perusal of the statement and the circumstances surrounding the obtaining of it, in the light of <em>Wright, </em>we are not satisfied that the State has met its burden of overcoming the presumption that the statement is unreliable; the statement itself and the circumstances under which Coley made it did not establish the particularized guarantees of trustworthiness required to render it admissible. In short, the statement was unreliable and therefore inadmissible. It follows that the trial judge abused his discretion when he admitted the statement in evidence over objection; the receipt in evidence of the challenged statement was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\"><em>Wright </em>indicated that corroborative evidence may be used to determine whether a hearsay statement was harmless. 497 U.S. at 823, 110 S.Ct. at 3150. The corroborating evidence here was the testimony of the victims. It showed that the error was harmful. Simmons was masked during the robbery. He removed the mask for a short time enabling one of the victims to see his face. She remembered seeing him at Friendly High School. She identified the masked man as Simmons from his school yearbook picture. Another victim could not identify Simmons but gave the police a description of him. The defense produced three witnesses. Their testimony was in the nature of an alibi, tending to show that Simmons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>could not have been present at the scene of the crime. Also, a witness for the defense testified that Simmons attended Gwenn Park High School in the morning and Friendly High School in the afternoon, contrary to the time that the identifying victim said she attended Friendly High School. It is quite apparent that Coley\u2019s statement served in a large and significant measure to buttress the identification of Simmons. The importance of the statement to the State\u2019s case is indicated by the fact that the first trial of Simmons, which was conducted without Coley\u2019s statement in evidence, resulted in a mistrial because the jury could not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">In the light of all this, we are not satisfied that the rigid standard we adopted in <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 350 A.2d 665 (1976) has been met. On our own independent review of the record, we are not able \u201cto declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict....\u201d <em>Id., </em>276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d 665. We hold that the error was not harmless. We note that, in any event, the State declared that it does not contend that any error in admitting Coley\u2019s statement was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Having found that the trial court erred in admitting Coley\u2019s statement over objection and that the error was not harmless, we hold that Simmons is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY REVERSED;</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">\n<em>CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTION TO VACATE THE JUDGMENTS AGAINST DERRICK WENZELL SIMMONS AND ORDER A NEW TRIAL;</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">\n<em>COSTS TO BE PAID BY PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"[1]\">\n<p id=\"b677-9\">1.
