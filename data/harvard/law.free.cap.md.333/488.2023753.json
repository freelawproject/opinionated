Tanenbaum, an attorney admitted to practice law in this State, filed a \u201cPetition for Court\u2019s Approval of Attorney\u2019s Use of Trade Name.\u201d In his petition, Tanenbaum \u201crequests the Court\u2019s approval of the Petitioner\u2019s use of the trade name \u2018Home Buyer\u2019s Legal Counsel\u2019 \u201d as being in compliance with Rules 7.1 and 7.5 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct. We must dismiss his petition, however, because we lack the jurisdiction to render advisory ethics opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Based on decisions such as <em>In re Corporate Name </em>\u2014 Old<em>towne, </em>285 Md. 132, 400 A.2d 1111 (1979) (finding corporate name improper under the Code of Professional Responsibility) and <em>Application of Lord &amp; Whip, P.A., </em>309 Md. 222, 522 A.2d 1347 (1987) (approving corporate name where it did not violate the Rules of Professional Conduct), Petitioner may have assumed that this Court had the authority either to approve of or disapprove of his contemplated trade name. Those cases, however, are inapposite to the instant matter. In both <em>In re Corporate Name </em>\u2014 Oldtowne and <em>Application of Lord &amp; Whip, P.A., </em>professional service corporations sought approval of corporate names based upon provisions contained within Title 5, Subtitle 1 of the Corporations and Associations Article of the Maryland Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">For instance, in <em>In re Corporate Name </em>\u2014 Oldtowne, this Court discussed the pertinent provisions of the Corporations and Associations Article under which the petition for review of the name \u201cOldtowne Legal Clinic, P.A.\u201d was filed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">\u201cSection 5-111 provides that to obtain a certificate of authority for a corporate name, a professional service corporation must file an application \u201cwith the appropriate licensing unit\u2019 which is defined in \u00a7 5-101(c) to mean \u2018the board, agency, or other entity which licenses or otherwise legally authorizes the performance of a professional service.\u2019 Section 5 \u2014 111(c) requires the \u2018licensing unit\u2019 to consult with and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>obtain approval of the statewide professional organization to which the majority of individuals in the State performing the same professional service belong. Section 5 \u2014 111(d) provides that if the licensing unit and professional organization approve of the proposed corporate name, the licensing unit shall issue a certificate of authorization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-4\">H\u00ed # *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-5\"><em>The Court, as the licensing unit contemplated by \u00a7 5-111 of the Act in connection with professional associations of lawyers, </em>requested the Maryland State Bar Association to consider [the] petition and to file a brief amicus curiae addressing the issues in the case.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4r\">285 Md. at 135, 400 A.2d at 1113-14. The Court further explained that, according to these provisions, the Court should consider whether the usage of the name conflicts with \u201c \u2018established ethical standards, rules, and regulations of the profession.\u2019 \u201d 285 Md. at 138, 400 A.2d at 1115 (quoting Maryland Code (1975), Corporations and Associations Article, \u00a7 5-111(c)(2), now codified in Md.Code (1975, 1993 Repl.Vol., 1993 Cum.Supp.), Corps. &amp; Ass\u2019ns Art., \u00a7 5-108(c)(2)). Trade names were prohibited under the now obsolete Code of Professional Responsibility, and this Court disapproved of the name at issue in <em>In re Corporate Name </em>\u2014 Oldtowne. <em>See </em>Maryland Rules (1986 Repl.Vol.), DR 2-102(A) (\u201cA lawyer in private practice shall not practice under a trade name----\u201d); <em>see also Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Freedman, </em>300 Md. 22, 475 A.2d 1165 (1984) (disapproving of, in a disciplinary proceeding, the trade name \u201cThe Lawyers at Dart Drug\u201d pursuant to DR 2-102(A)); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Powers, </em>300 Md. 25, 475 A.2d 1167 (1984) (prohibiting, in a disciplinary proceeding, the trade name \u201cUnion Legal Services\u201d pursuant to DR 2-102(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Similarly, in <em>Application of Lord &amp; Whip, P.A., </em>the petitioner filed an \u201cApplication for Certificate of Authorization to Use the Corporate Name \u2018Lord <em>&amp; </em>Whip, P.A.\u2019 Pursuant to Sections 5-109 through 5-ll[l] of the Corporations and Associations Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland.\u201d In that applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>tion, the petitioner complied with Md.Code (1975, 1985 Repl.Vol.), Corps. &amp; Ass\u2019ns Art., \u00a7 5-111(a), by including in its application the contemplated corporate name, the reasons for adopting it, and the number of stockholders the corporation has or will have when incorporated. The petitioner specifically requested that this Court \u201cgrant [his petition] under the provisions of Sections 5-109 through 5-111....\u201d Based on the application, and the Attorney Grievance Commission\u2019s indication that the name would not violate the Rules of Professional Conduct, we granted the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">In the instant matter, however, Petitioner asks us to render an advisory ethics opinion on the propriety of the trade name he intends to use; he does not ask us to issue a certificate for a corporate name pursuant to the authority granted us under the Corporations and Associations Article. Thus, Petitioner\u2019s request is no different than a request for an advisory ruling from this Court that the fee an attorney intends to charge is reasonable under Rule 1.5 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, or a request that this Court determine whether a claim is meritorious, pursuant to Rule 3.1, prior to the lawyer filing suit. Because it would be improper for this Court to render an advisory ethics opinion, we shall not address the instant petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">We wish to make it clear that our dismissal of the petition should not be considered an approval of the Petitioner\u2019s use of the trade name he desires. We recognize that, according to the comment to Rule 7.5 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, a firm \u201cmay be designated by the names of all or some of its members, by the names of deceased or retired members where there has been a continuing succession in the firm\u2019s identity or by a trade name such as the \u2018ABC Legal Clinic.\u2019 \u201d We also note that Petitioner\u2019s generic trade name does not include the name of the attorney responsible for it. <em>Cf </em>Rule 7.2(d) (\u201cAny communication made pursuant to this Rule shall include the name of at least one lawyer responsible for its content.\u201d). Petitioner may wish to contact the Maryland State Bar Association\u2019s Committee on Ethics, and seek its opinion on the permissibility of generic names such as \u201cHome Buyer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Legal Counsel\u201d in light of Rule 7.5\u2019s prohibition on names that \u201cimply a connection with a government agency or with a public or charitable legal services organization\u201d and Rule 7.1\u2019s prohibition on \u201cmisleading\u201d communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">\n<em>PETITION FOR COURT\u2019S APPROVAL OF ATTORNEY\u2019S USE OF TRADE NAME IS HEREBY DISMISSED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
