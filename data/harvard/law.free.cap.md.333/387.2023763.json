Art., \u00a7 3-801(k) (defining delinquent act).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Douglas argues that the child abuse statute is not applicable to juvenile offenders and, thus, a \u201cdelinquent act\u201d cannot be based upon conduct constituting child abuse. He sets forth several arguments in support of this position and we shall address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">Douglas was found to be delinquent by a juvenile court master based on acts which, if committed by an adult, would have constituted child abuse as well as an attempted sexual offense in the second degree. Douglas was committed to the Department of Juvenile Services as a result of this finding. Thereafter, Douglas\u2019s counsel filed exceptions challenging the master\u2019s use of the child abuse statute as the basis for determining that Douglas committed a delinquent act. Douglas, however, did not challenge the attempted sexual offense finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">An exceptions hearing was held in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (McCurdy, J.). At the hearing, it was established that Douglas, who was thirteen years old at the time of the offenses, was temporarily living with his aunt, uncle, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>their two children, ages ten months and three years. On February 20, 1992, after the uncle went to work, Douglas\u2019s aunt left their children with Douglas so she could go to the store. When she returned, she noticed a scratch on her three-year-old daughter\u2019s face. The child later informed her mother that Douglas had \u201chit her in the face and put his wee wee in her butt.\u201d Based on these findings, the judge decided to overrule Douglas\u2019s exceptions. The judge agreed .with the State\u2019s assertion that both adult and minor offenders are included within the language of the child abuse statute. Pursuant to \u00a7 35A,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the judge concluded that Douglas was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>\u201chousehold or family member\u201d who caused abuse to a child and, therefore, he could be adjudged delinquent based on such conduct. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed in an unreported opinion and we granted Petitioner\u2019s request for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Under the Juvenile Causes Subtitle, an adjudicatory hearing is held to determine whether a child committed a delinquent act. <em>See \u00a7 </em>3-801(b). <em>See also \u00a7 </em>3-801(d) (\u201c \u2018Child\u2019 means a person under the age of 18 years.\u201d); \u00a7 3-812 (setting out the requirements for alleging a delinquent act in a juvenile petition). A delinquent act is defined as \u201can act which would be a crime if committed by an adult.\u201d \u00a7 3-801(k). Upon finding that a child has committed a delinquent act, a disposition hearing is held to determine whether the juvenile requires \u201cassistance, guidance, treatment or rehabilitation.\u201d \u00a7 3-801(n).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Child abuse is a crime. <em>See </em>\u00a7 35A. Moreover, the clear and unambiguous language of \u00a7 3-801(k), defining a delinquent act as \u201can act which would be a crime if committed by an adult,\u201d provides no exception for child abuse. Thus, one might assume that child abuse is a justifiable basis for a delinquent act if the juvenile offender\u2019s conduct and relationship to the victim falls within the statutory language of \u00a7 35A. Section 35A(a)(2)(i) defines \u201cabuse\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">\u201cThe sustaining of physical injury by a child as a result of cruel or inhumane treatment or as a result of a malicious act by any parent or other person who has permanent or <em>temporary care or custody or responsibility for supervision of a child, or by any household or family member, </em>under circumstances that indicate that the child\u2019s health or welfare is harmed or threatened thereby____\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Section 35A(b)(l) makes it a felony offense if a person, who has \u201ctemporary care or custody or responsibility for the supervision of a child\u201d or who is \u201ca household or family member,\u201d causes abuse to a child. Petitioner notes that his adjudication was based on the 1991 amendment to the child abuse statute which expanded the class of potential child abusers by adding the language, \u201cany household or family member.\u201d <em>See </em>Chapter 184 of the Acts of 1991. He contends that the Legislature could not have contemplated that children could be charged with child abuse. Thus, Petitioner argues that \u00a7 35A is an exception to \u00a7 3-801 (k)\u2019s broad definition of delinquent act.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">In order to determine whether \u00a7 35A is limited to adult offenders only, we begin by recognizing that \u201cthe statutory language is, of course, the primary source for determining the legislative intent.\u201d <em>In re Keith G., </em>325 Md. 538, 542, 601 A.2d 1107, 1109 (1992). <em>See also State v. Bricker, </em>321 Md. 86, 92, 581 A.2d 9, 12 (1990) (\u201cWhen interpreting a statute, the starting point is the wording of the relevant provisions.\u201d). A principal rule of statutory construction is that, \u201c[wjhen the Legislature uses commonly accepted words or terms in a statute without qualification, courts construing the statute can and should assume that the Legislature was aware of the commonly accepted meaning of the word[s] or term[s].\u201d <em>Reistertown Lumber v. Royer, </em>91 Md.App. 746, 757, 605 A.2d 980, 985 (citing <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Burke, </em>321 Md. 699, 706, 584 A.2d 702, 706 (1991)), <em>cert. denied, </em>327 Md. 626, 612 A.2d 257 (1992). <em>See also Fairbanks v. McCarter, </em>330 Md. 39, 46, 622 A.2d 121, 125 (1993) (\u201cIt is well settled that in construing a statute to ascertain and effectuate its goal, our first recourse is to the words of the statute, giving them their ordinary and natural import.\u201d); <em>Brodsky v. Brodsky, </em>319 Md. 92, 98, 570 A.2d 1235, 1237 (1990) (\u201c[W]e assume that the words of the statute are intended to have their natural, ordinary and generally understood meaning in the absence of evidence to the contrary.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Section 35A(a)(5) defines \u201chousehold member\u201d as \u201ca <em>person </em>whojives with or is a regular presence in a home of a child at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>the time of the alleged abuse.\u201d (Emphasis added). \u201cFamily member\u201d is defined as \u201ca <em>relative </em>of a child by blood, adoption, or marriage.\u201d \u00a7 35A(a)(4) (emphasis added). Neither \u201cperson\u201d nor \u201crelative\u201d is qualified by the word \u201cadult.\u201d Moreover, the commonly accepted meaning of both \u201cperson\u201d and \u201crelative\u201d is in no way exclusively limited to adults. <em>See, e.g., </em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1686, 1916 (1986) (defining \u201cperson\u201d as \u201can individual human being\u201d and \u201crelative\u201d as \u201ca person connected with another by blood or affinity\u201d). As observed by the Court of Special Appeals in its unreported opinion of the instant case, the statutory definition of abuse has \u201conly one age qualifier \u2014 that is, abuse must be <em>sustained </em>by a child \u2014 someone under the age of 18 years.\u201d (Emphasis in original). In light of the Legislature\u2019s failure to specify that the abuser be an \u201cadult\u201d or someone \u201c18 years or older,\u201d we should assume that \u00a7 35A was not limited only to adult offenders.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Although the words of a statute are the starting point for ascertaining the Legislature\u2019s intent, they must not be read in a vacuum but should be considered in light of other manifestations of legislative intent. <em>See Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 514-15, 525 A.2d 628, 632 (1987). Further evidence of the Legislature\u2019s intent may be gleaned from a statute\u2019s \u201crelationship to earlier and subsequent legislation.\u201d <em>Kaczorowski, </em>309 Md. at 515, 525 A.2d at 632. In \u00a7 3-829(a)(l) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, the Legislature has provided that a \u201ccourt may enter a judgment of restitution against the parent of a child, the child, or both in any case in which the court finds a child has committed a delinquent act\u201d resulting in property loss or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>personal injury to another. Subsequent to the 1991 amendment of the child abuse statute, the Legislature amended \u00a7 3-829 to permit a court to order that a child adjudicated delinquent pay restitution to the victim for counseling expenses, \u201cif the delinquent act involved: ... <em>[c]hild abuse </em>under Article 27, \u00a7 35A of the Code.\u201d \u00a7 3 \u2014 829(a)(l)(iii) (emphasis added). \u25a0 <em>See </em>Ch. 301 of the Acts of 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Clearly the Legislature believed that child abuse was the basis for a delinquent act when it amended \u00a7 3-829. Because this change occurred after the enactment of the statute in question, Petitioner argues that it merely reflects a legislative \u201cassumption that Article 27, sec. 35A applies to minors\u201d and is therefore \u201cweak evidence at best.\u201d The 1992 amendment to \u00a7 3-829, however, may guide us in ascertaining that intent. Absent any other evidence to the contrary, the plain language of \u00a7\u00a7 35A and 3-801(k), when considered in light of \u00a7 3-829\u2019s premise that child abuse constitutes a delinquent act, supports our conclusion that the Legislature intended \u00a7 35A to be the basis for a delinquent act.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Despite these reasons for concluding that the child abuse statute encompasses minor offenders, Douglas argues that \u00a7 35A requires the abuser to be \u201can adult in a position of responsibility superior to that of the child in order to be guilty of the breach of trust that is essential to this crime.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals convincingly disposed of this \u201cresponsibility\u201d argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">\u201c[T]he manner in which the statute was amended is significant. The statute was amended by adding \u2018or by any household or family member\u2019 <em>after </em>the clause, \u2018by any parent or other person who has ... responsibility for supervision of a child.\u2019 The legislature did not amend the statute to read \u2018by any parent or <em>household or family member </em>or other person who has ... responsibility for supervision of a child.\u2019 Indeed, \u2018household or family member\u2019 is not modified at all. Had the legislature amended the statute in this latter fashion, Douglas\u2019[s] argument might have been more persuasive. The actual language of the statute as amended, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>however, implies that a \u2018household or family member\u2019 would <em>not </em>have to have \u2018permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for supervision of a child\u2019 in order for the statute to apply to that household or family member.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Thus, a position of \u201cresponsibility\u201d is not required under the catch-all phrase, \u201cany household or family member.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We therefore find Douglas\u2019s argument without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Douglas also contends that charging a juvenile with child abuse serves no purpose in a juvenile proceeding. He maintains that a delinquent act should be based solely on the \u201cunderlying offense\u201d rather than the child abuse charge because only one delinquent act is necessary for a juvenile disposition. For instance, Douglas\u2019s acts would have constituted both child abuse and an attempted sexual offense in the second degree if he was an adult. Because a juvenile disposition could be based exclusively on the attempted sex offense, Douglas contends that basing a delinquent act on child abuse is \u201cpointless.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">The juvenile delinquency statute does not in any way indicate that juveniles should only be adjudicated delinquent for the least serious, lesser included offense that they commit. Douglas may be adjudicated delinquent for any act which constitutes a crime if committed by an adult. The State is entitled to seek an adjudication of delinquency based on the most serious offense that the juvenile committed, notwithstanding any underlying offenses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We note that the Juvenile Causes Subtitle \u201cshall be liberally construed\u201d to assure that a delinquent child is provided with any necessary \u201ctreatment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>training, and rehabilitation.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 3-802(b), (a)(1). Where a juvenile offender continues to commit delinquent acts, judges making future dispositions should be provided with a record that accurately reflects the juvenile\u2019s prior conduct. A juvenile record reflecting prior child abuse may necessitate a different course of \u201ctreatment, training, and rehabilitation\u201d than one simply reflecting an underlying offense such as assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Moreover, as the State pointed out and the Petitioner conceded, there may be instances where the juvenile court waives its jurisdiction over a minor. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3-817(a) (allowing court to waive exclusive jurisdiction with respect to petition alleging delinquency by child 15 years of age or older, or child charged with committing act punishable by death or life imprisonment if committed by an adult). In such cases, child abuse may be the most appropriate charge to bring against the offender based upon the serious nature of the offense. <em>See </em>\u00a7 35A(b) (permitting imposition of child abuse sentence consecutive to a sentence for any other offense based upon the act or acts establishing the abuse). We shall not assume that the Legislature wished to preclude the State from prosecuting a juvenile for child abuse when jurisdiction over that juvenile is waived to adult court.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Finally, Douglas argues that unreasonable applications of the child abuse statute may result if it is construed as applicable to child family or household offenders who abuse other child family or household members. Douglas states that, \u201c[o]ne wonders, for example, whether a child who injures a sibling in a fight should bear the stigma of a child abuse adjudication or whether a child abuse charge would apply to a ten-year old in the family who injures a sixteen-year old.\u201d We recognize that there may be instances where the statute might seem harsh if applied to sibling altercations, although we do not have such a situation before us. We need not explore all of the circumstances where the statute might be applied to sibling altercations. The plain language of \u00a7 35A evidences a clear intent to include injuries caused by \u201cany household or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>family member, under circumstances that indicate that the child\u2019s health or welfare is harmed or threatened thereby,\u201d regardless of the offender/victim age relationship. Therefore, absent manifestations of contrary legislative intent, and without further guidance from the Legislature, we shall, in the instant case, apply the plain language of the statute. Accordingly, we hold that a \u201cdelinquent act\u201d under \u00a7 3-801(k) of the Juvenile Causes Subtitle may be based upon a minor\u2019s conduct constituting child abuse under Article 27, \u00a7 35A.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.
