BELL, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b563-15\">The respondent, Howard Stuart Myers, was charged, in a petition for disciplinary action, filed by Bar Counsel, on behalf of the Attorney Grievance Commission, with violating Rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>3.3(a)(1)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Rule 8.4(c)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The rules were violated, the petition alleged, by a response the respondent gave to a question posed by the District Court judge concerning his traffic record. Specifically, it averred that in response to the question, \u201cif he had ever gotten a ticket before?\u201d the respondent \u201cfalsely stated, under oath, that he had not had a ticket since he was 19 years old.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The falsity of the statement was revealed when the District Court judge\u2019s review of the respondent\u2019s driving record via the computer terminal revealed \u201cspeeding violations of which respondent was found guilty on August 13,1987, August 24,1988 and June 7, 1990 with (1) current point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">A hearing was held on the petition at which the respondent testified. The court concluded, \u201cby clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Myers\u2019 false and misleading testimony before Judge Wittstadt demonstrates a violation of Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct 3.3(a) and 8.4(c).\u201d On the other hand, the court found \u201cthat since Mr. Myers did not know his driving record, and so testified, his responses to Judge Wittstadt were negligent or intentional misrepresentations and that the respondent knew he was being less than candid.\u201d The court also found that, despite the testimony of a forensic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>psychiatrist called by the respondent, the respondent\u2019s conduct was not caused by any adjustment disorder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">On the first time this matter was before this Court, the respondent excepted to the hearing court\u2019s findings of fact, arguing that it had equivocated as to whether his representations were intentional or negligent. The respondent maintained that this, in and of itself, was proof positive that there was no clear and convincing evidence that his misrepresentations were, in fact, intentional. Rather than dismiss the charges, as the respondent urged we do, we remanded the case to the hearing court \u201cfor a factual determination of whether the statements, which [it] found were false and misleading, were negligently uttered or constituted intentional misrepresentations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">On remand, the hearing court conducted a further hearing. At that hearing, the respondent testified that he did not deliberately intend to deceive the trial judge when he misrepresented his driving record. The hearing court found this testimony to be at variance with the respondent\u2019s prior testimony admitting that he did not know what his record was before representing the number of points he had on his driver\u2019s record. In its \u201cSupplemental Findings and Conclusions of Trial Court,\u201d therefore, the hearing court found, \u201cbased on clear and convincing evidence, that Mr. Myers did deliberately misrepresent his record to Judge Wittstadt in the District Court when he said to him that he had no points on his driving record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">The respondent has filed an exception. He maintains that there is a fatal variance between the charge that was actually brought by Bar Counsel and that which was authorized by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Review Board.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The disciplinary petition, the respondent points out, alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-4\">3. After the guilty finding Judge Wittstadt asked the Respondent about his driving record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">4. Respondent falsely stated, under oath, that he had no points.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">On the other hand, the respondent finds significant that the complaint made by Judge Wittstadt referenced, not a misrepresentation of the number of points the respondent had, but rather whether he had any traffic violations since he was 19 years old and that neither the Inquiry Panel nor the Review Board found that he misrepresented the number of points he had. The Inquiry Panel found \u201cthat the Respondent intentionally misrepresented his driving record to Judge Wittstadt ... while under oath.\u201d Because the Review Board adopted that finding, while making no other, and on that basis authorized the filing of charges, the respondent submits that he was improperly charged by Bar Counsel; he should not have been charged with falsely stating that he had no points, that conduct being \u201cadditional conduct which had not been the subject of recommendations by either the Inquiry Panel or Review Board.\u201d He urges dismissal of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">To be sure, as the petitioner recognizes, attorneys charged with misconduct must be afforded the \u201cbasic elements of due process \u2014 notice and the opportunity to defend in a full and fair hearing.\u201d <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Stewart, </em>285 Md. 251, 259, 401 A.2d 1026, 1030 (1979), citing <em>Bar Ass\u2019n of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number><em>Baltimore v. Posner, 275 </em>Md. 250, 255, 339 A.2d 657, 659-60, <em>cert. denied </em>423 U.S. 1016, 96 S.Ct. 451, 46 L.Ed.2d 388 (1975); <em>Maryland State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Frank, 272 </em>Md. 528, 538, 325 A.2d 718, 723-24 (1974). \u201cOf course, due process considerations dictate that attorneys are entitled to notice of the charges against them when disciplinary proceedings begin.\u201d <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Goldsborough, </em>330 Md. 342, 352, 624 A.2d 503, 508 (1993), citing <em>In re: Ruffalo, </em>390 U.S. 544, 550-51, 88 S.Ct. 1222, 1226, 20 L.Ed.2d 117, 122 (1968). Rule BV9C reflects that concern. Its requirement that \u201c[t]he charges ... be sufficiently clear and specific reasonably to inform the attorney proceeded against of any misconduct charged\u201d is designed to insure that the attorney is afforded notice and the opportunity to defend him or herself against the charges. The notice to which the attorney is entitled is of the factual allegations against which the attorney must defend. <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. McBurney, </em>282 Md. 116, 123-24, 383 A.2d 58, 62-63 (1978). Thus, while \u201cit is the \u2018complaint that an attorney has committed an act of misconduct,\u2019 <em>ie., </em>the operative facts alleged by the complainant as constituting the misconduct, that is referred to the Inquiry Panel,\u201d <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Keister, </em>327 Md. 56, 68, 607 A.2d 909, 915 (1992), it is the factual allegation the Inquiry Panel finds reason to believe and as to which the Review Panel directs charges be filed, of which the attorney must be informed and against which he or she must defend. Once directed to do so, Bar Counsel frames the formal charges. He is not, however, required simply to parrot the Review Board. All that is required is that the charges filed reflect the factual basis for which authorization was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">In this case, the charges brought by Bar Counsel focused on the respondent\u2019s driving record. So, too, did the letter from Judge Wittstadt and the findings of the Inquiry Panel, which the Review Board adopted. An intentionally false response to a question concerning whether a driver has points on his or her record is as much a misrepresentation of that driver\u2019s record as an intentionally false statement made in answer to a question concerning when the driver last received a traffic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>ticket. Moreover, the Wittstadt letter enclosed a tape of the District Court proceedings. Thus, notwithstanding Judge Wittstadt\u2019s specific reference to the respondent\u2019s comments concerning when last he received a ticket, \u201cthe operative facts alleged ... as constituting the misconduct\u201d included both the letter and the tape of the proceedings. Consequently, Bar Counsel\u2019s letter to the respondent defining the scope of the Inquiry Panel\u2019s task appropriately focused on the respondent\u2019s driving record. And it was that general focus, not whether the respondent misrepresented the number of points he had, that both the Inquiry Panel and the Review Board maintained throughout their respective proceedings. In short, what was being inquired into was whether the respondent intentionally misrepresented his driving record. Falsely stating that he had no points was one way of making such a misrepresentation. While, as the respondent correctly observes, we have said that \u201cBar Counsel may, file only such charges, supported by the facts found, as are \u2018directed\u2019 by the Review Board [but wjhere ... the Review Board does not direct, either expressly or implicitly, its filing, a respondent may challenge that charge at anytime,\u201d <em>Keister, </em>327 Md. at 73, 607 A.2d at 917, in this case, there is no basis for a challenge.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">The respondent\u2019s exception is overruled. We now proceed to consider the appropriate sanction for the conduct which the hearing judge found to have been proven by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">It is well-settled that the purpose of disciplinary proceedings is to protect the public rather than to punish the erring attorney. <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Goldsborough, </em>330 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Md. at 364, 624 A.2d at 513; <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v.

We have recognized that the public interest is served when this Court imposes a sanction which demonstrates to members of the legal profession the type of conduct that will not be tolerated. <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Kerpelman, </em>288 Md. 341, 382, 420 A.2d 940, 959 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 970, 101 S.Ct. 1492, 67 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981). Moreover, such a sanction represents the fulfillment by this Court of its responsibility \u201cto insist upon the maintenance of the integrity of the bar and to prevent the transgression of an individual lawyer from bringing its image into disrepute.\u201d <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Agnew, </em>271 Md. 543, 549, 318 A.2d 811, 814 (1974). Therefore, the public interest is served when sanctions designed to effect general and specific deterrence are imposed on an attorney who violates the disciplinary rules. <em>See Protokowicz, </em>329 Md. at 262-63, 619 A.2d at 105; <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Owrutsky, </em>322 Md. 334, 355, 587 A.2d 511, 521 (1991); <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Alison, </em>317 Md. 523, 540-41, 565 A.2d 660, 668 (1989). Of course, what the appropriate sanction for the particular misconduct is, in the public interest, generally depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case. <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Babbitt, </em>300 Md. 637, 642, 479 A.2d 1372, 1375 (1984) (the facts and circumstances of a case will determine how severe the sanction should be); <em>Montgomery, </em>296 Md. at 120, 460 A.2d at 600; <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Pollack, </em>289 Md. 603, 609, 425 A.2d 1352, 1355 (1981). The attorney\u2019s prior grievance history, as well as facts in mitigation, constitute part of those facts and circumstances. <em>Maryland State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Phoebus, </em>276 Md. 353, 362, 347 A.2d 556, 561 (1975). \u201cIn cases where the improper conduct of the lawyer involved misrepresentation, the severity of the sanction to be imposed for the misconduct depends upon the facts and cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>cumstanees of the particular case.\u201d <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Myers, </em>302 Md. at 579, 490 A.2d at 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">This is not the first time that the respondent has been disciplined by this Court. In 1985, he was suspended from the practice of law for a period of three years for conduct similar to that exhibited in the instant case. In that case, we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">\u201cMyers attempted to mislead an investigator [of the Attorney Grievance Commission] and the inquiry panel by producing a fabricated cover letter which purported to inform [his client] that the document required a witness. After observing that the will was signed and dated a full week before the alleged cover letter was sent, the panel and the court below concluded that Myers had artlessly lied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 580, 490 A.2d at 235. Prior to that proceeding, the respondent had been reprimanded for incompetence.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Although not required to do so, the hearing court offered its opinion that, notwithstanding its findings of facts and conclusions of law with respect to the respondent\u2019s conduct in front of Judge Wittstadt, the respondent should be allowed to continue in the practice of law. Noting that we have indicated that disbarment should be exercised with extreme caution, <em>see Bar Ass\u2019n of Baltimore City v. Marshall, </em>269 Md. 510, 518, 307 A.2d 677, 681 (1973), and that mitigating circumstances may and should be considered in determining the appropriate punishment, <em>see Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Pollack, </em>289 Md. at 609, 425 A.2d at 1355, it urges that a sanction other than disbarment be imposed. In addition, the respondent notes that, at the time he appeared in court he was very upset and concerned about the health of his longtime companion. Moreover, aware that his prior grievance history ought to, and will, be taken into account, the respondent points out that lawyer misrepresentations have not always resulted in disbarment even when the attorney has previously been disciplined for misconduct.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Finally, the respondent asserts that he is genu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>inely contrite for the misconduct and wishes to make amends. T .ike the hearing court, the respondent believes that a sanction other than disbarment is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">While disbarment ordinarily follows as a matter of course \u201cwhen a member of the bar is shown to be willfully dishonest for personal gain by means of fraud, deceit, cheating or like conduct, absent the most compelling extenuating circumstances,\u201d <em>Agnew, </em>271 Md. at 558, 318 A.2d at 817, that is not the only time that sanction is employed. Viewed in light of the respondent\u2019s prior suspension and the nature of the conduct for which it was imposed, we believe the proper sanction for the intentional misrepresentation in this case is the ultimate one, disbarment. Candor and truthfulness are two of the most important moral character traits of a lawyer. <em>See Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Levitt, </em>286 Md. 231, 238, 406 A.2d 1296, 1299 (1979); <em>Fellner v. Bar Ass\u2019n of Balt. City, </em>213 Md. 243, 247, 131 A.2d 729, 732 (1957). The respondent has exhibited an absence of those traits on not one, but two, occasions, and previously has been suspended as a result of one of them. This instance of misrepresentation, in fact, comes after he has completed a three year suspension for the earlier misrepresentation, thus indicating that he has \u201capparently learned nothing\u201d from that experience. <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Bailey, </em>294 Md. 526, 527, 451 A.2d 1210, 1210 (1982). <em>See also Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Sherman, </em>297 Md. 318, 327-28, 465 A.2d 1161, 1166 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">We are aware, of course, that sanctions short of disbarment have been imposed for misrepresentation, <em>i.e., </em>reprimand, <em>see, e.g., Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Stancil, </em>296 Md. 325, 333, 463 A.2d 789, 792 (1983) (reprimand); <em>Att\u2019y Griev.

O\u2019Neill, </em>285 Md. 52, 57, 400 A.2d 415, 418 (1979) (reprimand) or suspension, <em>see Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v.

Comm\u2019n v. Sherman, </em>295 Md. 229, 454 A.2d 359 (1983) and even when the attorney has previously been disciplined for misconduct. <em>See Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Urisko, </em>314 Md. 170, 176, 550 A.2d 370, 373 (1988) (60 day suspension for, <em>inter alia, </em>misrepresentation and neglect; respondent had previously been privately reprimanded for neglect); <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Singleton, </em>305 Md. 259, 268, 503 A.2d 714, 719 (1986) (indefinite suspension with right to apply for reinstatement after 45 days for misrepresentation and neglect, after prior private reprimand for 2 separate instances of neglect); <em>Myers, supra </em>(3 year suspension for misrepresentation after reprimand for incompetence); <em>Sherman, supra </em>(3 year suspension for misrepresentation after dismissal with warning in connection with allegations of neglect and incompetence). <em>See also Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Pollack, supra. </em>While it is true that in each of the latter cases, the attorney was not disbarred, in none of them did the prior misconduct also involve misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">The former cases are also distinguishable. In <em>Standi, </em>for example, although the misrepresentation was made to a client, we noted that \u201cthe disciplinary rule violations here resulted from a difficult relationship with a single client that appears to be an isolated episode not likely to recur.\u201d 296 Md. at 333, 463 A.2d at 792. The misrepresentation in <em>Heinze </em>was made to forwarding counsel. The Court viewed it as \u201cnot as grievous\u201d as that in <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Finnesey, </em>283 Md. 541, 547, 391 A.2d 434, 437 (1978) (30 day suspension for misrepre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>sentations made to client on at least three occasions concerning hearing dates which were never set on a petition which was never filed) and as not rising to the level of the misrepresentations in <em>Levitt </em>and <em>Bailey. </em>In both <em>Bailey </em>and <em>Levitt </em>the misrepresentation was made to the court. In <em>Bailey </em>the Court apparently treated it as part and parcel of the attorney\u2019s incompetence. <em>See </em>286 Md. at 686-38, 408 A.2d at 1334. The Court held in <em>Levitt </em>that the \u201cconduct [lying] in the apparent context in which it took place does not rise to that \u2018involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation,\u2019 but is confined to his having \u2018[k]nowingly ma[d]e a false statement ... of fact.\u2019 \u201d 286 Md. at 234, 406 A.2d at 1300. In <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>the attorney disciplined was a neophyte, who, on the day that the lies were told, admitted them and also exhibited extreme contrition for having lied. 285 Md. at 56-57, 400 A.2d at 417-418. And this case is not within that line of cases where the misrepresentation was not for personal gain. <em>See Maxwell, </em>307 Md. at 603, 516 A.2d at 571; <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v.
