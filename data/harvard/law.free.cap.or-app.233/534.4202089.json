ORS 162.385.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He contends that, in convicting him, the trial court explicitly proceeded from an erroneous legal premise, <em>viz., </em>that a person violates ORS 162.385 by knowingly giving false information to a peace officer, regardless of whether the person knows that the officer has requested the information either for the purpose of \u201cissuing or serving * * * a citation,\u201d ORS 162.385(l)(a), or of \u201carresting the person on a warrant,\u201d ORS 162.385(l)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The state acknowledges that, as we held in <em>State v. Jaha, </em>118 Or App 497, 501, 848 P2d 622 (1993), it must prove that the defendant \u201cact[ed] with knowledge of every element of the offense, <em>including that the officer was requesting identification for the purpose of issuing a citation.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Accordingly, the state concedes that the trial court erred and agrees with defendant that he is entitled to a new trial. We accept the state\u2019s concession as well founded under <em>Jaha.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-7\"> ORS 162.385 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-8\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of giving false information to a peace officer for issuance or service of a citation or for an arrest on a warrant if the person knowingly uses or gives a false or fictitious name, address or date of birth to any peace officer for the purpose of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-9\">\u201c(a) The officer\u2019s issuing or serving the person a citation under authority of ORS 133.055 to 133.076 or ORS chapter 153; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-10\">\u201c(b) The officer\u2019s arresting the person on a warrant.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
