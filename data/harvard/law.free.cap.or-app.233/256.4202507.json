J.</author>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">In May 2008, a judgment of conviction was entered following defendant\u2019s pleas of guilty to five counts of identity theft. ORS 165.800. On three of those counts, defendant was sentenced to consecutive terms of 13 months each, for a total of 39 months of incarceration. At the time that defendant committed her crimes, ORS 421.121(2) (2007) provided that the maximum amount of time credits for appropriate institutional behavior (good time credits) could not exceed 20 percent of the total term of incarceration. The 2009 legislature amended ORS 421.121 to increase the maximum amount of good time credits to 30 percent for inmates not convicted of listed violent felonies. Or Laws 2009, ch 660, \u00a7\u00a7 17,18 (House Bill (HB) 3508). Defendant\u2019s crimes were not excluded from eligibility for an increase in good time credits to 30 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">A hearing was held before the trial court to determine if defendant was eligible for the increased good time credits. The trial court determined that defendant was not eligible for additional good time credits. A supplemental judgment provided that defendant \u201cmay not be considered\u201d for the increased good time credits. Defendant filed a notice of appeal from the supplemental judgment and moved for an expedited appeal. The Appellate Commissioner issued an order to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, relying on <em>State v. Hart, </em>188 Or App 650, 653, 72 P3d 671 (2003) (only post-judgment orders that impose a sentence, suspend imposition or execution of a sentence, or affect probation can be appealed under ORS 138.053(1)). Pursuant to ORS 19.235(3) and after considering the responses filed by the parties, we summarily determine that this court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>HB 3508, section 17(2)(a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> amended ORS 421.121 to increase the maximum amount of good time credits an inmate convicted of certain nonviolent crimes could earn from 20 percent to 30 percent of the total term of incarceration. HB 3508, section 18, provides the process by which a trial court determines whether an inmate is eligible for the 30 percent maximum reduction in the term of incarceration. If the trial court finds that the inmate is eligible for such consideration by the Department of Corrections, the trial court shall enter a supplemental judgment so stating.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">Defendant argues that the supplemental judgment determining that she is not eligible for the additional good time credits is appealable because HB 3508, sections 17 and 18, require the trial court to make new factual findings and legal conclusions, which results in the imposition of a new sentence appealable under ORS 138.053(l)(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, in contrast to the order in <em>Hart, </em>which merely denied the defendant\u2019s motion to correct a previously imposed sentence, defendant argues that HB 3508, sections 17 and 18, create a process for \u201cresentencing\u201d certain categories of inmates depending on whether they are found eligible or ineligible for the term reduction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>The state responds that the supplemental judgment does not fall within the appealable actions identified in ORS 138.053(1) because the supplemental judgment neither imposes nor suspends imposition or execution of a sentence and does not affect probation. The state also argues that no \u201cresentencing\u201d occurred because nothing changed in defendant\u2019s sentence. Finally, the state argues that, notwithstanding the legislative history relied on by defendant, the term \u201cresentencing\u201d does not appear in HB 3508.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">We agree with the state. There is no right of appeal when the trial court <em>denies </em>eligibility for additional good time credits to an inmate, because the ruling does not alter the original judgment. Moreover, HB 3508, section 18, provides for entry of a supplemental judgment <em>only </em>when the trial court determines that it is appropriate to <em>allow </em>the Department of Corrections to consider the inmate for a sentence reduction. There are two subsections in section 18 that permit the trial court to enter a supplemental judgment authorizing the department to consider an inmate for reduction. The first, subsection 18(5)(b), provides the procedure when neither the district attorney nor the victim files objections:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">\u201cIf a notice of objection is not filed with the court within the time period described in subsection (4) of this section and the sentencing court determines that it is appropriate to authorize the department to consider the inmate for a reduction in the term of incarceration under ORS 421.121 that may not exceed 30 percent of the total term of incarceration in a department institution, the court shall enter a supplemental judgment using the form of judgment submitted by the department under subsection (14)(a) of this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The second, subsection 18(7)(b), provides the procedure when an objection has been filed by either the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>attorney or the victim, or both, or when the court acts on its own motion, and after a hearing has been held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-4\">\u201cUpon the conclusion of the hearing, the court shall order on the record in open court that the department is authorized to consider the inmate for a reduction in the term of incarceration under ORS 421.121 that may not exceed 30 percent of the total term of incarceration in a department institution, unless the court finds, on the record and in open court, substantial reasons to order that the inmate not be considered for the reduction. <em>If the court orders that the inmate may he considered for the reduction, the court shall enter a supplemental judgment using the form of judgment submitted by the department under subsection (14)(a) of this section.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">(Emphasis added.) Both subsections require the entry of a supplemental judgment when the trial court rules that an inmate is <em>eligible </em>for a sentence reduction because the trial court has effectively amended the original sentence. HB 3508 does not provide for entry of a supplemental judgment when a trial court determines that an inmate is ineligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">In contrast, the Department of Corrections\u2019 decision to provide a form of supplemental judgment that can either grant or deny relief was not contemplated by HB 3508, sections 17 or 18. In fact, subsection 18(14)(a) of HB 3508 limits the department\u2019s authority to prepare \u201ca form of supplemental judgment that specifies the sentences and counts for which an inmate is <em>eligible </em>for a reduction in the term of incarceration under ORS 421.121 that exceeds 20 percent of the total term of incarceration.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal on our own motion, remand the case to the trial court to vacate the supplemental judgment and reenter its decision as a nonappealable order. <em>See Austin Mutual Ins.
