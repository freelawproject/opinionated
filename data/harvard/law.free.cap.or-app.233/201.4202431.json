J.</author>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">Defendant appeals from the judgment of his conviction for interfering with public transportation, ORS 166.116(l)(a), assigning error to the denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal (MJOA). In particular, defendant contends that he had not \u201center[ed] or remain[ed] unlawfully in * * * [a] public transit station,\u201d ORS 166.116(l)(a), in violation of a TriMet exclusion order because the area at the Hillsboro Transit Center where he was walking when he was arrested was not a \u201cTransit Dedicated Light Rail Platform[ ]\u201d as defined in the Notice of Exclusion. We agree with defendant and, accordingly, reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">In reviewing the denial of an MJOA, we view the evidence and reasonably related inferences in the light most favorable to the state. <em>See State v. Hall, </em>327 Or 568, 570, 966 P2d 208 (1998). Consistently with that standard, the material facts are as follows: On January 27, 2008, Hillsboro Police Officer Bunday issued a TriMet Notice of Exclusion to defendant for riding on a MAX train without having paid the fare. As pertinent here, the notice stated that defendant was \u201cexcluded from and prohibited from entering or remaining upon, the TriMet system, as described in the attached Exhibit D\u201d for a period of 60 days.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As described in detail below, Exhibit D to the notice specified that the exclusion applied to, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cTransit Dedicated Light Rail Platforms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">On February 16, 2008, during the period of exclusion, Hillsboro Police Officer Morse saw defendant walking on the westbound MAX train platform at the Hillsboro Transit Center. The transit center is a complex that includes not only platforms for eastbound and westbound MAX trains but also bus shelters and bicycle racks, as well as two buildings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>that are immediately adjacent to the westbound train platform. One of those buildings houses a Hillsboro police substation, and, in the walkway between the two buildings, there are public pay telephones.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Unlike at some other TriMet locations, where access to platforms is restricted to persons possessing proof of fare, the MAX train platforms at the Hillsboro Transit Center are open to members of the public without proof of fare. Consequently, members of the public without a MAX ticket and who have no intention of riding the MAX train can use the westbound platform \u2014 the location where defendant was walking \u2014 to gain access to the adjacent pay telephones and police substation. Similarly, members of the public can, without proof of fare, enter the platform area to park their bicycles at the adjacent bicycle racks.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Morse recognized defendant from a previous encounter and knew that he was subject to a currently effective TriMet exclusion order. Accordingly, he arrested defendant, and defendant was charged by complaint with one count of interfering with public transportation, ORS 166.116. That statute provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of interfering with public transportation if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">\u201c(a) Intentionally or knowingly enters or remains unlawfully in or on a public transit vehicle or public transit station;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-9\">\u201c(3) As used in this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-10\">\u201c(a) \u2018Enter or remain unlawfully\u2019 has the meaning given that term in ORS 164.205.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">ORS 164.205(3), in turn, defines the term \u201center or remain unlawfully\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-12\">\u201c \u2018Enter or remain unlawfully\u2019 means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-13\">\u201c(a) To enter or remain in or upon premises when the premises, at the time of such entry or remaining, are not open to the public or when the entrant is not otherwise licensed or privileged to do so[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Defendant waived trial by jury, and, after the state presented its evidence, he moved for a judgment of acquittal. Defendant argued that, given the terms of the exclusion notice \u2014 and particularly the description of the scope of exclusion in Exhibit D \u2014 his presence on the platform did not violate the exclusion and, thus, was not \u201cunlawful\u201d for purposes of ORS 166.116(l)(a). Defendant contended, particularly, that the platform where he had been arrested was not a \u201cTransit Dedicated Light Rail Platform[ ]\u201d as defined in Exhibit D, because that area was not used solely for purposes of transit but, instead, could be used by members of the public who are not TriMet riders for a variety of purposes not related to mass transit, including making telephone calls at the pay telephones, contacting the police at the adjacent substation, and parking bicycles. The trial court denied that motion without comment. When defendant renewed his MJOA at the close of all evidence, the court again denied the motion, observing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-4\">\u201c[pleople that are excluded are excluded from transit dedicated light rail platforms in general. This was a transit dedicated light rail platform.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">On appeal, defendant assigns error to the denial of the MJOA and reprises his arguments before the trial court. We begin with the operative language of the exclusion notice, including Exhibit D. As noted, the face of the notice, under the heading \u201cEffect of this Notice,\u201d provides, \u201cUnless your exclusion is modified or set aside * * * you will be excluded from and prohibited from entering or remaining upon, the TriMet system, as described in the attached Exhibit D.\u201d Exhibit D provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">\u201cNotwithstanding any definition of the geographic boundaries of the District Transit System contained within [ORS] 267.010, resolutions affecting TriMet\u2019s boundaries, contract provisions, the TriMet Code, any formal legal designation of certain property as owned or controlled by TriMet, or elsewhere, the geographic boundaries of the District Transit System, for the purpose of enforcing TriMet regulations through exclusions, or enforcing exclusions through arrest or criminal citation, shall be construed as limited to the areas that are readily discernable as TriMet property, as defined herein. No person shall be issued a Notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Exclusion for conduct that occurred outside of the boundaries defined herein. <em>In addition, the \u2018part of the District Transit System [from] which said person is excluded\u2019 shall be limited to the </em>following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-4\">\u201c1. TriMet Vehicles. ** *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">\u201c2. TriMet Parking Facilities. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">\u201c3. Partially or Fully Enclosed Bus Shelters. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">\u201c4. Transit Dedicated Light Rail Platforms. Transit Dedicated Platforms <em>include those platforms that are used solely </em>for the purpose of transit and <em>have no shared use with the public or public walkways, </em>through-ways, or sidewalks, and includes adjoining stairways, ramps and elevators.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-8\">\u201c5. Trackways * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">At first blush, the use of the term \u201c \u2018part of the District Transit System [from] which said person is excluded\u2019 \u201d seems inscrutable because there is no explicit referent in the text of the notice or the balance of Exhibit D. However, contextually, it is patent that that language corresponds to, and is derived from, TriMet Code section 28.18B., which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-11\">\u201cA person excluded under TMC Section 28.18 may not during the period of exclusion, enter or remain upon any <em>part of the District Transit System from which said person is excluded. </em>An excluded person who enters or remains upon any <em>part of the District Transit System from which the person has been excluded </em>may be charged with the crime of Interfering with Public Transportation (ORS 166.116) or the crime of Criminal Trespass in the Second Degree (ORS 164.245).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b234-13\">Given that context, Exhibit D, by its terms, limits the scope of the exclusion to five precisely defined types of locations that do not collectively comprise the totality of TriMet\u2019s property. That is, a person who is subject to the exclusion would not violate that exclusion \u2014 and, derivatively, ORS 166.116(l)(a) \u2014 merely by entering upon TriMet property; rather, the state, to establish a violation, must demonstrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>that a defendant intentionally or knowingly entered one of the five specifically defined types of locations. Consequently, in the circumstances of this case, the inquiry reduces to whether the westbound MAX train platform at the Hillsboro Transit Center was a \u201cTransit Dedicated Light Rail Platform! ]\u201d as defined in Exhibit D.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Defendant contends that the uncontroverted evidence established that the platform could be, and was, used by members of the public, including those who are not TriMet passengers, for a variety of purposes that are not related to mass transit, including to make pay telephone calls, to park and lock their bicycles at the bicycle rack on the platform, and to gain access to contact police at the adjacent police substation. Defendant reasons and asserts, consequently, that the westbound platform was not a \u201cTransit Dedicated Light Rail Platform! ]\u201d because it was <em>not </em>\u201cused solely for the purpose of transit\u201d and that it <em>did </em>have a \u201cshared use with the public or public walkways [and] through-ways.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">We do not understand the state to dispute defendant\u2019s characterization of the nature and multiplicity of the platform\u2019s shared public uses. Rather, the state contends that defendant\u2019s understanding of the scope and content of \u201cTransit Dedicated Light Rail Platforms\u201d is erroneously restrictive. Specifically, the state stresses that the operative provision begins, \u201cTransit Dedicated Platforms <em>include </em>* * (Emphasis in state\u2019s brief.) The state then highlights the distinction, in its view, between \u201cmeans\u201d (as a term of exclusive definition) and \u201cincludes\u201d (as a term of nonexclusive description). That is, the state posits that \u201cincludes\u201d in this context functionally connotes \u201cincluding, but not limited to.\u201d Thus, in the state\u2019s view,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">\u201cplatforms that are solely dedicated for transit purposes and have no shared public use are only a part of a larger category, i.e., all transit dedicated light rail platforms. In other words, transit dedicated light rail platforms are not limited to those that are solely dedicated for transit purposes and have no shared public use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">As further contextual support for that construction, the state points to other provisions of Exhibit D that either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>begin with \u201cinclude\u201d but subsequently qualify that description with limiting \u201cbut not including\u201d language or explicitly employ terms of exclusion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">The state\u2019s efforts are unavailing as contradicting the plain language of the pertinent provision of Exhibit D. Again, that provision reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\">\u201c4. Transit Dedicated Light Rail Platforms. Transit Dedicated Platforms include those platforms that are used solely for the purpose of transit and have no shared use with the public or public walkways, through-ways, or sidewalks, and includes adjoining stairways, ramps and elevators.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The operative term in that provision is \u201c[dedicated.\u201d \u201cDedicate\u201d means, as pertinent in common use, \u201cto set apart or devote formally or seriously to a definite use, end, or service.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>589 (unabridged ed 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Consistently with that understanding, \u201cinclude\u201d in the definition connotes \u201cmeans\u201d \u2014 that is, \u201cTransit <em>Dedicated </em>Light Rail Platforms\u201d means platforms that are used solely for transit purposes and does not include those platforms for which there is a shared public use. Conversely, to construe \u201cincludes\u201d as the state <em>urges </em>\u2014 viz., that \u201cTransit Dedicated Light Rail Platforms\u201d includes all platforms used in part for transit purposes, regardless of the nature and degree of the shared public use for nontransit purposes, ignores or obviates the sense and significance of \u201cdedicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Further, under the state\u2019s reading, the wording \u201cthat are used solely for the purpose of transit and have no shared use with the public\u201d would be gratuitous, as self-evident. That is, if the universe of \u201cTransit Dedicated Light Rail Platforms\u201d includes all platforms with any transit-related purpose, however slight, then, of course, that universe includes \u201cthose platforms that are used solely for the purpose of transit.\u201d Logically, linguistically, and functionally, it is counterintuitive to define an (allegedly) broadly inclusive class solely by reference to its most indisputably obvious member. <em>Accord Kelly v. Hochberg, </em>231 Or App 155, 160, 217 P3d 699 (2009) (addressing construction of \u201crecreational purposes\u201d definitional statutes, which stated that the term \u201cincludes, but is not limited to\u201d a variety of listed uses); <em>Friends of Yamhill County v. Yamhill County, </em>229 Or App 188, 193, 211 P3d 297 (2009) (noting that, under principle of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>a court, in construing statutory definition that begins with \u201cincludes\u201d followed by \u201can open-ended statutory list,\u201d \u201cis limited by the common characteristics of those things already in the list\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">We thus agree with defendant that \u201cTransit Dedicated Light Rail Platforms\u201d for purposes of Exhibit D means those used \u201csolely\u201d for transit purposes and does not encompass those with a \u201cshared use with the public.\u201d We further agree with defendant that, even viewed most favorably to the state, the evidence in this case did not establish that the westbound MAX train platform at the Hillsboro Transit Center was a \u201cTransit Dedicated Light Rail Platform\u201d as so defined. Consequently, defendant\u2019s presence at that location did not violate the exclusion order, and there is no evidence that defendant had otherwise \u201center[ed] or remained] unlawfully\u201d in that location. ORS 166.116(l)(a). Accordingly, the trial court erred in denying the MJOA.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-8\"> The notice specified that, unless defendant timely requested a hearing, the exclusion would take effect 10 business days after receipt of the notice.
