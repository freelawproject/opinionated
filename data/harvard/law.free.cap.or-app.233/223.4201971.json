In his first assignment, he contends that the trial court erroneously admitted certain evidence that connected defendant to the assault. In his second assignment, defendant asserts that the court erred in instructing the jury that defendant could be liable for third-degree assault on an aid-and-abet theory when it was the fact of his presence in aid of the principal that made the offense an assault in the third degree. In his third assignment, defendant asserts that the court should have instructed the jury that at least 10 of the jurors must agree on whether defendant was guilty as principal or as aider-abettor. The state concedes the point that defendant raises in his second assignment of error. We write only to address that assignment and agree with the parties that the trial court erred. <em>See State v. Merida-Medina, </em>221 Or App 614, 619-20, 191 P3d 708 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 690 (2009) (holding that, \u201c[b]ecause the aid of \u2018another person\u2019 is necessary for the crime [of third-degree assault] to occur, under ORS 161.165(2), the \u2018other\u2019 person is not deemed to be an accomplice in the third-degree assault\u201d and concluding that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could find the defendant guilty of third-degree assault under an aid-and-abet theory).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Our conclusion renders defendant\u2019s third assignment \u2014 that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could convict defendant on a theory of either principal liability or accomplice (aid-and-abet) liability \u2014 a moot point.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Case Number A138180 reversed and remanded; Case Number A138181 affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
