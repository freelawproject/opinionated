J.</author>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction and sentence of life without parole stemming from the burglary, robbery, and murder of Jessie Valero. After a jury trial in which the state sought the death penalty, defendant was convicted of seven counts as follows: two counts of aggravated murder, based on defendant\u2019s intentional killing of the victim to conceal the identity of the perpetrator of robbery (Count 1) and burglary (Count 2), ORS 163.095(2)(e); intentional murder (Count 3), ORS 163.115(l)(a); two counts of felony murder, based on defendant\u2019s killing of the victim \u201cin the course of and in furtherance of\u2019 the crimes of robbery (Count 4) and burglary (Count 5), ORS 163.115(l)(b); first-degree robbery (Count 6), ORS 164.415; and first-degree burglary (Count 7), ORS 164.225. Defendant raises multiple assignments of error. Because it is dispositive, we write to address defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in excluding hearsay statements offered by the defense to show that a third party, Tiffany Scherer, had killed the victim. We conclude that the trial court so erred and that the error was not harmless. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a new trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Given the jury\u2019s verdict in this case, we \u201cstate the facts that the jury was permitted to hear in the light most favorable to the state.\u201d <em>State v. Thoma, </em>313 Or 268, 270, 834 P2d 1020 (1992). On the morning of March 17, 2005, a relative discovered Valero\u2019s body on the living room floor of her apartment in Hillsboro. Valero had died from 29 stab wounds. Aside from the contents of her jewelry box, which were strewn over her bed, her apartment was clean and in order. A gold pendant depicting the Virgin Mary was missing from her possessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">On August 22, 2005, defendant and two other men, Jorge Reyes-Sanchez and Jose Lugardo-Madero, were charged with Valero\u2019s murder and related crimes. Like defendant, Reyes-Sanchez was charged with two counts of aggravated murder, ORS 163.095(2)(e), intentional murder, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>ORS 163.115(l)(a), two counts of felony murder, ORS 163.115(l)(b), robbery in the first degree, ORS 164.415, and burglary in the first degree, ORS 164.225. Lugardo-Madero was charged with two counts of felony murder, robbery in the first degree, and burglary in the first degree. Reyes-Sanchez\u2019s trial commenced January 10, 2007. By the time defendant\u2019s trial began, on March 13, 2007, a jury had convicted Reyes-Sanchez of charges related to Valero\u2019s murder, including aggravated murder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Lugardo-Madero was scheduled to go to trial in May 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">At defendant\u2019s trial, Lugardo-Madero testified for the prosecution. Lugardo-Madero testified that, on the evening of March 15, 2005, he had accompanied defendant and Reyes-Sanchez to Valero\u2019s apartment complex. On the way to Valero\u2019s apartment, defendant informed Lugardo-Madero that \u201cwe were going to break into an apartment\u201d to steal jewelry. It was understood that they would then attempt to exchange the stolen property for methamphetamine. Lugardo-Madero told defendant and Reyes-Sanchez that he did not want to go in and offered to wait outside. At some point, Lugardo-Madero got tired of waiting and approached the apartment. He heard a loud noise, became frightened, and left to go to the apartment of a mutual friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Lugardo-Madero further testified that, later that night, defendant arrived at the apartment where Lugardo-Madero was, bathed himself, and laundered some of his clothes. Another witness also saw defendant throw some clothes into the dumpster outside. Another witness testified that, sometime before sunrise that same night, she had seen defendant with blood on his hands and Reyes-Sanchez with blood on his pants. According to Lugardo-Madero, when he next saw defendant a week later, defendant told him that he and Reyes-Sanchez \u201chad killed the lady\u201d and threatened that, if Lugardo-Madero told anyone, \u201c[t]he same thing could happen to [him].\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Sometime after Valero\u2019s murder, a witness saw defendant with a gold pendant depicting the Virgin Mary. Several other witnesses testified that they saw Reyes-Sanchez with the pendant in the days and weeks following Valero\u2019s murder. A witness who eventually obtained the pendant testified that it came from Reyes-Sanchez and that, later, Reyes-Sanchez asked that the pendant be returned to him because it \u201cbelonged to the lady that got murdered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">While investigating the crime scene, the police found a red bicycle that Reyes-Sanchez had stolen inside Valero\u2019s apartment, blocking the front door. At least one witness also saw defendant and Lugardo-Madero with the bicycle. The police also discovered a screwdriver with a yellow handle behind the victim\u2019s apartment building that had been sharpened to a point and which, forensic testing later revealed, had trace amounts of Valero\u2019s blood on it. At trial, the state offered testimony from witnesses who had seen defendant and Reyes-Sanchez with similar screwdrivers, including one who had seen defendant with a yellow-handled screwdriver like the one found at the murder scene on the day of the murder. However, no DNA, fingerprints, or other forensic evidence connected defendant to the murder scene.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">During the defense\u2019s case at trial, but outside the presence of the jury, defendant proffered evidence that another person, Tiffany Scherer, had killed the victim. Specifically, as part of an offer of proof, defendant presented testimony from four witnesses \u2014 Connie Torres (C. Torres), Naomi Rivera, Lisa Smith, and Jessica Callahan \u2014 who recounted statements by Scherer in which Scherer, with varying degrees of detail, had admitted that she had stabbed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>a female victim to death. After each witness testified, the trial court permitted the state to cross-examine the witness on her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">In addition to the four hearsay witnesses, defendant also proffered, as corroborating evidence, the testimony of Benilde Torres (B. Torres) and Hillsboro Police Detective Patrick Brady. B. Torres testified that she saw Scherer with a scratch on her neck about two or three days after she learned of Valero\u2019s murder. Brady testified that there were no other murder cases in Hillsboro in March 2005 involving a female victim who had been stabbed multiple times.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Finally, as part of his offer of proof, defendant called Scherer. As amplified below, Scherer denied either murdering Valero or making the self-inculpatory statements recounted by the four hearsay witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Defendant contended that, notwithstanding that Scherer was available to testify, the hearsay testimony recounting her admissions, as corroborated by other evidence, must be admitted to show that she, not defendant, had killed Valero. Because the testimony of the four hearsay witnesses is central to our analysis and disposition, we describe that testimony in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">C. Torres testified that, about a week after she learned of Valero\u2019s death in the paper, she encountered Scherer \u201cunderneath [her] friend\u2019s truck, * * * listening to music, acting like a little baby,\u201d and \u201crocking back and forth.\u201d According to C. Torres, she approached Scherer to see what was wrong and brought her inside, where \u201c[Scherer] just\u2014 she broke down * * * [a]nd * * * started crying.\u201d Scherer then told C. Torres that \u201cshe killed somebody, she killed a girl\u201d\u2014 and, specifically, that \u201c[Scherer] and this girl were fighting,\u201d that the argument escalated, and that \u201conce she started * * * she couldn\u2019t stop,\u201d \u201c[s]he stabbed her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">C. Torres further testified that Scherer said that after she stabbed the \u201cgirl\u201d to death, she got scared and tried to make it look like a burglary. Scherer told C. Torres that others were involved in the cover-up, but C. Torres \u201cdidn\u2019t ask for any names.\u201d C. Torres acknowledged that Scherer never identified who she had stabbed, but she was able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>\u201cput two and two together\u201d and connect Scherer\u2019s account to Valero\u2019s murder. After Scherer confessed to her, Scherer \u201cdisappeared for a while,\u201d and C. Torres did not see her again until \u201ca couple of months\u201d later.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">On cross-examination by the state, C. Torres admitted that, although her encounter with Scherer was about a week after Valero\u2019s murder, the first time she disclosed Scherer\u2019s purported statements to the defense or the authorities was in the middle of Reyes-Sanchez\u2019s trial, in January 2007, nearly two years later. According to C. Torres, she came forward after she learned that the state was seeking the death penalty against defendant and Reyes-Sanchez: \u201cI don\u2019t think somebody who\u2019s not guilty of doing something, I don\u2019t think they should get the death penalty for something that they didn\u2019t commit themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">There is no evidence in the record that C. Torres had any relationship to defendant or his alleged coperpetrators, Reyes-Sanchez and Lugardo-Madero. Conversely, C. Torres testified that she was friends with Scherer and had \u201cknown her about five years.\u201d She also claimed to be friends with Scherer\u2019s mother, Tina, whom she had known for \u201cabout fifteen\u201d years. Additionally, C. Torres testified about her relationship with Valero, whom she claimed to have known for \u201c20 years or so\u201d by virtue of her relationship with Valero\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Rivera, the second hearsay witness, testified that, two or three months after she learned of Valero\u2019s murder, Scherer told her that she had stabbed a woman \u201cover and over and over again.\u201d Scherer did not identify her victim by name, but Rivera testified that \u201cit wasn\u2019t too hard to figure out who she was talking about.\u201d Scherer reportedly told Rivera that she and the woman had gotten into an argument \u201cat [Lugardo-Madero\u2019s] birthday party,\u201d which the woman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>had hosted at her apartment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> According to Rivera, Scherer claimed that the woman was drunk, and that she \u201cstabbed her\u201d after \u201c[t]hat bitch * * * [came] at [her] with a knife.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Rivera testified that she had known Scherer for about three years and that Scherer \u201cwas a friend that [she] did drugs with,\u201d but that they had used drugs together only \u201ca few times.\u201d According to Rivera, at the time Scherer made her admissions, both she and Scherer were using methamphetamine at the apartment of Scherer\u2019s mother\u2019s boyfriend, Dale. She also acknowledged that she and defendant were friends and that she had known him since he had come to Oregon.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">On cross-examination, the state impeached Rivera using prior inconsistent statements that she had made in a prior police interview. In particular, Rivera acknowledged that she had previously told a detective that she \u201cdidn\u2019t remember anything significant occurring around [Lugardo-Madero\u2019s] birthday in 2005\u201d \u2014 and, in response to the court\u2019s follow-up questioning regarding her testimony, also as part of an offer of proof, in Reyes-Sanchez\u2019s trial, explained that \u201c[n]o one asked me or said anything about \u2014 no one asked me anything.\u201d Rivera first disclosed Scherer\u2019s purported admissions to law enforcement authorities on December 13, 2006, over a year and a half after Scherer allegedly made those statements and less than a month before Reyes-Sanchez was scheduled to go to trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Defendant next offered the testimony of Smith. Smith was a long-time family friend of Scherer\u2019s. Smith testified that she had known Scherer \u201cpretty much her whole life\u201d and that she \u201cknow[s] her whole family.\u201d She claimed to have grown up with Scherer\u2019s mother and aunt, to know her grandparents, and to have lived with various members of Scherer\u2019s family. Smith claimed that she \u201c[s]omewhat\u201d considered herself a surrogate mother for Scherer, when Scherer \u201cwasn\u2019t locked up,\u201d and that Scherer sometimes called her \u201cmom\u201d or \u201cAunt Lisa.\u201d As was the case with C. Torres, there is no evidence in the record that Smith had any prior relationship with defendant, Reyes-Sanchez, or Lugardo-Madero.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">At the beginning of her testimony, Smith stated that \u201cI went through like some really traumatic things in treatment lately, so my memory is not really good right now\u201d\u2014 and thereafter offered repeated qualifications that her memory was faulty. With those qualifications, Smith testified that she, Scherer\u2019s cousin, Nicki, and another person, Angel, had confronted Scherer \u201ca couple of months\u201d after Valero\u2019s murder, after hearing rumors that she was the one responsible. According to Smith, she had \u201casked [Scherer] if she killed Jessie,\u201d and \u201c[Scherer] told me, Wes.\u2019 \u201d Smith testified that \u201c[she] told [Scherer] what [she] had been hearing, and [Scherer] told [her] that they had got in a fight.\u201d According to Smith, Scherer \u201csa[id] that they left the [Cooler] tavern and went back to Jessie\u2019s house,\u201d where the stabbing purportedly took place, and that \u201c[Scherer] t[old] me that she stabbed [Jessie] 22 times, but I\u2019m not real clear.\u201d Scherer also told Smith that, later, she \u201csent somebody back to rob the apartment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Smith further testified that either Scherer or Nicki had told her that \u201cJessie\u201d had gone into convulsions or a seizure during the stabbing. Earlier testimony in defendant\u2019s case had established that Valero suffered from epilepsy and had a history of seizures.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>On cross-examination, Smith testified that she was using methamphetamine at the time Scherer made her admissions to her. She also acknowledged that she was having difficulty separating what she had learned from Scherer directly from things Nicki and Angel had told her and other rumors.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">Like C. Torres, Smith did not report what Scherer had told her to the authorities until January 2007. Smith explained that she did not come forward earlier because she was \u201cin [her] addiction\u201d and \u201cwanted by the police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The final hearsay witness, Callahan, testified that, sometime around the time of the murder, Scherer admitted to her that she had \u201cstabbed somebody\u201d after \u201cthe girl had jumped her,\u201d and that she was hiding from the police.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Callahan testified that this was the first time she had ever met Scherer and that Scherer never identified her victim by name or state where or when the incident occurred. Callahan testified that she did not ask Scherer for any more details because she \u201cdidn\u2019t really want to know no more.\u201d After the incident, Callahan testified she did not see Scherer again until \u201cwell into summertime,\u201d \u201c[p]robably\u201d about two months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">On cross-examination, Callahan acknowledged that she was using methamphetamine at the time Scherer made that statement to her and that she \u201cwas trying not to\u201d pay attention to what Scherer was saying. In fact, Callahan stated that she did not connect Scherer\u2019s confession to Valero\u2019s murder until she was in jail months later, in November 2006, when she overheard other inmates talking about Scherer\u2019s potential involvement. At that point, she disclosed what Scherer had told her. As was the case with C. Torres and Smith, nothing in the record discloses any relationship between Callahan and defendant or his alleged coperpetrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>As noted, defendant also called Scherer as a witness during his offer of proof. Scherer denied ever stabbing a woman or telling any of the witnesses that she had. She also denied ever meeting Valero or being at her apartment. She admitted, however, that she had lived in the Hillsboro area in March 2005, during the time of the murder, and had subsequently lived in Salem during April and May of that same year.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Scherer also testified about her relationships with the witnesses who gave testimony against her. Scherer confirmed that Smith was a family friend whom she has known for \u201call my life, almost.\u201d She also confirmed that she and C. Torres were \u201cfriends\u201d and stated that she had also known C. Torres \u201call my life.\u201d Scherer likewise described Rivera as a \u201cfriend\u201d whom she knew \u201c[t]hrough the same crowd.\u201d Scherer denied ever meeting Callahan but admitted that it was possible that she could have met her, but never knew or no longer remembers her name. Scherer denied knowing Lugardo-Madero or ever attending a birthday party for him, and there is no evidence in the record that she had a relationship with defendant or Reyes-Sanchez.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Defendant argued that, when viewed collectively and in the context of other circumstantial evidence {e.g., the testimony by Brady and B. Torres and the evidence of Valero\u2019s epilepsy), the testimony recounting Scherer\u2019s purported statements satisfied all the requisites for admission under OEC 804(3)(c) except for the declarant\u2019s unavailability as a witness. Defendant further contended that, in the totality of the circumstances, it would violate due process to preclude him from presenting reliable, materially exculpatory hearsay evidence based solely on declarant\u2019s availability. <em>See, e.g., Holmes v. South Carolina, </em>547 US 319, 126 S Ct 1727, 164 L Ed 2d 503 (2006); <em>Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>410 US 284, 93 S Ct 1038, 35 L Ed 2d 297 (1973); <em>accord Thoma, </em>313 Or at 279-83. The state countered that the hearsay testimony was inadmissible because Scherer was, in fact, available to testify, that her statements were not against her penal interest, and that, in all events, the hearsay evidence lacked the requisite indicia of trustworthiness for admission under OEC 804(3)(c) or, failing that, under principles of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>OEC 804(3)(c) states an exception to the hearsay rule, OEC 802, and applies when the hearsay declarant is shown to be \u201cunavailable as a witness.\u201d Specifically, OEC 804(3) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-4\">\u201cThe following are not excluded by [OEC 802] if the declarant is unavailable as a witness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">\u201c(c) A statement which was at the time of its making so far contrary to the declarant\u2019s pecuniary or proprietary interest, or so far tended to subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability, or to render invalid a claim by the declar-ant against another, that a reasonable person in the declar-ant\u2019s position would not have made the statement unless the person believed it to be true. <em>A statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability and offered to exculpate the accused is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">The trial court excluded the evidence on the alternative grounds that (1) Scherer was not \u201c[u]navailab[le] as a witness,\u201d OEC 804(1),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and so the evidence did not meet the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>\u201cthreshold for admissibility\u201d under OEC 804(3)(c); and (2) the trustworthiness of the evidence was not circumstantially corroborated. The trial court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-4\">\u201cWell, first taking the Tiffany Scherer evidence. They don\u2019t meet the evidence code requirement for statements against penal interest. You know, to the extent that they \u2014 where she basically says that she killed someone or stabbed someone, that would be a crime. But it\u2019s not clear that it\u2019s Jessie Valero that she\u2019s talking about. And, you know, Tiffany Scherer is not unavailable. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">\u201cSecondly, the only two facts, independent facts, that have been brought out in this trial that would even potentially be corroborative of, you know, the fact that this, in fact, occurred were the statements of Anita Valero that her mother basically suffered from epilepsy, and in one of the statements that Tiffany Scherer is alleged to have made, there is reference to someone going into a seizure.[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">\u201cAnd secondly, * * * Benilde Torres indicated that some period of time around the time of the murder * * * she saw something that appeared to be a scratch on Tiffany Scherer\u2019s neck * * *. That\u2019s the sum total of corroboration that\u2019s outside of the other statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">\u2018You know, except for, I guess, the negative that nobody else \u2014 no other woman was stabbed, which really doesn\u2019t indicate necessarily the truth of the statement that somebody was stabbed. And for those reasons the offer of proof is not allowed on that point.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">With the Scherer \u201calternative perpetrator\u201d evidence excluded, defendant\u2019s predominant theory of defense was that, given alleged inconsistencies in the state\u2019s proof and the lack of forensic evidence implicating defendant, the state had failed to meet its burden of proof. The jury convicted defendant on all charges, but did not impose the death penalty. On the aggravated murder charge, defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility of release or parole. ORS 163.105(l)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">On appeal, defendant reiterates and refines the arguments that he made to the trial court regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>admissibility of the Scherer hearsay testimony. <em>First, </em>defendant contends that the trial court erred in concluding that the hearsay statements were insufficiently corroborated so as to \u201cclearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statements].\u201d OEC 804(3)(c). In that regard, defendant emphasizes that multiple witnesses recounted inculpatory statements by Scherer, that those witnesses had no apparent motive (either because of affinity with defendant or hostility towards Scherer) to fabricate their accounts \u2014 and, indeed, three of the four were friends of Scherer\u2019s \u2014 and that, although the statements varied in inculpatory detail, some included particulars that were peculiar to this murder. <em>Second, </em>relying predominantly on <em>Holmes </em>and <em>Chambers, </em>defendant contends that excluding reliable, materially exculpatory evidence based solely on the hearsay declarant\u2019s, Scherer\u2019s, <em>availability </em>to testify violates due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">The state responds that, as a statutory matter, the statements were inadmissible because Scherer was available to testify and because there was insufficient corroboration indicating the trustworthiness of the statements.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Additionally, the state contends that application of the unavailability requirement so as to preclude the admission of Scherer\u2019s inculpatory statements as substantive evidence was not so arbitrary or disproportionate as to violate due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Thus, as framed by the parties, defendant\u2019s due process-based argument is implicated only if the excluded testimony satisfies the corroboration/\u201ctrustworthiness\u201d requirement for admission of statements against penal interest. Accordingly, we begin by addressing that question. <em>See, e.g., State v. Nielsen, </em>316 Or 611, 618, 853 P2d 256 (1993) (under \u201cfirst things first\u201d methodology, court is to consider potentially dispositive nonconstitutional contentions before addressing constitutional arguments); <em>Zockert v. Fanning, </em>310 Or 514, 520, 800 P2d 773 (1990) (same). As explained below, we conclude that corroborating circumstances sufficiently indicated the trustworthiness of the proffered evidence for purposes of OEC 804(3)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number> Our analysis is predicated on a \u201ctwo-part standard of review\u201d that controls when we review a \u201ctrial court evidentiary ruling [as to whether] a statement fits within an exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>State v. Cook, 340 Or 530, 537, 135 </em>P3d 260 (2006). First, with respect to matters of historic fact pertaining to the content of statements and pertinent attendant circumstances, we will uphold the trial court\u2019s preliminary factual determinations if there is any evidence, including reasonable inferences, in the record to support them. <em>Id.; State v. Carlson, </em>311 Or 201, 214, 808 P2d 1002 (1991). If the trial court does not make findings on pertinent facts, and there is conflicting evidence, we will presume that the trial court found facts in a manner consistent with its ultimate conclusion. <em>Carlson, </em>311 Or at 214 (citing <em>State v. Stevens, </em>311 Or 119, 127, 806 P2d 92 (1991); <em>Ball v. Gladden, </em>250 Or 485, 487, 443 P2d 621 (1968)). Thus, for example, if there were conflicting evidence as to when, relative to the \u201cstartling event,\u201d a declarant made a statement for purposes of OEC 803(2), or whether a witness had a motive to falsely ascribe an inculpatory statement to the declarant under OEC 804(3)(c), we would presume that the trial court resolved those factual disputes consistently with its ultimate evidentiary ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Second, with the material facts so fixed, we must determine whether, as a matter of law, the trial court\u2019s ruling comports with the requirements of the evidentiary rule. <em>See Cook, </em>340 Or at 537 (\u201c[T]he court reviews the trial court\u2019s ultimate legal conclusion, as to whether the hearsay statement is admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule, to determine if the trial court made an error of law.\u201d). In this case, that inquiry reduces to whether, in the totality of the circumstances (with disputed historic facts viewed consistently with the trial court\u2019s ruling), defendant\u2019s proffered evidence satisfied the purposes of the corroboration requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">As we have repeatedly observed, \u201c[t]here is no magic formula to determine whether the corroboration requirement under [OEC 804(3)(c)] has been satisfied; each case must be decided on its own individual circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. Edwards-Peecher, </em>218 Or App 311, 318, 179 P3d 746 (2008) (citing <em>State v. Lytsell, </em>187 Or App 169, 180, 67 P3d 955 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>(2003)). Nonetheless, the legislature has provided some guidance. According to the legislative commentary to OEC 804(3)(c), <em>reprinted in </em>Laird C. Kirkpatrick, <em>Oregon Evidence </em>\u00a7 804.04[2], 841-42 (5th ed 2007), the corroboration requirement was intended to address the concern at common law that out-of-court statements offered to exculpate the accused are inherently suspect, especially where \u2014 as the rule requires \u2014 the declarant is unavailable to testify. Thus, corroboration is required before admission both to ensure that \u201ceither the fact or the contents of the confession [are not] fabricated\u201d and because, after admission, \u201cthe situation * * * is not well adapted to control by rulings as to the weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In that vein, courts are to construe the corroboration requirement \u201cin a manner that effectuates its purpose to circumvent fabrication.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">In sum, the corroboration requirement is a screening device designed to frustrate fabrication either by declarants seeking to falsely exculpate a criminal defendant or by witnesses who, by way of hearsay, falsely ascribe inculpatory statements to purported declarants. Given that overarching purpose, and the totality of material circumstances, we conclude that the trial court erred in determining that defendant\u2019s proffered hearsay evidence did not satisfy the corroboration requirement. <em>Accord Thoma, </em>313 Or at 278-79 (concluding that the trial court had erred in determining that the described corroborating circumstances were insufficient to establish the trustworthiness of the alleged alternative perpetrator\u2019s inculpatory statements).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">In so concluding, as amplified immediately below, we rely primarily on three considerations: (1) Scherer told multiple witnesses in separate conversations that she had killed a female victim (who, in one instance, was identified as \u201cJessie\u201d) by stabbing her repeatedly \u2014 and Valero was the only woman who had been stabbed to death in Hillsboro in the relevant time period. (2) Of the four hearsay witnesses, three had no motive, including by way of relationship to either defendant or Scherer, to fabricate their accounts\u2014 and, indeed, one was a close friend and two others were friends of Scherer\u2019s \u2014 nor did Scherer have any reason, including any relationship with defendant or his alleged coperpetrators, to falsely claim responsibility for Valero\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>murder. (3) Although Scherer\u2019s statements to the four hearsay witnesses varied in their degree of detail, they were consistent as to certain essential facts and, in several instances, related particulars that were peculiar to this crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">First, defendant\u2019s offer of proof established that, on four separate occasions in the weeks and months following Valero\u2019s murder, Scherer independently confessed to four people, unrelated to each other, that she had stabbed a female victim to death. Scherer\u2019s repetition of her confession to separate people on four separate occasions itself gives corroborative weight to the witnesses\u2019 accounts. <em>See Thoma, </em>313 Or at 278 (identifying as a persuasive corroborating circumstance that the alleged perpetrator \u201crepeated his confession to three different people at three different times\u201d). Moreover, there was no evidence that could otherwise explain the confluence of those witnesses\u2019 reports. There were no other murder cases in Hillsboro, proximate to Valero\u2019s murder, involving the repeated stabbing of a female victim. Nor was there evidence of any relationship between or among the hearsay witnesses to suggest that they had collaborated on their respective testimonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Second, as noted, Scherer denied knowing defendant, Reyes-Sanchez, or Lugardo-Madero, and the state did not adduce any evidence of such a connection. Absent such a connection between Scherer and defendant and his alleged coperpetrators, or other evidence of motive, there was no apparent reason for Scherer to falsely claim responsibility for Valero\u2019s murder. <em>See Thoma, </em>313 Or at 278 (listing as corroborating circumstance that \u201c[t]here was no known connection between\u201d the defendant and the purported \u201calternative perpetrator\u201d declarant); <em>cf. Edwards-Peecher, </em>218 Or App at 318 (pointing to relationship between the defendant and her son, the purported \u201calternative perpetrator\u201d \u2014 \u201ca 13-year-old child living with [the defendant]\u201d and \u201cdependent on her for his support\u201d \u2014 as a circumstance supporting exclusion of son\u2019s alleged hearsay statements (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Likewise, three of the four witnesses \u2014 C. Torres, Smith, and Callahan \u2014 had no apparent reason to lie about what Scherer had told them. There was no evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>those witnesses had any direct ties to defendant or his alleged coperpetrators, Reyes-Sanchez and Lugardo-Madero, or, correspondingly, had any motive to exculpate them by fabricating their testimony. On the contrary, C. Torres, Smith, and Rivera were friends of Scherer. C. Torres had known Scherer for at least five years and had a long-standing relationship with Scherer\u2019s mother, Tina. Similarly, Smith was a life-long family friend of Scherer\u2019s, whom Scherer sometimes referred to as \u201cmom\u201d or \u201cAunt Lisa.\u201d Callahan, who had no relationship to defendants or Scherer, had no apparent motive to exculpate the former or inculpate the latter. Only Rivera had an apparent motive to falsify her testimony, because, unlike the other witnesses, she and defendant were friends. However, the central elements of her testimony, as discussed below, were corroborated by the testimony of the other witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Nonetheless, the state contends that the statements are \u201csuspect\u201d because of the timing of the hearsay witnesses\u2019 revelations, which occurred in proximity to Reyes-Sanchez\u2019s trial in January 2007. In that regard, the state emphasizes that (1) Rivera first spoke with law enforcement in mid-December 2006 and (2) both C. Torres and Smith never disclosed Scherer\u2019s admissions until after Reyes-Sanchez\u2019s trial had begun. To be sure, the witnesses\u2019 accounts might well have been more powerfully circumstantially corroborated if they had contacted law enforcement authorities promptly upon hearing Scherer\u2019s purported admissions. Nonetheless, given the complete absence of a demonstrated connection between three of the four witnesses and defendant or his alleged coperpetrators, that timing does not substantially subvert the trustworthiness of the witnesses\u2019 accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Indeed, at least with respect to C. Torres and Smith, the evidence discloses a persuasive, even compelling, explanation for the delayed reporting: Because of their friendship with Scherer, they had an incentive not to disclose her self-inculpatory statements \u2014 and did so only when confronted (because of the imminence of Reyes-Sanchez\u2019s trial) with the concrete prospect that others might be convicted, and potentially sentenced to death, for a murder that Scherer had committed. That is precisely the explanation C. Torres gave: She came forward after she learned that the state was seeking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the death penalty, because \u201cI don\u2019t think somebody who\u2019s not guilty of doing something, I don\u2019t think they should get the death penalty for something that they didn\u2019t commit themselves.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Third, although Scherer\u2019s statements to the four hearsay witnesses varied in certain particulars and in their degree of detail, they shared common elements that corresponded to the essential facts of the charged crimes. For example, Scherer\u2019s statements to Smith that \u201cshe stabbed [Jessie] 22 times,\u201d and to Rivera and C. Torres that she stabbed a woman \u201cover and over and over again,\u201d and that \u201conce she started * * * she couldn\u2019t stop,\u201d broadly correlated with the facts of Valero\u2019s murder {e.g., Valero was stabbed 29 times). Further, in her statements to Smith, Scherer identified her victim as \u201cJessie\u201d and correctly identified the victim\u2019s apartment as the location of the crime. Scherer\u2019s statements, to C. Torres and Smith, that she got scared and tried to make the murder look like a burglary and that she involved others in the cover-up, were reconcilable with the facts of the case. Finally, Valero had epilepsy \u2014 and Smith testified that either Scherer or another person had told her that the victim had gone into convulsions or seizures during the stabbing. A reasonable trier of fact could ascribe that statement evidencing knowledge of facts peculiar to this crime to Scherer \u2014 as, indeed, the trial court apparently did in its assessment of foundational corroboration. <em>See </em>233 Or App at 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The hearsay witnesses\u2019 accounts also cross-corroborated one another. All referred to stabbing a female victim to death, and three referred to repeated or uncontrolled stabbing. Further, the four hearsay witnesses\u2019 accounts of <em>when </em>Scherer confessed to them were internally consistent and corroborated by Scherer\u2019s testimony about her whereabouts after the murder. After C. Torres and Callahan spoke with Scherer, around the time of the murder, they did not see her again until \u201ca couple of months\u201d later, which was consistent with Scherer\u2019s testimony that she left the Hillsboro area for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Salem during April and May. That, in turn, corresponds with Scherer\u2019s statement to Callahan that she was hiding from the police. Then, several months after Valero\u2019s murder, apparently after Scherer had returned to Hillsboro, she confessed to Smith and, possibly, Rivera.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">The state contends, nevertheless, that other aspects of the record so subvert or contradict the hearsay witnesses\u2019 accounts as to preclude a determination that they possess the requisite trustworthiness for admissibility. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">First, the state emphasizes the forensic evidence, which the state contends demonstrates that Valero was attacked by two assailants \u2014 not one \u2014 who used two different weapons. However, the evidence in that regard is hardly uncontradicted. Specifically, although the state medical examiner testified that Valero\u2019s wounds were \u201cconsistent\u201d with the use of two different weapons, he also agreed with defense counsel that \u201cthere\u2019s no way of knowing with any degree of medical certainty whether one weapon was used or two.\u201d Thus, the evidence, albeit supportive of the state\u2019s \u201ctwo-assailant\u201d (Reyes-Sanchez and defendant) theory of the cases, did not foreclose Scherer\u2019s purported \u201csingle-assailant\u201d account.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Second, the state points to uncontested evidence contradicting Rivera\u2019s account in which Scherer allegedly said that she had stabbed a woman either during or after a birthday party for Lugardo-Madero that \u201cJessie\u201d had hosted at her apartment. That evidence shows that, although Lugardo-Madero\u2019s birthday is March 15 (two days before Valero\u2019s body was discovered), Valero did not host a birthday party for him that day.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Although the date and location of the murder, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>described in Rivera\u2019s account, are consistent with the circumstances of the crime, the \u201cbirthday party\u201d feature she ascribed to Scherer appears to be inexplicable and, at least, mistaken. Although that feature detracts from the trustworthiness of Rivera\u2019s account, in the totality of the circumstances of this case, including the compelling collective cross-corroboration offered by the other hearsay witnesses\u2019 accounts, that discrepancy does not justify excluding Rivera\u2019s account, much less defendant\u2019s hearsay evidence in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Third, the state contrasts Scherer\u2019s use of the term \u201cgirl\u201d to refer to the victim in her purported statements to C. Torres and Callahan, with the fact that Valero was a \u201cmiddle-aged grandmother.\u201d With respect, given the vagaries and pliability of the vernacular, jurors could find that there is no necessary contradiction. In all events, as noted, Valero was the only female stabbing victim in Hillsboro during the pertinent period.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Finally, the state emphasizes that all hearsay witnesses were methamphetamine users and that some were under the influence of the drug at the time the statements were made, distorting their statements and recollections. We fully appreciate that jurors, in evaluating the credibility or accuracy of the hearsay accounts, may ultimately consider the effect of the participants\u2019 drug use on their perceptions and recall. Nevertheless, nothing in the record explains how or why methamphetamine abuse would cause a person to falsely admit to four other persons, on four separate occasions, that she had committed a murder or, conversely, why such abuse would cause disinterested witnesses to falsely ascribe such statements to an innocent person. That consideration goes, at most, to the weight, and not the foundational admissibility, of the proffered hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">We thus conclude that, notwithstanding the countervailing considerations that the state posits, \u201ccorroborating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness\u201d of defendant\u2019s proffered hearsay evidence, OEC 804(3)(c), and that the trial court erred in determining otherwise. Further, it is patent that Scherer\u2019s purported statements \u201cso far tended to subject [her] to * * * criminal liability * * * that a reasonable person in [her] position would not have made [them] unless the person believed [them] to be true.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consequently, the inquiry reduces to whether the trial court erred in determining, alternatively, that Scherer\u2019s availability to testify precluded the admission of her purported inculpatory statements as substantive evidence. Specifically, given that Scherer\u2019s demonstrated availability precluded admission of her hearsay statements under OEC 804(3)(c), was defendant nevertheless entitled, under principles of due process, to present testimony recounting those statements as substantive evidence that Scherer, not defendant, had killed Valero?</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">As amplified below, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of defendant\u2019s proffered reliable and materially exculpatory evidence \u201cdenied him a trial in accord with traditional and fundamental standards of due process.\u201d <em>Chambers, </em>410 US at 302. <em>Chambers </em>and, by instructive contrast, <em>Thoma, </em>impel that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">In <em>Chambers, </em>the defendant, who had been charged with the murder of a police officer in Mississippi, sought to present a defense that another man, McDonald, had killed the officer. 410 US at 285, 289. That defense was predicated principally upon a sworn written confession by McDonald and on testimony from three witnesses that McDonald had told each of them that he had killed the officer. <em>Id. </em>at 289, 292-93. At trial, Chambers called McDonald as a witness and, by way of direct examination, introduced McDonald\u2019s confession. However, on cross-examination by the state, McDonald testified that he had previously repudiated his confession as fabricated and then gave a detailed account of an alibi. <em>Id. </em>at 291. When Chambers then sought to have McDonald designated as an adverse witness, so that he could cross-examine him regarding the purported reasons for recanting the written confession and the alleged alibi, the court refused to do so, invoking Mississippi\u2019s \u201cvoucher\u201d rule by which a party who called a witness was deemed to vouch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>for the truthfulness of his or her testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 291-92, 295-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\">Further, and of particular significance to our case, Chambers unsuccessfully sought to introduce testimony from the three witnesses who would have recounted the statements that McDonald had purportedly made to them confessing to the murder. <em>Id. </em>at 292-93. The trial court excluded that testimony, ruling that McDonald\u2019s purported statements were inadmissible under Mississippi\u2019s hearsay rule, which did not include an exception for statements against penal interest. <em>Id. </em>at 292-93, 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Chambers was convicted of murder. The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed that conviction, rejecting Chambers\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. <em>Id. </em>at 291-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The United States Supreme Court reversed, concluding that the cumulative effect of the trial court\u2019s rulings excluding evidence of McDonald\u2019s guilt violated Chambers\u2019s due process right to present a complete defense. <em>Id. </em>at 285, 302. The Court first considered Mississippi\u2019s \u201cvoucher\u201d rule, characterizing it as \u201cdoubly harmful to Chambers\u2019 efforts to develop his defense,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 296, because Chambers, by calling McDonald as a witness was (1) deemed to have \u201cvouched\u201d for McDonald\u2019s testimony, including his repudiation of the written confession and his denial of involvement in the murder, and (2) concomitantly was precluded from cross-examining McDonald as an adverse witness regarding that testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 296-97. The Court, after canvassing historical justifications for the \u201cvoucher\u201d rule, concluded that the application of that rule \u201cplainly interfered with Chambers\u2019 right to defend against the State\u2019s charges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The Court then addressed the exclusion of the three witnesses\u2019 testimony, which would have recounted McDonald\u2019s purported inculpatory statements. The Court prefaced that discussion by emphasizing that those statements \u201cwere originally made and subsequently offered at trial under circumstances that provided considerable assurance of their reliability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300. In that regard, the Court noted, <em>inter alia, </em>that each of the statements had been made \u201cspontaneously to a close acquaintance shortly after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>the murder had occurred\u201d; that each confession was corroborated by some other evidence; that \u201c[t]he sheer number of independent confessions provided additional corroboration for each\u201d; and that \u201cMcDonald stood to benefit nothing by disclosing his role in the shooting to any of his three friends.\u201d Id. at 300-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">With the essential condition of reliability so confirmed, the Supreme Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\">\u201cFew rights are more fundamental than that of an accused to present witnesses in his own defense. In the exercise of this right, the accused, as is required of the State, must comply with established rules of procedure and evidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability in the ascertainment of guilt and innocence. Although perhaps no rule of evidence has been more respected or more frequently applied injury trials than that applicable to the exclusion of hearsay, exceptions tailored to allow the introduction of evidence which in fact is likely to be trustworthy have long existed. The testimony rejected by the trial court here bore persuasive assurances of trustworthiness and thus was well within the basic rationale of the exception for declarations against interest. That testimony also was critical to Chambers\u2019 defense. In these circumstances, where constitutional rights directly affecting the ascertainment of guilt are implicated, the hearsay rule may not be applied mechanistically to defeat the ends of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">\u201cWe conclude that the exclusion of this critical evidence, coupled with the State\u2019s refusal to permit Chambers to cross-examine McDonald, denied him a trial in accord with traditional and fundamental standards of due process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">410 US at 302 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">We proceed to <em>Thoma. </em>In <em>Thoma, </em>the defendant, who was charged with murder, attempted to advance a defense that another man, Pierce, had killed the victim. 313 Or at 273-75. Before trial, the state moved to preclude the defendant from presenting evidence of Pierce\u2019s purported involvement, including testimony from three witnesses who would have recounted statements by Pierce claiming responsibility for the murder. <em>Id. </em>At the pretrial evidentiary hearing, the defendant, while making an offer of proof of those witnesses\u2019 putative hearsay testimony, did not attempt to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>call Pierce as a witness; the only evidence at that hearing as to Pierce\u2019s (un)availability was testimony by a detective that Pierce was an inmate either at the Oregon State Penitentiary or the Oregon State Correctional Institution. <em>Id. </em>at 277.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">The trial court excluded the proffered evidence on the grounds that it was insufficiently corroborated to be admissible under OEC 804(3)(c) and that, concomitantly, it lacked the indicia of reliability prescribed in <em>Chambers. Id. </em>at 273. The jury subsequently convicted the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">On appeal, the Oregon Supreme Court affirmed, concluding that the proffered evidence was not admissible under OEC 804(3)(c) or as a matter of due process under <em>Chambers. </em>With respect to OEC 804(3)(c), the Supreme Court rejected the trial court\u2019s rationale that the proffered hearsay evidence failed to satisfy the rule\u2019s corroboration requirement; indeed, the court cataloged specific indicia of trustworthiness, including the multiplicity and diversity of Pierce\u2019s self-inculpatory statements, the timing of those statements, and the lack of any relationship between Pierce and the defendant that might have motivated Pierce to fabricate such admissions. <em>Id. </em>at 278. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court concluded that the hearsay testimony was not admissible under OEC 804(3)(c) for the alternative reason that the defendant had failed to establish that Pierce was, in fact, \u201cunavailable as a witness,\u201d as prescribed in OEC 804(3). <em>Id. </em>at 277-78. For example, the defendant did not show that Pierce\u2019s attendance could not be procured or that, \u201cif called, Pierce would have exercised his privilege against self-incrimination and declined to testify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 277. Thus, notwithstanding that the proffered hearsay evidence was otherwise \u201csufficient to submit to a jury,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 278, the defendant\u2019s failure to establish the declarant\u2019s unavailability precluded its admission under OEC 804(3)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The Supreme Court then addressed the defendant\u2019s alternative <em>Chambers- </em>based <em>argument </em>\u2014 viz., that \u201ceven if he failed to lay a proper foundation for admission of Pierce\u2019s hearsay statements] * * * he nonetheless had the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>introduce that testimony under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">The Supreme Court began by describing <em>Chambers </em>in detail, akin to our discussion above. <em>Id. </em>at 279-82. It then concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">\u201cOur extensive summary of the <em>Chambers </em>decision makes it clear why that case does not aid defendant here. Pivotal to the case was the fact that, under Mississippi law, the exculpatory hearsay testimony was not admissible <em>in any case. </em>That is, no matter how reliable the evidence might be shown to be, it would not have been admitted. Such an unyielding rule denied criminal defendants due process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">\u201cAs previously demonstrated, Oregon\u2019s rule is not so unyielding. Before a criminal defendant can invoke the Due Process Clause, he or she must show that the state\u2019s law denies the process claimed to be due. In terms of this case, to be admissible under the due process rule of <em>Chambers, </em>the evidence must be inadmissible under the Oregon Evidence Code. Defendant has not made such a showing of inadmissibility here. There has been no violation of his rights under the Constitution of the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 282-83 (citations omitted; emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Thus, as rendered in <em>Thoma, Chambers\u2019s sine qua non </em>is that the proponent of reliable, materially exculpatory evidence must demonstrate that state law completely precludes the admission of that evidence. That is, state law affords no common law or statutory basis on which that evidence could be admitted. Because the defendant in <em>Thoma </em>failed to establish that the declarant, Pierce, was <em>not </em>\u201cunavailable,\u201d he failed to foreclose the possibility that the hearsay evidence could have been admitted under OEC 804(3)(c).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Consequently, <em>Chambers </em>was inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>In sum, the Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of the defendant\u2019s Chambers-based due process argument in <em>Thoma </em>was based exclusively on the defendant\u2019s failure to establish that the declarant was not unavailable to testify. The totality of the court\u2019s analysis, and particularly its validation of the reliability of the proffered hearsay, attests that, but for the defendant\u2019s failure in that regard, that evidence would have been admissible under <em>Chambers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Here, defendant made precisely the showing that was missing in <em>Thoma. </em>In his offer of proof, defendant called Scherer, who, rather than invoking any privilege, testified and denied that she had been involved in Valero\u2019s death or had made the purported self-inculpatory statements. Thus, in dispositive distinction from <em>Thoma, </em>defendant, as the proponent of reliable, materially exculpatory hearsay evidence, established that the declarant was not \u201cunavailable as a witness.\u201d OEC 804(3). Consequently, unlike in <em>Thoma, </em>defendant showed that the proffered testimony could not have been admitted under OEC 804(3)(c). Further, the state does not contend that the excluded testimony could have been admitted as substantive evidence under any other provision of the Oregon Evidence Code.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Accordingly, defendant established the requisites for admissibility under <em>Chambers, </em>and the trial court, by excluding that evidence, denied defendant \u201ca trial in accord with traditional and fundamental standards of due process.\u201d <em>Chambers, </em>410 US at 302.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>That error was not harmless. A federal constitutional error is harmless \u201c \u2018if the reviewing court may confidently say, on the whole record, that the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cook, </em>340 Or at 544 <em>(quoting Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 US 673, 681, 106 S Ct 1431, 89 L Ed 2d 674 (1986)). In making that assessment, and taking into account all properly admitted evidence, we consider the \u201cimportance\u201d of the improperly excluded evidence to defendant\u2019s case, the \u201cpresence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting\u201d the evidence on \u201cmaterial points,\u201d and \u201cthe overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s <em>case.\u201dId. </em>(quoting <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 US at 684).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">Here, we cannot \u201cconfidently say\u201d that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of defendant\u2019s proffered evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. That evidence was central to defendant\u2019s putative \u201calternative perpetrator\u201d defense; it explicitly implicated Scherer as the true perpetrator of the murder for which defendant was charged and ultimately convicted. That evidence was substantial and, as addressed in detail above, sufficiently substantiated as trustworthy by corroborating circumstances. Multiple witnesses, including those with no discernible motive to lie, would have testified that Scherer had confessed to them that she had killed a woman \u2014 whom she identified to one witness as \u201cJessie\u201d \u2014 by stabbing her repeatedly.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> To be sure, those witnesses\u2019 accounts varied in some particulars, but those inconsistencies were, for the most part, marginal or potentially reconcilable. Further, jurors could find, based on one account (Smith\u2019s) that Scherer knew peculiar details of the crime <em>(e.g., </em>that Valero had suffered an epileptic seizure) that the perpetrator would have known. Finally, although the state\u2019s evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt was strong \u2014 and indisputably sufficient to establish defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>doubt \u2014 there was no direct DNA or forensic evidence linking defendant to the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Given the totality of those circumstances, the error was not harmless with respect to defendant\u2019s convictions for murder. Further, given the inextricable interrelationship between the other charges on which defendant was convicted and the alleged murder, the exclusion of the proffered \u201calternative perpetrator\u201d evidence was not harmless with respect to those convictions as well. Accordingly, a remand for a new trial on all charges is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-7\"> That disposition obviates any need to consider defendant\u2019s other assignments of error, which pertain to various rulings made during the guilt phase of his trial that may or may not reoccur on remand or may be presented in a different posture, and asserted errors in sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b345-6\"> Reyes-Sanchez appealed his convictions, assigning error to, <em>inter alia, </em>the exclusion of \u201calternative perpetrator\u201d hearsay evidence closely similar to, but not identical to, that proffered and excluded in this case. That appeal is pending in this court. <em>State v. Reyes-Sanchez </em>(A136062).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b345-7\"> Defendant cross-examined Lugardo-Madero on his motive to cooperate with the prosecution. Lugardo-Madero admitted that he hoped that, by cooperating with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>the prosecution, he might receive a plea offer for a reduced charge or a sentence less than the potential life sentence he was facing for felony murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b346-8\"> The state also presented evidence pertaining to defendant\u2019s motive for the crime, <em>viz., </em>to obtain property to trade for methamphetamine. Defendant frequently traded stolen property, including car stereos, for methamphetamine, but also occasionally was able to obtain methamphetamine from his drug dealer on credit. According to the state\u2019s evidence, on the day of the murder: (1) defendant and Lugardo-Madero went looking for a car that they intended to break into; (2) when they were unable to locate it, defendant tried to persuade his drug dealer to give him methamphetamine on credit; (3) when that failed, then the two met up with Reyes-Sanchez at his apartment, and the three of them proceeded to Valero\u2019s apartment, where the murder took place; and (4) later, defendant sought out his drug dealer to buy methamphetamine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b348-7\"> C. Torres and Scherer were both regular methamphetamine users. However, C. Torres claimed that neither she nor Scherer were using methamphetamine at the time Scherer made her purported admissions. On cross-examination, the state confronted C. Torres with a statement she purportedly made to a police detective, to the effect that \u201cshe and [Scherer] were both using meth during the time [Scherer] told her this information.\u201d C. Torres denied making any such statement and insisted that the detective \u201cmust have misunderstood what I said.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b349-6\"> According to Rivera, Scherer told her that she had been staying with a person named \u201cJessie\u201d and that the argument that Scherer described occurred at that person\u2019s apartment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b349-7\"> Rivera claimed that she was not sure, based on what Scherer said, whether the stabbing occurred \u201cduring [or] after\u201d the birthday party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b349-8\"> There is no evidence in the record that Rivera had a prior relationship with Reyes-Sanchez or Lugardo-Madero.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b349-9\"> Later, also as part of his offer of proof, defendant called Brady, who had interviewed Rivera on December 13, 2006, to testify to prior consistent statements that Rivera made in that interview and rebut the state\u2019s inference of recent fabrication. Although much of what Brady testified to was consistent with Rivera\u2019s trial testimony, there were also significant differences (in addition to those differences adduced by the state in its own cross-examination of Rivera). According to Brady, Rivera had stated that Scherer had confessed to her \u201cabout a week or less\u201d after Valero\u2019s murder, and that they were using methamphetamine at Scherer\u2019s mother\u2019s house, not Dale\u2019s apartment. Additionally, according to Brady, Rivera had stated that Scherer had told her that both she and a woman named \u201cJessie\u201d had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>been drinking. Brady also testified to additional details that were consistent with, but not included in, Rivera\u2019s trial testimony. Specifically, Rivera told Brady during the interview that Scherer had \u201cgone to the Cooler [tavern] with Jessie a couple of times\u201d and that Scherer \u201cbegan crying and shaking\u201d before she made her statements to Rivera.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b351-7\"> On direct examination, Callahan testified that it was \u201cMarch-ish\u201d when Scherer made that statement. On cross-examination, Callahan acknowledged that she was \u201cnot exactly sure\u201d and that, when examined previously <em>(viz., </em>during the offer of proof in Reyes-Sanchez\u2019s trial), the best she could say was that \u201cit was raining at the time,\u201d like \u201cJanuary through March.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b353-9\"> In <em>State v.

According to Callahan, once she made the connection, she promptly disclosed Scherer\u2019s purported statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b361-7\"> As noted, Rivera\u2019s testimony that Scherer made her admissions to her two or three months after Rivera learned of Valero\u2019s murder was undermined by other defense evidence, <em>viz., </em>that she had said previously, in her interview with Brady, that Scherer made her admissions \u201cabout a week or less\u201d after the murder. In either case, Rivera\u2019s testimony seems to comport with Scherer\u2019s account about her whereabouts during those times.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b361-8\"> Lugardo-Madero testified that he spent the evening before his birthday prowling for cars with defendant. He slept at his mother\u2019s house and, after rising at noon on his birthday, March 15, reconnected with defendant at the apartment of a mutual friend, Tory McLeod. According to Lugardo-Madero, he and defendant spent about five to six hours at McLeod\u2019s apartment and used methamphetamine there. Then, he and defendant left the apartment to track down a car that they intended to break into. When they were unable to locate the car, they returned to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>McLeod\u2019s apartment. Lugardo-Madero testified that he spent the rest of his day as recounted above. <em>See </em>233 Or App at 313-14, 314 n 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">The state\u2019s evidence established that, on March 15, Valero went to an orientation for her new job at Little Caesar\u2019s Pizza and then went shopping that afternoon. After she arrived home, she called and spoke with several friends on the phone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b366-7\"> The prosecutor in <em>Thoma </em>also represented to the court that a \u201ctransport order\u201d for Pierce had been prepared. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b367-9\"> The reasoning is precise and, practically, paradoxical: If the defendant in <em>Thoma </em>had shown that the declarant was \u201cunavailable,\u201d the exculpatory hearsay evidence would have been admissible under OEC 804(3)(e). Conversely, if the defendant had shown that the declarant was <em>not </em>\u201cunavailable\u201d <em>(i.e., </em>available), the evidence would have been admissible, as a matter of due process, under <em>Chambers, </em>because the defendant would have shown that it was not admissible under OEC 804(3)(c) and, hence, was not admissible under Oregon evidentiary law. However, the defendant failed to make either showing and, thus, failed to exclude the possibility that Pierce was, in fact, \u201cunavailable as a witness,\u201d and that (upon a proper showing of that foundational fact) the evidence could have been admitted under OEC 804(3)(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b368-5\"> The state suggests, in passing, that the excluded statements might have been admissible for impeachment purposes, <em>i.e., </em>to impeach Scherer\u2019s denials, if defendant had called Scherer as a witness at trial. However, that suggestion cannot be reconciled with Oregon\u2019s adoption of the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d rule, which precludes a party from calling a witness for the primary purpose of exposing the trier of fact to otherwise inadmissible hearsay testimony. <em>See State v.
