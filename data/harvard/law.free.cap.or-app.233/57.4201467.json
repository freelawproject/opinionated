On defendant\u2019s motion, the trial court set aside the judgment pursuant to ORCP 71 B(l)(a), which provides that the court \u201cmay relieve a party * * * from a judgment for * * * mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\u201d Plaintiff appeals, arguing that the court abused its discretion by providing relief to defendant. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">As we explain below, but state here in order to put the facts in context, the resolution of this case depends on whether the record contains evidence supporting the court\u2019s finding that defendant failed to file an answer because it mistakenly understood that, when plaintiff sought the default judgment, the parties were engaged in settlement negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Most of the facts are procedural and, except where noted, undisputed. Plaintiffs complaint alleged that she was injured when the front wheels of a grocery cart that she was pushing sank into a shallow pothole in a parking lot owned by defendant Standard Insurance Company. The alleged incident occurred on March 6, 2006. Some time thereafter, plaintiffs attorney filed a claim with defendant\u2019s insurer, One Beacon, and the claim was denied. On January 9, 2008, plaintiffs attorney and One Beacon\u2019s claims handler, Fleming, had a telephone conversation during which, according to Fleming\u2019s follow-up letter mailed the same day, Fleming reasserted One Beacon\u2019s \u201cposition that there is no liability on the part of our insured.\u201d The letter went on to request, however, that plaintiffs attorney send the insurer</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">\u201cphotos of the pothole in question * * * as well as all medical bills and records for [plaintiff] for my review. * * * Once I have received all material I will take another look at our liability position and we can discuss it again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">\u201cI look forward to working with you to bring this claim to a resolution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">A few weeks later, as the statute of limitations neared, plaintiffs attorney sent Fleming a courtesy copy of the complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>he planned to file, along with the medical bills and records that Fleming had requested. He also requested that Fleming send him a copy of the medical bills that the insurer had paid on behalf of plaintiff. A week later, on February 21, 2008, plaintiffs attorney sent Fleming more medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Two days later, plaintiff filed a complaint seeking $400,000 in damages and served the complaint and a summons on defendant\u2019s registered agent. The summons contained the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">\u201cIN THE NAME OF THE STATE OF OREGON: You are hereby required to appear and defend the complaint filed against you in the above entitled cause within 30 days from the date of service of this summons on you; and if you fail to appear and defend, the plaintiff will apply to the court for the relief demanded in the complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">\u201cNotice to defendant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">\u201cREAD THESE PAPERS CAREFULLY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">\u2018You must \u2018appear\u2019 in this case or the other side will win automatically. To \u2018appear\u2019 you must file with the court a legal paper called a \u2018motion\u2019 or \u2018answer\u2019 * * * within 30 days [as required by ORCP 7 C(2)].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">Thirty days passed with no response from defendant and no written notice from defendant that it intended to file an appearance. The lack of written notice relieved plaintiff of the requirement that she provide ten days\u2019 notice of her intent to seek an order of default, ORCP 69 A(l), and, in fact, she sought <em>(exparte) </em>and received such an order on the thirty-third day. The default judgment was entered shortly thereafter, on April 23, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">Nearly three months passed. Then, on July 16, defendant moved to set aside the default. In support of the motion, defendant submitted a two-page affidavit signed by Fleming, reciting the history of her correspondence with plaintiffs attorney and stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-11\">\u201cBased on my conversations and dealings with [plaintiffs attorney], I understood that [he] would not seek a default against the defendant because he was continuing to evaluate his client\u2019s claim and he was not yet in a position to make a settlement demand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>\u201cOn March 11, 2008, I received a summons and Amended Complaint from the insured!.] At this time, due to my continuing dealings with [plaintiffs attorney], I understood that [he] did not require a responsive pleading and would not attempt to default the defendant. At this time I understood that [plaintiffs attorney] would continue to submit to me information relating to his client\u2019s medical issues and expenses, and would provide a settlement demand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">Plaintiffs attorney responded with a declaration stating, \u201cAt no time or in any manner did I state, suggest or imply to One Beacon or anyone else that I would not seek a default against the defendant.\u201d He also stated that all of his dealings with Fleming and her supervisor, even after the default judgment, had been cordial, and neither had \u201cclaimed that we had an arrangement, understanding or implicit bargain of any sort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The court held a hearing on defendant\u2019s motion and heard the parties\u2019 arguments, but took no new evidence. It subsequently set aside the default judgment. The court did not make any express findings and did not set out its reasoning. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The court\u2019s authority to set aside a judgment derives from ORCP 71 B(l)(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">\u201cOn motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or such party\u2019s legal representative from a judgment for the following reasons: (a) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglectf.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">We review the court\u2019s decision to grant such relief for abuse of discretion. <em>Litton and Char-Ol\u00e9 Ranch, </em>Inc., 281 Or 687, 690, 576 P2d 369 (1978); <em>Knox v. GenX Clothing, </em>Inc., 215 Or App 317, 319, 168 P3d 1251 (2007). Under that standard, we will affirm the court unless its decision is not within the range of lawful alternatives. <em>State v. Rogers, </em>330 Or 282, 312, 4 P3d 1261 (2000). When the court\u2019s decision rests on factfinding, we are bound by the court\u2019s findings if they are supported by any evidence. Or Const, Art VII (Amended), \u00a7 3. Recognizing that a default judgment deprives a party of its \u201cday in court,\u201d we liberally construe ORCP 71 B so as to avoid that result \u201cwhen it can be done without doing violence to the regular disposition of litigation.\u201d <em>National Mortgage Co. v. Robert C. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number><em>Wyatt, Inc., </em>173 Or App 16, 23-24, 20 P3d 216, <em>rev den, </em>332 Or 430 (2001). One aspect of such liberal construction is that we view the facts in the light most favorable to the party seeking relief from default. <em>Id. </em>at 18. Further, we have granted relief from default under ORCP 71 B(l) when the defaulted party believed that settlement negotiations were pending, <em>Mary Ebel Johnson, P.C. v. Elmore, </em>221 Or App 166, 169, 189 P3d 35, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 301 (2008), and where the defaulted party was \u201csurprised\u201d because the adversary\u2019s taking of the default was contrary to the defaulted party\u2019s understanding that a settlement would be negotiated, <em>McKenna and McKenna, </em>57 Or App 185, 189, 643 P2d 1369 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Thus, in order to prevail here, plaintiff must establish that, viewing the record in the light most favorable to defendant, no evidence supports the court\u2019s implicit finding that, as Fleming testified, she understood that settlement negotiations were pending. In support of that position, plaintiff maintains that Fleming\u2019s bare assertion that she \u201cunderstood\u201d settlement negotiations were ongoing (and that she was therefore \u201csurprised\u201d by plaintiffs <em>ex parte </em>default motion) cannot support the court\u2019s finding, because defendant did not adduce any facts establishing that such an understanding was reasonable. That argument rests on the assumption that the mistake, inadvertence, or surprise to which ORCP 71 B(l) refers must be rationally based. Thus, for example, if the only conversations between the parties involved, say, the weather or the World Series, the defaulted party\u2019s \u201cunderstanding\u201d that the other party had agreed not to take a default would not justify relief. The contrary argument is that the presence of the word \u201cexcusable\u201d before \u201cneglect\u201d in the phrase \u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise, or <em>excusable </em>neglect,\u201d indicates a legislative decision to leave the terms mistake, inadvertence, and surprise unqualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The dispute raises an interesting question, but we need not decide it. That is so because, in this case, and under our standard of review, adequate evidence supports a finding that Fleming not only had the understanding that negotiations were ongoing, but that her understanding was reasonable. She asked plaintiffs attorney to send her photographs and medical records so that she could \u201ctake another look at our liability position\u201d for further discussions in the hope that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>the parties could \u201cbring this claim to a resolution.\u201d In response, plaintiff sent the information and asked for defendant\u2019s insurer\u2019s billing information. The complaint and summons were served within a week. Those undisputed facts, interpreted (along with their reasonable inferences) in the light most favorable to defendant, are evidence that Fleming reasonably believed that settlement negotiations were ongoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">Plaintiff nonetheless advances several additional arguments. First, she points out that, in <em>McKenna </em>and <em>Mary Ebel Johnson, P.C., </em>the evidence that the defaulted party believed settlement negotiations were pending was much stronger than in the present case. That is true, but it does not help plaintiff; our standard of review does not permit us to weigh the strength of the evidence supporting the court\u2019s finding, but merely to determine whether <em>any </em>such evidence exists. For the same reason, even if we were to agree with plaintiffs argument that more and stronger evidence supports a contrary finding, we could not reverse the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Plaintiff also argues that ORCP 69 A(l) and Lane County Supplemental Local Rule 5.001 compel reversal. The provision from ORCP 69 A(l) on which she relies states, in part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">\u201cIf the party against whom an order of default is sought has * * * provided written notice of intent to file an appearance to the party seeking an order of default, then the party against whom an order of default is sought shall be served with written notice of the application for an order of default at least 10 days * * * prior to entry of the order of default.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">According to plaintiff, the implication we must draw from that rule is that, \u201cunless a defendant has given the plaintiff \u2018written notice of intent to file an appearance,\u2019 a defendant who has failed to appear should <em>expect </em>that the plaintiff, without further notice, may obtain an order of default.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) We agree with plaintiff that the rule is some evidence that defendant, as a matter of fact, did not have a reasonable understanding that no default would be taken; again, however, under our standard of review, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>mere existence of such evidence is not sufficient to establish an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Lane County Supplemental Local Rule 5.001 provides, \u201cOral stipulations between counsel, except those made in open Court and on the record, will not be recognized.\u201d In this case, neither the court nor defendant asserts, much less relies on, any oral stipulations between counsel. The rule is not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">In short, we conclude that the record contains evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s finding that, at the time plaintiff sought an order of default, defendant reasonably understood that settlement negotiations were ongoing and that a default would not be taken, and that that finding legally justified the court to set aside the judgment of default under ORCP 71 B(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
