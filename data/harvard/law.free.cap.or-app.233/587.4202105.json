The order approved an annexation request by the City of Florence (city) under the commission\u2019s authority to make \u201cminor boundary changes.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An annexation minor boundary change can be initiated by a resolution of the commission, by a city resolution, or by petitions of property owners or resident electors. ORS 199.490(1). In order to initiate an annexation proceeding by city resolution, however, a city must receive consents of the affected property owners or electors calculated in two alternative ways \u2014 one known as a \u201ctriple majority\u2019 consent and the other a \u201cdouble majority\u201d consent. ORS 199.490(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">In this case, the city initiated the minor boundary change proceeding after receiving property owner consents from nearly all of the property owners in the affected territory. The city initially stated that it was proceeding on a \u201cdouble majority\u201d basis, but later switched its justification to the \u201ctriple majority\u201d basis. On review, petitioners contend that the original calculation of property owner consent referenced in the initiating resolution was binding and insufficient to allow the resolution, and that the commission\u2019s order was void because its proceedings were started improperly. Petitioners further assert that the commission denied them procedural rights by changing the method for calculating property owner support for the city\u2019s initiating resolution after the close of the public hearing and that the commission did not make findings in the record about how the annexation complied with statewide land use planning goals. We review for errors of law, ORS 183.482(8), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>We begin with a brief summary of processes used by the boundary commission to approve city annexations. For many years, boundary commissions in the Portland metropolitan area, Marion County, and Lane County decided major and minor boundary changes. A \u201cmajor boundary change\u201d was \u201cformation, merger, consolidation or dissolution of a city or district.\u201d ORS 199.415(11). A \u201cminor boundary-change\u201d was an \u201cannexation, withdrawal or transfer of territory to or from a city or district or a transfer of territory from a city-county to a city.\u201d ORS 199.415(12).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">The manner of initiating a boundary change differed depending on whether it was a minor or major boundary change. <em>Compare </em>ORS 199.476 - 199.485 (initiation of major boundary change), <em>with </em>ORS 199.487 and ORS 199.490 (initiation of minor boundary change). Under ORS 199.490(1), certain minor boundary changes, including annexations, could be initiated by resolution of the affected city or district. However, in order for an annexation to be initiated by a city council resolution, ORS 199.490 required that the annexation be supported by property owners and/or electors in the territory to be <em>annexed </em>\u2014 i.e., that they consent in writing. That statute provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">\u201c(2)(a)(A) An annexation proceeding may also be initiated by a resolution adopted by the governing body of the affected city or district upon receiving consent to annex their land in writing from more than half of the owners of land in the territory proposed to be annexed, who also own more than half of the land in the territory proposed to be annexed and of real property therein representing more than half of the assessed value of real property in the territory proposed to be annexed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">\u201c(B) A resolution adopted by the governing body of the affected city or district upon receiving written consent to annexation from a majority of the electors registered in the territory proposed to be annexed and written consent to the annexation of their land from the owners of more than half the land in the territory proposed to be annexed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">In short, a city council resolution for an annexation could be initiated in either of two ways: (1) under ORS 199.490(2)(a)(A) by a \u201ctriple majority\u201d consent of property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>owners or (2) under ORS 199.490(2)(a)(B) by a \u201cdouble majority\u201d consent of property owners and electors.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">On June 18, 2007, the city adopted a resolution initiating annexation of the Fawn Ridge Subdivision. The city had received consents from 40 of the 43 affected property owners, representing 96 percent of the annexation area (excluding streets), and 98 percent of the assessed value of the territory to be annexed. The resolution made findings of compliance with relevant land use standards and directed the filing of the resolution and \u201ccertified copies of the statements of consent\u201d with the commission. The findings in the resolution referred to the consents as justifying initiation of the minor boundary change under ORS 199.490(2)(a)(B), the \u201cdouble majority\u201d consent. The reference to \u201cdouble majority\u201d consent \u2014 which required consent of electors \u2014 would later prove controversial because, although a few of the lots in the annexation territory were improved, there were no resident electors in the territory. Nonetheless, the city then filed an annexation application with the commission on July 3, 2007, and again indicated, this time on an application check sheet, that the annexation resolution was authorized by a \u201cdouble majority\u201d consent to the annexation.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The commission considered the annexation at a public hearing on August 2, 2007. Petitioners presented written and oral testimony regarding the proposal, specifically noting that the \u201cdouble majority\u201d consent described in ORS 199.490(2)(a)(B) required a majority of the electors in a territory to consent in writing, but that the territory subject to this annexation contained no registered electors. Petitioners asserted that the \u201cdouble majority\u201d method for tallying consents did not apply and that the proceedings were started improperly. At the end of that hearing, the commission directed staff to obtain legal advice on how to proceed, given the mistaken identification of the type of consents. The public hearing was closed, and a special meeting was scheduled for September 27 to deliberate on the annexation.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">At the September 27 meeting, the commission issued its final order approving the annexation. That order provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>\u201cWHEREAS, Resolution No. 8, Series 2007, by the city of Florence was filed on July 3, <em>2007 </em>\u2014 in <em>accordance with ORS 199.490(2)(a) </em>\u2014 for annexation of territory to the City of Florence, described in attached Exhibit A and shown on attached map Exhibit B; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-4\">\u201cWHEREAS, the commission duly published notice of the public hearing in accordance with ORS 199.463 and in accordance with the rules of the commission and ORS 199.452(1), conducted a public hearing on August 2, 2007, and deliberated on September 27, 2007; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-5\">\u201cWHEREAS, on the basis of the study of the proposal, which considered economic, demographic and sociological trends and physical development of the land <em>including the applicable comprehensive plan, </em>and of the public hearing, the commission approved the proposal and made the findings and reasons attached as Exhibit C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-6\">\u201cNOW THEREFORE IT IS ORDERED: That the area described be a part of the city of Florence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">(Emphasis added.) Exhibit C, attached to that order, includes the following findings:</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">\u201c1. This proposal was initiated with the boundary commission by the City of Florence <em>after receiving the necessary consents on July 3, 2007, in accordance with ORS 199.490(2)(a)(A). </em>The proposal was found to be a valid filing under OAR 191-006.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">\u201c2. Consents were received by the City of Florence representing more than half the owners of the land in the territory to be annexed, who own more than half the land, and the real property represents more than half of the assessed value of all the property in the territory to be annexed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">(Emphasis added.) The referenced exhibit details how the annexation will meet the policy considerations and \u201cpurposes\u201d outlined in ORS 199.410. Finally, the exhibit lists \u201creasons\u201d for the annexation, including that the \u201cproposal was supported by the City of Florence and the owners of the properties proposed for annexation\u201d and was \u201cconsistent with the LCDC acknowledged comprehensive plans.\u201d Neither the final order nor the attached exhibits discuss the statewide land use planning goals (goals).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Petitioners advance procedural claims of error that fall into two camps. First, petitioners make a number of assertions about the change in identifying the consents supporting the city resolution, a change from a \u201cdouble majority\u2019 consent identified in the city resolution to a \u201ctriple majority\u201d consent determined under the commission annexation order. We address those arguments together. Second, petitioners argue that the commission failed to make required findings that the annexation complied with the goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\">We turn first to petitioners claim that the city was required to file a notice of intent to annex that identified the particular type of annexation consent being sought before the city solicited written consents to the annexation. ORS 199.490(2)(b), which sets out procedural requirements for the city to adopt an annexation resolution, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-4\">\u201cHowever, before soliciting statements of consent for the purpose of authorizing an annexation under a proceeding initiated as provided by this subsection, the governing body of the affected city or district shall file a notice of intent to annex with the boundary commission having jurisdiction of the affected territory. The notice of intent to annex shall name the affected city or district and generally describe the boundaries of the territory sought to be annexed, which territory must be contiguous to the city or district or separated from it only by a public right of way or a stream, bay, lake or other body of water. The notice of intent to annex shall have attached to it a county assessor\u2019s cadastral map showing the location of the affected territory that the city or district proposes to annex.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Thus, the statute sets out a number of requirements for the notice of intent, none of which directs that the notice identify the annexation consents as calculated under the \u201cdouble majority\u201d or \u201ctriple majority\u201d method. Here, the city \u201cfile[d] a notice of intent to annex\u201d that \u201cname[d] the affected city * * * and generally describe[d] the boundaries of the territory,\u201d and met the other statutory requirements. ORS 199.490(2)(b). There is no merit to petitioners\u2019 claim that the notice of intent to annex was defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The city then obtained signatures from landowners in the territory to be annexed that the city believed met the two \u201cdouble majority\u201d consent requirements: consent from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>the owners of more than half the land, and zero consents from half of no registered electors (i.e., zero divided by two is zero). ORS 199.490(2)(a)(B). The consents, in any event, were more than sufficient to meet the \u201ctriple majority\u201d requirements of ORS 199.490(2)(a)(A). However, a finding in the city\u2019s resolution initiating the minor boundary change process described the initiation as \u201cauthorized by ORS 199.402(2)(a)(B).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">Petitioners appear to claim that the misidentification of the method of calculating consents in the resolution\u2019s findings undercuts its effectiveness in initiating the annexation process. ORS 199.490(2)(a), however, did not require the city resolution to accurately identify which method it would use to calculate consents. It merely required that the resolution be adopted \u201cupon receiving consent to annex their land in writing\u201d from a triple majority of property owners or \u201cupon receiving written consent to annexation\u201d from a majority of resident electors and property owners. There is no factual dispute that the city\u2019s resolution was adopted after receiving consents from a triple majority of property owners.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The city\u2019s resolution ordained only that the city recorder was \u201cdirected to file certified copies of the statements of consent and this Resolution with the Lane County Local Government Boundary Commission.\u201d The city\u2019s resolution was consistent with ORS 199.490(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Petitioners next contend that the commission was deprived of authority to accept the initiating resolution as supported by a \u201ctriple majority\u201d of property owners because the city\u2019s annexation resolution stated that initiation was authorized under ORS 199.402(2)(a)(B). Petitioners argue that the commission\u2019s authority to approve the annexation is contingent on the city making a resolution submitting that particular type of annexation to the commission before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>public hearing. Respondents contend that the commission\u2019s authority to approve a \u201ctriple majority\u201d annexation is not contingent on the city filing a resolution that accurately identifies the type of consents relied on. In the alternative, respondents also contend that, even if the commission erred, the error did not impair the fairness or correctness of the annexation, and so any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">We have already decided that the city was not required to identify the annexation consents calculation method in the initiating resolution. Under the plain terms of ORS 199.490(2)(a), the sufficiency of a resolution initiating an annexation depends on whether the city had received sufficient consents as a matter of fact. Because the city had received sufficient consents, the minor boundary change was properly started under ORS 199.490, and the commission did not err in so concluding.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Moreover, there is nothing in the approval criteria for a minor boundary change that links that approval to the correctness of findings in a city resolution initiating annexation. The commission applied ORS 199.462(1) to evaluate the minor boundary change. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">\u201cIn order to carry out the purposes described by ORS 199.410 when reviewing a petition for a boundary change * * *, a boundary commission shall consider local comprehensive planning for the area, economic, demographic and sociological trends and projections pertinent to the proposal, past and prospective physical development of land that would directly or indirectly be affected by the proposed boundary change * * * and the goals adopted under ORS 197.255.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Nothing in that statute suggests that the commission is required to consider whether the annexation was initiated using a particular consent method as part of its approval process or that accepting an initiating resolution after a change for \u201ctriple majority\u201d to \u201cdouble majority\u2019 consents would be in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Similarly, ORS 199.461(4) describes the record for approval or disapproval of a boundary change petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number><em>\u201cOn the basis of the study </em>and <em>on the basis of the facts </em>presented at the hearing, the boundary commission shall approve the proposed boundary change * * * as presented or <em>as modified by the commission </em>or disapprove the proposed change, by an order stating the reasons for the decision of the commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">(Emphasis added.) Here, too, the statute does not limit the commission\u2019s authority to accept an initiating resolution when there is an incorrect finding on the type of consents received. The commission uses the \u201cfacts\u201d presented at the hearing, which may include the procedural facts, as one basis for approving or disapproving the annexation. Given the commission\u2019s power to modify a proposal before approval and those statutory directives to review and approve a proposal based on specific substantive criteria, we find no basis to conclude that the commission lacks authority to approve an annexation under ORS 199.490(2)(a)(A) simply because of an incorrect finding in an initiating resolution. The commission did not err as a matter of law in approving the annexation. Accordingly, we affirm as to those assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Next, petitioners argue that the commission failed to consider and make findings regarding whether the proposed annexation complied with the statewide planning goals as required by ORS 199.462(1) and OAR 191-030-0020(25). Respondents agree that the commission\u2019s final order must comply with the goals, but argue that the commission met that requirement by finding that the annexation complied with the city\u2019s acknowledged comprehensive plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">As noted earlier, ORS 199.462(1) requires that, \u201c[i]n order to carry out the purposes described by ORS 199.410,\u201d a \u201cboundary commission shall consider local comprehensive planning * * * and the goals adopted under ORS 197.225\u201d in making a boundary change. OAR 191-030-0020(25), a rule adopted by the commission, also regulates the findings required to approve a proposed boundary change. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">\u201cTo adopt a final order approving a boundary change proposal, the Commission must find that the proposal <em>complies with the statewide planning goals </em>and is consistent with the applicable acknowledged comprehensive plans and land use regulations as provided in the Commission\u2019s State Agency Coordination (SAC) Program, which is hereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>adopted by reference. <em>Failure of the proposal to be found in compliance with the statewide planning goals </em>or to be consistent with the acknowledged comprehensive plan and land use regulations will result in denial of the proposal by the Commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">(Emphasis added.) Under both the statute and rule, then, the commission is required to consider how the proposed annexation complies with the goals in making a boundary change.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Other policies temper the goal consistency requirement. ORS 199.462(1) requires the commission to consider the goals <em>\u201cin order to carry out the purpose described by ORS 199.410.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) ORS 199.410(3)(d) sets out the general policy for local government boundary commissions and provides that one of the purposes of the boundary commission statutes is to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">\u201c[plrovide that boundary determinations are consistent with acknowledged local comprehensive plans and are, in conformance with statewide planning goals. In making boundary determinations the commission shall first consider the acknowledged comprehensive plan * * *. <em>Only when the acknowledged local comprehensive plan provides inadequate policy direction shall the commission consider the statewide planning goals.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, ORS 199.462(1) \u2014 the statute that requires goal consistency for approval of boundary changes\u2014 requires the commission to consider the goals <em>in order to carry out </em>the purposes listed in ORS 199.410, which in turn states that the commission should consider the goals <em>only </em>when the acknowledged comprehensive plan does not provide adequate policy direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">Similarly, another administrative rule of the commission rounds out the goal consistency requirement of OAR 191-030-0020(25). OAR 191-005-0060 requires that a boundary commission and staff must make a study of a boundary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>change proposal, including an annexation. That rule provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-4\">\u201c[T]he study shall consider state planning goals, and county, city, and other applicable plans and policies (ORS 199.410). When considering a boundary change in an area for which there is an acknowledged comprehensive plan, the Commission shall consider the acknowledged plan and <em>does not have to address statewide goals.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">OAR 191-005-0060 (emphasis added). Both rules, read in context, reflect the same policy as ORS 199.462 and ORS 199.410, namely, that the acknowledged local comprehensive plan itself addresses the application of the goals to the annexation and further goal findings are necessary only where the plan is inadequate or does not address the area to be annexed.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The commission made findings that applicable policies in the relevant comprehensive plan supported the annexation. Those findings suffice to comply with ORS 199.462(1) and the relevant administrative rules. The commission found that \u201c[t]he annexation area was within the urban growth boundary of the acknowledged 1988 Florence Comprehensive Plan and 2020 Realization Comprehensive Plan,\u201d and that the annexation \u201cassisted in fulfilling the comprehensive plans policies of annexing out to the urban growth boundary.\u201d The commission also found that the \u201cexisting and proposed uses were consistent with the long-range plan for the area and fulfilled the growth policies in the comprehensive plan and in Oregon law.\u201d Petitioners do not argue that the acknowledged comprehensive plan was inadequate to provide standards for the annexation or that the annexation was inconsistent with those plan standards. In light of the commission\u2019s findings that the annexation complied with the acknowledged comprehensive plan and Oregon law, no further findings addressing state land use goals were necessary for approval of the boundary change.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Finally, petitioners claim that the boundary commission erred in approving an unreasonable annexation under the common-law standard for reasonable annexations announced in <em>Portland General Electric Co. v. City of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number><em>Estacada, </em>194 Or 145, 159, 241 P2d 1129 (1952). We reiterated in <em>Morsman v. City of Madras, </em>191 Or App 149, 153-54, 81 P3d 711 (2003), that the requirement for reasonable annexations is assessed using specific legislative and regulatory criteria for annexation approvals, rather than through unguided judicial concepts of order or fairness. We continue to hold that view and reject, without further discussion, petitioners\u2019 claims about the substantive merits of the annexation.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b634-5\"> <em>See </em>ORS 199.460 (jurisdiction of commission over boundary changes); ORS 199.415(4) (definition of \u201cboundary change\u201d as \u201ca major or minor boundary change\u201d); ORS 199.415(12) (\u201cminor boundary change\u201d as including \u201cannexation * of territory to ** * * a city\u201d). The Lane County Boundary Commission was abolished by the 2007 Oregon Legislative Assembly. Or Laws 2007, ch 239, \u00a7\u00a71-7,16. The boundary change at issue was adopted before July 1,2008, the effective date of that law. All references to provisions of ORS chapter 199 in this opinion refer to the 2007 versions of the statutes that were in effect when the annexation was approved by the commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b639-7\"> Petitioners had the opportunity at the boundary commission hearing on the minor boundary change to argue and present evidence on the question of whether the annexation resolution was, in fact, supported by sufficient consents. Petitioners did not argue that the signatures were insufficient; they argued only that, as a matter of law, an annexation labeled by the city as supported by a \u201cdouble majority\u2019 consent could not be approved as supported by a \u201ctriple majority\u201d of property owners. Accordingly, we do not agree with petitioners that they were entitled to any additional notice or that their rights were prejudiced when the commission approved the annexation as supported by a \u201ctriple majority\u201d of property owners.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b642-9\"> The Land Conservation and Development Commission (LCDC) rules provide that an \u201c \u2018Acknowledgment of Compliance\u2019 is an order of the Commission issued pursuant to ORS 197.251(1) that certifies that a comprehensive plan and land use regulation, land use regulations or plan or regulation amendment <em>conforms with the Goals.\u201d </em>OAR 660-003-0005 (emphasis added).
