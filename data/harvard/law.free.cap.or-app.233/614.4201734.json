He contends, in part, that, in the underlying criminal case, he received constitutionally inadequate assistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed to \u201cchallenge the admissibility of the state\u2019s expert witness\u2019s \u2018diagnosis\u2019 of sexual abuse[.]\u201d That assignment of error is controlled by our recent decision in <em>Umberger v. Czerniak, </em>232 Or App 563, 222 P3d 751 (2009) (trial counsel did not render constitutionally inadequate assistance where, before the Oregon Supreme Court rendered its decision in <em>State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 218 P3d 104 (2009), counsel failed to object to expert\u2019s qualifications to testify about whether the victim had been sexually abused). As in <em>Umberger, </em>we conclude here that petitioner\u2019s trial counsel did not fail to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment when counsel failed to object to the expert testimony at issue. We reject petitioner\u2019s other assignments of error without discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
