The opinion affirmed a decision of the City of Bend (city) that approved respondent\u2019s site plan for a triplex residence. LUBA determined that the city erred in granting respondent\u2019s requested variances to street improvement, property dedication, and special setback standards for the development. However, it concluded that an alternative waiver of those requirements by the city engineer was sufficient to sustain approval of the site plan. Petitioners, who are neighbors opposed to the triplex development, contend that LUBA erred in affirming the plan on that basis. They claim that the waiver standard applied by the engineer was too indefinite to pass muster under ORS 227.173(1). Petitioners also assert that the engineer lacks authority to waive the special setback standard. Respondent cross-assigns error to LUBA\u2019s determination that the city erred in granting the variances. We review the board\u2019s opinion and order to determine whether it is \u201cunlawful in substance.\u201d ORS 197.850(9)(a). We conclude that LUBA correctly held that the waiver standard was lawful under ORS 227.173(1), but that the board erred in determining that the city engineer had authority to waive the setback standard. We also conclude that the cross-assignments of error lack merit. Accordingly, we reverse and remand the opinion and order to LUBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The controversy about the triplex development was not new to LUBA. Respondent sought city approval of a site plan for a triplex residence. The dwelling had already been constructed in an established neighborhood of single-family dwellings on Steidl Road, a local street in the City of Bend. Steidl Road is two blocks long, approximately 24 feet in width, and situated in a 40-foot right-of-way. The city\u2019s road standards require a 36-foot-wide pavement and a 60-foot right-of-way for a local street. The subject property and nearby lots are zoned to allow multi-family dwellings.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The city first approved construction of the triplex dwelling through an administrative process that did not include a public hearing. After that approval, respondent began to construct the building\u2019s foundation. Petitioners then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>sought review of the administrative approval to LUBA. LUBA remanded the approval for findings on whether the decision could be made without a public hearing. <em>Zirker v. City of Bend, </em>55 Or LUBA 188 (2007). Meanwhile, respondent completed construction of the triplex.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">The city then adopted findings to explain the legitimacy of an administrative approval process for the triplex and the lack of a need to apply discretionary development standards. On review, LUBA rejected those findings and determined that discretionary standards did apply to the development. <em>Tallman v. City of Bend, </em>56 Or LUBA 398 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Respondent then applied for site plan approval and the road improvement and setback variances under the applicable development code criteria. At the hearing before the city\u2019s hearings officer, the city\u2019s traffic engineer contended that the road improvement standards could be waived. The hearings officer approved the application, finding that respondent\u2019s proposal met the variance criteria and that, alternatively, the city engineer properly waived application of the setback and road improvement standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The issues in this case concern whether to excuse the development from the restrictions imposed by (1) a required special setback from Steidl Road, and (2) requirements that respondent dedicate and improve part of the lot\u2019s frontage on that road. Those requirements are imposed by the city\u2019s development code in order to facilitate future expansion and improvement of the road to applicable code standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">The normal setback in the zoning district requires development to occur outside of a 10-foot setback from the front property line. The property line of respondent\u2019s lot adjoins the existing 40-foot right-of-way for Steidl Road. Because the right-of-way is below code requirements, a \u201cspecial setback\u201d is imposed by Bend Development Code (BDC) 3.5.300(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The normal 10-foot setback must be measured from that special setback, instead of from the front property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>line. As a result, the front porches and north front corners of the triplex intrude into the 10-foot setback area.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">The city allows for variance to the special setback requirement, BDC 5.1.300(A), and respondent requested such a variance. The criteria for allowing a setback variance, as applicable to this case, are stated in BDC 5.1.300(B). They include whether the variance is \u201cmaterially detrimental\u201d to the stated purpose of the code requirement, that \u201cexisting physical and natural systems * * * will not be adversely affected\u201d any more than normal, and that the hardship created by the setback requirement not be \u201cself-imposed.\u201d Of particular relevance, BDC 5.1.300(B)(2) allows a variance to the setback restriction only when</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">\u201c[a] hardship exists that is peculiar to the nature of the requested use, lot size or shape, topography, sensitive lands, or other similar circumstances related to the property or use over which the applicant has no control, and which are not applicable to other properties in the vicinity (e.g., the same land use district^.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">In addition to the special setback requirement, pursuant to BDC 3.4.200(M), in order to develop the property, respondent is required to dedicate an additional 10 feet of right-of-way along the property\u2019s frontage with Steidl Road. BDC 3.4.200(A) also requires that respondent widen the pavement of Steidl Road along that frontage by six feet. Respondent applied for a variance to those requirements, which could be granted only if \u201ca required improvement is not feasible due to topographic constraints or constraints posed by sensitive lands or the project does not meet the exception standards listed herein.\u201d BDC 3.4.200(B). Additional criteria for that variance are stated in BDC 5.1.400(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The hearings officer determined that the improvements met the applicable criteria and granted the requested variances. On review, LUBA disagreed and concluded that the condition of the property did not justify the allowance of either variance. We concur with LUBA\u2019s reasoning in its determinations on both variance requests, and reject respondent\u2019s cross-assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Nonetheless, LUBA affirmed the city\u2019s decision to approve the site plan, based on the city engineer\u2019s waiver of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>those requirements. It concluded that the waiver was authorized by chapter 3.4 of the BDC. That chapter sets out standards for the design and construction of public and private infrastructure. Section 3.4.100 sets forth the \u201cpurpose and authority\u201d for the specifications \u201cin this Chapter.\u201d BDC 3.4.100(B) and (C) provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-4\">\u201cB. City\u2019s Authority. The City Engineer may, at his/her discretion, modify or waive the required content of this chapter when in his/her judgment special circumstances dictate such change, pursuant to Section 3.4.100(C), below.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-5\">\u201cC. When Standards Apply. Unless otherwise provided, the standard specifications for construction, reconstruction or repair of transportation facilities, utilities and other public improvements within the City shall conform to this Chapter. No development shall occur unless the public improvements related to development comply with the public facility requirements established in this Chapter, unless specifically exempt or otherwise specified by a land use review and/or condition of approval from a land use action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">(Boldface in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Planning staff found that comments on the application provided by the city\u2019s transportation engineer showed her intent to waive the special setback and right-of-way requirements because of \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d under BDC 3.4.100(B). According to the hearings officer\u2019s findings, at the time of the public hearing,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">\u201cthe City\u2019s traffic engineer, Ms. Robin Lewis, stated that the Engineering Division had decided or intended to waive the 36' pavement width requirement and explained generally why, in her opinion, such discretion to do so was important to the Engineering Division. Ms. Lewis further explained the waiver decision identifying the reasoning for such, including that there was a very low volume of traffic on the subject streets, low pedestrian traffic, and short street length and that the area was already developed, but for this lot, and redevelopment was very unlikely. According to the Traffic Engineer, the \u2018built environment\u2019 is now static, and includes other houses which do not comply with the current standards, the streets currently function very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>well and as such the 36' width requirement was unnecessary. She relied heavily on the traffic analysis provide[d] by the applicant and her own observations of the site. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-4\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-5\">\u201c* * * Ms. Lewis stated that the total average daily trips (ADT) on Steidl Road would be 170 with the triplex, only 11% of what is expected on a typical residential street. Steidl Road currently serves less than <em>150 </em>ADT and the anticipated [volume] for the street classification is 1,500 ADT. She further testified that the peak p.m. ADT with the development of the triplex would increase by only .55% and that the street Very infrequently\u2019 has even two cars on it at the same time. * * * She found that due to the built environment, including short street length of about two blocks, and conflict with existing structures in the event the street width and right-of-way are widened, that it was very unlikely that Steidl Road would ever redevelop. She generally explained that the widening of the street was unnecessary to accommodate vehicle traffic from planned and future growth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The hearings officer found the engineer\u2019s reasoning to adequately state \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d sufficient to waive the street improvement and dedication requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Before the city and on LUBA review, petitioners contended that the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d standard for an engineer waiver was too indefinite to suffice as a criterion for a land use decision under ORS 227.173(1). That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-8\">\u201cApproval or denial of a discretionary permit application shall be based on standards and criteria, which shall be set forth in the development ordinance and which shall relate approval or denial of a discretionary permit application to the development ordinance and to the comprehensive plan for the area in which the development would occur and to the development ordinance and comprehensive plan for the city as a whole.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">As this court has previously explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-10\">\u201c[r]educed to its essentials, ORS 227.173(1) requires that development ordinances set forth reasonably clear standards for discretionary permit applications. The intent of the statute is to insure that those standards be the sole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>basis for determining whether a discretionary permit application is approved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-4\"><em>Lee v. City of Portland, </em>57 Or App 798, 801, 646 P2d 662 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">We understand petitioners to have argued below that the waiver allowance for \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d was not a \u201creasonably clear standard\u201d because any distinguishing or \u201cspecial\u201d characteristic of the development could be used to excuse compliance. The hearings officer found that the standard could be determined by reference to other related code provisions. LUBA held that BDC 3.4.100(B) was a \u201chighly subjective standard,\u201d but that ORS 227.173(1) did not forbid subjective standards. LUBA concluded that \u201cthe City Engineer\u2019s decision that the BDC 3.4.200 road standards and the BDC 3.5.300 special setback need not be imposed as a condition of approving the disputed triplex was within the City Engineer\u2019s discretion under BDC 3.4.100(B)\u201d and that the standard complied with ORS 227.173(1). <em>Zirker v. City of Bend, </em>59 Or LUBA 1, 20 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">On review, petitioners argue that LUBA erred in concluding that the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d standard was \u201creasonably clear\u201d under ORS 227.173(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Petitioners claim that the standard does not give sufficient guidance to the applicant and city decision-maker to know the required proof of compliance with that standard. Petitioners also assert that the waiver could apply only to the transportation improvements required under BDC chapter 3.4 and not to the setback required by BDC 3.5.300(B). Respondent counters that the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d criterion is sufficiently definite when construed in the context of other code provisions relating to street widths. We conclude that the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d criterion is \u201creasonably clear\u201d under ORS 227.173(1), but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>that the waiver authority applies only to the transportation improvements required by BDC chapter 3.4.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">The method for determining the intended meaning of a statute is to examine the text of the statute for its plain meaning, together with the context of related statutes, and material portions of the legislative history of the measure. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). On its face, ORS 227.173(1) requires that: (1) a decision on a discretionary permit application be \u201cbased on standards and criteria\u201d; (2) that those standards and criteria \u201crelate [the action on the application] to the development ordinance and to the comprehensive plan\u201d; and (3) that the standards and criteria \u201cshall be set forth in the development ordinance.\u201d As we held in <em>Lee, </em>the requirement that a discretionary permit decision be \u201cbased on standards and criteria\u201d necessarily means that the standards must operate to guide official discretion in deciding whether to issue the permit, so that those standards, and not some other predilection of the decision-maker, provide \u201cthe sole basis for determining whether a discretionary permit application is approved.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>57 Or App at 801. To provide that guidance, the standards must be sufficiently definite to give the parties and the decision-maker an understanding of what proof and arguments are necessary to show that the application complies with those criteria and to make the outcome capable of prediction by the decision-maker. The statute\u2019s requirement that the necessary standards and criteria must allow a relation of the action on the permit to the comprehensive plan implies that the standards advance the policies in the applicable comprehensive plan. <em>See also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>ORS 197.175(2)(b) (obligating cities to \u201c[ejnact land use regulations to implement their comprehensive plans\u201d). Finally, the standards must be \u201cset forth in the development ordinance,\u201d requiring that the standards be adopted and published exclusively in the development ordinance prior to the decision. <em>See BCT Partnership v. City of Portland, </em>130 Or App 271, 276 n 2, 881 P2d 176 (1994) (ORS 227.173(1) \u201cseems to have the purpose of assuring that permit decisions will be based on pre-existing legislation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">In <em>BCT Partnership, </em>we explained that a discretionary permit approval standard could be gleaned from various parts of the development code. 130 Or App at 277. In that case, an applicant for a parking garage conditional use permit was required to prove that the application was consistent with the city\u2019s \u201cshort term parking strategy,\u201d a strategy that was not explicitly announced in the city\u2019s development code. <em>Id. </em>at 273-74. We concluded that the standard was \u201cset forth\u201d under ORS 227.173(1) in related general provisions of the development code. We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">\u201cORS 227.173 allows cities to identify the standards and criteria that apply to particular permits by interpreting more general provisions that are \u2018set forth\u2019 in their land use legislation, and from which the specific applications reasonably follow. We also conclude that the city satisfied the statute here. The city\u2019s legislation includes sufficient general provisions to establish and identify the short term parking strategy that the city interpreted them as embodying; the issues to be addressed in the proceeding were sufficiently discernible from those provisions; and the city\u2019s order provided the necessary explanation under ORS 227.173(2) of what standards it was applying and how they applied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">To reiterate, BDC 3.4.100(B) allows discretion by the city engineer to \u201cmodify or waive the required content of this chapter when in his/her judgment special circumstances dictate such change, pursuant to Section 3.4.100(C), below.\u201d Two limiting features of a \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d waiver are apparent from the face of the ordinance. First, \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d must be a matter of \u201cjudgment\u201d or expertise of an engineer. BDC 3.4.100(B) allows a waiver by the engineer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>\u201cin his/her judgment.\u201d The ordinance contemplates that some specifications for a public improvement may not be feasible or practical in context, and allows the exercise of professional engineering judgment by the city engineer to modify or waive the specification. Thus, the subject matter of the waiver must be one that requires the application of engineering expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">Second, the specification waiver authority under BDC 3.4.100(B) means something different than the general authority to allow a variance to a transportation design guideline under BDC 3.4.200(B), relating to infeasibility due to topographic constraints or sensitive lands. It is reasonable to construe the particular waiver authority in BDC 3.4.100(B) to not be redundant of general variance authority expressed elsewhere in the code. <em>Cf. </em>ORS 174.010 (stating rule that construction of statutes is preferred \u201cas will give effect to all\u201d provisions in the law); <em>State v. Stamper, </em>197 Or App 413, 418, 106 P3d 172, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 230 (2005) (courts should avoid construction of legislation that results in surplusage and redundancy). Thus, the engineer\u2019s waiver authority would not extend to the circumstances that would allow a waiver of the requirements imposed by BDC 3.4.200(B) and BDC 5.1.400.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Other parts of BDC chapter 3.4 supply particulars for the exercise of authority under BDC 3.4.100(B). BDC 3.4.200(E) provides that \u201c[sjtreet location, width and grade shall be determined in relation to existing and planned streets, topographic conditions, public convenience and safety, and in appropriate relation to the proposed use of the land to be served by such streets.\u201d Moreover, BDC 3.4.200(F)(2) sets out particular \u201cfactors\u201d to determine the \u201cpavement width\u201d for streets, including \u201c[sjtreet classification in the Transportation System Plan,\u201d \u201c[ajnticipated traffic volume,\u201d \u201c[ojn-street parking needs,\u201d and \u201c[sjidewalk and bikeway requirements based on anticipated level of use.\u201d All of those policies are stated for the purpose of providing \u201cstandards for attractive and safe streets that can accommodate vehicle traffic from planned growth\u201d under BDC 3.4.100(A). Those policies inform the application of the engineer\u2019s expertise to modify or avoid the standards for street width and frontage dedication.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>The city\u2019s traffic engineer exercised professional judgment to grant a waiver and vary the required width for Steidl Road, given technical conclusions about \u201canticipated traffic volumes,\u201d \u201con-street parking needs,\u201d \u201cthe proposed use of the land to be served\u201d by Steidl Road, and \u201cpublic convenience and safety\u201d under the development code. Relying on traffic analysis provided by the applicant and projected traffic counts, the engineer concluded that a 36-foot pavement width for Steidl Road was not needed, given the \u201cvery low volume of traffic on the subject streets, low pedestrian traffic, and short street length and that the area was already developed, but for this lot, and redevelopment was very unlikely.\u201d That judgment was based on reasonably clear criteria expressed in the development code for the determination of road pavement width. Those criteria allowed the parties to present proof and arguments on expected traffic increases for the road and were sufficient to guide the application of the engineer\u2019s expertise. The city\u2019s waiver decision on pavement and right-of-way width for Steidl Road was lawful under ORS 227.173(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">LUBA erred, however, in concluding that the engineer\u2019s waiver authority under BDC 3.4.100(B) and (C) for \u201cpublic facility requirements established in this Chapter\u201d extended to development setback requirements required in a different chapter of the code, BDC 3.5.300. A special setback under BDC 3.5.300 is not a \u201cpublic facility requirement\u201d; nor is it \u201cestablished in this Chapter.\u201d BDC 3.4.100(A) states that the purpose of \u201cthis Chapter\u201d is to \u201cprovide requirements for design and construction of public and private infrastructure.\u201d Other \u201cchapters\u201d of the BDC, such as chapter 3.3 of the code (Vehicle Parking, Loading and Bicycle Parking), contain separate statements of purpose and separate references to \u201cthis Chapter.\u201d BDC 3.3.100 (\u201cThe purpose of <em>this Chapter </em>is to provide basic and flexible standards for the development of vehicle parking, loading and bicycle parking.\u201d <em>\u201cThis Chapter </em>also provides standards for bicycle parking because many people use bicycles * * (Emphasis added.)). Thus, read in context with other provisions of the code, it is clear that, by using the term \u201cestablished in this Chapter\u201d in BDC 3.4.100(A), the code refers to requirements established in chapter 3.4. Special setback requirements are established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>under BDC 3.5.300, not chapter 3.4. Accordingly, the engineer\u2019s waiver authority \u2014 which applies only to the requirements established in chapter 3.4 \u2014 does not extend to special setback requirements, and the waiver in this case was beyond the engineer\u2019s authority.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-8\"> BDC 3.5.300(A) explains that the purpose of the restriction is \u201cto ensure that adequate right of way will be available for the appropriate street improvements as the city grows[.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b652-7\"> We note that the issue raised by the parties in this case involves only ORS 227.173(1).
