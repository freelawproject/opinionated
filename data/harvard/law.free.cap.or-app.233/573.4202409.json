He was charged with and convicted of the crimes of attempting to elude a \u201cpolice officer\u201d with a vehicle, ORS 811.540, and resisting arrest by a \u201cpeace officer,\u201d ORS 162.315. On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal, arguing that the tribal officer involved in the underlying traffic stop was not a \u201cpolice officer\u201d or \u201cpeace officer\u201d as defined by the applicable statutes. We review, as a question of law, the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal when the facts are not in dispute. <em>State v. Nollen, </em>196 Or App 141, 144, 100 P3d 788 (2004). We conclude that the tribal police officer was not a \u201cpolice officer\u201d for purposes of ORS 811.540 or a \u201cpeace officer\u201d under ORS 162.315 and, accordingly, reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The issues presented are questions of law and the facts are not in dispute. The case was tried to the court, and the court made the following factual findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">\u201cJoseph Davino is a full time commissioned officer working for the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs. Officer Davino was hired by Warm Springs on October 25, 2004.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">\u201c[Defendant] is a non-Indian who lives on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-9\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-10\">\u201cDuring Officer Davino\u2019s shift on January 19, 2005, he observed a vehicle driven by [defendant] on Highway 26. The two were traveling in opposite directions and Officer Davino thought [defendant] was appearing to hide from him as they passed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-11\">\u201cOfficer Davino turned his vehicle around and followed the car driven by [defendant]. Officer Davino testified that he followed the vehicle for approximately one mile and the driver and passenger appeared nervous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-12\">\u201cAt a point very close to the reservation boundary [defendant] turned around to look at Officer Davino. When [defendant] turned around, his vehicle went across the center line and into the oncoming traffic lane of travel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>\u201cOfficer Davino activated his overhead lights to stop the vehicle driven by [defendant] for a traffic offense committed in the officer\u2019s presence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-4\">\u201cThe vehicle didn\u2019t respond to the overhead lights and proceeded to go over the bridge across the Deschutes River that is the boundary of the Reservation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-5\">\u201cOfficer Davino activated his siren near the boat entrance to the Deschutes River which is located off the Reservation and at this point believed that he had probable cause to stop the vehicle for the crime of Attempt to Elude Police with a Vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">\u201cThe driver of the vehicle eventually pulled over. The passenger in the vehicle fled by foot. The driver of the vehicle, [defendant], was detained at gun point and placed under arrest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Defendant subsequently resisted arrest and was subdued with the assistance of additional tribal police officers and pepper spray. Davino was driving a marked Warm Springs patrol car and wearing his Warm Springs Police uniform at the time of the traffic stop. Davino was not deputized by the Jefferson County Sheriff nor had he attended the Oregon Police Academy at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">At the conclusion of the state\u2019s case, defendant moved for judgment of acquittal on both counts. In that motion, defendant argued that \u201cin terms of Count 1, Attempt to Elude a Police Officer, ORS 811.540, that * * * a Warm Springs Tribal Police Officer is not a police officer under the definition provided by ORS 801.395.\u201d Defendant went on to argue that \u201cin terms of Count 2, the Resisting Arrest count, [ORS 162.315], * * * the state must establish that the Warm Springs Tribal Police officer [is a peace] officer as described in [ORS 133.055].\u201d The court denied defendant\u2019s motion and issued a judgment of conviction on both counts. Defendant renews those same contentions on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">ORS 811.540 defines the crime of fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer. That statute provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-10\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-11\">\u201c(a) The person is operating a motor vehicle; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>\u201c(b) A police officer who is in uniform and prominently displaying the police officer\u2019s badge of office or operating a vehicle appropriately marked showing it to be an official police vehicle gives a visual or audible signal to bring the vehicle to a stop, including any signal by hand, voice, emergency light or siren, and either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-4\">\u201c(A) The person, while still in the vehicle, knowingly flees or attempts to elude a pursuing police officer; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-5\">\u201c(B) The person gets out of the vehicle and knowingly flees or attempts to elude the police officer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Defendant does not dispute that the facts establish a violation of ORS 811.540, so long as Davino was a \u201cpolice officer\u201d as that term is used in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">ORS 801.395, which defines \u201cpolice officer\u201d for purposes of ORS 811.540, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">\u201c \u2018Police officer\u2019 includes a member of the Oregon State Police, a sheriff, a deputy sheriff, a city police officer or a law enforcement officer employed by a service district established under ORS 451.410 to 451.610 for the purpose of law enforcement services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">We construe a statutory term to discern legislative intent as to its meaning by first examining the text, context, and any relevant legislative history of the provision. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 172, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). A tribal police officer is not specifically listed in ORS 801.395 as being included within the scope of the term \u201cpolice officer.\u201d However, the use of \u201cincludes\u201d in the text of the definition of \u201cpolice officer\u201d indicates that the legislature intended the list to be nonexclusive. <em>See, e.g., State v. Courtier, </em>166 Or App 514, 517, 997 P2d 894 (2000) (ordinance defining \u201cdangerous or deadly weapon\u201d by use of term \u201cincludes\u201d was not limited to the list of particularly described and identified weapons); <em>State v. Haynes, </em>149 Or App 73, 76, 942 P2d 295 (1997), <em>rev den, </em>328 Or 275 (1999) (\u201cIt bears emphasis that stating what a term <em>means </em>is not the same as stating what it <em>includes. </em>The former describes generally what a term is intended to express or signify. The latter describes in particular those things that are contained in or embraced by the term.\u201d (Emphasis added.)). Given that \u201cpolice officer\u201d is an open-ended term in ORS 801.395, we determine the meaning of \u201cpolice officer\u201d by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>identifying the shared characteristics of the law enforcement officers that are listed in the statutory definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">It is no simple task to identify the core characteristics of the listed examples of \u201cpolice officer [s]\u201d so as to discern the fundamental meaning of that term. At one level of generality, all of the included types of \u201cpolice officer[s]\u201d are persons who work for a governmental entity and are charged with the enforcement of laws and the maintenance of public order. That meaning of \u201cpolice officer\u201d is consistent with the common understanding of \u201cpolice officer\u201d as \u201can officer in a police force.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1754 (unabridged ed 2002). The relevant definition of \u201cpolice\u201d is: <em>\u201c4 </em>b : the department of government having as its principal function the prevention, detection, and prosecution of public nuisances and crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1753. That general meaning of \u201cpolice officer\u201d encompasses members of virtually every public law enforcement organization, including the Warm Springs Tribal Police. The trial court apparently gave that broad meaning to the term \u201cpolice officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The listed types of \u201cpolice officer[s]\u201d in ORS 801.395, however, share more than a common job function to enforce criminal laws. Each type of \u201cpolice officer\u201d is employed by a governmental entity of the State of Oregon \u2014 by the state, a county, a city, or a law enforcement service district. If <em>that </em>characteristic is the defining feature of \u201cpolice officer\u201d \u2014 that a \u201cpolice officer\u201d is a person employed by an Oregon governmental entity \u2014 then defendant did not attempt to elude a \u201cpolice officer\u201d under ORS 811.540. The Warm Springs Tribe is not a governmental entity of the State of Oregon. Instead, it is a \u201cself-governing sovereign political community[ ].\u201d <em>United States v. Wheeler, </em>453 US 313, 322-23, 98 S Ct 1079, 55 L Ed 2d 303 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">As between the more general and the specific meanings of \u201cpolice officer\u201d suggested by the listed types of law enforcement officers in ORS 801.395, the statutory context of the term \u2014 how it is used in the Oregon Vehicle Code \u2014 suggests the more narrow meaning.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Within the Oregon Vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Code, the term \u201cpolice officer\u201d is used in three primary ways: (1) to define offenses that involve some interaction with a police officer; <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) to specify law enforcement authority with respect to traffic and motor vehicle laws;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (3) to perform duties in connection with implied consent laws.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The statutes in the Oregon Vehicle Code that specify the law enforcement authority of a \u201cpolice officer\u201d extend that authority only to officers of Oregon governmental entities. Thus, it is likely that the overallmeaning of \u201cpolice officer\u201d in the Oregon Vehicle Code is a law enforcement officer of an Oregon governmental entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">ORS 810.410(1) sets out the core authority of a \u201cpolice officer\u201d with respect to the enforcement of traffic crimes and violations. That statute provides context in determining the general meaning of \u201cpolice officer\u201d as defined by ORS 801.395. ORS 810.410(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">\u201cA police officer may arrest or issue a citation to a person for a traffic crime at any place within or outside the jurisdictional authority of the <em>governmental unit </em>by which the police officer is authorized to act <em>as provided by ORS 133.235 and 133.310.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">ORS 810.410(1) contains two indications that a \u201cpolice officer\u201d is a person acting on behalf of an Oregon governmental entity. First, the authority of a police officer is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>linked to a \u201cgovernmental unit.\u201d Although the term \u201cgovernmental unit\u201d is not defined, its technical meaning in other contexts is a governmental entity organized under the laws of the State of Oregon. <em>See, e.g., </em>ORS 30.360(4) (defining \u201cgovernmental unit\u201d for purposes of statutes regulating actions by or against governmental units as \u201cthe State of Oregon or any county, incorporated city, school district or other public corporation of like character in this state\u201d); ORS 87.603 (defining \u201cgovernmental unit\u201d as used in ambulance lien statutes as \u201cthe state, any county, city or other municipal corporation or any department, board or other agency of any of them\u201d); ORS 442.015(14) (\u201cgovernmental unit\u201d as used in health planning statutes as \u201cthe state, or any county, municipality or other political subdivision, or any related department, division, board or other agency\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Second, ORS 810.410(1) describes the authority of a \u201cpolice officer\u201d to be \u201cas provided by ORS 133.235 and 133.310.\u201d ORS 133.235 sets out the circumstances under which an officer may arrest a person; ORS 133.310 similarly describes the authority of an officer to arrest a person without a warrant. The types of officers covered by those statutes are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">\u201ca member of the Oregon State Police or a sheriff, constable, marshal, municipal police officer, investigator of a district attorney\u2019s office if the investigator is or has been certified as a peace officer in this or any other state, or an investigator of the Criminal Justice Division of the Department of Justice of the State of Oregon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">ORS 133.005(3). Those identified law enforcement officers are police officers of Oregon governmental entities. ORS 810.410(1), then, equates the authority of a \u201cpolice officer\u201d to be coincident with that of officers pursuant to ORS 133.235 and ORS 133.310 \u2014 that is, officers of Oregon governmental entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The Oregon Vehicle Code, then, describes the enforcement authority of a \u201cpolice officer\u201d by referring to the \u201cauthority of the governmental unit by which the police officer is authorized to act.\u201d That reference is likely to mean an Oregon governmental unit. The code also references the arrest authority of such an officer to be a law enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>officer of the State of Oregon or its municipalities and political subdivisions. Given that statutory framework for the authority of a \u201cpolice officer,\u201d we conclude that the intended meaning of \u201cpolice officer\u201d as defined by ORS 801.395 is a law enforcement officer of an Oregon governmental unit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Indeed, we reached that conclusion in <em>dictum </em>in <em>State v. Pamperien, </em>156 Or App 153, 967 P2d 503 (1998). In that case, we considered the scope of a tribal police officer\u2019s authority to stop a nontribal member on the reservation for a traffic infraction under the stop authority given to a \u201cpolice officer\u201d by ORS 810.410.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We concluded that \u201c[t]he authority of tribal police officers to stop drivers for speeding within the borders of the reservation does not derive from ORS 810.410. Rather, it derives from the tribe\u2019s inherent power as sovereign to maintain public order on the reservation.\u201d <em>Pamperien, </em>156 Or App at 156. A concurrence to the majority opinion would have found that a tribal police officer was a \u201cpolice officer\u201d under ORS 801.395 and was therefore authorized to stop drivers under ORS 810.410. The majority disagreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-5\">\u201cIf * * * tribal officers are \u2018police officers\u2019 under ORS 801.395, then <em>all </em>of ORS 810.410 applies to tribal officers. Such a ruling would have implications far beyond the narrow facts of this case. For example, ORS 810.410(1) allows a police officer to \u2018arrest or issue a citation to a person for a traffic crime at any place within <em>or outside the jurisdictional authority of the governmental authority by which the police officer is authorized to act </em>* * (Emphasis added.) In other words, if the concurrence is correct in its reading of the statutes at issue here, then ORS 810.410 grants tribal officers the right to arrest nonmembers of the tribe off the reservation for violations of state law. While we know of no federal case law forbidding such a result, it clearly would represent a grant of authority to tribal officers far in excess of anything mandated by tribal sovereignty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">156 Or App at 157 n 3 (omissions and emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>In sum, the term \u201cpolice officer\u201d is defined by ORS 801.395 by reference to law enforcement officials of the State of Oregon and governmental entities organized under state law. The context of the use of the term \u201cpolice officer\u201d in the Oregon Vehicle Code confirms that a limiting characteristic of a \u201cpolice officer\u201d as defined by ORS 801.395 is that the officer be an agent of an Oregon governmental entity. Because we conclude that Davino was not an agent of an Oregon governmental entity and, therefore, was not a \u201cpolice officer\u201d within the meaning of the statute, defendant did not violate ORS 811.540 in seeking to elude a \u201cpolice officer,\u201d and the trial court erred in not granting his motion for judgment of acquittal on the fleeing and eluding charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on the resisting arrest charge under ORS 162.315 requires the construction of different statutory text. ORS 162.315 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of resisting arrest if the person intentionally resists a person known by the person to be a peace officer or parole and probation officer in making an arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">\u201c(2) As used in this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">\u201c(a) \u2018Arrest\u2019 has the meaning given that term in ORS 133.005 and includes, but is not limited to, the booking process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">\u201c(b) \u2018Parole and probation officer\u2019 has the meaning given that term in ORS 181.610.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">\u2021 <em>% </em>Hi *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-10\">\u201c(3) It is no defense to a prosecution under this section that the peace officer or parole and probation officer lacked legal authority to make the arrest or book the person, provided the officer was acting under color of official authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">ORS 161.015(4) provides the relevant definition of \u201cpeace officer\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-12\">\u201c \u2018Peace officer\u2019 means a sheriff, constable, marshal, municipal police officer, member of the Oregon State Police, investigator of the Criminal Justice Division of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Department of Justice or investigator of a district attorney\u2019s office and such other persons as may be designated by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">Thus, pursuant to the statutory definition, \u201cpeace officer\u201d is defined to mean any one of a list of law enforcement officials, together with \u201csuch other persons as may be designated by law.\u201d An Indian tribal officer is not one of the law enforcement officials listed in ORS 161.015(4); the issue becomes whether an Indian tribal officer is within the category of \u201csuch other persons as may be designated by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Our construction of the meaning of \u201csuch other persons as may be designated by law\u201d is assisted by the rule of <em>ejusdem generis. </em>In <em>Bellikka v. Green, </em>306 Or 630, 636, 762 P2d 997 (1988), the court described that rule: \u201c[Wjhen the legislature chooses to state both a general standard and a list of specifics, the specifics do more than place their particular subjects beyond the dispute; they also refer the scope of the general standard to matters of the same kind, often phrased in Latin as <em>\u2018ejusdem </em>generis.\u2019 \u201d <em>See also Schmidt v. Mt. Angel Abbey, </em>347 Or 389, 402, 223 P3d 399 (2009) (\u201cWhen * * * the legislature uses a general term in a statute and also provides specific examples, those specific examples provide useful context for interpreting the general term.\u201d); <em>Vannatta v. Keisling, </em>324 Or 514, 533, 931 P2d 770 (1997); <em>State v. Gallegos, </em>217 Or App 248, 255, 174 P3d 1086 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 670 (2008) (under <em>ejusdem generis, </em>a list of specifics gives \u201cfurther definition\u201d to the scope of a more general standard that follows).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">All of the listed law enforcement officers in ORS 161.015(4) are agents of Oregon governmental entities whose authority is \u201cdesignated by [Oregon] law.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Applying the rule of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>\u201csuch other persons as may be designated by law\u201d under ORS 161.015(4) are peace officers of the same type as the listed persons \u2014 persons whose law enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>functions are designated by Oregon law as opposed to some other authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Moreover, that construction of ORS 161.015(4) is consistent with its legislative history. The provision was part of the 1971 Oregon Criminal Code. The definition of \u201cpeace officer\u201d was discussed by the Senate Committee on Criminal Law and Procedure at a February 26, 1971, hearing on the criminal law revision. As originally drafted, the \u201cpeace officer\u201d definition included only the listed law enforcement officials. Senator Anthony Yturri suggested amending the bill by adding \u201cand other such persons as may be designated by law.\u201d Senator Yturri said that \u201cand such other persons as may by statute or the governor be designated as peace officers * * * the legislature still has the power in its wisdom, if it sees from time to time that certain types of individuals should have the powers of a peace officer under certain circumstances.\u201d Tape Recording, Senate Committee on Criminal Law and Procedure, SB 40, Feb 26, 1971, Tape 5, Side 2 (Statement of Sen Anthony Yturri).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">That legislative history suggests that the legislature contemplated that either the legislature itself or the governor would grant peace officer power to additional persons. Examples mentioned in the committee hearings included campus police, liquor control personnel, and Department of Agriculture personnel. Thus, the only mentioned examples of potential \u201cpeace officers\u201d are, like the officers already enumerated in the statute, granted police authority by the State of Oregon, its agencies or municipalities. It is unlikely that the legislature contemplated that the law of another jurisdiction could designate a peace officer for the purposes of ORS 161.015(4). We conclude that a \u201cpeace officer\u201d under ORS 161.015(4) is a law enforcement official who is \u201cdesignated by [Oregon] law.\u201d Any designation of Davino under tribal law is insufficient to qualify him as a \u201cpeace officer\u201d under ORS 161.015(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The question then becomes whether Oregon law does, in fact, designate Indian tribal police officers as peace officers.

Thus, a \u201cpeace officer\u201d is \u201cdesignated by law\u201d when the law enforcement status or functions of that person or the position are specified by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">No Oregon statute supplies that official status or delegates that law enforcement function to tribal police officers. The statutes relating to police officer training and certification include Indian tribal officers as persons subject to training and certification. Under ORS 181.640, the Board of Public Safety Standards and Training and the Department of Public Safety Standards and Training are authorized to provide training for \u201cpublic safety personnel,\u201d to establish procedures by which \u201claw enforcement units\u201d can determine whether \u201cpublic safety personnel meet minimum standards or have minimum training,\u201d and to \u201ccertify * * * public safety personnel * * * as being qualified under the rules established by the board.\u201d ORS 181.640(l)(b) - (d). ORS 181.610(16) defines \u201cpublic safety personnel\u201d to include \u201cpolice officers,\u201d and ORS 181.610(14) defines \u201cpolice officers\u201d to include various employees of a \u201claw enforcement unit\u201d including an \u201cIndian reservation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">But a training certificate is not a designation of official status or a delegation of authority as a \u201cpeace officer.\u201d By analogy, a student of law may obtain a diploma from a law school, but that person is not \u201cdesignated\u201d as a lawyer until accredited by the exercise of judicial authority. A police cadet may obtain training, but is not \u201cdesignated by law\u201d until official status or authority is conferred by operation of law. The training and certification statutes for police officers do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>\u201cdesignate by law\u201d the official status or authority of Indian tribal police officers.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Therefore, although tribal officers share many characteristics with Oregon police, sheriffs, and other law enforcement personnel, the Warm Springs Tribal Police Officers are not \u201cdesignated\u201d by Oregon law as peace officers. Accordingly, Davino was not a \u201cpeace officer\u201d for the purposes of the resisting arrest statute, ORS 162.315, and the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-7\"> The \u201ccontext\u201d of a statute, for the purposes of our statutory construction analysis, includes other statutes <em>in pari materia, </em>that is, other statutes on the same general subject.

It is sufficient to conclude that one limiting characteristic of a \u201cpolice officer\u201d under ORS 801.395 is that the person carries out law enforcement duties for an Oregon governmental entity.
