The judgment states that child is within the jurisdiction of the court, based, in part, on an allegation in the dependency petition that father has a history of assaultive behavior. On appeal, father asserts that that allegation was insufficient as a basis for the court\u2019s jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The state concedes that the allegation that father had a history of assaultive behavior \u201cwas insufficient on its face to state a basis for juvenile jurisdiction and further, that the state failed to prove facts that might have cured the defect.\u201d We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The parties agree that father earlier stipulated to the court\u2019s jurisdiction on a separate and independent basis\u2014 that father did not have sole custody of child and was, therefore, unable to protect child from mother \u2014 and that the case should be remanded for entry of judgment on the basis of that stipulation. <em>See State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. S. A., </em>230 Or App 346, 214 P3d 851 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Vacated and remanded for entry of judgment establishing dependency jurisdiction based on allegation admitted by father.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b663-7\"> Father makes several additional assignments of error, including that he was improperly denied a continuance and that his counsel before the juvenile court was inadequate. Given our disposition of this case, we need not reach those issues. Father also argues that the juvenile court\u2019s order that he submit to a drug and alcohol assessment was also erroneous. That order was based on the allegation of assaultive behavior. Again, given our disposition, we need not reach that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
