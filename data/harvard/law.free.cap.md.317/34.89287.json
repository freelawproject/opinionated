The Board sought mandamus relief in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. The court granted in part and denied in part the requested relief. Because we conclude that the Board was entitled to no mandamus relief, we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">The State of Maryland makes payments to the Contribution Fund established by Maryland Code (1957, 1988 Repl. Vol.) Art. 73B, \u00a7 40, for the purpose of providing Social Security coverage and retirement benefits to certain government employees, including public school teachers. Pursuant to its authority under Art. 73B, \u00a7 39, the Department of Personnel, Division of Social Security, performed audits of payments made by the State, on behalf of Board employees, between 1976 and fiscal year 1984. The audits determined that the State had made payments on behalf of Board employees who were ineligible for State payment of employer costs of Social Security. The audits also revealed that certain payments made by the State for the employer costs duplicated payments made by the State through Maryland Department of Transportation funding separately provided to the Board. As a result of these audits, the Department of Personnel issued assessments against the Board in the amount of $876,399.78.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">On July 8, 1985, the Board notified the Department of Personnel that it was appealing the audit findings and requested a hearing, citing as the \u201capplicable regulatory authority\u201d COMAR \u00a7 17.02.03.01 <em>et seq. </em>The regulations in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>this chapter specifically deal with contested case hearings conducted by the Maryland Department of Budget and Fiscal Planning pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, Code (1984), \u00a7\u00a7 10-101 through 10-405 of the State Government Article. Subsequently, the Department of Budget and Fiscal Planning informed the Board that it had scheduled a pre-hearing conference and a hearing on the Board\u2019s appeal \u201cin accordance with Article 78B, Section 39, Annotated Code of Maryland.\u201d The statute referred to provides in subsection (e), among other things, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-4\">\u201c(2)(i) If an audit of the records of a school system, public library, or educational institution reveals that the system, library, or institution owes money to the Contribution Fund, any delinquent payment may not be collected until:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-5\">1. The school system, public library, or educational institution has an opportunity to appeal the decision to a hearing examiner who shall be appointed by the Secretary of the Department of Budget and Fiscal Planning and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-6\">2. The hearing examiner finds that the funds are owed to the Contribution Fund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">(ii) If the hearing examiner determines that moneys are owed to the Contribution Fund, the moneys shall be deducted from any State funds that would otherwise be paid to the school system, public library, or educational institution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">(iii) <em>An appeal taken pursuant to this paragraph is not a contested case, for the purposes of the Administrative Procedure Act.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">A pre-hearing conference was held on May 29, 1986, with a hearing scheduled for June 5, 1986. At the pre-hearing conference, the Board requested that the hearing be a \u201ccontested case\u201d hearing under the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, with a reporter present. The hearing examiner denied this request.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">On June 4, 1986, the day before the scheduled hearing, the Board, pursuant to subtitle 3 of the Administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Procedure Act, \u00a7\u00a7 10-301 through 10-305 of the State Government Article, presented the Secretary of Personnel with a petition for a declaratory ruling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The petition sought a ruling on a number of matters including the authority of the Department of Personnel to determine which positions are ineligible for State payment of employer costs of Social Security, whether the scheduled hearing was the Board\u2019s sole recourse for challenging the audits, and whether the Board was entitled to a review of the audit and assessment under the contested case provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, \u00a7 10-201 <em>et seq. </em>of the State Government Article.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>On the same day, June 4, 1986, the Secretary of Personnel declined to issue a declaratory ruling, stating that it would be \u201cinappropriate ... to issue a Declaratory Ruling on a matter that is to be heard and decided tomorrow.\u201d The next day, June 5, 1986, at the hearing, the Board requested that the hearing be held in abeyance pending the determination of the issues raised in the petition for declaratory ruling. The hearing examiner denied the request to hold the hearing in abeyance. The Board\u2019s counsel then refused to participate, insisted that the hearing be held in abeyance, and left the hearing. The hearing examiner thereupon adjourned the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">On June 10, 1986, the Board again requested that the Secretary of Personnel rule on the issues raised in the petition for declaratory ruling. On July 8, 1986, the hearing examiner ordered that the Board\u2019s appeal be dismissed, with prejudice, for lack of prosecution. On July 9, 1986, the Secretary of Personnel again declined to issue a declaratory ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">On August 7, 1986, the Board instituted the present action by filing a complaint for a writ of mandamus in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. Named as defendants were the Secretary of Personnel, the Director of the Division of Social Security in the Department of Personnel, the Secretary of Budget and Fiscal Planning, and an administrative officer in the Department of Budget and Fiscal Planning who had served as the hearing examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The Board alleged that the defendants had acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and unreasonably in not granting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Board\u2019s request for a contested case hearing, in refusing to issue a declaratory ruling in response to the Board\u2019s petition, and in refusing to hold the hearing in abeyance pending the issuance of a declaratory ruling. The complaint requested a writ of mandamus compelling the defendants to convene a contested case hearing and compelling the Secretary of Personnel to issue a declaratory ruling in response to the Board\u2019s petition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendants filed a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">After a hearing, the circuit court issued a writ of mandamus compelling the Secretary of Personnel to render a declaratory ruling as to whether the Board \u201cis entitled to a contested case hearing under \u00a7 39(e) of the Article 73B.\u201d The court denied the Board\u2019s request for mandamus relief in all other respects. The Board appealed from this order, alleging that the circuit court improperly denied the other requested relief. The defendants cross-appealed from the issuance of the writ of mandamus compelling the Secretary of Personnel to render a declaratory ruling. Prior to any proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals, this Court issued a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">We shall first address the Board\u2019s appeal from the circuit court\u2019s refusal to compel the defendants to convene a contested case hearing regarding the audit findings. The defendants contend that the appeal and hearing provided for in Art. 73B, \u00a7 39(e), is the exclusive remedy available for the Board to challenge the audits. Since that provision specifically states that the appeal \u201cis not a contested case, for the purposes of the Administrative Procedure Act,\u201d the defendants conclude that the Board has no right to a contested case hearing and that the Department of Budget and Fiscal Planning has no duty to conduct one. Thus, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>the defendants\u2019 view, the court below properly denied the Board\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus compelling the agency officials to conduct a contested case hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">The Board, on the other hand, asserts that the hearing called for in \u00a7 39(e) is not its sole remedy. The Board stresses the underscored portion of this Court\u2019s language in <em>Agrarian, Inc. v. Zoning Inspector, </em>262 Md. 329, 332, 277 A.2d 591, 592 (1971), wherein the Court stated (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\">\u201cIt is well established that a claimant ordinarily must seek to redress the wrong of which he complains by using the statutory procedure the legislature has established for that kind of case, <em>if it is adequate and available </em>and that if he is unsuccessful and wishes aid from the courts, he must take judicial appeals in the manner the legislature has specified rather than by seeking to invoke the ordinary general jurisdiction of the courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">In the Board\u2019s view a hearing pursuant to \u00a7 39(e) is inadequate and inapplicable to an adjudication of its appeal because a \u00a7 39(e) hearing serves the limited purpose of \u201cdeciding whether the Board ... \u2018owes money\u2019 to the State and whether the State is due the \u2018delinquent payments.\u2019 \u201d (Board\u2019s Brief, p. 17). Thus, presumably, the Board views the \u00a7 39(e) hearing as restricted to considering the accuracy of the audit\u2019s calculations. The Board asserts that its appeal raises legal issues beyond the scope of the audit\u2019s accuracy. Specifically, the Board broadly challenges the Department of Personnel\u2019s authority to determine which employees are eligible for State payment of employer costs, to determine that State payments duplicated prior State payments, and to recapture past State payments. Furthermore, the Board claims that a hearing examiner appointed by the Department of Budget and Fiscal Planning would lack the knowledge and expertise to determine these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">In our view, the circuit court properly denied the Board\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus compelling the Department of Budget and Fiscal Planning to conduct a contested case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>hearing. A claimant seeking to challenge an audit must use the procedure established by Art. 73B, \u00a7 39(e). And, under the plain language of that statute, the administrative proceeding \u201cis not a contested case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">We are unpersuaded by the Board\u2019s assertion that \u00a7 39(e) is inapplicable to its claim that the Department of Personnel lacked authority to make various determinations which affected the outcome of the audit. Nothing in the language or legislative history of the statute supports the Board\u2019s view that an appeal under \u00a7 39(e) was not intended to encompass claims of the type which the Board raises. On the contrary, the language of \u00a7 39(e) gives a hearing examiner broad power to determine whether \u201cfunds are owed to the Contribution Fund.\u201d The statutory language does not limit the grounds on which a hearing examiner could conclude that the moneys at issue are not owed to the Contribution Fund. The fact that Art. 73B, \u00a7 39(e), places the hearing under the control of the Department of Budget and Fiscal Planning, rather than the Department of Personnel, makes it entirely reasonable for the hearing examiner to consider questions concerning the scope and exercise of the Department of Personnel\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">In sum, the Administrative proceeding under \u00a7 39(e) covers the Board\u2019s challenge to the audit. Moreover, the Board has cited no other statutory provision, and we are aware of no other provision, which would encompass the Board\u2019s challenge to the audit.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\u201cOrdinarily, where a statutory administrative remedy is provided, it will be deemed to be exclusive.\u201d <em>Sec., Dep\u2019t of Human Res. v. Wilson, </em>286 Md. 639, 643-644, 409 A.2d 713, 716 (1979). As we stated in <em>Oxtoby v. McGowan, </em>294 Md. 83, 91, 447 A.2d 860, 865 (1982): <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number><em>See also, e.g., Muhl v. Magan, </em>313 Md. 462, 480-481, 545 A.2d 1321, 1330-1331 (1988); <em>Quesenberry v. WSSC, </em>311 Md. 417, 424, 535 A.2d 481, 484 (1988); <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Cap. P. &amp; P. Comm\u2019n v. Crawford, </em>307 Md. 1, 13, 511 A.2d 1079, 1085 (1986); <em>Bd. of Ed. For Dorchester Co. v. Hubbard, </em>305 Md. 774, 786-787, 506 A.2d 625, 630-631 (1986); <em>White v. Prince George\u2019s Co., </em>282 Md. 641, 649, 387 A.2d 260, 265 (1978); <em>Agrarian, Inc. v. Zoning Inspector, supra, </em>262 Md. at 332, 277 A.2d at 592. Applying this settled principle to the instant case leads to the conclusion that the administrative remedy provided by \u00a7 39(e) is the Board\u2019s exclusive remedy and should have been followed by the Board.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>\u201cWhere the General Assembly has provided a special form of remedy and has established a statutory procedure before an administrative agency for a special kind of case, a litigant must ordinarily pursue that form of remedy and not bypass the administrative official.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>The underlying concern on the part of the Board seems to be that, absent a contested case hearing at the administrative level, the Board will not be entitled to judicial review of the administrative decision concerning the audits and the moneys due the Contribution Fund. The Administrative Procedure Act, \u00a7 10-215(a) of the State Government Article, provides that \u201c[a] party who is aggrieved by the final decision <em>in a contested case </em>is entitled to judicial review of the decision____\u201d (Emphasis added). The General Assembly specified that the administrative proceeding under Art. 73B, \u00a7 39(e), \u201cis not a contested case, for purposes of the Administrative Procedure Act.\u201d Consequently, the General Assembly obviously intended that there be no judicial review of the \u00a7 39(e) administrative decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The Board seeks a contested case administrative proceeding, instead of proceeding under \u00a7 39(e), so that it will be entitled to judicial review. It argues that it is constitutionally entitled to a hearing which will be subject to judicial review, relying on <em>Criminal Inj. Comp. Bd. v. Gould, </em>273 Md. 486, 500-502, 331 A.2d 55 (1975). Specifically, the Board quotes the following from the <em>Gould </em>case (Board\u2019s Brief, p. 23, quoting 273 Md. at 500-502, 331 A.2d at 64-65):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANQ\">\u201c The Legislature cannot, of course, interfere with the judicial process by depriving litigants from raising questions involving their fundamental rights in any appropriate judi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>cial manner, nor can it deprive the courts of the right to decide such questions in an appropriate proceeding.\u2019 \u201d ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-4\">\u201c[T]his Court, in a long line of cases, has consistently held that the Legislature cannot divest the courts of the inherent power they possess to review and correct actions by an administrative agency which are arbitrary, illegal, capricious or unreasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">As the above-quoted language shows, the doctrine referred to in the <em>Gould </em>case relates to \u201cdepriving litigants from raising questions involving their fundamental rights,\u201d 273 Md. at 500, 331 A.2d at 64-65. <em>Gould, </em>and the earlier cases on which <em>Gould </em>relies, indicate that a legislative attempt to deprive a litigant of judicial review, under some circumstances, is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">In the present context, however, the lack of judicial review of the administrative decision regarding the audit and the moneys owed to the Fund does not involve any constitutional right of the Board. Art. 73B, \u00a7 39(e), reflecting the legislative intent that the administrative proceeding to review the audits shall not be subject to judicial review, has no constitutional infirmity which can be raised by the Board under the circumstances here. The reason is that the Board is a state government agency; it is a creature of the State, an arm of the State.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">State agencies and political subdivisions, \u201cas creatures of the State, have \u2018no right to question the constitutionality of the acts of [their] superior and creator,\u2019 \u201d <em>Baltimore County v. Churchill, Ltd., </em>271 Md. 1, 6, 313 A.2d 829, 832, <em>appeal dismissed, </em>417 U.S. 902, 94 S.Ct. 2594, 41 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>L.Ed.2d 207 (1974), quoting <em>Columbia County v. Board of Trustees, </em>17 Wis.2d 310, 317, 116 N.W.2d 142, 146 (1962). The Court went on in the <em>Churchill </em>case to set forth \u201cthe prevailing rule, that a subdivision or other arm of a state does not, in general, have standing to contest the constitutionality, under either the federal or state constitution, of any act of the state.\u201d 271 Md. at 7, 313 A.2d at 833. <em>See, e.g., State v. Burning Tree Club, </em>301 Md. 9, 18-26, 481 A.2d 785, 789-793 (1984); <em>State\u2019s Atty. v. City of Baltimore, </em>274 Md. 597, 602, 337 A.2d 92, 96 (1975); <em>City of Baltimore v. Concord, </em>257 Md. 132, 138-139, 262 A.2d 755, 758-759 (1970); <em>Duvall v. Lacy, </em>195 Md. 138, 143, 73 A.2d 26, 27-28 (1950). <em>See also Williams v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>289 U.S. 36, 40, 53 S.Ct. 431, 432, 77 L.Ed. 1015, 1020 (1933). Although, as the above-cited cases point out, there are exceptions to this principle, none of the exceptions is applicable to the present case. Consequently, the Board\u2019s argument, based upon an asserted constitutional right to judicial review and the asserted invalidity of the legislative intent to preclude judicial review, must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">As the Board had no right to a \u201ccontested case\u201d hearing, and as the administrative proceeding under Art. 73B, \u00a7 39(e), was the appropriate remedy for the Board\u2019s complaints, the circuit court properly denied the Board\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus to compel the agency officials to convene a \u201ccontested case\u201d hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Our holding above is essentially dispositive of the defendants\u2019 cross-appeal from the issuance of a writ of mandamus compelling the Secretary of Personnel to render a declaratory ruling as to whether the Board was entitled to a contested case hearing. We have just held, as a matter of law, that the Board\u2019s exclusive remedy was the administrative proceeding under Art. 73B, \u00a7 39(e), and that the hearing under \u00a7 39(e) is not a contested case hearing. It would be a useless exercise to mandate that the Secretary of Personnel now render a declaratory ruling on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Apart from our present holding with respect to \u00a7 39(e), however, the circuit court clearly erred in issuing a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Long ago Judge Alvey, writing for the Court in <em>George\u2019s Creek Coal &amp; Iron Co. v. County Comm\u2019rs of Allegany Co., </em>59 Md. 255, 259 (1883), said of the writ of mandamus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ\">\u201c[I]t can only be resorted to to supply the want of some more appropriate ordinary remedy. Its office, as generally used, is to compel corporations, inferior tribunals, or public officers to perform their functions, or some particular duty imposed upon them, which, in its nature, is imperative, and to the performance of which the party applying for the writ has a clear legal right. The process is extraordinary, and <em>if the right be doubtful, or the duty discretionary, or of a nature to require the exercise of judgment, </em>or if there be any ordinary adequate legal remedy to which the party applying could have recourse, <em>this writ will not be granted.\u2019\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-5\"><em>See Bovey v. Exec. Dir., Health Claims, </em>292 Md. 640, 644-647, 441 A.2d 333, 336-337 (1982), and cases there reviewed. The principle that mandamus ordinarily will not lie to control the exercise of discretion has been reiterated by this Court on many occasions. <em>See, e.g., In re Petition For Writ of Prohibition, </em>312 Md. 280, 305-306, 539 A.2d 664, 676 (1988); <em>Md.

Baughman, </em>153 Md. 607, 610, 139 A. 291, 293 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Whether or not to issue a declaratory ruling under the Administrative Procedure Act is clearly a matter of the agency\u2019s discretion. Section 10-305(a) of the State Govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>ment Article states that an agency <em>\u201cmay </em>issue a declaratory ruling.\u201d (Emphasis added). The court below acknowledged, and the Board concedes, that in light of the statutory language, the issuance of declaratory rulings is discretionary. Consequently, it would seem to follow that mandamus will not lie to control the Secretary\u2019s exercise of discretion in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">The Board, while agreeing that mandamus ordinarily will not lie to control the exercise of discretion, relies on cases recognizing an exception to this principle where public officials or agencies engage in \u201carbitrary abuses of discretion.\u201d The Board points to language in <em>State Dep\u2019t of A. &amp; Tax. v. Clark, </em>281 Md. 385, 398, 380 A.2d 28, 36 (1977); <em>Criminal Inj. Comp. Bd. v. Gould, supra, </em>273 Md. at 500-501, 331 A.2d at 65; and <em>State Health Dep\u2019t v. Walker, </em>238 Md. 512, 523, 209 A.2d 555, 561 (1965) (\u201cWhile as a general rule mandamus is not proper to review non-ministerial acts of public officials or agencies, this Court has recognized that such will lie to remedy arbitrary abuses of discretion\u201d). The Board asserts that the Secretary of Personnel\u2019s refusal to issue a declaratory ruling in this case was an arbitrary abuse of discretion, and thus mandamus will lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The cases relied on by the Board, as well as other opinions indicating that, under some circumstances, mandamus will lie to remedy clear abuses of discretion by government officials or agencies, all involve claims of personal rights or property rights of <em>private </em>individuals or entities. It is very doubtful that these cases, and the principle they set forth, have any application to an action for mandamus by one state government agency against another state government official or agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Nevertheless, we shall assume arguendo that the Board would have been entitled to mandamus relief if the Secretary\u2019s refusal to issue a declaratory ruling was a clear abuse of discretion. Under the circumstances, the Secretary\u2019s action was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Preliminarily, it is questionable that the Board was entitled to seek a declaratory ruling under the Administrative Procedure Act. Subtitle 3 of the Administrative Procedure Act, constituting \u00a7\u00a7 10-301 through 10-305 of the State Government Article of the Code, contains the authorization for administrative declaratory rulings. Section 10-303 of subtitle 3 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-4\">\u201cA political subdivision of the State or an instrumentality of a political subdivision is entitled, to the same extent as other legal entities, to be an interested person, party, or petitioner in a matter under this subtitle, including an appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">In <em>Bd. of Ex. of Land, Arch. v. McWilliams, </em>270 Md. 383, 387, 311 A.2d 792, 795 (1973), this Court indicated that the quoted language was \u201cnot ... of sufficient scope\u201d to give a <em>State </em>agency \u201cthe status of an interested person, petitioner, or party, as the case may be____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Even if the Board was entitled to request a declaratory ruling, the Secretary of Personnel still did not abuse his discretion in declining to render one. The request for a declaratory ruling was not timely, having been filed on the eve of the scheduled hearing. Moreover, the issues which the Secretary of Personnel was asked to decide by the declaratory ruling were being raised in the hearing before the Department of Budget and Fiscal Planning. It is a settled principle that \u201c[w]here there exists a pending action presenting an issue, a party to that action ordinarily may not obtain a resolution of the issue by filing a separate declaratory judgment action.\u201d <em>Turnpike Farm v. Curran, </em>316 Md. 47, 49, 557 A.2d 225, 226 (1989). <em>See Haynie v. Gold Bond Bldg. Products, </em>306 Md. 644, 650-652, 511 A.2d 40, 43-44 (1986), and cases there reviewed. While our prior cases applying this principle have involved requests to a court for a declaratory ruling, we believe that the principle is fully applicable to requests for a declaratory ruling under subtitle 3 of the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">The circuit court, therefore, erred in issuing writ of mandamus to the Secretary of Personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART, AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR THE ISSUANCE OF A JUDGMENT DISMISSING THE COMPLAINT.

The Petition for Declaratory Ruling, after reciting the facts leading up to the hearing, sought a declaratory ruling with respect to the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">\u201cA. Whether [the Department of Personnel] has the authority to designate positions as ineligible for State payment of the employer cost of FICA or whether that authority rests with the Board of Trustees of the Retirement Systems of the State of Maryland, pursuant to MD.ANN.CODE, Art. 73B, \u00a7 81(3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">\"B.

Whether, as to Bus Aides, the grant funding instituted in. Fiscal 1982 includes amounts for employer fringe benefits, specifically FICA and retirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-10\">\"E. Whether the auditors' assessments improperly seek to recapture the full amount of FICA and retirement paid by the State on behalf of Bus Aides, despite the fact that the amount of actual \u2018duplication\u2019 of payment is only to the extent of the amount of grant money attributable to the specific fringe benefits: FICA and retirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-11\">\"F. Whether [the Department of Personnel] is entitled to recapture purported duplicated payment of retirement contributions on behalf of Transportation Assistants, inasmuch as the pre-1982 transportation formula never included payment of fringe benefits for those positions and absent any express provisions that the grants</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>paid beginning in fiscal 1982 include funds for such employees\u2019 fringe benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">\"G. Whether the hearing before Richard L.
