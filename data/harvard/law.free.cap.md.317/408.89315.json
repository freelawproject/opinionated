The important constitutional issue presented is whether, under the circumstances of this case, a police officer has probable cause to arrest and search a backseat passenger after observing two marijuana seeds located on the front floor of an automobile. We conclude that relying solely on their proximity, an officer does not possess sufficient cause to believe that a backseat passenger has dominion and control over two marijuana seeds on the front floor of a car.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">Petitioner, Wesley Warren Livingston (\u201cLivingston\u201d), was one of three occupants of an automobile speeding southbound on 1-95, in Cecil County, Maryland. The car was stopped shortly after midnight by State Trooper Lawrence Nelson (\u201cNelson\u201d). Livingston, who was not the owner of the vehicle, was seated in the backseat. Notwithstanding the darkness of the hour, the trooper, with the aid of his 30,000 candlepower flashlight, managed to discern two marijuana seeds located on the right front floorboard of the car. Nelson arrested each of the car\u2019s occupants for possession of the seeds. During a search incident to the arrests, Nelson discovered cocaine and marijuana in Petitioner\u2019s pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">Livingston was indicted for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, possession of cocaine, and possession of marijuana. He moved to suppress the evidence claiming it was the product of an illegal arrest. The Circuit Court for Cecil County denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">Livingston was convicted on all three counts and then sentenced to three years. On appeal, the Court of Special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Appeals, in a per curiam opinion, affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. We reverse, and shall explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">As we recently discussed in <em>Malcolm v. State,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>314 Md. 221, 226 n. 5, 550 A.2d 670, 672 n. 5 (1988), the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the \u201cright of the people to be secure in their persons____\u201d <em>See </em>U.S. Const, amend. IV.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is now axiomatic that Article 26 of Maryland\u2019s Declaration of Rights is <em>in pari materia </em>with the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>E.g., Trusty v. State, </em>308 Md. 658, 661 n. 2, 521 A.2d 749, 750 n. 2 (1987); <em>Potts v. State, </em>300 Md. 567, 576, 479 A.2d 1335, 1340 (1984); <em>Gahan v. State, </em>290 Md. 310, 319, 430 A.2d 49, 54 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">The result of these protections is that a police officer is generally required to obtain a search warrant to conduct a valid search of an individual. Nevertheless, there are exceptions to this requirement, such as when the search of an individual is incident to a lawful arrest. <em>Colvin v. State, </em>299 Md. 88, 98, 472 A.2d 953, 958, <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 873, 105 S.Ct. 226, 83 L.Ed.2d 155 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">In <em>Colvin, </em>we applied the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 94 S.Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973), which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>A custodial arrest of a suspect based on probable cause is a reasonable intrusion under the Fourth Amendment; that intrusion being lawful, a search incident to the arrest requires no additional justification. It is the fact of the lawful arrest which establishes the authority to search, and we hold that in the case of a lawful custodial arrest a full search of the person is not only an exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment, but it is also a \u2018reasonable search\u2019 under that amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4K\"><em>Colvin </em>[299 Md.] at 97-98, 472 A.2d at 957-58, citing <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U.S. at 235, 94 S.Ct. at 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">Clearly then, a reasonable search under such circumstances is predicated upon a prior lawful arrest. Conversely, if the prior arrest is unlawful, the subsequent search and seizure\u2014necessarily derived from it\u2014are also unlawful. <em>Trusty v. State, </em>308 Md. 658, 661 n. 2, 521 A.2d 749, 750 n. 2 (1987); <em>Stanley v. State, </em>230 Md. 188, 192, 186 A.2d 478, 481 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Thus it follows that if Livingston\u2019s arrest is found to be invalid, so too must the search of his person. Because the Fourth Amendment bars the use of evidence obtained through illegal search and seizure,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the cocaine and marijuana seized from Livingston\u2019s pocket must then be suppressed and the convictions reversed. The issue becomes whether Livingston\u2019s arrest for possession of the marijuana seeds was lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">In <em>Berkemer v. McCarty, </em>468 U.S. 420, 439, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 3150, 82 L.Ed.2d 317, 334 (1984), the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe usual traffic stop is more analogous to a so-called \u2018Terry stop,\u2019 ... than to a formal arrest.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968); <em>United States v. Patterson, </em>691 F.Supp. 908, 912 (D.Md.1987). <em>Accord, Pennsylvania v. Bruder, </em>488 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>U.S. -, -, 109 S.Ct. 205, 206, 102 L.Ed.2d 172, 176 (1988) . Therefore, stopping a vehicle for a speeding violation and detaining its occupants does not constitute a custodial arrest. <em>Colorado v. Bannister, </em>449 U.S. 1, 3, 101 S.Ct. 42, 43, 66 L.Ed.2d 1, 4 (1980). Yet such a stop does constitute a \u201cseizure\u201d within the Fourth Amendment. <em>Delaware v. Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 653, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 1396, 59 L.Ed.2d 660, 667 (1979). Thus, it must be reasonable. <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 20, 88 S.Ct. at 1879, 20 L.Ed.2d at 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Committed in the trooper\u2019s presence, the speeding violation constituted a valid reason for stopping the vehicle. More importantly, it served as a valid basis for a visual intrusion into the automobile. <em>Bannister, </em>449 U.S. at 4, 101 S.Ct. at 43, 66 L.Ed.2d at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">The plain view doctrine \u201cserves to supplement a previously justified intrusion, ... and permits a warrantless seizure.\u201d <em>State v. Wilson, </em>279 Md. 189, 194, 367 A.2d 1223, 1227 (1977). Therefore, when the police (1) have a prior justification for their intrusion; (2) inadvertently discover evidence which is in plain view; and (3) immediately perceive that what they have discovered is evidence, they are permitted to seize that evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 455, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 2039-40, 29 L.Ed.2d 564, 584-86 (1971). <em>See Arizona v. Hicks, </em>480 U.S. 321, 326, 107 S.Ct. 1149, 1153, 94 L.Ed.2d 347, 355 (1987); <em>Wiggins v. State, </em>315 Md. 232, 250-52, 554 A.2d 356, 364-65 (1989) ; <em>Liichow v. State, </em>288 Md. 502, 513, 419 A.2d 1041, 1047 (1980); <em>State v. Wilson, </em>279 Md. 189, 195, 367 A.2d 1223 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">The trooper\u2019s use of a flashlight to look into the car did not preclude a plain view discovery, for it is generally accepted that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-10\">[T]he use of a flashlight or similar artificial illumination has been most readily upheld when it has permitted an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>officer to see objects inside a vehicle. When the vehicle was parked or was lawfully stopped on the public way, the courts have consistently held that the officer\u2019s conduct in illuminating the interior of the automobile does not constitute a search.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">1 W.R. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure </em>\u00a7 2.2(b), at 329 (2d. ed. 1987).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Thus, having validly stopped the car and promptly spotted the seeds in the beam of his flashlight, the trooper had probable cause to believe that a misdemeanor\u2014possession of marijuana\u2014was being committed in his presence. But which of the vehicle\u2019s occupants was committing the misdemeanor?</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">In <em>Davids v. State, </em>208 Md. 377, 118 A.2d 636 (1955), we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">An officer without a warrant should not make an arrest for a misdemeanor unless ... the circumstances are such that they would justify a person of ordinary prudence in believing that the suspected person is committing a misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 384, 118 A.2d at 638. In other words, there must be some factual basis to believe that a suspect is a participant in the misdemeanor before he may be arrested. <em>Id. </em>Here, the presence of two seeds on the floor in the front of the car, without more, is insufficient to inculpate Livingston, a rear seat passenger, for possession of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"ASk\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>The case of <em>State v. Leach, </em>296 Md. 591, 463 A.2d 872 (1983), is helpful in interpreting the possession statute under which Livingston was arrested.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Leach, </em>two brothers, Michael and Stephen Leach, were arrested for possession of phencyclidine (PCP). The PCP was found in a bedroom in an apartment owned and occupied by Michael. Stephen Leach possessed a key to the apartment and had given the apartment number as his address both to the arresting officer, and previously, to\u00b0the Motor Vehicle Administration when registering his motorcycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Although finding that Michael was the sole owner and occupier of the apartment, the trial court held that both Stephen and Michael were guilty of possession of PCP. <em>Id. </em>at 595, 463 A.2d at 874. The court based its decision on the fact that the PCP was located in, and both brothers had access to, the apartment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">We reversed, holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">\u2018Possession\u2019 means \u2018the exercise of actual or constructive dominion or control over a thing by one or more persons.\u2019 Art. 27, \u00a7 277(s). The statute recognizes, as we held in <em>Henson v. State, </em>236 Md. 518, 525, 204 A.2d 516, 520 (1964), that possession may be constructive. Possession may also' be joint. <em>See Garrison v. State, </em>272 Md. 123, 128, 321 A.2d 767, 770 (1974); <em>Rucker v. State, </em>196 Md. 334, 340, 76 A.2d 572, 574 (1950).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>But the \u2018evidence must show directly or support a rational inference that the accused did in fact exercise some dominion or control over the prohibited ... drug in the sense contemplated by the statute, <em>i.e., </em>that [the accused] exercised some restraining or directing influence over it.\u2019 <em>Garrison, supra, </em>272 Md. at 142, 321 A.2d at 777.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 595-96, 463 A.2d at 874, (discussing the definition of possession contained in Art. 27, \u00a7 277(s)).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Though he had access to the apartment, Stephen Leach did not exhibit a restraining or directing influence over contraband located in a closed container in the bedroom dresser, nor in paraphernalia in the bedroom closet. <em>Id. </em>at 596, 463 A.2d at 874. As a result, he could not be inculpated for its possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Writing for the court, Judge Eldridge further explained the statute in <em>Dawkins v. State, </em>313 Md. 638, 547 A.2d 1041 (1988):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-8\">[A]n individual ordinarily would not be deemed to exercise \u2018dominion or control\u2019 over an object about which he is unaware. Knowledge of the presence of an object is normally a prerequisite to exercising dominion and control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 649, 547 A.2d at 1046.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">The same logic applies to Livingston. Merely sitting in the backseat of the vehicle,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Livingston did not demonstrate to the officer that he possessed any knowledge of, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>hence, any restraining or directing influence over two marijuana seeds located on the floor in the front of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Without more than the mere existence of two marijuana seeds located in the front of the car, we hold that the police officer lacked probable cause to arrest Livingston, a rear seat passenger, for possession of marijuana. Thus, Livingston\u2019s arrest was illegal, and the contraband seized in the search arising out of that arrest must be suppressed. Accordingly, the convictions must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CECIL COUNTY AND REMAND THE CASE TO THAT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY CECIL COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-10\">.
