In addition to chest injuries from the collision, his head was punctured by a snow plow arm which extended outward from the front of the truck. His family sued both the manufacturer of the snow plow and the truck owner who had used the plow without its blade. Because the court found that Rangaswamy was contributorily negligent in causing the accident, his family could not recover on its negligence claim against the truck owner who had used the plow. Contributory negligence is not a defense to strict liability, and a jury found the manufacturer strictly liable for its snow plow design. The issue here is whether the manufacturer may recover from the plow\u2019s user some of the money it paid to the plaintiffs\u2014 even though the plaintiffs could not have held the plow\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>user liable. We hold that the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act (\u201cUCATA\u201d) does not establish a right of contribution under these circumstances. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1957, 1986 Repl.Vol.) Article 50, \u00a7\u00a7 16 to 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Montgomery County (\u201cthe County\u201d) purchased a snow plow made by the Valk Manufacturing Company (\u201cValk\u201d) and had it installed on one of its trucks. On a snowless day in December of 1982, the County drove the truck with the plow device\u2014but without the plow blade. Absent the blade, a steel plow arm extended at least twenty-nine inches from the bumper and radiator of the truck. At trial, one witness described it as a \u201cbattering ram.\u201d According to that witness, the County could have lowered the plow arm in about two minutes through the removal of some cotter pins.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">While travelling along Great Falls Road in Montgomery County, the truck collided with the car driven by Dr. Rangaswamy (\u201cRangaswamy\u201d). Rangaswamy had pulled out onto Great Falls Road from West Kersey Lane and directly in front of the oncoming truck.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a result of the collision, the steel arm of the snow plow penetrated the driver\u2019s window of the car. Rangaswamy suffered puncture wounds in the left side of his skull in addition to chest injuries. He died shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The decedent\u2019s widow and son brought a wrongful death action in negligence against the County and in strict liability against Valk.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Valk filed a negligence cross-claim against the County for contribution. After hearing the plaintiffs\u2019 and Valk\u2019s case, the judge found that Rangaswamy had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>been contributorily negligent in pulling his car into the intersection. Upon motions for directed verdict, he dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 claim against the County and Valk\u2019s cross-claim against that entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">While contributory negligence bars direct negligence claims, the defense does not bar strict liability claims. <em>See Ellsworth v. Sherne Lingerie, Inc., </em>303 Md. 581, 597, 495 A.2d 348, 356 (1985); <em>Anthony Pools v. Sheehan, </em>295 Md. 285, 299, 455 A.2d 434, 441 (1983), <em>aff'g, </em>50 Md.App. 614, 620-26, 440 A.2d 1085, 1089-92 (1982); <em>see generally Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 402A comment n (1965). The plaintiffs therefore pursued the remaining strict liability claim against Valk alleging that Valk should have manufactured a snow plow with a quick disconnect device which would facilitate the removal of the snow plow arm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The jury found that Valk was liable for creating a defective and unreasonably dangerous snow plow design and awarded $2,500,000.00 in damages. Upon the denial of its post-trial motions, Valk appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Among other things, the Court of Special Appeals held that Valk\u2019s cross-claim against the County for contribution had been incorrectly dismissed. <em>Valk Manufacturing v. Rangaswamy, </em>74 Md.App. 304, 329-30, 537 A.2d 622, 634-35 (1988). Noted the Court of Special Appeals, \u201c[t]he facts only established that the contributory negligence of Dr. Rangaswamy precluded his representatives from doing anything about that fault. It would not, however, preclude others from seeking proper redress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330, 537 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>at 635. We granted certiorari to consider whether a right of contribution exists in this case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>[i]f you do not have any quick action coupling on there with a check valve in connection with it, when you take it off it is going to drain all the oil out. So, you have to put a coupling on there that you can disconnect quickly and then you do not lose your oil and there is no big problem. Otherwise you would have to refill the whole hydraulic system everytime that you did not do that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">As early as 1799, the English common law barred contribution among joint tortfeasors. In <em>Merryweather v. Nix-an, </em>8 Term.Rep. 186, 101 Eng.Rep. 1337 (1799), two parties acted intentionally and in concert against the plaintiff. The plaintiff sued one of the parties and obtained full judgment. That party was barred from seeking damages from the non-paying party on the rationale that a wrongdoer should not be able to recover anything as the result of his or her wrongful act. <em>Prosser and Keeton on Torts </em>\u00a7 50, 336-37 (W. Page Keeton 5th ed. 1984). The case did not consider contribution in the context of mere negligence, as opposed to intentional wrongdoing. \u201cIt was not until 1894 that the question was even raised in England in a case of concurrent negligence, and the better English view, even before their statute, appears clearly to have been that contribution is not denied in cases of mere vicarious liability, negligence, accident, mistake, or other <em>unintentional </em>breaches of the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">As in <em>Merryweather, </em>early American courts barred contribution in cases of wilful misconduct. Those courts, however, subsequently extended that bar to negligent conduct as well. <em>Prosser and Keeton </em>at 337. This historical turn of events has been much criticized: \u201cThere is obvious lack of sense and justice in a rule which permits the entire burden of a loss, for which two defendants were equally, unintentionally responsible, to be shouldered onto one alone, according to the accident of a successful levy of execution, the existence of liability insurance, the plaintiffs whim or spite, or the plaintiffs collusion with the other wrongdoer, while the latter goes scot free.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">It is this unfairness which the UCATA sought to remedy. 12 U.L.A. 59, Commissioners\u2019 Prefatory Note to 1955 Version (1975) (\u201cThis act would distribute the burden of responsibility equitably among those who are jointly liable and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>thus avoid the injustice often resulting under the common law.\u201d). The act \u201cestablishes the right of a person liable for damages for an unintentional wrong to compel others, who are liable with him for the same damages, to share in discharging the common liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 59. Created in 1939, the uniform law was later revised in 1955. At least nineteen states have adopted the law, either in its original or revised form. 12 U.L.A. 71 (Supp.1989).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">In 1941, Maryland enacted a modified version of the UCATA. 1941 Maryland Laws Chapter 344. As this Court stated shortly after its passage: \u201cThe primary purpose of the [UCATA] was to create a right of contribution among joint tortfeasors which did not exist at common law ... and to establish a procedure whereby that right might be made effective in practice.\u201d <em>Baltimore Transit Co. v. State ex rel. Schriefer, </em>183 Md. 674, 679, 39 A.2d 858, 860 (1944). Maryland had originally barred contribution among all joint tortfeasors. <em>E.g. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R. Co. v. Howard County, </em>113 Md. 404, 77 A. 930 (1910).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Although the uniform law was later revised, Maryland retained, for the most part, the version it originally adopted. Maryland\u2019s only substantive revision of the Act has been alteration and then abrogation' of the third party practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>provision originally contained in the UCATA. <em>See </em>1957 Md.Laws Ch. 399 (repealing third party practice provision); 1947 Md.Laws Ch. 717 (modifying third party practice provision). Now third party practice in contribution cases is regulated by Maryland Rule 2-332, formerly Md.Rule 315<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The goals of the procedural device, however, remain the same. \u201cThe purpose of the third party practice provided for by the [UCATA] and by the Rules which have superseded it [is] to try in one action all phases of litigation among the original and impleaded parties____\u201d <em>Stem v. Nello L. Teer Co., </em>213 Md. 132, 144, 130 A.2d 769, 775 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">According to the UCATA, \u201c[t]he right of contribution exists among joint tortfeasors.\u201d Maryland Code (1957, 1986 Repl.Vol.) Article 50, \u00a7 17(a). This right is inchoate, however, until one joint tortfeasor \u201chas by payment discharged the <em>common liability </em>or has paid more than his pro rata share thereof.\u201d Art. 50, \u00a7 17(b) (emphasis added). In order for Valk to seek contribution from Montgomery County under the UCATA, <em>both </em>must be \u201cjoint tortfeasors.\u201d According to the UCATA, joint tortfeasors \u201cmeans two or more persons jointly or severally <em>liable in tort </em>for the same injury to person or property, whether or not judgment has been recovered against all or some of them.\u201d Art. 50, \u00a7 16(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">We now consider the meaning of the terms \u201cliable in tort\u201d and \u201ccommon liability\u201d as they are used in the UCA-TA. If they denote mere culpability to the plaintiff for a wrong, then the County might be considered a joint tort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>feasor and subject to contribution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the terms denote legal responsibility to the plaintiff for a wrong, the County is not a joint tortfeasor and is therefore not subject to contribution. The County was held not liable to plaintiffs as a result of Rangaswamy\u2019s own contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">We have previously construed the language at issue in the context of interspousal immunity and worker\u2019s compensation immunity. In <em>Ennis v. Donovan, </em>222 Md. 536, 161 A.2d 698 (1960), the plaintiff sued Ennis for negligent driving. Ennis, in turn, sued the plaintiff\u2019s spouse who had been driving at the time of the collision. We held that because the plaintiff was barred by interspousal immunity from suing Mr. Donovan directly,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the defendant could not sue him indirectly for contribution. We reasoned that the UCATA \u201c \u2018is only applicable to a situation where there is a common liability to an injured person in tort. * * * [TJhere can be no contribution where the injured person has no right of action against the third party defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 540, 161 A.2d at 700 (quoting <em>Baltimore Transit Co. v. State ex rel. Schriefer, </em>183 Md. 674, 679, 39 A.2d 858, 860 (1944)). \u201c[T]he right, if any, of ... the defendant to contribution from ... the third party defendant is a derivative right and not a new cause of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>222 Md. at 539, 161 A.2d at 700; <em>see Krick v. Carter, </em>477 F.Supp. 152, 153 (M.D.Pa.1979) (stating that Maryland bars contribution in the context of interspousal immunity).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">In the <em>Schriefer </em>case which we quoted, we had barred contribution where the third party defendant was an employer who had achieved immunity through compliance with the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. In reaching that conclusion, we relied on the Commissioners\u2019 notes to the 1939 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>version of the UCATA. As quoted in <em>Schriefer, </em>these notes stated that 1) \u201c[t]he common obligation contemplated by this Act is the common liability of the tortfeasors to suffer adverse judgment at the instance of the injured person whether or not the injured person elects to impose it\u201d and 2) the Act \u201cpermits contribution among all tortfeasors whom the injured party could hold liable jointly and severally for the same damage or injury____\u201d <em>Schriefer, </em>183 Md. at 680, 39 A.2d at 860-61. These comments clearly reflect the Act\u2019s assumption that contribution from a third party defendant is predicated on his or her direct liability to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">We have since described that case as holding \u201cthat there [is] no right of contribution where the injured person has no right of action against the third party defendant.\u201d <em>Stem v. Nello L. Teer Co., </em>213 Md. 1 142, 130 A.2d 769, 774 (1957). Similarly in <em>Hatzinicolas v. Protopapas, </em>314 Md. 340, 550 A.2d 947 (1988), Judge Rodowsky, writing for the majority, noted that \u201c[o]ur cases have held that there is no right to contribution from an alleged joint tortfeasor who enjoys immunity as to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, because there is no common liability to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353, 550 A.2d at 954; <em>see generally </em>5 MLE <em>Contribution </em>\u00a7 3 at 548-49 (1960) (\u201cThe Act applies only where there is a common liability to an injured person in tort, and where an injured person has no right of action against a third person, there can be no contribution entitling defendant to join the third person as defendant under the Act, notwithstanding the liability under the Act may be joint or several, since the right of contribution is a derivative right and not a new cause of action.\u201d) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The reasoning of the <em>Schriefer </em>case has been extended by the United States District Court for the District of Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>land to cases of parent-child immunity. In <em>Zaccari v. United States, </em>130 F.Supp. 50 (D.Md.1955), the court held that the defendant could not seek contribution from the plaintiffs father because the plaintiff was barred from suing her father under Maryland law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Schriefer </em>and <em>Zaccari </em>have been relied on by other courts for the proposition that there must be common liability to the plaintiff in order to obtain contribution. <em>E.g. Robinson v. Adco Metals, Inc., </em>663 F.Supp. 826, 831 (D.Del.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Federal courts applying Maryland law continue to sustain this general proposition. In <em>Fischbach &amp; Moore Int\u2019l v. Crane Barge R-14, </em>476 F.Supp. 282 (D.Md.1979), <em>aff'd, </em>632 F.2d 1123 (4th Cir.1980), the lower court noted that \u201cany entitlement to contribution which a concurrent wrongdoer may have from another culpable party arises from the duty each of the wrongdoers owes to the injured party, as opposed to no obligation running among themselves.\u201d This point was later reiterated in <em>Pyramid Condominium Ass\u2019n v. Morgan, </em>606 F.Supp. 592 (D.Md.1985): \u201cWhen a plaintiff has no right of action against a third party, there can be no contribution entitling the defendant to join the third party as a defendant under the Uniform Act, notwithstanding the fact that liability under the Act may be joint or several.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The majority of UCATA jurisdictions have barred contribution where interspousal or parent-child immunity exists. <em>Welter v. Curry, </em>260 Ark. 287, 539 S.W.2d 264 (1976) (parent-child immunity); <em>Short Line, Inc. v. Perez, </em>238 A.2d 341 (Del.1968) (interspousal immunity); <em>Strahorn v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>50 Del. 50, 123 A.2d 107 (1956) (parent-child immunity); <em>Rodgers v. Galindo, </em>68 N.M. 215, 360 P.2d 400 (1961) (interspousal immunity), <em>overruled on other </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number><em>grounds, Maestas v. Overton, </em>87 N.M. 213, 531 P.2d 947, 948 (1975); <em>Lee v. Mowett Sales Co., </em>316 N.C. 489, 342 S.E.2d 882, 883 (1986) (parent-child immunity); <em>Moler v. Quality Chevrolet, Inc., </em>2 Ohio App.3d 120, 440 N.E.2d 1228, 1229 (1981) (interspousal immunity), <em>overruled on other grounds, Shearer v. Shearer, </em>18 Ohio St.3d 94, 480 N.E.2d 388 (1985); Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 29-11-102(a) (1980) (barring contribution in the context of immunities);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>see Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Westerlind, </em>374 Mass. 524, 373 N.E.2d 957, 959 (1978) (barring contribution under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act on the rationale that the language of the UCATA \u201crequires that the potential contributor be directly liable to the plaintiff.\u201d); <em>Burmeister v. Youngstrom, </em>81 S.D. 578, 139 N.W.2d 226 (1965) (barring contribution in the context of a guest statute by reasoning which strongly suggests that the same would be true for any immunity). In concluding that contribution is barred due to immunity, these states typically rely on the Commissioners\u2019 notes, the Act\u2019s specific language and its purpose to prevent the whim of the plaintiff from determining who bears the cost of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">In sum, the \u201ctraditional view is that there can be no contribution between concurrent tortfeasors unless they share a \u2018common legal liability\u2019 toward the plaintiff____ The contribution action arises from the original obligation that the party cast in contribution owed to the plaintiff.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number><em>Simeon v. T. Smith &amp; Son, Inc., </em>852 F.2d 1421, 1434 (5th Cir.1988) (barring contribution due to immunity arising out of Jones Act), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Lumar Marine, Inc. v. Simeon, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 109 S.Ct. 3156, 104 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Immunities, however, are on the wane. And just as courts have become increasingly reluctant to bar a plaintiffs cause of action, so are they reluctant to bar contribution among unintentional wrongdoers.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Four UCATA jurisdictions have allowed contribution despite family immunity. <em>Paoli v. Shor, </em>345 So.2d 789, 790 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1977), <em>aff'd, </em>353 So.2d 825, 826 (Fla.1977); <em>Campo v. Taboada, </em>68 Haw. 505, 720 P.2d 181, 183 (1986); <em>Puller v. Puller, </em>380 Pa. 219, 110 A.2d 175, 177 (1955); <em>Zarrella v. Miller, </em>100 R.I. 545, 217 A.2d 673, 675 (1966). These jurisdictions do not primarily rely on the language of the UCATA or the Commissioners\u2019 notes. Instead, these jurisdictions focus on the policies underlying immunity, while relying on precedent predating the UCATA,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> not commenting on past precedent,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or attempting to distinguish contrary holdings under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>worker\u2019s compensation law.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">In sum, family immunity is held to be a bar to contribution in the majority of IJCATA jurisdictions which have considered the issue.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Like intrafamily immunity, contributory negligence bars recovery against wrongdoers.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> But, whereas intrafamily immunity arises from the status of the wrongdoer, contributory negligence arises from the tortious actions of the injured. We now consider cases that have directly reviewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>the availability of contribution in the context of contributory negligence, as opposed to family immunities.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">This issue has frequently arisen in the past in the context of the Federal Employees Liability Act (\u201cFELA\u201d). \u201c[I]n FELA suits contributory negligence is not available as a defense against a plaintiff and is allowed only in mitigation of damages. Nonetheless, the third party defendant may assert plaintiffs contributory negligence as a bar to any recovery on the third party claim.\u201d 6 Wright and Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 1455 at 30 (1971). Thus courts have barred contribution against a third party defendant who has the defense of contributory n\u00e9gligence. <em>Kennedy v. Pennsylvania R.R. Co., </em>282 F.2d 705, 708-09 (3rd Cir.1960); <em>Fort Worth &amp; Denver Ry. Co. v. Threadgill, </em>228 F.2d 307, 312 (5th Cir.1955); <em>Reynolds v. Southern Ry.

As Professors Prosser and Keeton have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>summed it up: \u201cIf there was never any liability [to the plaintiff], as where the contribution defendant has the defense of family immunity, assumption of risk, or the application of an automobile guest statute, or the substitution of workers\u2019 compensation for common law liability, then there is no liability for contribution.\u201d <em>Prosser &amp; Keeton on the Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 50 at 339-40 (W. Page Keeton 5th ed. 1984). This position has been specifically adopted by the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 886A &amp; comment g (1979).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">In conclusion, contribution under the UCATA as enacted in Maryland is predicated on a wrongdoer\u2019s direct liability to the plaintiff. Where the law, as in this case, shields one of two wrongdoers with the defense of contributory negligence, the UCATA does not currently remove that shield. In the future, the legislature may allow contribution either by altering the UCATA or by abrogating or limiting such shields as contributory negligence.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>See Harrison v. Montgomery County Bd. of Educ., </em>295 Md. 442, 456 A.2d 894 (1983) (noting that it is for the legislature to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>determine whether the defense of contributory negligence should be abrogated in Maryland).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">But until that time, we are bound to abide by the statute as it is written. Under the statute, contribution is available only among joint tortfeasors. A joint tortfeasor must be legally responsible to the plaintiff for his or her injuries. Here the County was not liable to the plaintiffs and therefore is not a joint tortfeasor subject to contribution. Thus, the trial court properly dismissed Valk\u2019s cross-claim against the County for contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REINSTATING THE CROSS-CLAIM REVERSED.
