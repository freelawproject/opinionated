The State, approaching the statute\u2019s construction from a technical, double jeopardy standpoint, contends that each separate guilty finding on a count charging an infamous crime for which a separate sentence could be imposed is a \u201cconviction\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 3-4(c). Appellee, Tommie Broadwater, Jr. (Broadwater), emphasizing rehabilitation of first time offenders as the legislative purpose, contends that the criminal proceeding in which there is adjudication of guilt and sentencing is the \u201cconviction\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 3-4(c). Based primarily on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>the legislative history of the section and on the social history immediately surrounding its enactment, we hold that Broadwater\u2019s construction is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">The federal grand jury for the District of Maryland in April 1983 charged Broadwater jointly with one or more other co-conspirators in five counts of a six count indictment. Count I alleged that the conspiracy operated from January 1983 until March 6, 1983, that co-defendants would illegally acquire United States food stamp coupons, paying approximately forty percent of their face value, that the stamps would be delivered to Broadwater who paid approximately sixty percent of the face value, and that Broadwater would cause the coupons to be processed through certain businesses, wholly or partially owned by him, for redemption by the United States and the Department of Agriculture at face value. Overt acts alleged in furtherance of the conspiracy were illegal transfers of specified face value amounts of food stamps to Broadwater on specified occasions, namely, $10,000 in face value of stamps on January 21, $15,035 on February 1, $20,000 on February 20, and $25,000 on March 6. Counts II through V of the indictment alleged that Broadwater, as to each overt act, unlawfully, acquired, possessed and used food stamp coupons in a manner not authorized under the laws of the United States in violation of 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2024(b) (1982). A jury found Broadwater guilty on each of the five counts against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The court in October 1983 imposed split, concurrent sentences on each of the five counts, <em>i.e., </em>six months confinement, two and one-half years imprisonment suspended, and four years probation, with fines of $10,000 on each of Counts I and II. The court further ordered restitution of $18,420 and 1,000 hours of community service.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">\u201cJUDGMENT AS TO DEF. T. BROADWATER: The defendant is hereby committed to the custody of the Attorney General or his authorized representative for imprisonment for a period of three (3) years as to each of Count Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, and fined the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>sum of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) as to Counts No. 1 and 2, and on condition that the defendant be committed and confined in an appropriate institution for a period of six (6) months. Said period of imprisonment to run concurrently with each other, making a total period of three (3) years imprisonment and a total of six (6) months confinement. Said fine is to be cumulative as to each of Counts Nos. 1 and 2, making a total fine of Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000.00).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">\"IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the execution of the remainder of the sentence of imprisonment only is hereby suspended and defendant placed on probation for a period of four (4) years as to each of Counts No. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, to commence upon the defendant\u2019s release from confinement upon the following terms and conditions: (1) That defendant comply with all local, state, and federal laws; (2) that defendant comply with the rules and regulations of the Probation Office; (3) that restitution in the amount of Eighteen Thousand Four Hundred and Twenty Dollars ($18,420.00) to be paid to the U.S. Department of Agriculture; (4) that defendant complete One Thousand (1,000) hours of community service at such times and in such manner as is prescribed by the Probation Office.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">As a result of the outcome of the federal prosecution Broadwater\u2019s name was stricken from the registry of qualified voters in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. Broadwater had previously been a member of the Maryland Senate, elected from a district within that county. After Broadwater had served his period of confinement and while he was on probation, he unsuccessfully challenged under the Equal Protection Clause of the Federal Constitution, Maryland Constitution art. 1, \u00a7 12 under which registration as a voter is a condition of initial and continued eligibility for seeking or holding elective office, as therein more particularly set forth. <em>Broadwater v. State, </em>306 Md. 597, 510 A.2d 583 (1986); <em>Broadwater v. State, </em>303 Md. 461, 494 A.2d 934 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">After having fully completed his period of probation, Broadwater attempted to register again as a voter in Prince George\u2019s County. The Board refused his application because of his \u201cCONVICTION OF DISQUALIFYING CRIMES.\u201d Broadwater then filed a complaint against the Board in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. The Attorney General\u2019s Office joined with counsel for the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>in defense of the action by having the State of Maryland intervene as a defendant. The circuit court ordered the Board to reinstate Broadwater as a registered voter and this appeal was noted. We granted appellants\u2019 petition for certiorari prior to consideration of the matter by the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">The ultimate dispute is whether \u00a7 3-4(c) should be read on a micro scale, as the State contends, or on a macro scale, as Broadwater contends. From the textual standpoint, the State argues that for purposes of assessing guilt and, ultimately, of imposing sentence on conviction \u201ceach count of an indictment is regarded as if it were a separate indictment and the jury is required to determine whether to make a finding of guilt on .each count____\u201d <em>Mack v. State, </em>300 Md. 583, 595, 479 A.2d 1344, 1349 (1984). Broadwater points out that conviction has also been said to mean \u201cthat legal proceeding which ascertains the guilt of the party____\u201d <em>State v. Brantley, </em>1 Ohio St.2d 139, 141, 205 N.E.2d 391, 393 (1965), and that \u201cconvicted\u201d has been said to \u201cinvolve[ ] all the necessary proceedings from the charge to the sentence inclusive.\u201d <em>Smith v. State, </em>75 Fla. 468, 473, 78 So. 530, 532 (1918). Not surprisingly, this Court has said that \u201c[i]n today\u2019s usage, however, the meaning of \u2018convicted\u2019 and \u2018conviction\u2019 turns upon the context and purpose with which those terms are used.\u201d <em>Myers v. State, </em>303 Md. 639, 642, 496 A.2d 312, 313 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">The parties also find support for their respective positions in the history of \u00a7 3-4(c). Prior to the general election of November 7, 1972, Maryland Constitution art. 1, \u00a7 2 had provided in part that \u201c[n]o person above the age of twenty-one years, convicted of larceny, or other infamous crime, unless pardoned by the Governor, shall ever thereafter be entitled to vote at any election in this State[.]\u201d The provision first appeared in the Constitution of 1851. See Constitutional Convention Commission of Maryland, <em>Constitutional Revision Study Documents </em>at 642-43 (1968). The proposed constitution which was rejected in 1968 would have authorized the General Assembly to prescribe by law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>disqualifications from voting by reason of conviction of serious crime. <em>See </em>Constitutional Commission of Maryland, <em>Comparison of Constitutions, </em>\u00a7 2.06 (1968). The substance of that proposal was separately presented to the voters by a constitutional amendment proposed by Ch. 368 of the Acts of 1972 and ratified that year. 1973-1974 Maryland Manual at 575. Chapter 368 amended Md. Const, art. 1, former \u00a7 2 to read in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">\u201cThe General Assembly by law may regulate or prohibit the right to vote of a person convicted of infamous or other serious crime____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The provision is now Md. Const, art. 1, \u00a7 4. Md.Code, Art. 33, \u00a7 3-4(c) implements the constitutional authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Pointing to the long-standing constitutional requirement for lifetime disfranchisement (in the absence of gubernatorial pardon), the State views \u00a7 3-4(c)\u2019s legislative implementation of the constitutional change as a careful modification by which \u201cthe General Assembly plainly contemplated a narrow and grudging relinquishment of its unqualified power to deny the right to vote to all convicted felons.\u201d Brief for Appellants at 13. Broadwater sees the constitutional amendment and the enactment of \u00a7 3-4(c) as part of a broad, national trend favoring rehabilitation and opposing lifetime disfranchisement of felons. He reads \u201cin connection with his first such conviction only\u201d to distinguish between first time offenders and repeat offenders so that the premise underlying \u00a7 3-4(c) is assumed rehabilitation after confinement and completion, without violation of condition, of any period of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Close review of the available legislative history supports Broadwater\u2019s analysis. At the 1972 legislative session then Senator J. Joseph Curran, Jr. introduced Senate Bill 239 which, conditioned on adoption of the amendment to Md. Gonst. art. 1, \u00a7 2, would have amended \u00a7 3-4(b) of the Election Code to list as a qualification that the voter was \u201c[n]ot twice convicted of an infamous crime, unless pardoned by the Governor.\u201d <em>See </em>1972 Md. Laws 1722-24; <em>see also </em>1972 Maryland Senate Journal at 141. Amendments to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>the bill were proposed in committee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> One committee proposal changed subsection (b) and added subsection (c) providing that \u201c[n]o person shall be registered as a qualified voter if he has been twice convicted of an infamous crime, unless pardoned by the Governor.\u201d 1972 Md. Sen. J. at 595. An amendment was offered from the floor to strike the word \u201ctwice\u201d and to insert \u201clarceny or other\u201d before \u201cinfamous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 628. The floor amendment to proposed subsection (c) initially failed by one vote, <em>id. </em>at 657, but, on reconsideration, was adopted, <em>id. </em>at 727-28, and the bill was enacted in that form.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Consequently, from the effective date of the constitutional amendment in 1972 until July 1, 1974, \u00a7 3-4(c) produced the same result as former \u00a7 2 of art. 1 of the Constitution in that the statute read: \u201cNo person shall be registered as a qualified voter if he has been convicted of larceny or other infamous crime, unless pardoned by the Governor.\u201d Md. Code (1957, 1973 Cum.Supp.), Art. 33, \u00a7 3-4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">In the 1974 legislative session Senator Blount introduced Senate Bill 57 to amend, <em>inter alia, </em>\u00a7 3-4(c). <em>See </em>1974 Md.SenJ. at 41. Senate Bill 57 was amended in committee and, as amended, enacted. <em>See </em>1974 Md.Laws 1353-54. Set forth below in columns for comparison purposes is \u00a7 3-4(e) as introduced and as amended. The comparison should also be made in light of Md.Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol.), Art. 1, \u00a7 10 which provides \u201cthe singular always includes the plural and vice versa____\u201d Brackets indicate words deleted from the bill as introduced and underlining indicates words added to the introductory form of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>AS INTRODUCED</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">No person shall be registered as a qualified voter if he has been convicted [once] of larceny or other infamous crime, unless he has been pardoned, or [unless] he has completed any sentence imposed pursuant to [his] conviction, including any period of probation imposed by virtue of parole or otherwise in lieu of a sentence or part of a sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"A6X\">AS AMENDED</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">No person shall be registered as a qualified voter if he has been convicted of larceny or other infamous crime, unless he has been pardoned, or, in connection with his first such conviction only, he has completed any sentence imposed pursuant to that conviction, including any period of probation imposed by virtue of parole or otherwise in lieu of a sentence or part of a sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">The word \u201conce\u201d in the introductory version is ambiguous. \u201cOnce\u201d can mean \u201cone time and no more.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1575 (4th ed.1976). But it can also mean \u201cever,\u201d \u201cat some indefinite time in the past,\u201d and \u201cat one time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under the latter meanings the introductory version could have produced endless cycles. If a person were ever convicted of an infamous crime, that person would be reenfranchised upon completion of the sentence. The intent, however, was that the person could be convicted \u201cone time and no more.\u201d The amendment removes the ambiguity and cuts off the endless cycles by providing that eligibility to vote is restored upon completion of sentence \u201cin connection with [the person\u2019s] first such conviction only[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">The State submits that its construction of \u00a7 3-4(c) is supported by a comparison of the title of Senate Bill 57 as introduced with the title as enacted, following amendments. Set forth below are both forms of the relevant part of the title. Once again brackets in the introductory form indicate words deleted therefrom by amendment and underlining in the amended version indicates words added to the introductory form as a result of amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>AS INTRODUCED</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">For the purpose of providing that [no] person may be registered as a qualified voter if he has been convicted of larceny or other infamous crime [, unless] he has (1) been pardoned or (2) completed any sentence imposed pursuant to his conviction, including periods of parole or probation____</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">AS AMENDED</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">For the purpose of providing that a person may be registered as a qualified voter if he has been convicted of larceny or other infamous crime only once and he has (1) been pardoned or (2) completed any sentence imposed pursuant to his conviction, including periods of parole or probation____</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">The introductory form of the title of Senate Bill 57 presents the problem of endless cycles of convictions for infamous crimes with reinstatement as a voter following completion of the service of the sentence imposed. The amendment to the title basically inserts the words, \u201conly once,\u201d to modify \u201cconvicted,\u201d while the same series of amendments was removing \u201conce\u201d as a modifier of \u201cconvicted\u201d in the body of the statute. Thus the title reinforces our construction, presented above, which views the purpose of the amendment to be to prevent multiple restorations of voting privileges following completion of sentences imposed in a series of convictions for infamous crimes, as contrasted with the purpose being to prevent restoration of voting privileges upon completion of sentence imposed for two or more infamous crimes charged, tried to guilty verdicts and sentenced in one criminal proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">Thus, the legislative purpose of the language relied upon by the State concerns the timing or sequence of convictions and not the interrelationship of charges in a multiple count indictment. The \u201cfirst such conviction\u201d does not refer to the lowest numbered count charging an infamous crime on which there is a verdict or plea of guilty in an indictment charging multiple infamous crimes. \u201c[F]irst such conviction\u201d is used in the broader, layperson\u2019s sense of the occasion of conviction of a person who is a first time offender, as opposed to a repeat offender. If a person who has never previously been convicted of an infamous crime suffers a \u201cfirst such conviction,\u201d the eligibility to re-reg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>ister as a voter arises when the first time infamous crime offender has completed the entire sentence imposed on all proven counts for all crimes of all types on the occasion of that \u201cfirst such conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Under our construction of \u00a7 3-4(c) the General Assembly, in effect, left questions of merger, lenity, the nature of factual interrelationships between counts, and the degree of seriousness of multiple offenses to the sentencing discretion of the trial judge. Under \u00a7 3-4(c) no first time offender who has been convicted of one, two or more infamous crimes in the same criminal proceeding can be eligible to vote until that person has served the entire sentence imposed at that proceeding. It is the sentence which reflects those factors when \u00a7 3-4(c) is applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">This construction of \u00a7 3-4(c) is hardly absurd, as the State contends. Indeed, it is consistent with a national trend which was in vogue at least at the time when \u00a7 3-4(c) was enacted. <em>See </em>Note, <em>Restoring the Ex-Offender\u2019s Right to Vote: Background and </em>Developments, 11 Am.Crim.L. Rev. 721, 755-57 (1973). In <em>Richardson v. Ramirez, </em>418 U.S. 24, 94 S.Ct. 2665, 41 L.Ed.2d 551, decided June 24, 1974, the Supreme Court sustained against an Equal Protection Clause challenge a provision of the California constitution which disfranchised a person convicted of any infamous crime. Justice Marshall, dissenting, presented the following survey:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">\u201cThe public purposes asserted to be served by disenfranchisement have been found wanting in many quarters. When this suit was filed, 23 States allowed ex-felons full access to the ballot. Since that time, four more States have joined their ranks. Shortly after lower federal courts sustained New York\u2019s and Florida\u2019s disenfranchisement provisions, the legislatures repealed those laws. Congress has recently provided for the restoration of felons\u2019 voting rights at the end of sentence or parole in the District of Columbia. D.C. Code \u00a7 1-1102(7) (1973). The National Conference on Uniform State Laws, the American Law Institute, the National Probation and Pa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>role Association, the National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, the President\u2019s Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice, the California League of Women Voters, the National Democratic Party, and the Secretary of State of California have all strongly endorsed full suffrage rights for former felons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 83-85, 94 S.Ct. at 2685-86, 41 L.Ed.2d at 587-89 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The State also argues that federal law should control decision of the issue before us on the authority of <em>State v. Rappaport, </em>211 Md. 523, 128 A.2d 270 (1957). Rappaport had been charged with grand larceny in New York where he pleaded guilty and was placed on probation. Thereafter he voted in Maryland elections and was charged here with violating Md.Code (1951), Art. 33, \u00a7 193 under which it was an offense for \u201cany person who shall have been convicted of ... infamous crime, under the laws of this or any other state\u201d to vote at any election in this State. We held that the indictment against Rappaport was correctly dismissed because, applying New York law, there was no conviction in New York. In this case federal law treats each count on which Broadwater was convicted as a separate offense for which a separate sentence can be imposed. <em>See </em>7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2024(b) (1982). But that is the beginning of the problem and not its resolution. The problem of multiple charges concerns the effect of \u201cfirst such conviction only\u201d in \u00a7 3-4(c) on eligibility for reinstatement. That is an issue on which Maryland law controls in a context which did not exist in the period of lifelong disfranchisement during which <em>Rappaport </em>was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The construction which we adopt is also consistent with the rule favoring liberal construction of remedial statutes. <em>See State v. Barnes, </em>273 Md. 195, 328 A.2d 737 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Broadwater additionally argues that his construction is necessary in order to avoid a substantial question of denial of equal protection based upon the difference in treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>between first timers convicted on multiple counts in one trial and first timers convicted on one count in one trial. We do not rest our decision in any way on that rule of construction advocated by Broadwater, and we intimate no opinion on the degree of substantiality of the constitutional argument which Broadwater raised, but which we do not reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The State has moved to strike a reply brief filed by Broadwater to the reply brief filed by the State. Part of the material presented in Broadwater\u2019s reply brief is justified by Broadwater\u2019s \u201ccross-appeal\u201d from the circuit court\u2019s holding rejecting Broadwater\u2019s constitutional argument. Nevertheless, much of Broadwater\u2019s reply brief is directed to the statutory construction issue on which he is undisputably an appellee and on which he was not entitled to a further reply.
