Throughout that time the statute has provided that \u201c[a]n action may be brought\u201d by the Comptroller within a specified number of years from the time the tax is due in order to recover sales taxes. <em>See, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number><em>e.g., </em>Md.Code (1957, 1980 Repl.Vol.), Art. 81, \u00a7 342(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Comptroller asserts that the quoted words are satisfied by a deficiency assessment. The appellee submits that nothing short of the filing in court of an action of assumpsit or of a tax lien will do. The Comptroller primarily bases his construction on the tax statutes as a whole and on a long-standing administrative interpretation which is consistent with opinions of this Court. The vendor rests on the ordinary meaning of the quoted words and on an opinion of the Court of Special Appeals which directly addresses the question. For the reasons hereinafter set forth we apply the Comptroller\u2019s construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">This case began as a garden variety administrative appeal of a sales tax deficiency assessment. Appellee, Digi-Data Corporation (Taxpayer), is a manufacturer of computer peripherals. An audit by the Retail Sales and Use Tax Division resulted in the Comptroller\u2019s levying, on October 4, 1982, a deficiency assessment against Taxpayer for the period May 3, 1979, through July 13, 1982. The Taxpayer timely applied for revision and proceeded through the informal conference and formal hearing administrative levels of review. <em>See </em>Md.Regs.Code tit. 03, \u00a7 06.01.80A(2) and .80C(1) (1987). In October 1985, Taxpayer timely appealed to the Maryland Tax Court which remanded to the Comptroller. While Taxpayer was administratively litigating the deficiency assessment, the Comptroller neither sued Taxpayer nor liened its property. While the matter was on remand before the Comptroller, the Court of Special Appeals decided <em>Osborne v. Comptroller, </em>67 Md.App. 555, 508 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>A.2d 538, <em>cert. granted, </em>307 Md. 342, 513 A.2d 911 (1986), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>308 Md. 322, 519 A.2d 206 (1987).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Am2\"><em>Osborne </em>involved the construction of \u00a7 342(a). It reads: \u201cThe tax imposed by this [Retail Sales Tax] subtitle and all increases, interests and penalties thereon shall become, from the time due and payable, a personal debt of the person liable to pay the same to the State of Maryland. An action may be brought at any time within four (4) years from the time the tax shall be due and payable by the Comptroller in the name of the State to recover the amount of any taxes, penalties and interest due under the provisions of this subtitle, but if there is proof of fraud or gross negligence, there shall be no limitation of the period in which the action may be brought. Proof of negligence amounting to twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the tax due shall be prima facie evidence of gross negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2x\">The parties in <em>Osborne </em>agreed, as do the parties here, that sales taxes become due and are payable to the Comptroller before the twenty-first day of each calendar month by any vendor who, in the preceding calendar month, made any taxable sale at retail. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 335, 337 and 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">Osborne had conducted business as a sole proprietor and, in September 1977, transferred the assets of that business to a corporation of which he was a ninety-six percent owner. In July 1978, the Comptroller assessed the corporation for the period August 1, 1975, through August 31, 1977, on the theory that the corporation had successor liability for taxes due by the sole proprietorship. That assessment became final against the corporation which was bankrupt. In January 1979, the Comptroller assessed Osborne as a principal officer of the successor corporation, thereby asserting a double derivative theory of liability for the tax due prior to September 1977 by Osborne as a sole proprietor. Osborne challenged the assessment and claimed that, since liability was being asserted against him as an officer, he had been entitled to notice at the same time as the corporation. Eventually that assessment reached the Court of Special Appeals which in an unreported opinion of January 1983 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>held that Osborne should have been given an opportunity to be heard on the merits concerning the assessment levied against the corporation. Following remand, the Comptroller, in December 1983, for the first time assessed Osborne, individually, on the theory that he, as sole proprietor, was the vendor. It is the December 1983 assessment which was before the Court of Special Appeals in the reported version of <em>Osborne. </em>While the parties in <em>Osborne </em>were climbing up, and being knocked back down, the procedural ladder, the Comptroller had neither sued nor liened to collect from Osborne individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">The Court of Special Appeals held that the four-year period set forth in \u00a7 342(a), during which \u201c[a]n action may be brought at any time,\u201d is satisfied only by an action of assumpsit, which is expressly recognized as a tax collection remedy in \u00a7 206(a), or by establishing the lien which is authorized by \u00a7 342(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In explaining its conclusion that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>deficiency assessment did not stop the running of the four-year period, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-4\">\u201cFairly read, we think that the \u2018action\u2019 referred to in \u00a7 342(a)\u2014the one that must be brought within four years\u2014can include either the assumpsit action provided for in \u00a7 206 or the filing of a lien under \u00a7 342(b). Both of those proceedings are peculiarly directed at actually \u2018recovering] the amount of any taxes, penalties and interest due under the provisions of this subtitle,\u2019 which is the sole focus of \u00a7 342(a), and both are routinely brought \u2018in the name of the State,\u2019 as required by the statute. We do not, however, regard the mere \u2018filing,\u2019 \u2018levying,\u2019 or \u2018recording\u2019 of an assessment as the equivalent of an \u2018action\u2019 to \u2018recover\u2019 the taxes, notwithstanding that the Comptroller has long adopted that approach. Although a longstanding construction of a statute by executive or administrative officials charged with implementing it is \u2018a strong, persuasive influence in determining the judicial construction ... \u201c[n]o custom, however venerable, can nullify the plain meaning and purpose of a statute.\u201d \u2019 ... Given the contextual meaning of \u2018assessment\u2019 in the Retail Sales Tax Act, we see nothing in the law reasonably supporting the Comptroller\u2019s view that the recording of an assessment constitutes an \u2018action\u2019 under \u00a7 342(a). The assessment, as we said, is merely the Comptroller\u2019s ascertainment of what is due, and, while that is certainly a prerequisite to the recovery of the tax, the assessment is not, itself, directed at recovery or collection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">67 Md.App. at 564-65, 508 A.2d at 543 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The court then rejected the argument that its construction was \u201cabsurd\u201d or created administrative hardships. In significant part that rejection reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\">\u201cThe delay in this case strikes us as an extraordinary one, nearly all of which was due to the Comptroller\u2019s initial attempt to pursue Osborne solely in his double-derivative capacity as an officer of a \u2018successor to vendor\u2019 rather than as the person directly responsible. Moreover, we see no reason why, in the unusual case, the Comptroller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>cannot protect himself by filing either a lien or a lawsuit pending judicial review of the assessment. The lien, it would seem from \u00a7 342(b), can be filed \u2018from and after the time when notice has been given that such tax has become due and payable as provided herein\u2019; that means any time after the Comptroller issues <em>his </em>final decision as to the assessment pursuant to \u00a7 351. That such a procedure may, in some instances, work to the disadvantage of the taxpayer would be unfortunate, but the law, we think, is clear.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 565 n. 6, 508 A.2d at 544 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">As an alternative ground of decision the Court of Special Appeals pointed out that the Comptroller had not assessed Osborne within four years from September 21, 1977, because the assessment of January 1979 was limited to Osborne\u2019s capacity as a principal officer of the successor corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">We granted certiorari in <em>Osborne </em>only to learn at oral argument that the Comptroller had acquiesced in the distinction made by the Court of Special Appeals between Osborne as a principal officer of the successor and as a sole proprietor and that the Comptroller had abated the assessment. Thus, the Comptroller was attempting to appeal from the portion of the <em>Osborne </em>opinion dealing with the construction of \u00a7 342(a). We dismissed the appeal. <em>Comptroller v. Osborne, </em>308 Md. 322, 519 A.2d 206 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Meanwhile, the parties to this appeal agreed upon the amount of the deficiency assessment and agreed that the sole issue between them was Taxpayer\u2019s contention, rejected by the Comptroller, that the <em>Osborne </em>construction of \u00a7 342 was correct and time barred Taxpayer\u2019s liability. Taxpayer again appealed to the Maryland Tax Court. In an oral opinion by acting Chief Judge William B. Calvert, that agency viewed <em>Osborne\u2019s </em>construction of \u00a7 342(a) to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>dicta.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The agency held that a deficiency assessment was an \u201caction ... brought\u201d because \u201cfrom a practical standpoint ... as basically real estate lawyers, [the <em>Osborne </em>construction] would become a very harrowing experience for property owners.\u201d Joint Record Extract at 75. In the agency\u2019s view the General Assembly intended that the Comptroller would obtain a lien when there was \u201ca known figure that the Comptroller is in fact pursuing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">Taxpayer appealed from the order of the Maryland Tax Court to the Circuit Court for Howard County. That court considered Osborne\u2019s construction of \u00a7 342(a) to be dicta but agreed with the rationale and reversed the Maryland Tax Court. The Comptroller appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. We issued the writ of certiorari on our own motion prior to consideration of the case by the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Fully articulated, the Comptroller\u2019s position is that, although a deficiency assessment alone satisfies \u00a7 342(a), that official must nevertheless collect the tax \u201cby an action at law or a suit in equity\u201d within seven years from the assessment pursuant to proviso (c) of \u00a7 212. That section reads in its entirety as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">\u201cAll State, county or city taxes of every kind for which no other period of limitation is prescribed by this article shall be collected within 7 years after they shall have become due, or else shall be utterly barred; and no such taxes shall be collected after said period; provided (a) that when collectors shall have failed to collect such taxes and receivers or trustees have within said period been appointed to complete the collection thereof, the period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>for collection thereof shall be extended for two years from the time of the appointment of such receivers or trustees, and (b) that any action at law or suit in equity for collection of such taxes or for sale of property to pay the same or for the enforcement of any lien therefor, may, if instituted within the period hereinabove prescribed be prosecuted as if this section had never been passed, and any judgment or decree therein may be enforced or renewed as other judgments or decrees, and (c) that where the assessment of any tax imposed by this article has been made within the period of limitation properly applicable to such assessment, such tax may be collected by an action at law or suit in equity if commenced within 7 years after the assessment of the tax.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Appellee, in addition to embracing all of the reasons advanced in <em>Osborne, </em>submits that the taxpayer who does not wish to have a lien imposed on the taxpayer\u2019s property or defend a collection suit in court, while the taxpayer is pursuing administrative review of an assessment, can give the Comptroller a waiver of limitations which the Comptroller should be willing to accept. Taxpayer also contends that \u00a7 212 has no application because the sales tax is not a tax \u201cfor which no other period of limitation is prescribed by [Art. 81].\u201d \u00a7 212. Since 1982 the \u00a7 212 limitations period has been seven years while the period under \u00a7 342(a) has remained four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The answer to the question presented in this case lies in the legislative, administrative and judicial history of \u00a7\u00a7 342(a) and 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The Retail Sales Tax Act was enacted by Ch. 281 of the Acts of 1947. The model for \u00a7 342(a) (then codified at Md.Code (1939), Art. 81, \u00a7 278(a)) seems to have been a provision of the Emergency Gross Receipts Tax, enacted by Ch. 188 of the Acts of 1935, which was operative from April 1, 1935, through March 31, 1936. That tax statute added to Md.Code (1924, 1935 Cum.Supp.), Art. 56, title, \u201cLicenses,\u201d a number of new sections one of which, \u00a7 72-J, read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>\u201cEvery tax imposed by this Act and all increases, interest and penalties thereon shall become, from the time due and payable, a personal debt from the person liable to pay the same to the State of Maryland, and action may be brought at any time by the Comptroller in the name of the State to recover the amount of any taxes, penalties and interest due under the provisions of this Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">In cases of tax delinquency, \u00a7 72-G of the Emergency Gross Receipts Tax permitted the Comptroller to compute the tax \u201cfrom the best information available\u201d and the Comptroller\u2019s determination was prima facie correct. Under \u00a7 72-H any tax due became a lien, without notice by a public filing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The 1947 Retail Sales Tax Act took the format of the 1935 enactment concerning an \u201caction,\u201d inserted a six-year period of limitations, and combined that provision with an automatic lien.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The precursor of \u00a7 342, Md.Code (1939),</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Art. 81, \u00a7 278, as enacted by Ch. 281 of the Acts of 1947, read in toto:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\">\u201c(a) The tax imposed by this sub-title and all increases, interests and penalties thereon shall become, from the time due and payable, a personal debt of the person liable to pay the same to the State of Maryland. An action may be brought at any time within six (6) years from the time the tax shall be due-and payable by the Comptroller in the name of the State to recover the amount of any taxes, penalties and interest due under the provisions of this sub-title, but such actions shall be utterly barred after the expiration of the aforesaid six (6) years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">\u201c(b) The tax, and all increases, interests and penalties thereon shall be a lien upon the property of any person liable to pay the same to the State for a period of four (4) years from and after the time when such tax becomes due and payable as provided herein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">In that 1947 tax statute \u00a7 281(a) provided that the Comptroller \u201cshall levy a deficiency assessment\u201d against a taxpayer who had \u201cpaid less than the amount of tax due.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aq9\">We can now test for the 1947 legislative intent with respect to the meaning of \u201caction\u201d in terms of the contentions of the parties to this case. Literally the lien contem- \u25a0 plated by former \u00a7 278(b) arose automatically whenever there was a deficiency and even if the deficiency had not been alleged by the Comptroller in an assessment. In the 1947 form of the statute the Comptroller did not have to file a lien to satisfy the \u201caction\u201d requirement because the lien, at least in statutory terms, arose whenever the taxpayer failed to pay all of the taxes that were due. In 1947, \u00a7 212 (then codified at Md.Code (1939), Art. 81, \u00a7 160) contained a four-year statute of limitations and also contained proviso (c) which had been added by Ch. 701 of the Acts of 1941 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>provide an additional four years for the bringing of a collection action \u201cwhere the assessment of any tax imposed by this Article has been made within the period of limitation properly applicable to such assessment. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">When we apply the Comptroller\u2019s theory to the 1947 laws, the sales tax collector, under \u00a7 342\u2019s predecessor, had six years from the tax due date within which to assess and had four years from assessment, under \u00a7 212\u2019s predecessor, within which to have the assessment become final and to file a suit at law. At that same time, under the Taxpayer\u2019s theory, the Comptroller always satisfied the six-year limitations period because the deficiency gave rise to a lien, without further action by the sales tax collector. Thereafter, there would be no period of limitations on a suit to collect because the predecessor to \u00a7 212, including its proviso (c), did not apply. From an original intent standpoint, the Comptroller\u2019s construction is more reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Section 342(b)\u2019s requirement of a public filing for the attachment of a sales tax lien was added in 1949 by Ch. 465 of the Acts of that year. The last sentence of \u00a7 342(b), protecting innocent purchasers of personalty, was added by Ch. 91 of the Acts of 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">In 1957 <em>Topps Garment Mfg. Corp. v. State, </em>212 Md. 23, 128 A.2d 595, came before this Court. The appeal was from a judgment of condemnation on a writ of attachment by way of garnishment under which credits had been seized that were owing to a nonresident manufacturer of uniforms who mailed goods ordered by Maryland residents directly to the purchasers. In stating the facts Judge Hammond said for the Court: \u201cIn 1954 the Comptroller of Maryland wrote several times to Topps, requesting an audit of all Maryland sales during the previous six years\u2014the statutory period of limitations is six years\u2014so that he would have a basis for a use tax assessment.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 25, 128 A.2d at 596-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>In 1960 the Comptroller audited Atlas General Industries (Atlas) and levied a deficiency assessment covering six years beginning with a date in 1954. The basis for the assessment was the absence of statutorily required resale certificates. Atlas pursued administrative review contending that the lack of resale certificates created only a rebut-table presumption of sales at retail and contending that the Comptroller was estopped because tax auditors had not enforced the statutory requirement with comparable vigor in an earlier audit. The matter reached this Court which upheld the assessment. <em>Comptroller v. Atlas Gen. Indus., </em>234 Md. 77, 198 A.2d 86 (1964). In rejecting the estoppel argument Judge Prescott said for the Court: \u201cBy ... Section 342(a), the Comptroller is specifically granted authority to bring an action for failure to pay sales taxes at any time within six years from the time such taxes shall be due and payable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 84, 198 A.2d at 90. This Court then held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-4\">\u201cWe hold that the State is not estopped from asserting its claim for the payment of the taxes herein involved, and, as the action was brought within the time prescribed by statute, the judgment [of the circuit court setting aside the Comptroller\u2019s assessment] must be reversed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AF\"><em>Id. </em>at 86-87, 198 A.2d at 91. Neither the opinion nor the appellate record in <em>Atlas Gen. Indus, </em>indicate that any lien had been filed or assumpsit action instituted within six years from the date in 1954 when the earliest of the taxes assessed would have become due. The reference in <em>Atlas Gen. Indus, </em>to the \u201caction ... brought\u201d necessarily refers to the deficiency assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number><em>Atlas Gen. Indus, </em>cited favorably an opinion in the Eighth Judicial Circuit by the late Judge J. Gilbert Prendergast, <em>Bagby Furniture Co. v. Comptroller, </em>Balto. Daily Record, May 10, 1961, at 3, col. 1 (Balto. City Ct. Mar. 16, 1961). <em>Bagby </em>was an appeal from a deficiency assessment covering the period October 1, 1952 through October 31, 1958. The issue involved resale certificates, the assessment was sustained and there is no indication in the opinion that the Comptroller had ever sued or liened.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">During the week of September 20-25, 1965, the Comptroller audited a liquor store in Salisbury and then levied a deficiency assessment covering six years beginning September 1, 1959, and ending August 31, 1965. That taxpayer appealed to the Maryland Tax Court contending that the Comptroller was estopped because the audit had not been made at an earlier date. The agency, quoting \u00a7 342(a), said that the statute provided a six-year period of limitations and that annual or periodic audits were not required. <em>See Boulevard Beer Delivery, Inc. v. Comptroller, </em>Sales Tax No. 1 (Md.Tax Ct. May 31, 1967). There is no indication in <em>Boulevard Beer </em>that a suit or lien had been filed, in addition to the assessment\u2019s having been levied, within six years following the due date for taxes on sales made in September 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">House Joint Resolution No. 66 of the 1968 General Assembly called for appointment of a special committee to study the sales tax, among others. The reduction from six to four years in the limitations period of \u00a7 342(a) resulted from legislation recommended by that special committee. <em>See Report of the Special Joint Legislative Council\u2014Executive Committee on the Maryland Sales, Use, and Admissions Taxes\u2014An In-Depth Study </em>(1968) (the Report). The Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Baltimore had submitted to the special committee that \u201c[t]he statute of limitations for assessment, audit and collection should be reduced from 6 to 3 years\u201d in order to \u201creduce the expensive and burdensome record-keeping requirements of the present statute.\u201d Report at 39. The special committee recommended that both \u00a7 342(a) and the companion use tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>provision, \u00a7 393(a), be reduced to four years, to coincide with the limitations period of \u00a7 212, except in cases of fraud or gross negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 18. The recommended bill also deleted from \u00a7 342(a) the words, \u201cbut such actions shall be utterly barred after the expiration of the aforesaid six (6) years.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 47. The bill recommended by the special committee was enacted by Ch. 426 of the Acts of 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">From 1969 until 1982 \u00a7 342(a) and \u00a7 212, the latter both in its general rule and in its proviso (c), established periods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>of four years. While the statutes were so aligned one Wilmer Mechlin, on June 8, 1970, brought into Maryland waters a sailboat which he had purchased and federally documented out of state. Almost four years later the Comptroller assessed a use tax to Mechlin.* *<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The notice stated the assessment was for \u201cthe period June 6, 1970 thru June 6, 1970.\u201d The Comptroller revised this notice in October 1974 to correct the assessment period. Mechlin claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u00a7 393(a) time barred the assessment because the April assessment was void and the October assessment was not retroactive. In an administrative appeal the Court of Special Appeals upheld the assessment, agreeing with the trial court that the taxpayer \u201c 'had full notice of the assessment within the time limit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mechlin v. Comptroller, </em>48 Md.App. 242, 248, 426 A.2d 1387, 1390 (1981).

Section 212 deals with county and city, as well as State, taxes. It appears that the 1982 revision was not inspired by the collection of sales or use taxes. The bill which became Ch. 135, Senate Bill 507, was introduced by the chairman of the Baltimore County Senate delegation at the request of the Baltimore County administration. <em>See </em>1982 Laws of Maryland, at 5695.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\"><em>Osborne </em>was decided after the 1982 amendment to \u00a7 212 and before the repeal of Art. 81 in connection with the recodification of parts thereof as the Tax-General Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Following recodification, former \u00a7 342(c) is part of Md. Code (1988), \u00a7 13-1102 of the Tax-General Article (Tax-Gen.). Section 13-1102(a) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-4\">\u201cExcept as provided in subsection (b) of this section [the fraud or gross negligence exception], an action to recover admissions and amusement tax, motor fuel tax, or sales and use tax may not be brought after four years from the date on which the tax is due.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The Revisor\u2019s Note to \u00a7 13-1102 disclaims making any substantive change, indicates an awareness of the Comptroller\u2019s disagreement with <em>Osborne, </em>and in effect leaves the problem now before us for resolution by this Court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">In the recodification former \u00a7 212 is found in Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-1103 which in relevant part reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">\u201c(a) <em>7-year </em>limit.\u2014Except as otherwise provided in this section, a tax imposed under this article may not be collected after 7 years from the date the tax is due.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">\u201c(c) <em>Collection action after timely </em>assessment.\u2014If the assessment of any tax has been made within the period of limitations applicable to the assessment, a tax may not be collected after 7 years from the date of the assessment.

Contrary to the position taken by Taxpayer in the instant matter, this indicates that provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>so (c) of former \u00a7 212 could include sales and use taxes. Section 13-1103 does not contain any words, similar to those which had appeared in \u00a7 212\u2019s introduction, arguably limiting subsection (c) to taxes for which no other statute of limitations is provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">The consolidated treatment in Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-1102(a) of admissions and amusement tax and of motor fuel tax with sales and use tax directs our inquiry to the antecedent statutory limitations provisions for those other taxes. The motor vehicle fuel tax was imposed by Md.Code (1957, 1988 Repl.Vol.), Art. 56, \u00a7\u00a7 135-157. Chapter 714 of the Acts of 1974 had amended \u00a7 154 to add subsection (b), a limitations provisions which closely followed the text of \u00a7 342(a) relating to sales tax. By Ch. 364 of the Acts of 1981 a lien provision, tracking \u00a7 342(b), was added to the motor vehicle fuel tax statutes as \u00a7 154(b). Further, in 1981, the 1974 limitations provision was shifted to \u00a7 154(a) and was amended to add the following definition or clarification: \u201cFor the purposes of this section, the bringing of an action includes the filing of an assessment or the filing of a lien or the filing of any other action provided by law.\u201d Presenting the three enumerated types of action in the alternative manifests the intent that taking any one of the actions would fully satisfy \u00a7 154(a) limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Prior to the adoption of the Tax-Gen. Article, \u00a7 409A of Art. 81, dealing with the admissions and amusement tax, tracked both subsections of \u00a7 342. Section 409A was enacted by Ch. 608 of the Acts of 1985. Section 409A did not embody the definition by way of inclusion found in the comparable limitations provision of the motor vehicle fuel tax statutes. Thus, prior to the recodification of the general tax statutes, of the three statutes requiring an action to be brought within four years from the time when the tax was due, two were silent as to the meaning of \u201caction,\u201d while one expressly included assessments within the meaning of \u201caction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary in defining \u201caction\u201d initially presents as synonyms, \u201c[c]onduct; behavior; something <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>done; the condition of acting; an act or series of acts.\u201d That dictionary next presents the <em>Osborne </em>meaning, on which the instant appellee relies, by saying: \u201cTerm in its usual legal sense means a suit brought in a court; a formal complaint within the jurisdiction of a court of law.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 26 (5th ed. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Despite the fact that minds which \u201chave been trained to think like a lawyer\u201d automatically lock onto the concept of a complaint in court when the terms \u201caction ... brought\u201d are used, it appears that other persons who speak, write and think in the English language do not so inflexibly limit the meaning of \u201caction ... brought.\u201d Those who drafted the Tax-Gen. Article obviously did not consider the definition of \u201caction,\u201d as it appeared in the former motor vehicle fuel tax statutes, to be a special definition which had altered the plain meaning of \u201caction,\u201d even when paired with \u201cbrought.\u201d In Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-1102 that former statutory definition is omitted, and the three taxes (sales and use, admissions and amusement, and motor vehicle fuel) are presented with the same time limit within which \u201can action to recover\u201d the tax must be \u201cbrought.\u201d The Revisor\u2019s Note tells us that \u00a7 13-1102 \u201cis new language derived without substantive change\u201d from the predecessor statutes, described above. Of course, if those drafting the recodification considered that in the context \u201caction ... brought\u201d did not include levying an assessment, there would be a substantive change in omitting the definition which had appeared in the motor vehicle fuel tax statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The historical review set forth above also demonstrates that from the early days of the Retail Sales Tax Act to the present the administrative interpretation of \u201caction ... brought\u201d by the Retail Sales and Use Tax Division of the Office of the Comptroller has been that an assessment of delinquent tax was the bringing of an action by the Comptroller to recover tax due. That interpretation has been applied by the final assessing authority, the Maryland Tax Court. Both the Court of Special Appeals and this Court have accepted the validity of that administrative interpreta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>tion and, although never deciding the question as a contested issue prior to <em>Osborne, </em>have rendered judgments which could only have been correct if the administrative interpretation had been correct. \u201cAlthough never binding upon the courts, the contemporaneous interpretation of a statute by the agency charged with its administration is entitled to great deference, especially when the interpretation has been applied consistently and for a long period of time.\u201d <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>305 Md. 145, 161, 501 A.2d 1307, 1315 (1986). Given the ambiguity in the meaning of \u201caction,\u201d discussed above, the long-standing administrative construction is due considerable deference. <em>See Inlet Assoc. v. Assateague House Condominium Ass\u2019n, </em>313 Md. 413, 432, 545 A.2d 1296, 1306 (1988). The long-standing administrative interpretation is further reinforced by tacit legislative approval of, and acquiescence in, the administrative interpretation by amendments to \u00a7 342. <em>See Palm Oil Recovery, Inc. v. Comptroller, </em>266 Md. 148, 159-60, 291 A.2d 681, 687 (1972); <em>Department of Tidewater Fisheries v. Sollers, </em>201 Md. 603, 615-16, 95 A.2d 306, 311-12 (1953). In this connection the amendment by Ch. 426 of the Acts of 1969, which reduced the limitations period from six to four years is particularly significant inasmuch as this Court had previously expressed the view that an assessment of sales tax made within six years was an \u201caction ... brought within the time prescribed by statute[.]\u201d <em>Atlas Gen. Indus., </em>234 Md. at 85, 198 A.2d at 91. In the 1988 recodification, the General Assembly neither endorsed nor rejected the <em>Osborne </em>construction, but preserved the <em>status quo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">The Taxpayer\u2019s construction of \u00a7\u00a7 342 and 212 also produces an unreasonable result from the standpoint of administrative procedure and primary jurisdiction. The problem with which we are here concerned most commonly arises when sales tax auditors find that the vendor treats a class of transactions as nontaxable when, in the Comptroller\u2019s view, the transactions are taxable. An assessment for the deficiency is made, reaching back to the earlier of four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>years or when sales taxes on the class of transaction first became due. As Taxpayer would have it, the Comptroller unilaterally avoids limitations only by filing a suit or lien.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">The difficulty with Taxpayer\u2019s position is that, in the not uncommon situation where the vendor questions the assessment through administrative and judicial review, there will be dual proceedings. The vendor\u2019s administrative review and the Comptroller\u2019s assumpsit suit or lien perfection will be pending at the same time. In the judicial proceedings, the vendor almost always will have to retain counsel, at least to prevent a default or to attempt to remove the encumbrance from the vendor\u2019s property. Yet, during those proceedings, the court ordinarily should not address the merits of the assessment but should defer to the administrative process. <em>See White v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>282 Md. 641, 387 A.2d 260 (1978). Thus, the dual procedure which the <em>Osborne </em>analysis requires in order for the Comptroller to preserve the vendor\u2019s tax liability increases the expense, particularly for the taxpayer, without accomplishing any purpose other than to satisfy the legal technician\u2019s concept of the plain meaning of \u201caction ... brought.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The primary purpose of all statutes of limitations is to achieve repose after a period of time deemed reasonable by the legislature in light of the competing interests involved. With respect to \u00a7 342(a) the Report tells us that the purpose of the reduction in 1969 from six to four years was to reduce the time during which a vendor was required to retain sales records. The Comptroller\u2019s construction achieves that purpose to the same extent as does Taxpayer\u2019s construction. If the Comptroller has not issued a deficiency assessment, the vendor, at least from the standpoint of sales taxes, may apparently safely discard records for transactions on which taxes might have been due for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>more than four years. If the Comptroller has assessed within four years, then the taxpayer may not safely discard records under the theory of either party because the Comptroller has either satisfied \u00a7 342(a) by the assessment alone, or need only further aggravate the taxpayer by a suit or lien claiming the amount asserted in the assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">For the foregoing reasons we accept the Comptroller\u2019s construction, affirm the assessment and reverse the judgment below. Accordingly, <em>Osborne v. Comptroller, </em>67 Md.App. 555, 508 A.2d 538 (1986), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>308 Md. 322, 519 A.2d 206 (1987) is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HOWARD COUNTY REVERSED.

Rejected by most economists as medieval anachronisms, the taxes were drawn up hastily, with little thought to their exact aims beyond raising money, their economic effects, or the best structures in terms of the desired purposes.
