The award against the Fund was computed under the \u201cother cases\u201d provision of \u00a7 36(3)(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">Teneyck appealed this order to the Circuit Court for Frederick County arguing that compensation for his prior impairment should have been assessed under \u00a7 36(3)(d), a \u201cscheduled member provision.\u201d The circuit court agreed with Teneyck, ordering the Commission to revise the Fund\u2019s liability to $109 for 250 weeks, under \u00a7 36(3)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">This Court granted the Fund\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari to decide whether the \u201cscheduled member provisions\u201d of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act apply to Subsequent Injury Fund awards. For the reasons below, we affirm the circuit court decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">Section 36 of Article 101 declares that \u201c[e]ach employee ... entitled to receive compensation under this article shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>receive the same in accordance with the following schedule____\u201d It then sets forth a number of \u201cschedules.\u201d One of them is \u00a7 36(3)(d), a \u201cscheduled member\u201d provision, which establishes the amount of compensation (computed by multiplying a wage factor by a specific number of weeks) to be paid for permanent partial disability produced by reason of loss or loss of use of certain enumerated parts of the body. Loss of ah eye calls for 250 weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Section 36(3)(j) applies to \u201call other cases of [permanent partial] disability other than those specifically enumerated in paragraph (c) through (i)____\u201d As to these \u201cother cases,\u201d the Commission is directed \u201cto determine the portion or percentage by which the industrial use of the employee's body was impaired as a result of the injury and in determining [that] portion or percentage ...\u201d take into consideration a number of factors and to \u201caward compensation in such proportion as the determined loss bears to 500 weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">Section 66 deals with the Fund. Subsection (1) explains that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-9\">[w]henever an employee who has a permanent impairment due to previous accident or disease or any congenital condition which is or is likely to be a hindrance or obstacle to his employment, incurs subsequent disability by reason of a personal injury, for which compensation is required by this article resulting in permanent partial or permanent total disability that is substantially greater by reason of the combined effects of the impairment and subsequent injury than that which would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone, the employer or his insurance carrier shall be liable only for compensation payable under this article for such injury. However, in addition to such compensation to which the employer or his insurance carrier is liable, and after the completion of payments therefor provided by this article, the employee shall be entitled to receive ... additional compensation from a special fund to be known as the \u201cSubsequent Injury Fund,\u201d created for such purpose, in the manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>described hereafter in this section, it being the intent of this section to make the total payments to which such employee shall become entitled equal to the compensation that would be due for the combined effects of the impairment and subsequent injury resulting in permanent total disability or a substantially greater permanent partial disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-4\">Benefits from the Subsequent Injury Fund hereunder shall not be payable unless the combined effects resulting from a previous impairment and a subsequent accidental injury result in a permanent disability exceeding 50 percentum ... of the body as a whole; and that the previous impairment and subsequent accidental injury is each compensable, as determined by the Commission, for a period of not less than 125 weeks. However, the previous impairment shall be determined as of the date of the subsequent injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The Fund argues that according to these provisions, the compensation it owes Teneyck should be computed under \u00a7 36(3)(j). The Fund asserts that when the legislature enacted the \u201cscheduled member\u201d provisions it adopted a presumption as to the effect the loss of a \u201cscheduled member\u201d has on an employee\u2019s earning capacity. <em>Cox v. American Store Equip. Corp., </em>283 F.Supp. 390, 394 (D.Md. 1968). Believing that the effect on earning capacity caused by the loss of a member can be at least roughly estimated in advance, says the Fund, the legislature decided that it was fair to make those estimates and incorporate them into the act through the scheduled member provisions. In contrast, the \u201cother cases\u201d provision does not contain a similar presumption, leaving the determination of the effect on earning capacity to the discretion of the Commission. <em>Id. </em>In deciding a nonscheduled injury\u2019s effect on earning capacity, the Commission considers various factors including \u201cthe nature of the physical injury, the occupation, experience, training and age of the injured employee at the time of the injury....\u201d Md.Code (1957, 1985 Repl.Vol., 1988 Cum. Supp.), Art. 101, \u00a7 36(3)(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>The Fund insists that when \u00a7 66(1) is invoked, the Commission can and should determine the Fund\u2019s liability with the benefit of hindsight. The Commission must read \u00a7\u00a7 66 and 36 together, considering the criteria of \u00a7 66 in light of the facts surrounding the claimant\u2019s prior impairment to determine the amount of the Fund\u2019s liability. The Fund argues that \u00a7 36(3)(j) is the only section which allows the consideration of the factors set forth in \u00a7 66(1). It contends that the Commission must operate under the flexible approach of \u00a7 36(3)\u00ae so that it can exercise discretion in assessing the Fund\u2019s liability. Although this approach may produce (as in this case) less compensation than that payable under \u00a7 36(3)(d), it could produce more under other circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Teneyck, obviously, interprets the interplay between the subsections differently. He argues that recovery from the Fund is a two-step process. First, the Commission determines whether the claimant meets the criteria of \u00a7 66(1) making the Fund responsible for part of the employee\u2019s recovery. If the Fund must contribute to the claimant\u2019s recovery, then the amount of that contribution is computed by turning to the provisions of \u00a7 36 as is done in any case. The results then depend upon whether the prior impairment is a \u201cscheduled member\u201d or an \u201cother cases\u201d injury. Once the Fund\u2019s liability is determined, no consideration need be given to the factors in \u00a7 66(1). Teneyck also contends that \u00a7 36(3)\u00ae precludes its own use when the impairment is a \u201cscheduled member.\u201d We think Teneyck has the better of the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The contentions of the parties now before us require us once again to explore the murky depths of Article 101. Its often opaque provisions have engaged our attention with some frequency.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we shall once again seek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>to discover and effectuate the intent of the legislature, <em>Rucker v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>315 Md. 559, 564-565, 555 A.2d 1060, 1063 (1989), this time with respect to the relationship of \u00a7 66(1) to \u00a7\u00a7 36(3)(d) and 36(3)(j). Because there is a lack of relevant legislative history, we must rely substantially on the language of the statutes in the context of the goals and objectives they seek to achieve. <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 513-516, 525 A.2d 628, 632-633 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">The purpose of the Subsequent Injury Fund established by \u00a7 66 is to encourage employers to hire handicapped workers. <em>McKenzie v. </em>C.C. <em>Kottcamp &amp; Sons, </em>311 Md. 54, 57, 532 A.2d 703, 704 (1987); <em>Subsequent Injury Fund v. Thomas, </em>275 Md. 628, 633, 342 A.2d 671, 675 (1975); <em>Subsequent Injury Fund v. Pack, </em>250 Md. 306, 308, 242 A.2d 506, 508 (1968). This purpose is achieved by assuring that if an employer hires a worker with a prior impairment, and if that worker suffers a compensable injury on the current job, then the employer is liable only for the subsequent injury and not the \u201ccumulative effect of the prior and subsequent injuries.\u201d <em>Pack, </em>250 Md. at 308, 242 A.2d at 508. The Fund ordinarily makes up the balance, since it must \u201ccontribute to the employee\u2019s compensation an amount equal to the difference between the award payable for the subsequent injury alone and that payable for the second injury combined with the previous impairment.\u201d <em>Anchor Motor v. Sub. Injury Fund, </em>278 Md. 320, 325, 363 A.2d 505, 509 (1976); <em>Subsequent Injury Fund v. Kraus, </em>301 Md. 111, 112, 482 A.2d 468, 468 (1984); <em>see also McKenzie, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Section 66 also establishes conditions that must exist before the Fund is brought into the picture. They are: (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>that the combined effects of the previous impairment and the subsequent injury must result in a permanent disability that exceeds 50 percent of the body as a whole; and (2) that the previous impairment and the subsequent injury are each compensable, \u201cas determined by the Commission,\u201d for not less than 125 weeks. As we have seen, the Commission found the requisite conditions in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">Section 66, then, tells us how the Fund operates and when it comes into play. What it does not tell us is how to compute the amounts payable when the section is properly invoked. As a general rule, \u00a7 36 contains this information. As the Court of Special Appeals has observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">[tjhere are no provisions in Section 66 by which to determine the amount, manner, or method of paying benefits for ... awards made against the Fund; these matters can be determined only by reference to the provisions of Section 36, and the schedules therein contained, setting forth the formula to be followed in calculating the amount of awards due injured employees for ... permanent partial disabilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-6\"><em>Subsequent Injury Fund v. Chapman, </em>11 Md.App. 369, 375-376, 274 A.2d 870, 873-874, <em>aff'd per curiam, </em>262 Md. 367, 277 A.2d 444 (1971). <em>See also McKenzie, supra; Anchor Motor, supra. </em>Section 36, in its introductory paragraph, makes it clear that \u201c[e]ach employee ... entitled to receive compensation under this article <em>shall receive the same in accordance with the following schedule \u201d </em>[emphasis supplied]. Teneyck is such an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Section 36 contains comprehensive provisions pertaining to the computation of awards. It distinguishes between different kinds of disability, <em>e.g., </em>permanent total (subsection (1)), temporary total (subsection (2)), and permanent partial (subsection (3)). Teneyck\u2019s disability is in the last mentioned category. Thus, we turn to subsection (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">That subsection is itself subdivided into paragraphs dealing with types of injuries or impairments. Paragraph (a) makes it clear that \u201c[i]n [the] case of disability partial in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>character but permanent in quality, compensation <em>shall be paid to the employee at the rates enumerated for the periods as follows </em>\u201d [emphasis supplied]. Paragraphs (c) and (d) both deal with flat weekly payment periods for loss or loss of use of specified parts of the body. Paragraph (j) covers \u201call ... cases of disability other than those specifically enumerated ... in paragraphs (c) through <em>(i)____\u201d </em>The statutory scheme and the statutory language combine to persuade us that compensation for loss or loss of use of a bodily member listed in one of the scheduled member provisions is to be calculated by that provision; paragraph (j) only applies, as its language explains, to \u201cother cases.\u201d We intimated as much in <em>Anchor Motor:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\">Section 36 of Article 101 ..., delineating benefits payable to claimants ..., is divided into several subsections which apply to various types of disabilities, the following of which are applicable to this appeal [involving among other things prior impairment by virtue of injury to scheduled members]: \u00a7 36(1), pertaining to permanent total disabilities; \u00a7 36(3) [now \u00a7 36(3)(c)-(i) ], applying to permanent partial disabilities (enumerated injuries); and \u00a7 36(4) [now \u00a7 36(3)(j) ], pertaining to permanent partial disabilities (other, non-specific cases).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-6\"><em>Anchor Motor, </em>278 Md. at 322 n. 1,.363 A.2d at 507 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">The evolution of Article 101 supports our analysis. Prior to the introduction of the occupational disease provisions, currently codified as Maryland Code (1957, 1985 Repl.Vol.), Article 101, \u00a7\u00a7 22-26, and the Subsequent Injury Fund provisions, the article provided, in \u00a7 36, methods for computing awards for compensable impairments. Two methods existed for computing awards in permanent partial disability cases, one using the \u201cscheduled member\u201d provisions, and the other using the \u201cother cases\u201d provision. When the occupational disease sections were added in 1939, the legislature did not introduce a new method for calculating the amount of compensation for these diseases. Except in a few specifically enumerated instances, it intended the \u201cscheduled member\u201d and \u201cother cases\u201d provisions to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>applied as appropriate. Md.Code (1957, 1985 Repl.Vol.), Art. 101, \u00a7 22(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">Thus, by the time the General Assembly introduced the Fund concept in 1945, it was established that an award, for an impairment compensable under Article 101, was to be computed pursuant to the appropriate schedule in \u00a7 36, unless otherwise noted. Nothing within \u00a7 66 indicates that the legislature had any intention of changing the method of compensation laid out in \u00a7 36 for \u201cscheduled members\u201d or \u201cother cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The legislature has been careful to specify which provisions of \u00a7 36 are not applicable to the Fund, when it intends that result. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00a7 36(l)(c) (Fund not involved when certain waiver executed), \u00a7 36(3)(a)(iii) (serious disability provision does not apply to Fund cases),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u00a7 36(3)(Z) (certain survival provisions \u201cdo not apply to the provisions of \u00a7 66\u201d),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u00a7 36(6) (apportionment of permanent disability due in part to pre-existing disease or infirmity subsection not applicable where requirements of \u00a7 66(1) are met). The scheduled member provisions of \u00a7 36 contain no disclaimer of this sort.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Our conclusion is that the provisions of \u00a7 36 mean what they say, in the context of this case. The General Assembly decided that awards for loss or loss of use of certain members were to run for specific periods. That appears to be a legislative determination that the indicated loss or loss of use has a legislatively-decided effect on industrial loss of use. Commission discretion is preempted with respect to that question, when a scheduled member is involved. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>General Assembly made the various \u00a7 36 schedules applicable generally to all compensation payable under Article 101. It did not exclude the Subsequent Injury Fund from the provisions of \u00a7 36(3)(d). We hold that \u00a7 36(3)(d) applies in this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In doing so, we give effect to both \u00a7\u00a7 36(3)(d) and 36(3)(j), <em>see Sinai Hosp. v. Dep\u2019t of Employment, </em>309 Md. 28, 39-40, 522 A.2d 382, 388 (1987) (court should give effect to all parts of a statute, and not render legislative provisions surplusage), and we also carry out another goal of \u00a7 66(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-4\">to make the total payments to which such employee shall become entitled equal to the compensation that would be due for the combined effects of the impairment and subsequent injury resulting in .... a substantially greater permanent partial disability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">As we explained in <em>Pack, </em>the employer pays for the second injury and the Fund pays for \u201cthe balance of the total award, so that the sum of the two payments [will] equal the compensation provided by statute for the combined effects of both the previous disability and the subsequent injury.\u201d 250 Md. at 308, 242 A.2d at 508. <em>See also Anchor Motor, </em>278 Md. at 325, 363 A.2d at 509, and <em>C &amp; P Telephone Co. v.

John T. Clark &amp; Son, </em>20 Md.App. 109, 114, 314 A.2d 689 (1974). So far as Teneyck is concerned, the law of Maryland provided 250 weeks for his prior impairment. The Circuit Court for Frederick County did not err when it required the Fund to pay Teneyck for that impairment pursuant to \u00a7 86(3)(d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

A review of the annotations to Maryland Code, Article 101, reveals how frequently the courts, both state and federal, have been called upon to construe the provisions of Maryland\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. This suggests the desirability of both formal revision and substantive clarification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b689-7\">. The \u201cserious disability\u201d rates apply when an employer must pay a claimant for 250 weeks or more for an impairment resulting from \"one accident.\u201d In Fund cases, the impairment(s) arise from at least two incidents. Thus, the \"one accident\u201d language displays legislative purpose not to impose liability on the Fund in a \u201cserious injury\u201d case. <em>Barbee </em>v. <em>Hecht Co., </em>61 Md.App. 356, 486 A.2d 785 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b689-8\">.

At oral argument, the Fund represented to us that the circuit court\u2019s decision in this case was contrary to the general practice of the Commission.

As was the case in <em>McKenzie, </em>the General Assembly has amended \u00a7 66 (and also \u00a7 36) on several occasions since <em>Barbee, </em>\"but has done nothing to modify the administrative practice reflected in\" <em>Barbee. </em>This factor is \u201calso entitled to weight in our construction of \u00a7 66(1)----\u201d <em>McKenzie, </em>311 Md. at 62, 532 A.2d at 707.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b691-5\">McAULIFFE, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ApX\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">I do not agree that the General Assembly intended to mandate use of the scheduled disability section for determining the degree of previous impairment in Subsequent Injury Fund cases. Section 66(1) of Article 101 contemplates, indeed requires, that the determination of the percentage of industrial disability resulting from the combined effects of a previous impairment and a subsequent disability be made in terms of the disability of the body as a whole. That is precisely what the Commission did in this case in finding a combined disability of 55 percent of the body as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>whole, made up of a 30 percent industrial disability resulting from the previous loss of sight in one eye and a 25 percent disability resulting from the current industrial injury. The majority\u2019s approach artificially, and unnecessarily, deviates from the intended legislative scheme and provides a windfall to the employee. Instead of properly allowing the Commission to determine the actual percentage of previous industrial disability suffered by a claimant, the majority insists upon using a schedule established for an entirely different purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">The schedule set forth in Section 36 serves a useful purpose in avoiding endless litigation concerning the prediction of the extent of industrial disability likely to result from an anatomical disability suffered to a part of the body. However, as useful as the schedule may be in the initial awarding of benefits for the future, it is unnecessary and inapplicable when the task is the retrospective evaluation of a pre-existing disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">In the instant case, the Commission could and did determine the overall industrial disability that the loss of an eye had actually caused to this claimant at the time the current injury occurred. The Commission found that that disability was 30 percent of the body as a whole. The effect of the majority\u2019s decision is to require that the finding of this pre-existing disability necessarily be deemed to be 50 percent of the body as a whole. This is so because the schedule established by Section 36 awards 250 weeks for the loss of an eye, and under the current worker\u2019s compensation law the whole body is measured in terms of 500 weeks. <em>See </em>Art. 101, \u00a7 36(3)(j). Adding the 50 percent pre-existing disability to the 25 percent disability that the Commission found to have resulted from the current injury produces an overall disability of 75 percent of the body as a whole. This is a disability that this claimant does not have, according to the findings of the Commission, and it is a disability that should not be awarded. The majority.has rewritten the findings of the Commission in a manner that I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>believe is inconsistent with the overall intent of the legislature in adopting the Subsequent Injury Fund concept.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">I would reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Frederick County.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
