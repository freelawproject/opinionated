We conclude that, absent special circumstances, giving this instruction after a defendant has objected to it is error.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">In October 1986, Anthony Hardaway was tried before a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on a charge of attempted murder. Mr. Hardaway did not testify at the trial. At the conclusion of testimony and prior to instructing the jury, the trial judge met with counsel in his chambers. At the chambers conference, defense counsel requested that the court not instruct the jury that Mr. Hardaway had a right not to testify and that no adverse inference should be drawn from his failure to testify. The trial judge nevertheless instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>\u201cNow, as you have seen, the defendant himself did not take the witness stand to testify in his own defense. Every individual has that absolute constitutional right not to testify. You must not presume or infer any guilt because the defendant chose not to take the stand to testify.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">When defense counsel approached the bench and made an objection, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">\u201cCourt: \u2018[T]he reason I gave the instruction is because on occasion I have found that jurors comment that they thought the defendant was somehow barred from testifying because he didn\u2019t testify. Now, I know that sounds totally irrational to people familiar with the justice system like lawyers and judges, but the irrationality exists, but I believe the jury ought to be told that it was the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify, rather than the State having or the Court having prevented him from testifying.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">\u201cDefense Counsel: \u2018Your Honor, I don\u2019t think it is important that it is his decision not to testify. It is merely the fact that he didn\u2019t testify. Obviously, I advised my client out of the hearing of the jury, that they were not privy to his right and his decision. He was told he had a right to testify. I am not objecting to the substance of the instruction, merely the fact that you gave the instruction.\u2019 \u201cCourt: \u2018I want to explain on the record why I was giving it, notwithstanding the fact that the defense requested not to give it. It is just a fact of life that sometimes jurors get the wrong impression of why things are done, and that is just one way to dispel one irrational notion. We can\u2019t dispel all the irrational notions of the jurors____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty of attempted murder. After denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, the trial judge imposed a sentence of life imprisonment, suspending all but fifteen years of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed, <em>Hardaway v. State, </em>72 Md.App. 592, 531 A.2d 1305 (1987). Thereafter, this Court granted Hardaway\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, 311 Md. 698, 537 A.2d 262 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Hardaway does not dispute that the trial judge\u2019s cautionary instruction was a correct statement of the law. Rather, he urges us to rule that, as a matter of Maryland law, giving the instruction, after a defendant\u2019s request that it not be given, constitutes error. Hardaway reasons that the instruction may inadvertently harm a defendant by calling to the jury\u2019s attention the defendant\u2019s election not to testify-</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The State maintains that the instruction cannot be improper since it benefits the defendant. The State further reasons that because the instruction must be given at a defendant\u2019s request, and may be given <em>sua sponte, </em>it is not error to give it over a defendant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The Supreme Court of the United States, in <em>Lakeside v. Oregon, </em>435 U.S. 333, 98 S.Ct. 1091, 55 L.Ed.2d 319 (1978), held that giving a \u201cno adverse inference\u201d instruction over a defendant\u2019s objection does not violate the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The <em>Lakeside </em>Court nevertheless concluded that \u201c[i]t may be wise for a trial judge not to give such a cautionary instruction over a defendant\u2019s objection. And each State is, of course, free to forbid its trial judges from doing so as a matter of state law.\u201d 435 U.S. at 340, 98 S.Ct. at 1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">This Court has never flatly addressed the issue in this case as a matter of Maryland common law. In <em>Lambert v. State, </em>197 Md. 22, 78 A.2d 378 (1951), where it does not appear that the defendant requested beforehand that the instruction not be given, the Court held that it was not error for a trial judge to instruct the jury not to infer guilt from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. Nevertheless, <em>Lambert </em>is distinguishable from the instant case in which the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>dant clearly indicated prior to the giving of the instruction that he did not want it given.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Decisions by courts that have considered this issue as a matter of nonconstitutional state law generally fall into three categories. Some cases support the State\u2019s view that giving the instruction over a defendant\u2019s objection is permissible. <em>Harvey v. State, </em>187 So.2d 59, 60 (Fla.App.), <em>cert. denied, </em>194 So.2d 619 (Fla.1966); <em>State v. Baxter, </em>51 Haw. 157, 158-159, 454 P.2d 366 (1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 955, 90 S.Ct. 984, 25 L.Ed.2d 138 (1970); <em>State v. Garcia, </em>84 N.M. 519, 505 P.2d 862, 863 (N.M.App.), <em>cert. denied, </em>84 N.M. 512, 505 P.2d 855 (1972); <em>State v. Goldstein, </em>65 Wash.2d 901, 400 P.2d 368, 369, <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 895, 86 S.Ct. 189, 15 L.Ed.2d 152 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">A second group of decisions suggests that trial courts not give this instruction over a defendant\u2019s objection but holds that doing so is not erroneous. <em>State v. Piper, </em>113 Ariz. 390, 393-394, 555 P.2d 636 (1976); <em>Kimmel v. People, </em>172 Colo. 333, 336, 473 P.2d 167 (1970); <em>State v. Perry, </em>223 Kan. 230, 236, 573 P.2d 989 (1977); <em>Hill v. State, </em>466 S.W.2d 791, 793-794 (Tex.Ct.Crim.App.1971); <em>Hines v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 905, 911, 234 S.E.2d 262 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">A sizable number of cases have held, however, as a matter of state law, that giving this instruction over a defendant\u2019s objection is erroneous.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Russell v. State, </em>240 Ark. 97, 100, 398 S.W.2d 213 (1966); <em>People v. Anderson, </em>153 Ill.App.3d 542, 106 Ill.Dec. 512, 505 N.E.2d 1303, <em>app. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number><em>den., </em>116 Ill.2d 562, 113 Ill.Dec. 304, 515 N.E.2d 113 (1987); <em>Priest v. State, </em>270 Ind. 449, 453-454, 386 N.E.2d 686 (1979); <em>Gross v. State, </em>261 Ind. 489, 491-492, 306 N.E.2d 371 (1974); <em>State v. Kimball, </em>176 N.W.2d 864, 869 (Iowa 1970); <em>Commonwealth v. Buiel, </em>391 Mass. 744, 746, 463 N.E.2d 1172 (1984); <em>People v. Hampton, </em>394 Mich. 437, 438, 231 N.W.2d 654 (1975); <em>State v. Thompson, </em>430 N.W.2d 151, 153 (Minn.1988). <em>See also People v. Molano, </em>253 Cal.App.2d 841, 847, 61 Cal.Rptr. 821 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Several of the cases which hold that it is error to give the instruction over a defendant\u2019s objection reason that, while the instruction is designed to benefit the defendant, it may not always be beneficial. Therefore, if the defendant believes in a particular case that the instruction is not beneficial, he should be able to forego it. This reasoning is typified by the Iowa Supreme Court in <em>State v. Kimball, supra, </em>where the court held (176 N.W.2d at 869): <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>request, in any trial____\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>\u201c[T]he instruction is a comment on defendant\u2019s failure to testify even though it is supposedly for defendant\u2019s benefit and is designed to keep the jury from speculating on the reasons for his failure to take the stand and drawing improper inferences therefrom. There are those who believe the instruction is more harmful than helpful and regardless of how favorably to the accused the instruction may be worded it may inadvertently cause the jurors to consider certain adverse inferences which would not otherwise have entered their minds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">\u201cBecause of the divergent opinions in this sensitive area and as the giving of even a cautionary instruction favorable to defendant may violate the spirit of <em>Griffin v. State of California </em>[380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965) ], supra, we believe it is advisable for us to take a definitive position on this issue. We now hold that such instruction should not be given in any future trial unless it is requested by defendant, and that it will be considered error if it is given, absent such</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>It is clear that the purpose of the cautionary instruction is to protect the defendant in the exercise of his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. <em>See, e.g., Lakeside v. Oregon, supra, </em>435 U.S. at 339, 98 S.Ct. at 1095; <em>Anglin v. State, </em>244 Md. 652, 662, 224 A.2d 668, 673 (1966), <em>cert. denied, </em>386 U.S. 947, 87 S.Ct. 984, 17 L.Ed.2d 877 (1967); <em>Lambert v. State, supra, </em>197 Md. at 28-29, 78 A.2d 381. In fact, the entitlement to have the jury instructed that no adverse inference should be drawn from the defendant\u2019s silence is itself a constitutional right belonging to the defendant. <em>Carter v. Kentucky, </em>450 U.S. 288, 101 S.Ct. 1112, 67 L.Ed.2d 241 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">As the cautionary instruction is a right of the defendant, for the purpose of protecting the defendant, it should, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>like other rights, be waivable by the defendant. The observation by Chief Judge Murphy for the Court, in <em>Rice v. State, </em>311 Md. 116, 129, 532 A.2d 1357 (1987), is applicable here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>\"In some trials, the defendant\u2019s silence will be like \u2018the sun ... shining with full blaze on the open eye.\u2019 <em>State v. Cleaves, </em>59 Me. 298, 301 (1871). But in other trials\u2014perhaps when the whole story has been told by other witnesses or when the prosecutor\u2019s case is especially weak\u2014the'jury may not focus on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. For the judge or prosecutor to call it to the jury\u2019s attention has an undeniably adverse effect on the defendant. Even if jurors try faithfully to obey their instructions, the connection between silence and guilt is often too direct and too natural to be resisted. When the jurors have in fact overlooked it, telling them to ignore the defendant's silence is like telling them not to think of a white bear.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-9\">\"It is unrealistic to assume that instructions on the right to silence always have a benign effect. At times the instruction will make the defendant\u2019s silence costly indeed____the State must have a strong reason for ignoring the defendant\u2019s request that the instruction not b\u00e9 given. Remarkably, the Court fails to identify any reason for overriding the defendant's choice. Eliminating the instruction on request costs the State nothing, other than the advantage of calling attention to the defendant\u2019s silence. A defendant may waive his Fifth Amendment right to silence, and a judge who thinks his decision unwise may not overrule it. The defendant should also be able to waive, without leave of court, his lesser right to an instruction about his Fifth Amendment right to silence.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>\u201cIn <em>[State v.] McKay </em>[, 280 Md. 558, 375 A.2d 228 (1977),] we delved into the fundamental nature of the right to jury unanimity, and whether the right was waivable. We reasoned that the right was not an imperative requirement, but rather existed for the defendant\u2019s benefit; hence, like other fundamental rights, such as those to counsel and to confront v/itnesses, it can be waived.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAE\">As previously mentioned, courts have recognized the possibility that the instruction may not always, in fact, benefit the defendant. The Illinois court stated in <em>People v. Anderson, supra, </em>106 Ill.Dec. at 515, 505 N.E.2d at 1306, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">\u201c[I]t has been recognized that while this instruction is intended to benefit a defendant by cautioning the jury not to infer guilt from his failure to testify, it might, on the other hand, have the negative effect of calling the jury\u2019s attention thereto. Courts have therefore held that the choice of whether the instruction will be used is the defendant\u2019s, and that the giving of it over his objection is error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Since the instruction is a right of the defendant, for his benefit, but because the beneficial effect of the instruction may be uncertain in some circumstances, it follows that the decision whether the instruction is given should lie with the defendant. As stated by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in <em>Commonwealth v. Buiel, supra, </em>391 Mass, at 746-747, 463 N.E.2d at 1173-1174:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">\u201cWe have no hesitancy in announcing for the future that it will be reversible error if a judge instructs the jury concerning a defendant\u2019s right not to testify when the defendant has requested that no such instruction be given. It is difficult to determine whether such an instruction is beneficial to a particular defendant or to defendants as a group. On the one hand, it warns the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>against drawing inferences adverse to the defendant from his not testifying. On the other hand, such an instruction may focus the jury\u2019s attention on the question why the defendant decided not to assist the jury in their fact-finding function. The rule we announce is not constitutionally based. It is simply a statement of the law of the Commonwealth for cases tried after this date that the defendant has the choice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The Arkansas Supreme Court, in <em>Russell v. State, supra, </em>240 Ark. at 100, 398 S.W.2d at 215, explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-6\">\u201cthe instruction ought not to be given against the wishes of the defendant. If the accused is to have the unfettered right to testify or not to testify he should have a correlative right to say whether or not his silence should be singled out for the jury\u2019s attention.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The commentators are in accord. <em>See </em>Green, <em>The Failure to Testify Instruction, </em>14 Willamette L.Rev. 43, 51 (1977):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afs\">\u201cThe most sensible of the various judicial approaches is to allow the defendant to decide whether the instruction should be given in any particular case. The desirability of the instruction is a matter of trial strategy, and will therefore vary from case to case. The purpose of the instruction is to prevent the jury from considering the defendant\u2019s silence as evidence of guilt, and the defendant himself will normally be in the best position to decide whether or not the giving of the instruction will serve this end.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-7\"><em>See also, e.g,, McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 131 at 320 (E. Cleary 3d ed. 1984); Note, <em>Jury Instruction on the Failure of an Accused to Testify: A Defense Strategy, </em>5 W.New Eng.L.Rev. 227, 234-235 (1982); <em>Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions </em>3:17.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">The views set forth above are in accord with the approach taken by this Court generally with respect to defendants\u2019 rights and entitlements in criminal cases. In <em>Jones v. State, </em>297 Md. 7, 16, 464 A.2d 977 (1983), we quoted approvingly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>from the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Dennis v. United States, </em>384 U.S. 855, 86 S.Ct. 1840, 16 L.Ed.2d 973 (1966):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWe\">\u201c \u2018In our adversary system, it is enough for judges to judge. The determination of what may be useful to the defense can properly and effectively be made only by an advocate.\u2019 384 U.S. at 874-875, 86 S.Ct. at 1851, 16 L.Ed.2d at 986....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">And in <em>Curtis v. State, </em>284 Md. 132, 147, 395 A.2d 464 (1978), we stated that \u201c[a] defendant may forego a broad spectrum of rights which are deemed to fall within the category of tactical decisions by counsel____\u201d <em>See also Hagans v. State, </em>316 Md. 429, 455, 559 A.2d 792 (1989) (trial court ordinarily should not <em>sua sponte </em>give a jury instruction on an uncharged lesser included offense, as it is a matter of \u201cstrategy which is best left to the parties\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">There may be special circumstances when giving the \u201cno inference\u201d instruction over a defendant\u2019s objection is appropriate. For example, in a trial of multiple defendants, where one defendant requests the instruction while another objects to it, the constitutional right of the former defendant to the instruction must take precedence. <em>See, e.g., Lucas v. State, </em>499 N.E.2d 1090 (Ind.1986); <em>People v. Brooks, </em>124 Ill.App.3d 222, 79 Ill.Dec. 551, 463 N.E.2d 1326 (1984). Absent special circumstances like these, however, the defendant\u2019s expressed preference should be determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED, AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AND REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY FOR A NEW TRIAL.
