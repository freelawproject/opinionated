He argues that the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress, by increasing his base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) for possession of a firearm during a drug-trafficking offense, by failing to reduce his base offense level under \u00a7 3B1.2 for minor/minimal participant status, and that \u00a7 2D1.1 is violative of the Fourteenth Amendment as racially discriminatory. Finding that the district court committed no error and that Williams\u2019 contentions are unavailing, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-27\">One point is worth some discussion. Williams\u2019 sole challenge to the propriety of the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress is whether a dog sniff can \u201cestablish probable cause in a warrantless search without showing evidence of the dog\u2019s training and reliability.\u201d The following facts, as found by the district court, are uncontested and bear on this challenge. A vehicle driven by codefendant Frank Edward Williams was stopped for a traffic violation by DPS Trooper Washington and his partner. Codefend-ant Danyell Deoneore Waters was a passenger. After initiating background checks on the car and its occupants, Washington observed what he thought were metallic shavings, commonly used in the consumption of crack, on the front floorboard. He then obtained consent (as found by the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>and not challenged on appeal) and noticed during a search of the trunk that apparently the rear seat had been removed. Suspicions aroused by these and other circumstances (including dealer tags on a seven-year-old car and a patchy paint job of questionable quality), Washington called for a canine unit; the canine alerted after sniffing around the right rear quarter panel. The officers then searched the quarter panel and found crack and a firearm. Williams and Waters were arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Williams filed a motion to suppress in the district court contesting the search and seizure of the automobile he was driving which yielded cocaine base. After a hearing, the district court denied the motion to suppress, holding that the traffic stop was legal, the length of the investigatory stop was not improper, the search of the car\u2019s trunk was consensual, and that the \u201cdog sniff\u2019 was based on a \u201creasonable, articulable suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The district court specifically held that \u201cprobable cause for a search [of the car\u2019s trunk] did not exist\u201d before the dog sniff. Williams argued, in the district court, that \u201cthe training and reliability of a drug dog prior to reliance on a sniff test [is required] to justify a warrantless search.\u201d The district court, noting that this court had not addressed the precise issue, found the argument foreclosed by <em>United States v. Daniel, </em>982 F.2d 146, 151-52 &amp; n. 7 (5th Cir.1993), because under <em>Daniel, </em>\u201cthe necessity of establishing a drug dog\u2019s reliability in an application for a search warrant ... was not necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Williams pleaded guilty pursuant to a written plea agreement to conspiring to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base, reserving the right to appeal the denial of the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Williams urges this court to follow <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>25 F.3d 392, 393-94 (6th Cir.1994), which held that the training and reliability of a dog must be established when a dog sniff is used to establish probable cause to search.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">The \u201cstandard of review for a motion to suppress based on live testimony at a suppression hearing is to accept the trial</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">court\u2019s factual findings unless clearly erroneous or influenced by an incorrect view of the law.\u201d <em>United States v. Alvarez, </em>6 F.3d 287, 289 (5th Cir.1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 114 S.Ct. 1384, 128 L.Ed.2d 59 (1994). The trial court\u2019s conclusions of law are reviewed <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">Although there is no authority directly on point, the district court\u2019s determination was not error. The fact that the dog alerted provided probable cause to search. <em>See United States v. Seals, </em>987 F.2d 1102, 1107 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 114 S.Ct. 155, 126 L.Ed.2d 116 (1993). Further, <em>Daniel </em>appears controlling. <em>Daniel </em>held that \u201cDaniel\u2019s theory that an affidavit must show how reliable a drug-detecting dog has been in the past\u201d is without jurisprudential support in this circuit. <em>Daniel, </em>982 F.2d at 152 n. 7. Because a showing of the dog\u2019s reliability is unnecessary with regard to obtaining a search warrant, <em>a fortiori, </em>a showing of the dog\u2019s reliability is not required if probable cause is developed on site as a result of a dog sniff of a vehicle. <em>But see Diaz, </em>25 F.3d at 394 (holding that \u201cto support a determination of probable cause, the training and reliability of the dog must be established.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-15\">Williams\u2019s judgment of conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
