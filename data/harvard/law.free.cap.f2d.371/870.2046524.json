It is concluded, therefore, that applicant\u2019s mark is \u201cprimarily merely a surname\u201d within the meaning of the Act, and hence that it is not proper subject matter for registration on the Principal Register in the absence of a showing that it has acquired in this country a secondary meaning of indicating origin in applicant of the goods to which it is applied. See Kimberly-Clark Corporation v. Marzall, Comr., Pats., [90 U.S. App.D.C. 409, 196 F.2d 772] 93 USPQ 191 (CA DC, 1952).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-17\">In addition to the evidence submitted by appellant as to the meaning of SCHAUB and LORENZ, appellant argues that various city telephone directories<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> do not disclose any listing of SCHAUB-LORENZ. The examiner cites the fact that various city telephone directories<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> disclose listings of SCHAUB and LORENZ individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-18\">Appellant also argues here that the mark has become known and registered in many countries.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The solicitor replies that no evidence to this effect was submitted by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-19\">Appellant also cited Registration No. 386,174 of March 25, 1941, for LORENZ, now expired, as evidence that the mark here is not primarily merely a surname. The examiner replied that registration under the Trademark Act of 1920 does not support registrability on the Principal Register.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-20\">Concerning legal precedents, the examiner and the board relied on the decision in <em>Kimberly-Clark, </em>supra, wherein the court affirmed the District Court\u2019s refusal to order registration on the Principal Register of \u201cKimberly-Clark.\u201d The court in its opinion reasoned that if neither Kimberly or Clark was registrable, as being primarily merely surnames, then a combination of the two could not be registered. Appellant argues this decision is inapplicable here because, unlike <em>Kimberly-Clark, </em>evidence has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>submitted showing that each term has meaning other than as a surname and appellant itself does not use the combination as its corporate name.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Appellant argues the board failed to apply the correct test in resolving the issue of whether the mark is primarily merely a surname, citing Ex parte Rivera Watch Corp., 106 USPQ 145 (Com\u2019r. Dec. 1955). This opinion states the proper test as being, \u201cWhat is the primary significance of the mark to the purchasing public ?\u201d The mark Rivera was held not to be primarily merely a surname. The opinion also comments that an opposite conclusion in <em>Kimberly-Clark </em>might have been reached if the above test had been applied. Appellant argues in its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-5\">In addition to the Ex parte Rivera Watch Corp. case, supra, several subsequent cases held that marks which have different meanings in addition to meaning a surname are registrable. The discussed marks were initially rejected by the Examiner on the ground that the respective marks were primarily merely surnames.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-6\">In Ex parte Omaha Cold Storage Co., 111 USPQ 189 (Com\u2019r., 1956), the applicant\u2019s mark \u201cDouglas\u201d was held to be registrable and not primarily merely a surname. The Assistant Commissioner noted the various meanings of \u201cDouglas\u201d and how it appeared from the record that \u201cDouglas\u201d was not the surname of any person connected with the applicant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-7\">In Ex parte Gemex Co., 111 USPQ 443 (Com\u2019r., 1956), the applicant\u2019s mark \u201cWellington\u201d was held to be registrable and not primarily merely a surname. The Assistant Commissioner noted the different meanings of the term and followed the rationale set forth in the Rivera case, supra, stating:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-8\">\u201c * * * There is no way of knowing what the impact on the purchasing public is likely to be upon seeing \u2018WELLINGTON\u2019 watch bracelets and straps, or with what, if anything, purchasers are likely to associate the mark.\u201d \u201cThe rationale set forth in Ex parte Rivera Watch Corporation, 106 USPQ 145 (Com\u2019r., 1955), and in Ex parte Omaha Cold Storage Co., 111 USPQ 189 (Com\u2019r., 1956), leads to a conclusion here that \u2018WELLINGTON\u2019 is not primarily merely a surname within the meaning of Section 2(e) of the statute when that section is read in the light of its legislative history.\u201d'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">The sole issue here is whether the mark sought to be registered, SCHAUB-LO-RENZ, was properly refused registration under section 2(e) (3) of the Trademark Act of 1946 as being primarily merely a surname. This provision of the act has been productive of diverse and not easily reconcilable decisions by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board as well as by the courts. As stated by Assistant Commissioner Leeds in the <em>Rivera </em>case, 106 USPQ at 146:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-11\">The decisions interpreting the phrase \u201cprimarily merely a surname\u201d are not altogether consistent, nor do they establish clear guide lines for future determinations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-12\">The examiner and the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board rely to a large extent on the <em>Kimberly-Clark </em>case, supra, which involved two cases consolidated on appeal. The first case concerned a mark whose dominant portion was \u201cKimberly Clark.\u201d It was refused registration under paragraph 5 of the Trademark Act of 1905 which denied registration of a mark which consisted merely of the name of a corporation. There is no similar issue present here as the mark sought to be registered is not the name of the appellant corporation. In an action brought by appellant in the U. S. District Court, D.C., under R.S. 4915, the complaint was dismissed and the appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, D.C., followed. On this aspect of the decision it would seem that there was no occasion for the Court of Appeals to express its opinion as to the import of section 2(e) (3) of the Trademark Act of 1946.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-13\">The second ease involved the registra-bility of the mark \u201cKimberly-Clark\u201d on the Principal Register under the 1946 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>Act. The Commissioner had offered registration on the Supplemental Register. The refusal to register the mark was made under section 2(e) (3) as a mark which was primarily merely a surname. The Court of Appeals affirmed \u201c[f]or the reasons given in our discussion\u201d of the first case, 196 F.2d at 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">It is not clear why the Court of Appeals in <em>Kimberly-Clark </em>refused registration on the Principal Register when, according to the court\u2019s opinion, \u201csecondary significance\u201d had been shown, 196 F.2d at 774. See section 2(f) of the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(f)). As the board here commented, if appellant had shown \u201csecondary meaning,\u201d section 2(f), then section 2(e) (3) expressly presents no bar to registration on the Principal Register. As to this aspect we agree with the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Nonetheless the board was of the view that as neither \u201cSCHAUB\u201d or \u201cLORENZ\u201d would be likely to have any meaning other than as surnames, the combination SCHAUB-LORENZ was similarly defective. Apparently the board did not consider appellant\u2019s evidence to be persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">We think the board\u2019s initial error arose from dissecting the marks. A mark must be considered in its entirety. In Ada Milling Co., 40 CCPA 1076, 205 F.2d 315, this court had occasion to consider the mark \u201cStartgrolay\u201d for poultry feed. Registration was refused on the ground it was a combination of generically descriptive terms, starting, growing and laying. The court reversed the decision of the Patent Office on the ground that the mark, when viewed in its entirety, was capable of distinguishing the applicant\u2019s goods from those of others. The dissecting method employed in <em>Kimberly-Clark </em>and in In re Midy Laboratories, Inc., 26 CCPA 1294, 104 F.2d 617, was properly rejected by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">Section 2 states no trademark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others <em>shall be refused registration on the Principal Register </em>on account of its nature <em>unless it </em>\u2014 consists of a mark which is \u201cprimarily merely a surname.\u201d It is clear that the burden is on the Patent Office to prove that the trademark is primarily merely a surname. In Ex parte Gemex Co., 111 USPQ 443, relied on by appellant, Assistant Commissioner Leeds stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-11\">The Examiner of Trademarks expressed the opinion that the primary significance [see Ex parte Rivera, supra] of the mark [Wellington] presented is a surname significance, but he gave no rationale other than to cite its appearance in some telephone directories. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-12\">While there may be no hard and fast rule as to the amount of evidence necessary to demonstrate that a mark is or is not primarily merely a surname, we note here that the examiner cited only portions of the mark as being listed in telephone directories, relying on dissection of the mark which we find is error. No evidence was submitted that the <em>mark sought to be registered </em>was primarily merely a surname. Accordingly, we do not think the Patent Office has discharged its burden of proof and its decision must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-13\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-14\">ALMOND, J., concurs in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-15\">WORLEY, C.
