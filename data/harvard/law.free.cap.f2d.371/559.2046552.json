KAUFMAN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Peter DiBello (appellant), a longshoreman, employed by the McGrath Corporation (McGrath), a stevedoring concern, was injured in the course of his work when he fell from a vertical steel ladder on board the M/S Iberia, owned by Red-eri A/B Svenska Lloyd (Rederi). Appellant sued the shipowner to recover for his personal injuries, and Rederi filed a third party complaint against McGrath.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">At the trial, DiBello contended that the second rung of the ladder in question was defective, and the narrow issue for the jury was whether the ladder was reasonably fit for its intended use. In answer to special interrogatories the jury found that Rederi was not negligent, and that the ship was not unseaworthy. Judge Levet thereupon directed entry of a judgment in favor of Rederi and dismissed the third party complaint. DiBello appeals from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\"> Appellant\u2019s primary contention is that he was denied a fair trial because the Court failed to preserve an atmosphere of impartiality. DiBello argues that Judge Levet participated excessively in the trial, citing the fact that appellant\u2019s witnesses were interrupted by him 32 times. We cannot conclude in the circumstances of this case that this represents excessive participation. As we have noted, \u201cA judge who conducts a jury trial has a duty to see that the facts are clearly presented and may ask pertinent questions of the witnesses to that end. He is not a mere passive spectator or moderator, though it goes without saying that he should exercise self-restraint and preserve an atmosphere of impartiality and detachment.\u201d Pariser v. The City of New York, 146 F.2d 431, 433 (2d Cir. 1945). A careful examination of the record reveals that Judge Levet\u2019s questions were pertinent and calculated to aid the jury by clarifying the witnesses\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">The record also fails to indicate any pattern of hostility toward DiBello. The fact that Judge Levet made a great many more adverse rulings against appellant than appellee, indicates, in this case, that the requests and objections by appellant were not sound, rather than that the judge was biased. Nor is there any merit to DiBello\u2019s contention that the judge was generally argumentative or demeaning to appellant, his witnesses or his counsel. If, on rare occasion, Judge Levet\u2019s remarks might better have been left unsaid, they were but separate and isolated instances, insufficient to contaminate the free air of an impartial tribunal or to necessitate reversal. Cf. Judge Kaufman, United States v. Kelly, 349 F.2d 720, 765-766 (2d Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 947, 86 S.Ct. 1467, 16 L.Ed.2d 544 (1966); United States v. Kahaner, 317 F.2d 459, 478 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 836, 84 S.Ct. 73, 11 L.Ed.2d 65 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">DiBello also claims that it was error to allow McGrath to sum up to the jury. But, McGrath\u2019s first line of defense against the shipowner\u2019s claim of indemnity was to defeat DiBello\u2019s claim against Rederi. It is clear that a third party defendant has the right to examine and cross-examine witnesses on the trial of the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the defendant. See, e. g., Hagans v. Ellerman &amp; Bucknall S.S. Co., 318 F.2d 563 (3d Cir. 1963). It is irrelevant that Mc-Grath waived its right to jury on the separate issue of indemnity. Having the right to examine witnesses on the question of Rederi\u2019s liability, it was within the judge\u2019s discretion to allow McGrath to sum up to the jury and his exercise of this discretion was not abused in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"AqA\">Moreover, there is little merit to DiBello\u2019s claim that his time for summation was improperly curtailed. As appellant admits, \u201cthere is no precise method of proving this.\u201d Even his imprecise method which relies on when the \u201cbells of the neighboring church sounded,\u201d and the number of pages of the record given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>over to the summation fail to prove that DiBello\u2019s requested time for summation was prejudicially, deliberately and intentionally reduced. Indeed, the transcript reveals only that the total summations by counsel for Rederi and McGrath consumed 29 pages, while DiBello\u2019s summation was recorded in 22 pages.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Appellant\u2019s other contentions are also without merit and may be dismissed summarily. It was not error for the Court to deny DiBello\u2019s motion to strike all testimony which related to a ladder as being the exact ladder involved in appellant\u2019s accident. Captain Hanson, master of the <em>Iberia, </em>testified that the ladder introduced in evidence was in fact the ladder from which DiBello fell. Furthermore, there was sufficient evidence presented to the jury to justify Judge Levet\u2019s charge on contributory negligence and the jury\u2019s ultimate finding that Rederi was not negligent and the ship was not unseaworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
