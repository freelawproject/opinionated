Campbell, the trial judge, stated that in imposing sentence he was giving consideration to defendant Berger for his plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-24\">Several months later- petitioner and Uselding were convicted on a trial by jury before the same judge. Due to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>judge\u2019s illness, on June 11, 1963, petitioner was taken before Judge Walter J. La Buy for sentencing, after petitioner had expressly agreed that he should handle the sentencing instead of waiting for Judge Campbell\u2019s recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">It appears from petitioner\u2019s brief, filed by his counsel, that when Judge La Buy was about to impose sentence he stated that he had read the record of previous proceedings herein and that after being informed of petitioner\u2019s previous record and having heard the arguments of government\u2019s counsel against any leniency, he imposed, without stating his reasons, the 15 years\u2019 sentence. He also sentenced Uselding to 15 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Hilbrich and Uselding appealed to this court from their convictions. We affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">In support of petitioner\u2019s motion under section 2255, petitioner filed his own affidavit stating</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-7\">\u201cThat prior to my trial, the Assistant United States Attorney stated to me \u2018that if I agree not to go to trial and enter a plea of guilty and testify against Uselding, that he would see to it that I receive a similar sentence as was imposed on Berger, otherwise, if I went to trial he would see to it that I received a sentence twice as great.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">It will be observed that a sentence of 15 years, as imposed on Hilbrich, was also imposed on'Uselding and -is within the statutory maximum of 25 years and $10,000 fine, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">This case is not controlled by our holding in United States v. Wiley, 278 F.2d 500 (1960). Here the sentencing judge was not the trial judge. Judge La Buy, with many years of experience as a federal judge, was able to and, we have no reason to doubt, did properly consider the rights of Hilbrich when sentencing him. The suggestion implicit in Hil-brich\u2019s appeal that Judge La Buy was influenced by the sentence which Judge Campbell had imposed upon Berger is speculative and wholly inconsistent with the record and the integrity of Judge La Buy.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">For these reasons we affirm the order from which this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b881-24\">. 341 F.2d 555 (7 Cir. 1965), cert. denied 381 U.S. 941, 85 S.Ct. 1775, 15 L.Ed.2d 704.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
