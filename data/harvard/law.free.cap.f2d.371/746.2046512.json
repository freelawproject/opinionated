There are two answers to this: (1) appellant failed to request such a charge; and, more importantly, (2) the trial court instructed the jury that \u201cthe burden of proof is on the plaintiff to establish <em>every aspect of Ms case </em>by what we call a fair preponderance of the evidence\u201d [emphasis added], and then defined the term, preponderance of the evidence. This we think was sufficient, certainly in the absence of a request for more specificity.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-19\">We have examined the other errors urged for reversal and find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
