Sahley, plaintiff, and Mark T. McKee, defendant, agreed to embark on a joint venture whereby McKee would arrange for the acquisition and financing of companies brought to his attention by Sahley. All fees received by McKee were to be split evenly. Pursuant to this agreement, Sahley introduced McKee to the owners of Guerdon Industries, Inc. (Guerdon), a corporation engaged in the manufacturing of mobile houses, and McKee successfully brought about the acquisition of Guerdon stock by Laden-burg, Thalmann &amp; Co. (Ladenburg), private bankers, a defendant below, who subsequently refinanced Guerdon by a public stock offering.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> McKee was to receive $250,000 in connection with this transaction, $150,000 from the stock<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>holders of Guerdon and $100,000 from Ladenburg. These facts were found by the district court after the introduction of much highly conflicting testimony. McKee does not attack these findings on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">The principal dispute on appeal concerns the amount paid to Sahley prior to the trial in partial satisfaction of Sah-ley\u2019s $125,000 share of the Guerdon fee. It is conceded that Sahley received $38,-000 from McKee ($37,000 in cash plus an authorized $1,000 investment in Jensen Associates by McKee in Sahley\u2019s name), but McKee claims that an additional payment of $37,000 was made. The district court rejected this claim. McKee also questions the district court\u2019s findings on the extent to which he is liable for part of the moneys received from Ladenburg and the date from which pre-verdict interest should be computed on Sahley\u2019s share.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">\n<em>The investment in Jensen Associates</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">A photocopy of a check for $37,000 drawn by Gurdon T. Wolfe (a chief stockholder of Guerdon) payable to Mark McKee was introduced into evidence below. The check was endorsed by McKee: \u201cPay to Jensen Associates for purchase of stock for Sahley Corporation in like amount,\u201d and was duly deposited in Jensen Associates\u2019 account. Sahley, the holder of a 75% interest in Sahley Corporation, admitted in a deposition that Sahley Corporation was notified of the investment, which was subsequently entered as income in the corporation\u2019s books. McKee\u2019s claim is that, prior to this investment, Sahley assigned his interest in the Guerdon fee to his corporation and that the corporation\u2019s entry of the $37,000 investment as income on its books evidenced acquiescence to that mode of receipt of Sahley\u2019s share of the Guerdon fee. We find it unnecessary to pass on whether there was an assignment of Sahley\u2019s interest in the Guerdon fee to his corporation at the time of the Jensen investment, as we believe the record adequately supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that the $37,000 investment was never authorized by Sahley or his corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">Jensen Associates was incorporated in Delaware in May, 1959, mainly upon the initiative of Sahley and McKee, for the purpose of financing and setting up mobile home parks. McKee was to act as the financial promoter of the corporation and Sahley was to do much of the engineering and mechanical work. Apparently, each of ten directors put up an initial $1,000 (with McKee putting up Sahley\u2019s $1,000 \u2014 included in the $38,000 of the Guerdon fee that Sahley concedes he received). In September, 1959, at a subsequent directors\u2019 meeting, McKee reported that Ladenburg was willing to invest $200,000 in Jensen Associates if each director would provide another $20,-000. Sahley, who was running short of funds, testified that McKee told him, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-13\">The endorsement and payment stamps on the $37,000 Wolfe check establish that Jensen Associates deposited the check and that the drawee, Irving Trust Company, paid the check on October 22, 1959. Yet in November, Sahley, on pressing for more of his share of the Guerdon fee, was assured by McKee that his share would be forthcoming, no mention being made of the $37,000 investment in Jensen. Sahley further testified that it wasn\u2019t until January, 1960 that the investment was entered on Sahley Corporation\u2019s books, and that both prior and subsequent to that time McKee made further assurances that Sahley would get a direct payment of the rest of his share of the Guerdon fee. Viewing the evidence favorably to Sahley, it appears that McKee deliberately misled Sahley as to McKee\u2019s receipt of the Guerdon fee and as to the extent of Sahley\u2019s commitment to Jensen Associates, while McKee had, in fact, invested the money in Jensen Associates in a totally unauthorized amount.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>district court was in a position to judge credibility \u2014 an especially important element in this case \u2014 and on the basis of the record, his finding against McKee with respect to the $37,000 investment in Jensen Associates is accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">\n<em>Pre-Verdict Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">McKee argued below that the $100,000 due to him from Ladenburg was not connected with the Guerdon deal and that Sahley, therefore, had no interest in it. On May 1, 1959, Ladenburg and McKee entered into an agreement which specified that Ladenburg would pay over to McKee part of any profit realized by Ladenburg from the sale of Guerdon stock. On August 6, 1959, Ladenburg and McKee entered into a subsequent agreement purporting to cancel all the obligations of the May agreement, but at the same time calling for the rendering of unspecified future services by McKee in return for $100,000 payable in three equal annual installments. At the time of the trial, McKee had received two installments totalling $66,666.66 pursuant to this agreement. The district court, while rejecting a finding that Laden-burg by entering into the August agreement conspired to deprive Sahley of any share of the money due McKee from Ladenburg in connection with the Guer-don transaction, nevertheless found, in a finding unchallenged on this appeal, that the moneys paid to McKee under the August agreement were a substitute for what was due under the earlier agreement clearly connected with Guerdon.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">After the entry of the judgment, Sahley moved for pre-verdict interest on his share of the Guerdon fee under \u00a7 5001(b) of the New York C.P.L.R.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> With respect to Sahley\u2019s $50,000 share<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the moneys due from Ladenburg, the district court awarded interest from August 6, 1959, the date of the second McKee-Ladenburg agreement, although in fact the first installment was not paid until October 7, 1959 and the second until April 14, 1960. As the joint venture between McKee and Sahley was to share moneys <em>received, </em>we believe that the preverdict interest should be calculated from the date McKee actually received payments from Ladenburg and the judgment is modified accordingly and with due regard to the partial satisfaction of the judgment as a result of Judge Cannella\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-11\">Affirmed in part and modified in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b774-15\">. The district court found below that Sahley had no direct claim against Laden-burg for a finder\u2019s fee and additionally that Ladenburg had not conspired with McKee to deprive Sahley of his share of the moneys paid to McKee by Ladenburg.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b775-8\">. As it turned out, the expansion plans for Jensen Associates did not materialize so that all investments in the corporation eventually proved worthless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b776-7\">. Providing in part: \u201cInterest shall be computed from the earliest ascertainable date the cause of action existed * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b776-9\">. At thy trial below, McKee argued that at most he owed Sahley only $33,333.33 of the Ladenburg money as he had received but two installments totalling $66,666.66. Subsequent to the initial judgment, however, Judge Cannella ordered Ladenburg to pay into court the outstanding portion of the $100,000 fee (in brief, Sahley concedes that this sum has been paid in partial satisfaction of the judgment).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
