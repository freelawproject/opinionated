On appeal there is no dispute between the parties that the state court remedy on this claim has not been exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-14\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the petition for habeas corpus without prejudice to appellant\u2019s right to pursue the claim of conflict of interest in the state court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b595-27\">. 265 F.Supp. 664.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
