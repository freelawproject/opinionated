The prior art references relied on are:</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-25\">Merckel et al. [Merckel] 2,627,493 February 3, 1953</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-26\">Strean 2,449,184 September 14,1948</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-27\">The claims were considered together. Claim 2 defines the invention as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aq9-dedup-0\">2. A product comprising sugar crystals and a coating on the sugar crystals containing a soluble fluoride in which the fluorine ion is present in an amount greater than one part by weight of the fluorine per one million parts by weight of the sugar crystals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1076-31\">Appellant describes his invention as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-32\">The invention of appellant is based on the discovery that sugar can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>inactivated by the combination with fluorine or fluorides, at least insofar as its ability to increase the rate of growth of laetobacillus acidophilus. The reaction to inactivate the sugar, without interfering with its use as a sweetener, is believed to be a synergistic reaction that takes place by reason of the immediate presence of fluorine with sugar when taken into the human system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Az3\">Considering the prior art, Strean discloses compositions containing fluorides which inhibit dental caries when absorbed into the enamel of teeth. The compositions are \u201cadministered orally in the form of a lozenge, tablet or the like\u201d and contain sugar and calcium fluoride or sodium fluoride. The materials are combined by mixing and the sugar is used for flavoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">Merckel discloses a method for making a chewing gum having as an ingredient sodium fluoride \u201cfor effectuating fluorine treatment of the teeth.\u201d After preparing the gum base both sugar and the fluorides \u201care included to the extent desired and conveniently in the same, final mixing step.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-7\">Appellant has previously presented claims <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> defining an admixture of sugar in crystalline form with a fluorine salt. The board affirmed an examiner\u2019s rejection under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 based on the same references relied on here. That decision, which is not of record and date unknown, is urged to be res judicata as to the claims presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-8\">Res judicata requires, inter alia, a showing of an identity of the <em>issues </em>presented for adjudication and the <em>issues </em>previously decided. In re Szwarc, 319 F.2d 277, 50 CCPA 1571, In re Fried, 312 F.2d 930, 50 CCPA 954. A determination that an admixture of sugar and fluorine salt is obvious in view of the facts present before a previous board is not a determination that a fluorine coated sugar crystal is obvious in view of the facts presented here. We think the board erred in sustaining the examiner\u2019s rejection based on res judi-cata. We therefore turn to a consideration of the rejection based on section 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-13\">Both of the products disclosed in the prior art achieve the desired result stated in appellant\u2019s specification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-14\">* * * To impart the desired result, it is necessary for the fluorine to be made available in a water-soluble stage or in a stage which is soluble in the juices that are present in the oral cavity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1077-15\">Mixing sugar and fluorides to prepare a product for oral administration to inhibit tooth decay is thus old. The difference between appellant\u2019s invention and the prior art teachings resides in the method of combining the ingredients. The board found that coating the sugar with fluorides was but \u201ca convenient way of combining the sugar and fluorides.\u201d Appellant has not submitted any evidence tending to demonstrate that this conclusion is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-16\">In view of the teachings of the prior art and facts of record,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we agree with and affirm the board\u2019s conclusion that the claimed invention is obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-17\">The decision of the board is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-19\">WORLEY, C. J., concurs in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-22\">O I KEY NUMBER SYSTEM</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1076-33\">. Application Ser.
