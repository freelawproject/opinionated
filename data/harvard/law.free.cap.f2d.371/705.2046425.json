Sections 35-45. The United States, for the benefit of the miners, sued to compel Davison Fuel and Dock Company to pay each miner the difference between what he received and what he would have received had wages complied with standards set under authority of the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-19\">The district court decided that Davison had sufficient contractual relationship with the United States to invoke provisions of the Walsh-Healey Act and entered judgment for the use and benefit of the miners. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-20\">Although the facts are stipulated, it is necessary to an understanding of the problem to set them out in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-21\">National Lead contracted to operate on a cost-plus-a-fixed-fee basis the Atomic Energy Commission\u2019s Feed Materials Production Center at Fernald, Ohio. The contract provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that National Lead should acquire for the Government necessary materials which had not been furnished by the AEC and that payment for such materials was to be made from government funds deposited in special accounts. The Government reserved the right to require purchase orders to be submitted for its approval. Under the contract title to all materials purchased was to pass directly from the vendor to the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-22\">Appellant, Davison,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> entered into two purchase order contracts exceeding $700,-000 in combined amount, to supply coal over a period of two years for the operation of the Fernald facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-23\">The contracts provided that Davison \u201cshall produce (or arrange to have produced) * * * \u201d the coal and \u201cshall deliver coal from the source at the rate specified by the agreement and in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>schedule(s).\u201d The coal was \u201cnot (to) be delivered * * * from any other source * * * than set forth * * * \u201d in the attached schedules. The schedules named the source as a particular mine at Crown Hill, West Virginia, operated by Riverton Coal Company. Riverton was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fields Creek Coal Company, which was itself a wholly-owned subsidiary of Davison.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Davison operated no coal mines <em>directly </em>but owned and operated truck scales, a tipple, coal processing plant, and barge loading facility at Marmet, West Virginia. At North Bend, Ohio, Davison maintained a river harbor, including barge unloading facilities, coal processing plant, storage yard, and rail and truck shipping facilities. In addition, Davison owned coal producing properties in the vicinity of Marmet, West Virginia, which it leased to various mine operators.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The coal actually delivered by Davison under the purchase order contracts originated from three sources: the Riverton Coal Company, the designated source; Fields Creek Coal Company; and thirty-two other non-affiliated producers whose employment practices, as stipulated, did not comply with the minimum wage and overtime requirements of the Walsh-Healey Act. Although the Riverton mine produced a sufficient amount of coal to meet Davison\u2019s obligation under the contracts, Davison, apparently in accord with practices in the industry, purchased and intermingled coal from other producers in fulfilling its general contract obligations. To meet the specifications of the purchase orders, the raw coal before delivery had to be processed by screening, picking and crushing. This was accomplished in facilities of either Davison or its subsidiary, the Riverton Coal Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">The stipulations and representations required by the Walsh-Healey Act and liability for their violation are applicable only to \u201cany contract made and entered into by any executive department, independent establishment, <em>or other agency or instrumentality </em>of the United States * * 41 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 35. (Emphasis added.) A predicate, therefore, to liability on the purchase order contracts here in issue is that they be found, for purposes of the Act, to be \u201cgovernment contracts.\u201d Davison contends the contracts were between it and National Lead, two private corporations, and hence, not within the reach of the Walsh-Healey provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-14\">National Lead is, indeed, a private corporation. But here it was acting as an agent of the AEC, an instrumentality of the Government, in purchasing necessary supplies for operation of the AEC Fernald facility. For purposes of the Walsh-Healey Act, we think the contracts were \u201cmade and entered into\u201d by the AEC, admittedly an instrumentality of the United States, and the purchases were those of the Government. Cf. United States v. Livingston, 179 F.Supp. 9 (E.D.S.C.1959), aff\u2019d mem., 364 U.S. 281, 80 S.Ct. 1611, 4 L.Ed.2d 1719 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-15\">Both contracts were in the form of agreements between National Lead and Davison. Each contained, however, express stipulations that it was entered into by National Lead for and on behalf of the Government; that shipments of the coal were to be made to the United States Atomic Energy Commission, % National Lead Company; and that title to the coal was to pass directly to the Government <em>as purchaser. </em>The contracts were not to be binding without written approval of the AEC and were, in fact, signed by AEC contracting officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-16\">The purchase order contracts contained many standard clauses included and in some instances required to be in government contracts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The contracts specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>cally provided for incorporation by reference of the representations and stipulations of the Walsh-Healey Act, including applicable rulings and interpretations of the Secretary of Labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">The coal was to be paid for from funds advanced by the Government and segregated for this purpose by National Lead which was to acquire no right or interest in them. The Government remained liable <em>directly </em>if for any reason payment was not made.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The contracts plainly impose the ultimate liability and risk in the purchase transaction on the Government. Davison can express no surprise that the Government\u2019s status is that of purchaser for it was named as such in the contracts. The United States was sufficiently a party to the contracts with Davison to support the conclusion of the district judge that they were made by a government instrumentality within the meaning of the Walsh-Healey Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Davison urges on us in support of its position the decisions of the Supreme Court in United States v. Boyd, 378 U.S. 39, 84 S.Ct. 1518, 12 L.Ed.2d 713 (1964), and Powell v. United States Cartridge Co., 339 U.S. 497, 70 S.Ct. 755, 94 L.Ed. 1017 (1950). However, these are not pertinent for they determine only that the companies involved were not to be considered constituent parts of the Government. Here, the United States does not claim that National Lead was a part \u2014agency or instrumentality \u2014 of the Government, but only that National Lead was being compensated in its private corporate capacity as a purchasing agent for the AEC. This arrangement was a lawful delegation of authority whereby National Lead served as government purchasing agent. See United States v. Livingston, supra, 179 F.Supp. at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">Alabama v. King &amp; Boozer, 314 U.S. 1, 62 S.Ct. 43, 86 L.Ed. 3 (1941), also cited by Davison, is distinguishable from the present case. There the purchaser of materials was held to be the private contractor and not the Government; however, the purchase order specifically stated that it did \u201cnot bind, nor purport to bind\u201d the Government. In addition, the private contractor paid for the materials initially with his own funds, subject to reimbursement, and title passed to the Government only after written acceptance by the United States contracting officer. \u201cMeanwhile, title to materials was in the contractor, who had purchased them on his own credit and who, presumptively, could have diverted them to other purposes.\u201d United States v. Livingston, supra, 179 F.Supp. at 21. A result contrary to that in <em>King &amp; Boozer </em>was reached in Kern-Limerick, Inc. v. Scurlock, 347 U.S. 110, 74 S.Ct. 403, 98 L.Ed. 546 (1954), where on contractual terms more nearly like those in the present case the Government was held to be the actual purchaser and the private contractor its purchasing agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">Moreover, <em>King &amp; Boozer, </em>as <em>Boyd, </em>supra, and indeed, <em>Kern-Limerick, </em>dealt with problems of immunity from state taxation which involved consideration of different policies than in the case now before us. The Walsh-Healey Act is remedial wage and hour legislation and will be construed liberally to effectuate congressional policy \u201cthat the Federal Government should procure and use only goods produced under safe and fair working conditions.\u201d George v. Mitchell, 108 U.S.App.D.C. 324, 282 F.2d 486, 493 (1960). The Act will be interpreted to further its purpose \u201cto obviate the possibility that any part of our tremendous national expenditures * * * go to forces tending to depress wages and purchasing power and offending fair social standards of employment.\u201d Perkins v. Lukens Steel Co., 310 U.S. 113, 128, 60 S.Ct. 869, 877, 84 L.Ed. 1108 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"auu-dedup-0\">The divergence of relevant policies and difference in the contexts in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>issues arise also assist to explain what may appear to be a conflict between our decision in this case and a decision of the Sixth Circuit on the question of whether substantially similar purchase orders were government contracts. See United States v. P &amp; D Coal Mining Co., 358 F.2d 619 (6th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\"><em>P &amp; D Coal Mining </em>also involved the contracting status of National Lead as the manager of AEC\u2019s Fernald facility. A divided court held that the United States, having sued P &amp; D after taking an assignment of National Lead\u2019s rights under a coal purchase order similar to those in contention here, was chargeable for pre-judgment interest on P &amp; D\u2019s successful counterclaim on the order. This was so, the court held, even though interest on all final judgments against the United States on claims under the Tucker Act, under which suit was brought,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was to be computed only from the date of judgment. The panel imposed liability on the Government for pre-judgment interest due from National Lead after finding that the United States was <em>not </em>a party to the original purchase order contract but was suing as assignee of the private contract between P &amp; D and National Lead. Id. at 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The Sixth Circuit in <em>P &amp; D Coal Mining, </em>in deciding that the Government was not a party to the contract,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> relied on the fact that P &amp; D \u201chad no right, under the contract, to sue the Government for any sums due on coal delivered.\u201d Id. at. 621. In the present case, on the other hand, the Government <em>was </em>ultimately liable for payment to Davison if for any reason payment was not made from sums advanced to National Lead.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, the Sixth Circuit noted that the contract there \u201cshowed that it was approved by the\u201d AEC. Ibid. The purchase order contracts entered into with Davison in the present case were by their terms \u201cnot * * * binding unless so approved,\u201d and thus, the very existence of the legal obligation was contingent upon the written concurrence of the AEC.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-14\">The Walsh-Healey Act is expressly applicable only to primary government contracts and does not purport to affect the labor standards of subcontractors. 41 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 35. We agree with the United States, however, that Congress did not intend that Walsh-Healey provisions be circumvented by use of the prime contract as a means to insulate from the requirements of the Act the firms actually performing work that would normally be done by the prime contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-15\">The Act, to prevent such circumvention, requires in each government contract (incorporated by reference in the present purchase orders) a stipulation that the \u201ccontractor is the <em>manufacturer of </em>or a <em>regular dealer in </em>the materials * * * to be manufactured or used in the performance of the contract.\u201d 41 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 35. (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We believe the administrative rulings dealing with sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>stitute manufacturers applied by the Department of Labor in the present case <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> represent a reasonable interpretation of this statutory policy and are well within the Secretary\u2019s authority to \u201cmake * * * such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of * * * \u201d the Walsh-Healey Act. 41 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 38; see United States v. New England Coal and Coke Co., 318 F.2d 138, 147 (1st Cir. 1963); cf. American Trucking Ass\u2019ns, Inc. v. United States, 344 U.S. 298, 310, 73 S.Ct. 307, 97 L.Ed. 337 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">These rulings impose on one with a government contract for the manufacture of materials joint liability for failure of another manufacturer to which he has shifted the work to comply with Walsh-Healey standards. Rulings imposing liability for the omissions of substitute manufacturers were first issued in 1937, only a year after the passage of the Walsh-Healey Act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> They have been since consistently applied by the Secretary of Labor<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and have not been altered by Congress, notwithstanding several amendments to the original Act and frequent congressional inquiries concerning the Act and its administration by the Department of Labor.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We think that the present situation is one in which eongres-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>sional failure to act may be deemed to evidence congressional acquiescence. See, e.g., Ruth Elkhorn Coals, Inc. v. Mitchell, 101 U.S.App.D.C. 313, 248 F.2d 635 (1957), cert. denied, 355 U.S. 953, 78 S.Ct. 539, 2 L.Ed.2d 530 (1958); Mitchell v. Covington Mills, Inc., 229 F.2d 506 (D.C.Cir.1955), cert. denied, 350 U.S. 1002, 76 S.Ct. 546, 100 L.Ed. 865 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">The substitute manufacturer rulings help insure compliance with the fundamental Walsh-Healey policy that performance of work under government contracts will be at fair wages and in safe working conditions. The prime contractor may not escape Walsh-Healey responsibility by shifting to others work it has contracted to perform itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Even so, the substitute manufacturer rulings do not extend Walsh-Healey standards to government subcontracts generally.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This concededly would be in excess of the Secretary\u2019s statutory authority under the Act. United States v. New England Coal and Coke Co., 318 F.2d 138 (1st Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Davison urges that the Secretary may not ever extend protection to employees other than those of the prime contractor because the Act plainly embraces only persons \u201cemployed by the contractor.\u201d 41 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 35(b), (c). In view of the history of administration of the Act and the frequent opportunity of the Congress to correct administrative interpretation, we think \u201cemployed\u201d as used in the statute has acquired the meaning given it in the Secretary\u2019s rulings. Persons \u201cemployed by the (prime) contractor\u201d <em>may </em>be, in carefully defined situations, persons other than those on the prime contractor\u2019s payroll. We do not believe this to be in conflict with the position of the First Circuit in <em>New England Coal and Coke Co., </em>supra, for the court there carefully distinguished situations in which the substitute manufacturer rulings are properly invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-13\">Davison argues that the substitute manufacturer rulings of the Secretary of Labor are not applicable to it in any event because it is a \u201cregular dealer\u201d in coal and not a \u201cmanufacturer\u201d as that term is used in the Walsh-Healey Act and in the pertinent administrative regulations and rulings and interpretations.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>Davison asks us to reverse the conclusion of the district court that it bid and contracted in the present instance as a manufacturer, and was, therefore, bound by this status in the application of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Davison in the present contracts agreed to \u201cproduce (or arrange to have produced) and sell coal,\u201d and in the words of the district judge below, \u201cit would be extremely difficult to classify Davison as a dealer for the basic reason that through its two wholly owned subsidiaries it does mine, process and deliver coal.\u201d Moreover, Davison contracted expressly to supply the coal from its subsidiary, the Riverton Coal Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">That Davison and its subsidiaries are separate legal entities does not preclude consideration of them as an integrated production structure for the purpose of enforcing Walsh-Healey provisions. In applying regulatory statutes such as the Walsh-Healey Act, separate corporate entities are not inviolate. See, e.g., H. P. Lambert Co. v. Secretary of the Treasury, 354 F.2d 819, 822 (1st Cir. <em>1965); </em>Mansfield Journal Co. v. FCC, 86 U.S.App.D.C. 102, 180 F.2d 28, 37 (1950). It was stipulated that Davison owned all the stock in Fields Creek Coal Company, which in turn owned all the stock in Riverton, and that substantially all the coal which Riverton mined or otherwise handled was delivered to Davison. There was in addition at the time of execution of the present contracts substantial identity of officers in the companies. Davison also represented itself as sales agent for both Riverton and Fields Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">We agree with the district judge that Davison in entering into the present contracts did so as a \u201cmanufacturer\u201d for purposes of application of the WalshHealey Act and the Secretary\u2019s administrative rulings. Hence, the holding of the First Circuit in <em>New England Coal and Coke Co., </em>supra, is inapposite for the court there held \u201cthat the Walsh-Healey Act does not make a contractor, who <em>enters into a contract </em>to furnish goods to the government <em>as a regular dealer </em>and operates as such in the performance of its contract, responsible for the labor standards of its suppliers.\u201d 318 F.2d at 148. (Emphasis added.) The court expressly distinguishes circumstances involving the substitute manufacturer regulations which are applied to \u201cprevent evasion by the prime contractor of its Walsh-Healey obligations.\u201d Id. at 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">The district court held that the non-affiliated producers of coal whose labor conditions failed to meet WalshHealey standards were substitute manufacturers and <em>not </em>subcontractors for whose omissions Davison would not have been liable under the rulings of the Secretary.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">As was said by the district judge, \u201cit would be stretching the imagination rather far to say that because Davison processed (screened, picked, crushed) coal purchased from various \u2018pothole\u2019 mines, they were, in effect, purchasing materials, etc. and manufacturing them into a finished product for delivery under the contracts.\u201d Cf. East Texas Motor Freight Lines, Inc. v. Frozen Food Express, 351 U.S. 49, 76 S.Ct. 574, 100 L.Ed. 917 (1956). Rather, Davison, had contracted to \u201cproduce (or arrange to have produced) and sell coal\u201d of a certain specification and had instead shifted responsibility to substandard parties \u201cto produce all or some of the * * * (very commodity) called for by the contract * * Section 31(a), Department of Labor, Rulings and Interpretations No. 3 under Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Here, as with our consideration above of the question of whether Davison was a manufacturer or regular dealer, we note the rule that an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations should be accepted by the courts unless shown to be unreasonable or inconsistent with underlying statutory authority. Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 4, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965); Bowles v. Seminole Rock Co., 325 U.S. 410, 413, 65 S.Ct. 1215, 89 L.Ed. 1700 (1945); Norwegian Nitrogen Products Co. v. United States, 288 U.S. 294, 315, 53 S.Ct. 350, 77 L.Ed. 796 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Finally, Davison asserts that there can be no liability on the purchase order contracts in question because incorporation by reference of Walsh-Healey provisions in them<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201cconflicts with the clear legislative command of the Act that \u2018there shall be included\u2019 the representations and stipulations (41 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 35).\u201d The standard incorporating clause is currently set out in 41 C.F.R. Section 12.605. The administrative construction of the Act since 1942 has authorized incorporation by reference. See 7 Fed. Reg. 11086 (1942). Moreover, the courts have sustained incorporation by reference, albeit without challenge. E.g., Harp v. United States, 173 F.2d 761 (5th Cir. 1949), cert. denied, 338 U.S. 816, 70 S.Ct. 56, 94 L.Ed. 494 (1949). We believe this practice to be reasonable and not inconsistent with the terms of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Davison also objects to the conditional nature of the incorporating clauses in the present contracts. This objection is without merit since the Walsh-Healey Act itself provides for administrative proceedings to determine the applicability of the Act to any particular contract. 41 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 39, 43a. We agree with counsel for the United States that the conditional wording accurately reflects the legal situation and, indeed, prevents the contractor from being misled into believing that the inclusion of the clause precludes him from contesting the applicability of the Act to his contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-13\">We perceive no error in the findings or conclusions of the district court and, therefore, the judgment below for the United States is</p>\n<p id=\"b768-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b761-24\">. It is stipulated that workers at the thirty-two different mines were underpaid $93,603.29 and that if the Act is applicable the United States is entitled to recover this amount.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b761-29\">. Davison entered into the contracts under its name at that time, Raymond City Coal and Transportation Company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b762-8\">. Included, among others, were clauses providing for termination of the contract when determined in the best interests of the Government; requiring settlement of disputes by submission to the government contracting officer, with right of appeal to the AEG; giving the right to the Comptroller General to examine books. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>and documents of Davison pertinent to the orders; prohibiting discrimination in employment; covenanting against contingent fees; providing that members of Congress would not share in benefits; and agreeing to adhere to the terms of the Buy American Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b764-6\">.

If, for example, a contractor is awarded a contract subject to the Act as a manufacturer, that contractor is liable jointly with the substitute manufacturer for any acts or omissions on the part of a substitute manufacturer which would have constituted violations of the contractor\u2019s contract if he had performed the contract in his own plant and had committed such acts or suffered such omissions in connection with that performance.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b765-14\">.

He may not relieve himself of this obligation merely by shifting the work to another.\u201d 2 Fed.Reg. 1926 (1937).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b765-17\">. Since 1937, the Secretary of Labor (or his delegate) has consistently held that those who contract with the Government <em>as manufacturers </em>are responsible for the labor standards of the employees who actually do the work under the contract, whether or not they are the prime contractor\u2019s employees. E. g., Admoor Clothes, 6 Wage &amp; Hour Cas. 1073 (1944); Cohen-Fein Co., 6 Wage &amp; Hour Cas. 1116, 1118 (1940). Similarly, he has consistently ruled that those who contract as coal producers are responsible for the labor standards of the mines from which they purchase coal to fulfill their government contracts. In re Jno. McCall Coal Co., 15 Wage &amp; Hour Cas. 523 (1962); In re Simmons, 14 Wage &amp; Hour Cas. 546, aff\u2019d, 14 Wage &amp; Hour Cas. 682 (1960); In re McPherson, 13 Wage &amp; Hour Cas. 743, aff\u2019d, 13 Wage &amp; Hour Cas. 763 (1958); In re Bradford Coal Co., 13 Wage &amp; Hour Cas. 225 (1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b765-18\">.
