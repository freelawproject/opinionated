It clearly constitutes a collateral attack upon the judgment of conviction and does not constitute sufficient grounds for relief under \u00a7 2255.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-24\">Appellant\u2019s brief raises the question of an attempt by him to take an appeal from the judgment of conviction and sentence. This question was not raised by the motion filed in the trial court and is raised here for the first time. Therefore, we are precluded from considering the point. It may still be appropriately presented to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-26\">. Carrillo v.
