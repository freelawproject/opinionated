The conviction was affirmed by the New Jersey Supreme Court, 35 N.J. 168, 171 A.2d 649 (1961). Petition for rehearing was denied December 11, 1961. Appellant\u2019s petition for certiorari was denied by the United States Supreme Court, 369 U.S. 866, 82 S.Ct. 1035, 8 L.Ed.2d 83 (1962). Application was thereafter made to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey for a writ of habeas corpus. That was denied June 26, 1962, without prejudice, for failure to exhaust state remedies. Appellant next sought such writ from the New Jersey Superior Court. As stated in the appeal from the denial of that petition by the New Jersey Supreme Court, 40 N.J. 309, 311, 191 A.2d 472 (1963), \u201cThe matter was assigned to the judge who presided at the trial and a hearing was held on September 21, 1962. The petition was denied and the cause dismissed.\u201d The New Jersey Supreme Court affirmed that judgment, supra, holding p. 311, 191 A. 2d p. 473 \u201cThe complaint seeking the writ contains eleven counts all of which are cast by the pleader in constitutional terms. We have considered the merits of the grounds advanced in the complaint and find no substance in any of them.\u201d After that a second habeas corpus peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>tion was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The eleven counts of the petition were identical with those of the state court habeas corpus petition except that the paragraphs were renumbered.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">With respect to the material that was before the District Judge and whether a hearing was indicated the Judge stated in his opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-5\">\u201cIn considering this present application this Court has secured a transcript of the entire jury selection procedure and trial. This transcript comprises some nine volumes of testimony. In addition the Court has had the benefit of detailed appendices supplied by counsel for the petitioner in which reference is made to the transcript and to which the full transcript of motion arguments are attached. In addition counsel for petitioner has submitted a brief apparently fully stating his position in the matter. At the date set for oral argument counsel for petitioner and the prosecutor agreed to waive same and rest their contentions on the file and the voluminous record of the proceedings. The Prosecutor\u2019s office submitted a copy of their brief filed with the Supreme Court in the State habeas corpus proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">\u201cThe Court has given this matter long and careful attention and has fully read and digested all of the material submitted. The nature of the case is admittedly grave. The petitioner\u2019s contentions have been given full consideration by the New Jersey Supreme Court. As heretofore stated, the same contentions are raised in this proceedings for habeas corpus relief. The arguments raised may all be determined from the record and the transcript of the proceedings. There are no new elements alleged or contentions made which would require a hearing in the matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Appellant clearly agrees with the above in his brief, p. 5, where he says: \u201cUpon the question of whether or not a hearing would be held, counsel rested upon the voluminous record before Judge Coola-han.\u201d The particular docket entry of the District Court found in appellant\u2019s appendix also bears this out. The entry reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"an-dedup-0\">\u201c5-5-64 At call for hearing on petition for a writ of habeas corpus, Counsel indicated the matter would be submitted on the trial record and briefs to be filed. (Coolahan) (5-4-64)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">Our independent study of the state court record verifies completely the decision of the District Judge that in the full trial record plus the briefs and appendices of counsel he had everything before him necessary to his decision and that a hearing was not required. Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963); Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 73 S.Ct. 397, 97 L.Ed. 469 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">The District Court in a comprehensive, carefully documented opinion denied the application for the writ. Actually there would be no need or really justification for stating our views at any length except for the circumstance that on oral argument some question arose about evidence having been introduced at the voir dire and in the trial itself concerning a prior homicide by defendant for which introduction the state was responsible. To satisfactorily deal with that problem the factual picture should be briefly outlined.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">For about a year prior to February 1960, appellant, then fifty-nine years old, had been very friendly with Marion Wetzel who at the time was fifty-two years old. On February 4, 1960, shortly after 6:00 P.M. he entered a Newark, New Jersey tavern which Miss Wetzel owned and operated. She was there and they quarreled. A little later a witness saw appellant outside the tavern at his car, return to the tavern and point a shot gun at Miss Wetzel. The witness heard a shot and observed Miss Wetzel fall. When the police arrived they saw appellant struggling with two men for his gun. Witnesses testified that appellant at the time said, \u201cI shot her. She\u2019s behind the bar.\u201d A shotgun shell was obtained from appellant\u2019s pocket. In a statement to the police appellant said he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>had blacked out and had no knowledge of the shooting. In the brief for appellant it is admitted that \u201cForcella did not question, at anytime, that it was his act, by the use of a shot gun, that caused the death of Marion Wetzel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Forcella was indicted for first degree murder. His trial started on May 2, 1960. It is asserted on his behalf that \u201cThe panel of jurors chosen for the For-cella trial were quickly and effectively indoctrinated in an atmosphere of prejudice and bias.\u201d Complaint is made that the voir dire was before the whole jury panel and the statement is made that during it \u201c * * * the trial court allowed the propaganda to commence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The assertion that there was substantial error by reason of the voir dire examination being conducted in the presence of the jury panel is specious. The New Jersey procedure for the selection of a jury in a capital case was meticulously followed by the trial judge. There was no mention whatsoever of holding an in camera session, no thought of it or need for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">The unmistakable neutral atmosphere surrounding the entire selection of the jury and the meticulous fairness of the trial judge and counsel on both sides were evident immediately on the examination of the first panel member called. The prosecutor' inter alia asked as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-8\">\u201cQ. Mr. Jones, you understand at this posture of the case that both defense counsel and I are going to ask you certain questions not for any personal reasons but because we are trying to get a fair and impartial jury both for the defendant and the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-9\">You appreciate that fact, don't you ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-10\">The answer was \u201cYes\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">The prosecutor explained carefully and correctly the indictment for first degree murder, the jury function including that \u201ca person found guilty of murder in the first degree is subjected to the death penalty, unless the jury, after a consideration of all of the testimony and his Honor\u2019s instructions as to the law, recommends life imprisonment, in which ease no other punishment shall be given.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-13\">In examination by the defense attorney the following questions and answers occurred :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-14\">\u201cQ. Now, we are looking for a group of men and women as jurors in this case who can approach the case with an open mind, who can approach it without any prejudice or bias, who will give the defendant the benefit of every reasonable doubt that might arise from the evidence and give the defendant a fair and impartial trial. Do you feel that you fall within that class of person? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-15\">Q. Do you know of any reason whatsoever why you can\u2019t sit in this case and decide it solely upon the evidence ? A. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-16\">Mr. Jones was accepted as a juror.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-17\">The examination of the second person called was indicative of the careful insistence of the judge that the jurors have no bias or prejudice. The court\u2019s questions and the candidate\u2019s answers were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aux\">\u201cBy The Court :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-18\">Q. Do you mean that you could not decide this case strictly and wholly on the evidence and the charge of the Court? A. I am afraid not. This friend is still very critical.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-19\">Q. Because of that experience you think that will intrude upon your deliberations here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-20\">A. Yes.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-21\">The court asked the third prospect \u201cYou are saying that in no event would you vote-for the death penalty?\u201d The answer was \u201cYes, Your Honor.\u201d The prosecution challenged for cause and this was allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-22\">The defense led off with the questioning of the next member:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-23\">\u201cQ. You realize that this is a case in which the defendant is charged with murder and that the prosecutor is seeking the death penalty. Do you know any reason why you could not sit in this case and try and determine it without any bias or prejudice one way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>or the other and arrive at a verdict in the case? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\">The Court: You don\u2019t know any reason why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">The Juror: No, I don\u2019t have any reason.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Both sides again stressed that they wanted a jury with an open mind without any bias or prejudice one way or the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">The above was the pattern of the voir dire interrogation of the entire 154 men and women examined. A proportionately great number of them stated an abiding objection to capital punishment and were properly excused. Others had physical conditions, the care of sick relatives and business reasons which rightly called for being released from service. To a large extent the above conditions developed immediately and were passed upon at once. Therefore in those instances the prime questions above detailed were not asked. In every other examination which reached the fundamentals of the prospect\u2019s ability to judge the evidence without bias or prejudice, etc., the absolute necessity of those people selected as jurors being absolutely fair and impartial was constantly and strongly impressed upon the individual panelists and the whole group present. Some of these had read newspaper stories of the killing involved and had thereby become prejudiced and were excused for that reason. Others had not been affected by newspaper stories. The forty-seventh person examined had read newspaper articles and had been influenced by them. He said \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know as I couldn\u2019t sit on the jury but I don\u2019t believe I would turn a man loose to do it the third time.\u201d The prosecutor who was interrogating immediately advised the court that he believed \u201c * * * this man has certain opinions concerning this case * * The defense examined the man at length and he said \u201c * * * I would endeavor to do my best, to start all over\u201d, but he was hot sure he could. The judge from the bench once more detailed the sine qua non in order to qualify for service on the jury saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-11\">\u201cQ. And you are further saying, I take it, that you could not decide this case solely and wholly on the evidence that\u2019s adduced in this courtroom and on my charge, that your reading of the newspaper article would intrude itself upon your consideration ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-12\">A. Of course I haven\u2019t heard all the evidence. There could be a change of opinion that way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-13\">Q. Are you saying that you could not decide this ease wholly and solely on the evidence which is adduced in this courtroom and my charge of the law? Is that what you are saying? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-14\">Q. You could not do that? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-15\">The Court: I will grant your motion I will excuse him for cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aj-dedup-0\">Throughout the complete, searching questioning of the 154 persons called for jury service there is not the slightest intimation that anything mentioned during the venire interrogation affected those examined later in even the slightest degree. Where such item was referred to at all, it was substantially as with the twenty-fifth person called whom the defense queried as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-16\">\u201cQ. Now, do you know anything about this case other than what you have heard about it here? A. That\u2019s all, what I heard here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-17\">Q. Do you know of any reason why you couldn\u2019t sit on this jury and arrive at a verdict in accordance with the evidence adduced in the trial? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-18\">Q. If you were selected as a juror in this case do you think you could approach the case with an open mind? A. I could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-19\">Q. Would you be able to presume and consider the defendant as innocent throughout the trial until you heard all of the evidence and the Judge\u2019s charge? A. I could.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-20\">The forty-eighth person examined immediately after number forty-seven above mentioned, was suffering from a nervous disability and because of it was excused. The forty-ninth member of the venire was taking care of his sister seri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>ously ill with asthma, and was excused without other questioning. The fiftieth one was excused by reason of his opposition to capital punishment. The fifty-first, fifty-second, fifty-third and fifty-fourth were let go for reasons of business, health, opposition to capital punishment and again, health.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">The fifty-fifth person called, a lady, very well illustrates the total lack of impact upon the venire of previous questioning of and comment by members of the panel as they were examined one by one. She was asked, \u201cWell, have you formed any definite opinion with regard to this case?\u201d She answered <em>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about this case.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The only other instance of any reference whatsoever to the .prior crime was by the 151st talesman called. He after 3% pages of examination by counsel, was asked by the trial judge \u201cWell, are you saying that from a reading of the newspaper accounts of this case you have come to a conclusion as to the guilt or innocence of this defendant? Is that right? A. Well, yes. The fact that this man had done this before * * That was everything said by the talesman on the point. The judge continued to examine him, finally asking, \u201cWell, will you decide this case solely on the evidence which is heard here in this courtroom?\u201d The answer was <em>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied). Counsel queried \u201cCan you approach this case with an open mind?\u201d The court said \u201cWell can you? It\u2019s a very simple question.\u201d The answer was \u201cWell, yes, sure, surely.\u201d Counsel, stating that the presumption of innocence of a defendant in any criminal ease \u201c * * * cannot be removed from him unless and until, after a consideration of all the evidence, you find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d, then asked the juror, \u201cCan you approach this case and sit through the trial of it understanding that and bearing that foremost in your mind ?\u201d Answer \u201cI can\u201d. Asked that \u201cIf after a consideration of the evidence in this case you have a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of this defendant, would you acquit him\u201d, the talesman replied \u201cIf I had a reasonable doubt, well, I guess so, yes, sir. Q. <em>Are you sure? </em>A. <em>Yes sir.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">The voir dire examinations of every one of the venire down to and including the last person questioned (who was the 154th panel member passed upon) have been conscientiously studied. With no reservation, that thorough check out of all the 154 separate examinations reveals that the remarks of Nos. 47 and 151 are the sole such comment in the record. If they were heard by anyone other than counsel and the court, it is fair to conclude that no attention was paid them. Actually there was no reference to either remark thereafter directly or indirectly. Indeed it is obvious from the entire voir dire record that the venire generally attached no importance to what was said in the course of the interrogations. There are several specific instances of that, two of these illustrate the overall feeling. The seventieth person examined and who was chosen as a juror was asked by the defense and answered as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-9\">\u201cQ. Do you feel that if you were selected as a juror you could approach this case with an open mind? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-10\">Q. Have you read anything about this case? A. No, sir, I have not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-11\">Q. Has anyone talked to you about it? A. No, sir, only what I heard here since yesterday. That\u2019s all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-12\">Q. Other than what you heard in the courtroom is the only thing you have heard? A. Yes, that\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-13\">Q. So that you have no feelings or no thoughts one way or the other. A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-14\">Q. And if you are selected as a juror in this case would you be willing to give the defendant every reasonable doubt that arose from the evidence or lack of evidence in this case ? A. Yes, I would, sir, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-15\">Q. And are you willing to start out the case with an open mind presuming the defendant to be innocent of the charge? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>The 116th venireman was questioned by the defense attorney and answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-5\">\u201cQ. Mr. Jinks, in what section of Belleville is William Street? A. The valley; below the avenue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">Q. Yes, I know where you mean. If you were selected as a juror in this case, would you approach the case with an open mind, presuming the defendant to be innocent of the charge? A. I would, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">Q. Have you read anything about this case? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">Q. Have you heard anything about the case other than what you have heard here in the courtroom ? A. No, just in the jury room, just odds and ends.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-9\">Q. And from what- A. Of no importance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-11\">Q. What? A. No importance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-12\">Q. And from what you have heard, have you any preconceived idea as to the innocence or guilt of the defendant? A. No, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-13\">There was no motion to discharge the venire because of the remarks by Nos. 47 and 151 or anything further regarding them. We are firmly convinced that this was in the exercise of sound judgment by the competent, widely experienced defense lawyers. As is seen the prosecution had nothing to do with the incidents other than to end the first one at once by its matter of fact motion. The second instance affirmatively establishes that talesman No. 151, once he understood his duty as juror, completely accepted his responsibility to act in accordance therewith. We are also satisfied from the whole record that there was no harm to defendant, certainly no substantial harm, by reason of the remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-14\">The entire selection of the jury was in strict accord with the landmark New Jersey voir dire opinion in State v. Rios, 17 N.J. 572, 112 A.2d 247 (1955). See also In the Matter of the Petition of Forcella for a Writ of Habeas Corpus, 40 N.J. 309 (1963), concurring opinion, Schettino, J., 311, et seq., 191 A.2d 472, 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-15\">This brings us to the oral argument contention that defendant\u2019s prior crime was injected directly into this trial by the prosecution. The statement is made on behalf of appellant that \u201c * * * the Prosecutor erroneously states (a) that the defense disclosed the first 1948 killing to the jury;\u201d. The transcript shows that this is exactly what defendant himself did and even a cursory reading of it reveals it not as appellant\u2019s brief would have it \u201c* * * a wild attempt at mitigation * * * but an elaborate, skillfully stated life story by the defendant covering down to and including the slaying before us. This took 32 transcript pages to unfold in direct examination. In that testimony defendant gave a detailed account of what he asserted he knew regarding the 1948 crime to which as he stated he \u201cpleaded non vult to second degree murder.\u201d He explained at length that as to the 1948 crime he had no recollection of hitting his wife over the head with a cue stick and after that, shooting her.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-17\">In telling about the instant killing with his shotgun, defendant claimed that from just before the shooting he again knew nothing of what happened until after he was taken and put into a patrol wagon by the police. The cross-examination was directed against the credibility of that story. This was not only properly motivated but the prosecutor would have been affirmatively neglecting his duty had he failed to so act. If defendant\u2019s narrative had been believed by the jury it would have at least saved him from a first degree murder conviction. His own evidence plainly indicates that it was a shrewdly planned, carefully contrived effort to achieve that result. His basic strategy was to plausibly account for the damning fact that he in a similar crime of violence twelve years before had shot and killed his wife. He claimed as stated that he had blacked out at that time and had no knowledge of what he had done. He virtually repeated that same kind of tale about his wanton slaying of Miss Wetzel, i. e. that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>he had again blacked out and did not remember anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Far from the state having any connection with the introduction of appellant\u2019s murder of his wife back in 1948, it was appellant on direct examination who, after giving that whole awful account, went into elaborate detail about pleading non vult to second degree murder, being sentenced \u201cto twenty-five to thirty, and served ten years and thirteen days.\u201d After that he told about his hearing before the Parole Board in 1958, how he was paroled January 6, 1959, how he had met Miss Wetzel while he was in prison and she was visiting another inmate, how he contacted Miss Wetzel after he returned home and that they became engaged and on and on for 19 more pages of direct examination which wound up with him on February 4, 1960 drinking and quarreling with Miss Wetzel. His lawyer at that point asked Forcella \u201cThen what happened?\u201d Forcella replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d All that had happened was that Forcella with his shotgun had shot Miss Wetzel to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Appellant urges that our decisions in United States ex rel. Scoleri v. Banmiller, 310 F.2d 720 (3 Cir. 1962) and United States ex rel. Rucker v. Myers, 311 F.2d 311 (3 Cir. 1962) are pertinent to this issue. The problem in those decisions has no bearing upon the precise factual situation before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Out of all the remaining assertions of appellant there is one more contention now stressed which of necessity must be presented in some detail. It is said in appellant\u2019s brief that \u201cForcella was denied due process of law by the suppression of evidence on his behalf both by the State of New Jersey and with the knowledge of the State\u2019s representatives.\u201d At this stage what is left of the above charge concerns the appearance of Chairman Ashby of the State Parole Board as a witness subpoenaed by the defense. The State of New Jersey, appearing by an Assistant Attorney General, was opposed to the Chairman being a witness. There was a conference between the court and all the attorneys. An affidavit by one of the trial defense lawyers, submitted by appellant, states what then occurred, \u201cA discussion as to what Mr. Ashby would testify to and as to what records were privileged ensued. As a result a stipulation was entered into in open court regarding the New Jersey Parole Board records.\u201d In compliance with the above the report of the Parole Board\u2019s supervising psychiatric consultant on his pre-parole hearing examination of Fbrcella was turned over to the defense. That examination had been made in August, 1958 and the written report of same given the Board later. Forcella was released on parole January 6, 1959, after having served ten years in prison. The report was introduced into evidence as a defense exhibit and read to the jury by the senior defense lawyer. The expressed interest then and at this time by the defense in the Parole Board evidence was and is in the alleged blackouts of Forcella while confined.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">The report characterizes Forcella \u201c* * * functioning in the bright average intellectual range with potentials that go to the superior to very superior range.\u201d It should be mentioned in this connection that Forcella testified that he had studied law and had served as law clerk with Newark lawyers for seventeen years. His testimony covers 100 pages of the transcript. The type of witness he made could be gleaned from almost any portion of his evidence. A fair example is the following on his direct examination in chief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-10\">\u201cQ. Did you ever use the term in talking to Marion'or did you ever refer to her as \u2018you bitch\u2019? A. That\u2019s right, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-11\">Q. And what did you mean by that? A. My interpretation of bitch is supine, clever, in business acumen, wise, worldly-wise, intelligent. She was wise and she was intelligent, shrewd.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-12\">The above mentioned psychiatrist was a defense witness. He categorically stated that Forcella in the one and a half to two hour examination did not complain to him of any blackouts during the time he was confined to State\u2019s Prison. As a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>fitting finale to the blackout evidence there is Foreella\u2019s own fantastic story on the question of prison blackouts. On direct examination he testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-4\">\u201cQ. Now you were in prison from Christmas, 1948, until January 6, 1959, were you not? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-5\">Q. During that period of time did you ever have any spells where you lost all recollection of what had happened? A. A half a dozen times, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">Q. And will you tell us when these occurred and what occurred? A. Well, five or six times they occurred in the cell, and when I would wake up it would be as if I was just coming out of a state of suspended animation. Three or four times they tell me I was walking around there with mouth open, eyes in the air.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">On cross-examination appears the following :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-8\">\u201cQ. As I understand it, you testified while you were in State\u2019s Prison you blacked out about six or seven times ? A. That\u2019s right, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-9\">Q. Is that correct, sir, when I say six or seven times? A. That\u2019s right, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-10\">Q. Or was it more than that? A. Well, I can only remember that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-11\">Q. Do you always remember when you black out? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-12\">Q. But you remember six or seven times? A. That is correct. Because I used to walk around in a trance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-13\">Q. Who told you you walked around in a trance ? A. The inmates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-14\">Q. <em>How about the guards? </em>A. <em>Well, they didn\u2019t know it.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-15\">Q. Do you recall when is the first you blacked out? Was it in State\u2019s Prison or Rahway? A. At Rahway, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-16\">Q. And when was it, sir? A. The second year I was there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-17\">Q. How did you find out that you had blacked out? A. Some inmate that was there, that lived in Camden, saw me walking around in a trance, he said, and he was leading me around.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-19\">Q. <em>Did you report it to the guard? </em>A. <em>No, sir.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-20\">Q. <em>Did you report it to the institutional doctor? </em>A. <em>Well they don\u2019t do that, the inmates.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-21\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-22\">Q. You say you recall six or seven times that you blacked out. On each of those occasions did you ever report it to the doctor? A. <em>No, sir, I </em>just\u2014 <em>I just report severe migraine headaches to the doctors.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-23\">Q. Did you ever report to the doctors that you suffered a blackout while you were in these institutions? A. Sometimes I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-24\">Q. What? A. I believe I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-25\">Q. When did you report it? A. I don\u2019t know, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-26\">Q. Well, see if you can approximate the time. The first blackout you had, when did you report that, sir? A. I wouldn\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-27\">Q. Did you report the first blackout? A. I certainly did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-28\">Q. <em>You did report the blackout? A. I didn\u2019t report the blackout, I report severe migraine headaches, that I was blacking out.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-29\">Q. <em>Did you tell them you were blacking out? A. No, sir.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-30\">Q. <em>You did not? A. No, sir.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-31\">After that the witness switched his story. Asked, \u201cAnd when you reported the so-called migraine headaches, did you report to any doctor or anyone in authority that you had blacked out? A. That\u2019s right, half a dozen times.\u201d A little further into his testimony he said he suffered his first blackout in State\u2019s Prison after being there two and one half months; that three people were in the cell with him; that he doesn\u2019t know their names. After that he said \u201cI was taken out of the cell and brought to a hospital * * * by the officer \u2014 the guard that was on duty.\u201d He doesn\u2019t know the name of the guard. Asked \u201cAnd were you taken to the institution hospital?\u201d He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>answered <em>\u201cI walked to the institution hospital.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied). Even in this detail there seems to be some defense confusion as to what the witness did really claim in his various contradictory statements. Asked regarding his Rahway imprisonment, <em>\u2018\u2018Now, do you recall telling any doctors at Rahway that you had blacked out?\u201d </em>His answer was <em>\u2018\u2018No\u201d. </em>(Emphasis supplied). Right after that, he changed his answer and said, \u201cYes I told the doctor that visit that morning.\u201d He did not know the doctor\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Forcella was recalled to the stand, as the last witness in the trial. The short direct and cross-examination starkly reveals the net product of his endeavors to support the theory of prison blackouts. \u201cDirect examination by Mr. Sommer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-5\">Q. <em>Mr. Forcella, it has been testified here that on a number of occasions you were treated, while you were in prison, for migraine headaches. </em>Will you tell us what brought on those headaches ? A. <em>When I used to blank out. </em>When I woke up, when I came to, I had pounding headaches from the top of the head all the ways down to the bottom of the neck for about thirteen hours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">Q. And did you tell the doctors of that condition? A. <em>I told the doctor about the pounding, about the severe headaches.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-7\">Q. <em>And did they ask any other questions about it? A. No other questions.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-8\">Mr. Sommer: That is all. You may cross-examine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-9\">Cross-examination by Mr. Lordi:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-10\">Q. You say you told the doctors about the severe pounding at the back of your head? A. That\u2019s right, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-11\">Q. And you say the severe headaches were brought on by these blackouts? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-12\">Q. Did you tell them about the severe pounding ? A. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-13\">Q. <em>Did you tell them about the blackouts? A. I did not; he did not ask. </em>(Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-14\">Mr. Lordi: No further questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-15\">Mr. Sommer: The defense rests.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-16\">In the light of the above evidence, the citations advanced favoring the present argument for appellant on this issue have no bearing here. We have before us what was in fact a simple, fundamental incident of trial practice. Senior counsel for the defendant was one of the top criminal lawyers of the State. He was and is of the highest standing at the bar and was assigned to this defense by the New Jersey Superior Court. His junior associate was and is one of the finest type lawyers in that trial area. Those attorneys, as their considered opinion under all the peculiar circumstances decided it was unwise from the defendant\u2019s standpoint to become involved in a controversy with the head of the State Parole Board over the question of whether the Board\u2019s proceedings were privileged. Sound thinking was bound to conclude that no good could come from the records, if any. Certainly on the defendant\u2019s clear admissions there was nothing in them about blackouts. Assuming the improbable, if there was some note regarding migraine headaches, the one thing the defendant was consistent about was that his stated headaches came <em>after </em>the so-called blackouts. There was no medical evidence of connection between the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-17\"> For the purposes of this appeal the defense trial strategy is criticized. From the clear facts before us it was a justified decision by trial counsel. There was no suppression of evidence by the State of New Jersey. Nor was there any star chamber proceeding. It was a proper trial conference between the court and all the attorneys. It was within the authority of the defense counsel. State v. McMillan, 65 N.J.Super. 478, 483, 168 A.2d 81 (App.Div.1961); State v. Bentley, 46 N.J.Super. 193, 201-202, 134 A.2d 445 (App.Div.1957). It was the same sort of proper trial conference that goes on daily ir. every trial court. The result of that conference was placed on the record in open court in the presence of the defendant. There was nothing technical about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>it. In lieu of the Parole Board Chairman being called as a witness the psychiatric report was given the defense. If For-cella had not agreed to that, he could have, and with his background and personality, it is not too much to presume, would have so told his attorneys. The district judge brings this frivolous claim of \u201csuppressed evidence\u201d sharply into focus and soundly disposes of it in his opinion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-5\">\u201cIt appears from the transcript that certain stipulations were entered into between respective counsel. The stipulations obviated the appearance of a Superior Court Judge and the Chairman of the State Parole Board, both of whom had been subpoenaed by the defense. It was stipulated, and it appears in the record, that if the Judge had been called he would have testified that on an occasion Forcella visited him in his Chambers to inquire of him whether he would perform a marriage ceremony between defendant and the decedent. This merely corroborated testimony given by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-6\">\u201cThe other stipulation was that if the Chairman of the Parole Board had been called he would have testified that a psychiatric report, which was admitted into evidence and read to the jury, was submitted to the Board in August, 1958 and after a hearing in September, a parole was granted effective January 6, 1959.' There was no contention made that the stipulations were not in accord with the facts which were submitted to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">\u201cThese stipulations, which were worked out between counsel and the Court, did in no wise impair the fairness of the petitioner\u2019s trial. \u2018In New Jersey as in other states, it is settled that an attorney in a criminal case has implied authority to make stipulations and agreements incidental to the management of the defense in matters of trial procedure and the defendant is bound thereby.\u2019 State v. Ciniglio, 57 N.J.Super. 399, 406 [154 A.2d 845] (App.Div.1959), cert. denied 31 N.J. 295 [157 A.2d 364] (1960). However, although Forcella was not present when the stipulations were made he was present when his attorney placed them on the record in open Court. Under such circumstances, we can assume that he consented to his attorney\u2019s procedure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-9\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-10\">\u201cThe petitioner\u2019s brief attempts by way of innuendo and aspersion to challenge the propriety of the matters discussed in Chambers. It is not unusual in a trial of extended duration for the Court to confer with counsel in Chambers in regard to various problems and procedural matters which may arise. The defendant is safeguarded in these proceedings by the presence of his counsel. Matters such as jury instructions are in the legal province of the Court and the petitioner\u2019s brief itself labels this \u2018not significant in itself\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">We have closely examined all other points urged on behalf of the appellant. They are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b101-13\">FREEDMAN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AJY\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-14\">I respectfully dissent. The majority opinion has powerfully depicted the fairness of the trial judge in the conduct of the proceedings by referring to the numerous instances in which jurors were excused for cause and others were given the opportunity to say whether they were open-minded. It has concluded from this that the jury before whom the appellant was tried for his life had not been infected by any prejudice and that in any event the jury\u2019s knowledge that he had committed an earlier murder did him no harm because it was connected with his defense that he had blacked out, as he had also claimed on the first murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-15\">The undisputed principle which is our starting place is that evidence of appellant\u2019s murder of his wife under similar circumstances twelve years before would not have been admissible here, since such evidence, although relevant, is inherently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>and unduly prejudicial. Michelson v. United States, 335 U.S. 469, 475-476, 69 S.Ct. 213, 93 L.Ed. 168 (1948); see United States ex rel. Scoleri v. Banmiller, 310 F.2d 720 (3 Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 374 U.S. 828, 83 S.Ct. 1866, 10 L.Ed.2d 1051 (1963); United States ex rel. Lowry v. Myers, 364 F.2d 297 (3 Cir. 1966). Yet here it was the appellant\u2019s counsel in his opening statement, and the appellant himself on direct and cross-examination, who brought in the circumstances of the prior murder. The majority attributes this to trial strategy on behalf of the appellant. It seems to me at least equally attributable to the fact that the prior murder had already been revealed in the course of the <em>voir dire </em>examination and to the Hobson\u2019s choice that faced the trial strategist of either ignoring the devastating fact of the prior murder or encountering it head on and emphasizing the circumstances of blackout which the appellant had claimed surrounded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">There are two instances in which the fact of the prior murder was mentioned in the presence of the venire. After four jurors had been impaneled a venireman whom the prosecutor asked whether he could sit on the jury, replied: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know as I couldn\u2019t sit on the jury but I don\u2019t believe I would turn a man loose to do it the third time.\u201d This was not the only such remark. After thirteen jurors had been impaneled<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> another venireman in acknowledging that he had read newspaper accounts of the crime referred also to the prior murder. When asked by defense counsel whether the newspaper accounts led him to a conclusion as to the appellant\u2019s guilt his reply was: \u201cWell, yes. The fact that the man had done this before' \u2014 .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">What the majority opinion calls \u201cthe damning fact\u201d that appellant had shot and killed his wife twelve years earlier was therefore twice mentioned by prospective jurors in the presence of the panel and of those jurors who had already been selected to serve. I therefore believe that it cannot be said that defense counsel\u2019s trial tactics were not traceable to a fear of how the jury might be affected by knowledge of the prior murder if the appellant had not attempted to explain it. Whatever may be said the other way, sufficient doubt hovers over the question which in a death case, we must resolve in favor of the accused. As Mr. Justice Reed stated in Andres v. United States, 333 U.S. 740, 752, 68 S.Ct. 880, 886, 92 L.Ed. 1055 (1948): \u201cIn death cases doubts such as those presented here should be resolved in favor of the accused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">It is true that no objection was made at the time by appellant\u2019s counsel, but it is equally true that the court made no effort to remove the harmful effect of this information from the minds of the jurors. The New Jersey courts, as the majority points out, permit <em>voir dire </em>questioning to be conducted in the presence of the entire panel. State v. Rios, 17 N.J. 572, 112 A.2d 247, 254-256 (1955). But they also have been quick to recognize the possibility of prejudice to a defendant in this procedure and therefore have held that the trial judge should respond to the disclosure of improper facts either by admonishing the jury to disregard them or by declaring a mistrial. State v. Hunt, 25 N.J. 514, 138 A.2d 1, 12 (1958); State v. Ernst, 32 N.J. 567, 161 A.2d 511, 515 (1960), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 943, 81 S.Ct. 464, 5 L.Ed.2d 374 (1961). Neither course was followed here, although the wrong was twice committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Nor do I believe the record justifies the assertion that appellant\u2019s claim of blackouts inevitably would have driven him to the recitation of the circumstances of the murder of his wife twelve years earlier. There is enough in the record, including his counsel\u2019s opening statement and appellant\u2019s own testimony, to indicate that he could have attempted to show blackouts while imprisoned for the first offense. Indeed, it is difficult to perceive the shrewdness and cunning attributed to the appellant in paralleling his defense here to that in the prior case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>in which he pleaded non vult and was sentenced to imprisonment for second degree murder, when he could have made the claim of blackouts in prison without going into the circumstances of the prior crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">I would hold, therefore, that appellant was denied due process of law because the jury that tried him was one in whose presence two veniremen had referred to the prior murder without even an admonition from the judge that these statements should be disregarded. I am unable to accept the notion of a courtroom so sterilized that none of the jurors who had already been selected and the large number of veniremen in attendance was infected in the slightest degree by the express statements that the appellant in a widely publicized murder charge had also committed an earlier murder. I am therefore unable to agree that the defense in laying before the jury the detailed circumstances of the prior murder was simply pursuing the tactical maneuver of claiming that he had suffered earlier blackouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">This leads me to another claim of the appellant\u2019s able counsel. Appellant had subpoenaed the Chairman of the New Jersey Parole Board to produce certain Parole Board records. On the Chairman\u2019s arrival, accompanied by an Assistant Attorney General who opposed his giving testimony, counsel for both sides were called into the judge\u2019s chambers, where neither the appellant nor the court reporter was present. An affidavit of appellant\u2019s trial counsel alleges that after the state opposed admission of the Chairman\u2019s testimony and of the records the parties agreed on the admission of one document, the psychiatric report of the prison\u2019s consulting psychiatrist, who testified at the trial. Appellant claims that the suppressed reports would have aided his defense of blackout by demonstrating the truth of his assertion that he had blacked out in the early weeks of his original imprisonment and had been carried to the prison hospital by guards.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">In the leading case of Snyder v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 54 S.Ct. 330, 78 L.Ed. 674 (1934) it was held that due process does not require that a defendant be present when the jury and trial counsel are taken to the scene of the alleged crime for a view. Mr. Justice Cardozo there stated that a defendant\u2019s presence is constitutionally required only when he can contribute something to his defense by being present. The proper application of this test is demonstrated by two recent cases in the Fourth Circuit. In Near v. Cunningham, 313 F.2d 929 (4 Cir. 1963), the exclusion of the defendant in a state trial from the judge\u2019s chambers, where an agreement was made among the trial judge and counsel not to sequester the jury during recesses of the court, was held to violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process where the decision resulted in exposing the jury to prejudicial remarks. On the other hand, in Root v. Cunningham, 344 F.2d 1, 4-5 (4 Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 866, 86 S.Ct. 135, 15 L.Ed.2d 104 (1965), it was held that the defendant had no constitutional right to be present during the consideration of instructions by the trial judge and counsel in chambers where there was no evidence of resulting prejudice. Reconciling the two cases, the court said that the defendant\u2019s presence would have been important in <em>Near, </em>but useless in <em>Root: </em>\u201cNear \u2022 * * had a better opportunity to know the attitudes of these people [in and outside the courtroom] than his attorney or the court * * Under such circumstances, had he been permitted to attend the conference, he could have informed the court of this hostility and, perhaps, thus prevented the making of the decision which exposed the jury to it to his disadvantage.\u201d In <em>Root, </em>however, only legal points beyond Root\u2019s competence were discussed outside his presence. 344 F.2d at 4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">In my view the present case is stronger than the situation in the <em>Near </em>case. Appellant was prejudiced by his absence from the conference which deprived him of possible evidence of prior blackouts while in prison, a subject of supreme importance to his defense. It was not a le<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>gal technicality beyond appellant\u2019s grasp, for the contribution he could have made at the hearing in chambers on the parole records would have come from his personal knowledge of the facts, not his opinion on the law. It is a striking illustration of the familiar circumstance that counsel inevitably requires the presence of the client to bring to his attention those facts which are peculiarly within the client\u2019s own knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Because of the grave prejudice to the appellant resulting from the disclosure at the <em>voir dire </em>of a prior murder and because of his exclusion from the proceeding in chambers involving the Parole Board records, I cannot entertain that assurance that the defendant received a fair trial which alone would justify sending him to his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">I therefore repectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-9\">.
