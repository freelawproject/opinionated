Fry Roofing Company and two of its officers violated Section 2(a) of the Clayton Act (15 USC \u00a7 13(a)) by engaging in territorial price discriminations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s opinion is reported in 3 Trade Regulation Reporter j[ 17,303 (1965). The pertinent parts of its findings are summarized here.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-21\">Lloyd A. Fry Roofing Company (\u201cFry\u201d) is a Delaware corporation with its principal office and place of business in Summit, Illinois. Fry is the nation\u2019s largest producer of asphalt roofing products. There are nine other major manufacturers of asphalt roofing products and a large group of smaller manufacturers, the independents.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>In 1956-1960, Fry operated 19 asphalt plants throughout the United States. In 1958, it sold 14.2% of the nation\u2019s asphalt saturated felt, the product involved in the proceedings before the Commission. Asphalt saturated felt is used in the roofing industry as a moisture barrier under shingles. It is also used on \u201cbuilt-up\u201d roofs which consist of several layers of such felt bonded together with <em>hot </em>asphalt.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Roughly, Fry\u2019s customers are classified into wholesalers and retail dealers. One of Fry\u2019s principal customers is Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., a retailer purchasing at wholesale prices totaling $5,000,000 per annum during 1956 through 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Before February 1956, Fry sold at prices five to seven percent below the other majors\u2019 published prices. However, in this industry, published prices are not always the actual prices but are varied to meet competitive needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">In February 1956, Fry revised its price schedule. It increased its prices everywhere in the United States east of the \u2019Rockies. The new price list was based on freight equalization factors. In Knoxville, Tennessee, the critical market area here,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the new list price was $2.55 per roll for 60-pound rolls of 15 and 30-pound asphalt saturated felt.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The other majors followed this price change, and also made Knoxville a factory point for pricing.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">In the Knoxville, Tennessee, market area, two of Fry\u2019s competitors were Vo-lasco Products Company and The Ohio Paper Company. Volasco was organized in 1955 to manufacture and sell asphalt roofing products. Its plant was in Knoxville, Tennessee, and its principal competitors included Fry and the other nine majors and The Ohio Paper Company, another independent. The Commission found that because of Volasco\u2019s natural freight advantage, it could profitably sell to dealers within the Knoxville market area in less than carload shipments at prices substantially lower than Fry\u2019s delivered prices for similar quantities there.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">The Ohio Paper Company is located in Miamisburg, Ohio, and sold asphalt saturated felt in eastern Tennessee from 1955 to 1958 at 5% below the published prices of the majors. However, it stopped doing business in Tennessee in 1958 because prices were so low that it would be selling at a loss. It blamed Fry\u2019s low prices for its withdrawal from Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">From February to November 1956, Vo-lasco was selling felt to dealers in less than carload lots in the Knoxville area at prices ranging from $2.01 to $2.25 per roll. In August 1956, Fry\u2019s list price in Knoxville was $2.62 per roll. However, on November 1,1956, Fry lowered its list price to $2.36 per roll less a 5% secret rebate. The Commission found that Fry\u2019s prices to Knoxville customers were subsequently at or below Volasco\u2019s costs. During the relevant period, Fry\u2019s prices on asphalt saturated felt were higher in other felt factory areas than in the Knoxville area. In fact, until February 1, 1960, Fry maintained a price difference between Knoxville and other felt factory markets east of the Rockies.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-13\">Before November 1956, Volasco\u2019s sales of asphalt saturated felt had been increasing. Thereafter its sales diminished. Finally, because of low prices, Volasco sold felt only to its established customers instead of seeking new business.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-14\">The Commission found that Fry\u2019s February 1956 zoning price system was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>adopted to combat price competition, and that this price increase was adopted the following day by all majors. However, the independents continued to sell below the majors\u2019 published prices. Consequently, in April 1956, Fry\u2019s president agreed to \u201ctake corrective action\u201d if the market did not become stabilized within 30 days. In the Knoxville market area, Volasco and Ohio Paper continued to sell at lower prices, and Fry took its \u201ccorrective\u201d list price reduction there in November 1956. The Commission also found that Volasco\u2019s presence in Knoxville prompted Fry and the other majors to adopt their discriminatory price reductions and to make Knoxville a delivered-price basing point. The majors continued to maintain higher prices in areas where they were not competing with Vo-lasco or other small independents.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">The Commission found that Fry had initiated the price reduction of March 3, 1958, reducing prices to their lowest level in the Knoxville area. The Commission concluded that in making the Knoxville area discriminations, Fry had acted with predatory intent, with the purpose of disciplining small independent concerns selling below the prices established by Fry and followed by the, other majors. The Commission rejected Fry\u2019s contentions that Volasco\u2019s losses were due to causes other than the territorial price discriminations.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The Commission concluded that there was a reasonable possibility that independents would be eliminated or seriously debilitated by Fry\u2019s discriminatory practices, and that their removal as viable competitors would adversely affect price competition generally in the Knoxville area and substantially injure competition with Fry. Finally, it rejected Fry\u2019s claim that its discriminatory lower prices in the Knoxville area were made in good faith to meet competition, as permitted by Section 2(b) of the Robinson-Patman Act (15 USC \u00a7 13(b)). Fry has not reiterated that defense here.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\n<em>Territorial Price Discriminations.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\"> The relevant portion of Section 2(a) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, provides (15 USC \u00a7 13(a)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-11\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or indirectly, to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, where either or any of the purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce, where such commodities are sold for use, consumption, or resale within the United States or any Territory thereof or the District of Columbia or any insular possession or other place under the jurisdiction of the United States, and where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them . * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">One of the purposes of this provision is to protect manufacturers from discriminatory practices of their competitors. Its viability in primary line competition eases was reiterated in Federal Trade Commission v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 363 U.S. 536, 544-545, 80 S.Ct. 1267, 4 L.Ed.2d 1385. As Commissioner Elman\u2019s concurring opinion observes in the present case, territorial price differences are not invalid <em>per se, </em>for the statute requires that there be a reasonable probability of injury to competition. Injury to a competitor is not the test; the test is injury to competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-13\">In most primary line cases under this statute, a violation cannot be established without a close study of the market, including data as to the discriminator\u2019s share of the market. However, in cases of predatory intent, \u201cinjury to even a single competitor should bring the Act into play\u201d. Attorney General\u2019s National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws (1955) p. 165; Rowe, Price Discrimination under the Robinson-Patman Act (1962) pp. 145, 149. An intent to harm competitors distinguishes anti-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>competitive price cutting from competitive activity not meant to be prohibited per <em>se </em>by the Robinson-Patman Act. An illicit intent serves to show the substan-tiality and probability of the competitive effects that may result from the price reductions. If, as here, the price reductions are substantial and prolonged, it is proper to invoke the statute to curb the discriminatory pricing. Sunderland, \u201cTerritorial Price Differentials Under the Robinson-Patman Act\u201d, 41 Chicago Bar Record 121, 128 (1959); Edwards, Maintaining Competition (1949) p. 170, note 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Since the Commission\u2019s finding of Fry\u2019s predatory intent is supported by the record, we conclude that it was unnecessary for the Commission to engage in an elaborate market study. As this Court stated in Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission, 289 F.2d 835, 843 (7th Cir. 1961):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\"><em>\u201cIf </em>* * * projection [to ascertain the future effect of the price reductions made by the territorial price discriminator] is based upon predatoriness or buccaneering, it can reasonably be forecast that an adverse effect on competition <em>may </em>occur. In that event, the discriminations in their incipiency are such that they <em>may </em>have the prescribed effect to establish a violation of \u00a7 2(a). If one engages in the latter type of pricing activity, a reasonable probability may be inferred that its willful misconduct may substantially lessen, injure, destroy or prevent competition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">See also Note, \u201cCompetitive Injury under the Robinson-Patman Act\u201d, 74 Harv.L. Rev. 1597, 1609 (1961); Von Kalinowski, \u201cPrice Discrimination and Competitive Effects\u201d, 17 ABA Antitrust Section 360, 366-368 (1960). In the absence of predation, market analysis is needed to show a violation of Section 2(a) in primary line cases. Rowe, op. cit., pp. 150-151.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The Commission\u2019s finding that Fry acted with predatory intent is supported by the evidence. Thus the record shows .that during the early 1950\u2019s, asphalt saturated felt capacity exceeded the demand, and a number of small independent manufacturers offered vigorous competition to the majors. Various large customers were able to compel low prices on this product. All this resulted in intense price competition by 1956.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">When Fry inaugurated its February 1956 basing point price increase, its president described the current price fluctuations as emanating from \u201clack of confidence in each other\u201d. Fry submitted the February 1956 price schedule as its answer to the marketing situation. The day after Fry\u2019s new pricing system became effective, all the majors adopted it, one of them noting that the effect would be \u201cto increase prices substantially.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">Mr. M\u00fasico, manager of the Fry plant which served the Knoxville area, described the February 1956 plan as one to \u201cclean up all this mess\u201d and noted that it had been adopted by the entire industry. Under that plan, he concluded that the roofing industry\u2019s house \u201cwill be clean, for the first time, as certainly there is no room for any such chiseling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">Although the majors were willing to match each other\u2019s higher prices, by February 1956, the independents were quoting lower prices on less than carload lots. Low prices of independents prompted Fry\u2019s president to write that Fry \u201cwill take corrective action\u201d in the event that the independents would not raise their prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-12\">After Fry adopted the February 1956 higher price system, Volasco and Ohio Paper Company continued to sell below the prices adopted by Fry and the other majors in the Knoxville area. On November 1, 1956, Fry inaugurated lower Knoxville list prices than it maintained in Chicago and other felt factory areas where only majors were competing with it. Until February 1, 1960, Fry continued to maintain lower prices in the Knoxville area than in those other areas. Fry\u2019s consistent undercutting of Volas-co\u2019s prices permits an inference of predatory purpose. Rowe, Price Discrimina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>tion under the Robinson-Patman Act (1962) pp. 146-147; Sunderland, \u201cTerritorial Price Differentials Under the Robinson-Patman Act,\u201d 41 Chicago Bar Record 121, 128 (1959). Moreover, Fry knowingly undercut its competitors\u2019 prices; its prices were not made to meet competition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The following price table <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> depicts significant examples of Fry\u2019s and Volasco\u2019s prices from February 1956 to August 1958:</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Time Fry\u2019s Fry\u2019s Fry\u2019s \u201cApproved List Dealer Distributors\u201d Volasco\u2019s Range</p>\n<p id=\"ACO\">2-19-56-$2.55 $2.25 $2.11 $2.01-2.14</p>\n<p id=\"AOG\">4-18-56</p>\n<p id=\"ap-dedup-0\">4-19-56-2.62 2.25 2.11 2.01-2.25</p>\n<p id=\"ahs-dedup-0\">6-14-56</p>\n<p id=\"A-E\">6-15-56-2.62 2.17 2.17 2.10- 2.25</p>\n<p id=\"afq-dedup-0\">8-13-56</p>\n<p id=\"Aup\">8-14-56-2.62 2.01 2.01 2.10- 2.25</p>\n<p id=\"Akd\">10-31-56 (Sizeable sales to McClung at 2.00)</p>\n<p id=\"add-dedup-0\">11-1-56-2.36 2.24 2.02 1.99- 2.25</p>\n<p id=\"Ag7\">2-3-57</p>\n<p id=\"Ath\">2- 4-57-2.17 2.06 1.86 1.99- 2.20</p>\n<p id=\"Ah4\">3- 15-57</p>\n<p id=\"Agkc\">7- 18-57-2.54 2.12 1.89 1.99- 2.00</p>\n<p id=\"AIY\">8- 18-57</p>\n<p id=\"AWz\">3- 3-58-3.60 1.69 1.52 1.73-1.90</p>\n<p id=\"a-e-dedup-0\">4- 3-58</p>\n<p id=\"ACH\">4-4-58-3.60 1.69 1.52 1.62-1.73</p>\n<p id=\"Avn\">8-31-58</p>\n<p id=\"b337-65\">After March 1958 and for at least six months, Fry\u2019s above-shown dealer and \u201capproved distributor\u201d prices were below Volaseo\u2019s costs, thus amply demonstrating the deep and sustained nature of Fry\u2019s price cutting. Although the price differential between Knoxville and Chicago decreased during this time, nevertheless, it remained substantial (27}S for \u201capproved distributors\u201d vice 36^). Another indication of Fry\u2019s motivation to discipline the small independents is its grant of a 52% discount to dealers and \u201capproved distributors\u201d in the Knoxville <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>market area (and other areas served by independents during this same period), which is the largest discount that it gave east of the Rockies (apart from certain areas of New York State).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">The Commission also found that Fry was the price leader and was responsible for its own and other majors\u2019 discriminatory low prices. Fry initiated the November 1956 list price reduction and almost all the later reductions. Even though some of the other majors were also discriminators,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that of course does not absolve Fry. The law of negligence imposes liability on an individual if his \u201cconduct is a substantial factor in bringing about the harm * * * \u201d. A.L.I. Restatement of the Law of Torts (2d) \u00a7 431. The principle surely applies to price discrimination because under Section 2 (a) there need be only a reasonable probability that the injury is the effect of the discrimination. Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 191 F.2d 786, 792 (7th Cir. 1951), certiorari dismissed, 344 U.S. 206, 73 S.Ct. 245, 97 L.Ed. 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The record reveals that Fry was the instigator of the majors\u2019 price changes during the relevant period. Thus we have seen that the other majors adopted Fry\u2019s basing-point pricing system the day after it became effective. They also copied most of Fry\u2019s subsequent price changes. Officers of The Ruberoid Company (one of the Majors), Volasco and Ohio Paper Company testified that Fry had been the price leader, and upon inquiry, Fry\u2019s chairman did not deny this. It is clear that Fry created and maintained the discriminatory system. As stated by the American Bar Association\u2019s Section of Antitrust Law, \u201cThere was no question that competitive injury resulted to the two competitors [Volasco and Ohio Paper] as the result of Fry\u2019s price dis-criminations.\u201d 31 ABA Antitrust Section 93 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-13\">In view of Fry\u2019s predatory intent and price leadership, the Commission properly concluded that the effect of Fry\u2019s territorial price discriminations might substantially lessen competition within the meaning of Section 2(a) of the Robinson-Patman Act. Federal Trade Commission v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 363 U.S. 536, 552, 80 S.Ct. 1267, 4 L.Ed.2d 1385. In this connection, it should be, noted that in reviewing a similar record, another Court of Appeals has held that there was sufficient evidence of Fry\u2019s violation of Section 2(a) of the RobinsonPatman Act to submit to a jury. Volasco Products Company v. Lloyd A. Fry Roofing Company, 346 F.2d 661 (6th Cir. 1965), certiorari denied, 382 U.S. 904, 86 S.Ct. 239, 15 L.Ed.2d 157.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Since like evidence was deemed sufficient to go to the jury, it was also sufficient to support the Commission\u2019s determination here. Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 340 U.S. 474, 477, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-14\">Because we agree that Fry\u2019s discriminatory price reductions in the Knoxville market area were motivated by predatory intent, it is unnecessary to examine their effect upon competition in detail. Yet it should be observed that Volasco and Ohio were the main independents operating in this area and had both refused to adhere to the majors\u2019 prices. Since Volasco and Ohio Paper were the principal competitors of the majors in this area, their removal would certainly have an adverse effect on price competition generally in that market. In other words, in this particular market, there were only two important price competitors of the majors, and the area price discriminations were directed at their practices. In such a situation, the injury to the two independents qualifies as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>injury to competition. Porto Rican American Tobacco Co. of Porto Rico v. American Tobacco Co., 30 F.2d 234 (2nd Cir. 1929), certiorari denied, 279 U.S. 858, 49 S.Ct. 353, 73 L.Ed. 999, is the classic example of this principle. To the same effect, see Moore v. Mead\u2019s Fine Bread Co., 348 U.S. 115, 75 S.Ct. 148, 99 L.Ed. 145; Atlas Building Products Co. v. Diamond Block &amp; Gravel Co., 269 F.2d 950 (10th Cir. 1959), certiorari denied, 363 U.S. 843, 80 S.Ct. 1608, 4 L.Ed.2d 1727; Maryland Baking Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 243 F.2d 716 (4th Cir. 1957); E. B. Muller &amp; Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 142 F.2d 511 (6th Cir. 1944). Selective price reductions by a price leader to punish deviation from an industry price is itself anti-competitive conduct. In such a situation, the actual market results of the price reduction need not be manifest before enforcement of the Act is justified. Note, \u201cCompetitive Injury under the Robinson-Patman Act.\u201d 74 Harv.L.Rev. 1597, 1602, 1603 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Petitioners urge that there can be no violation of Section 2(a) in area price discrimination cases unless the Commission finds that the higher prices elsewhere support the lower prices in the market under examination. We have been cited to no authoritative decision to support this view. No such requirement was enunciated in Moore v. Mead\u2019s Fine Bread Co., 348 U.S. 115, 75 S.Ct. 148, 99 L.Ed. 145, or E. B. Muller &amp; Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 142 F.2d 511 (6th Cir. 1944). Congress and the cases assume that the \u201chigher price to purchasers supports the lower price to others.\u201d Austin, Price Discrimination (2nd Revised ed. 1959) p. 44; see also S.Rep.No. 698, 63d Cong.2d Sess. pp. 2-3 (1914); H.R.Rep.No. 627, 63d Cong., 2d Sess. p. 8 (1914); S.Rep.No. 1502, 74th Cong. 2d Sess. p. 4 (1936), and H.R.Rep. No. 2287, 74th Cong. 2d Sess. p. 8 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Relying upon such cases as Balian Ice Cream Co. v. Arden Farms Co., 231 F.2d 356 (9th Cir. 1955), certiorari denied, 350 U.S. 991, 76 S.Ct. 545, 100 L.Ed. 856, and Shore Gas and Oil Co., Inc. v. Humble Oil &amp; Refining Co., 224 F.Supp. 922 (D.N.J.1963), Fry asserts there was no violation of the statute because its Knoxville prices were not the proximate cause of injury to Volasco and Ohio. But those were private treble damage actions and there plaintiff must of course establish that defendants caused actual damages to them. In the present case, the statute merely requires that the effect of the discrimination \u201cmay be substantially to lessen competition.\u201d Moreover, two juries have already found on similar evidence that Fry proximately caused actual damages to Volasco. Volasco Products Co. v. Lloyd A. Fry Roofing Co., 308 F.2d 383 (6th Cir. 1962); idem, 346 F.2d 661 (6th Cir. 1965), certiorari denied, 382 U.S. 904, 86 S.Ct. 239, 15 L.Ed.2d 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">\n<em>Procedural Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Fry next argues that the Commission\u2019s refusal to permit Fry to subpoena pricing documents from its competitors vitiates the Commission\u2019s decision. However, the adverse rulings on the subpoenas were made in the course of interlocutory appeals and v/ere not raised by Fry when the case was finally before the Commission for disposition. Fry should have exhausted its administrative remedy by then complaining of the interlocutory rulings. It is too late to raise the matter now. See United States v. L. A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc., 344 U.S. 33, 36-37, 73 S.Ct. 67, 97 L.Ed. 54; Moog Industries, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission, 355 U.S. 411, 413-414, 78 S.Ct. 377, 2 L.Ed.2d 370; 3 Davis Administrative Law Treatise, \u00a7 20.06 (1958). In any event, the record discloses no abuse by the Commission in denying the interlocutory appeals, for Fry\u2019s competitors had shown that production would be burdensome as to time and expense, would reveal vital business information, could not be accomplished within the requested deadline, and that the request for the issuance of six of the seven subpoenas came too late (10 months after complaint counsel had rested). Being neither arbitrary nor unsupported by the record, the Commission\u2019s rulings as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>to the subpoenas will not be disturbed on appeal. Cf. Sue v. Chicago Transit Authority, 279 F.2d 416, 419 (7th Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Fry also complains of Commission Chairman Dixon\u2019s participation in the rulings denying the issuance of subpoenas. At that time, Fry did not request his withdrawal. In the absence of an objection, his withdrawal was not necessitated. Section 7(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1006(a)). When the case reached the Commission for consideration of the merits, Fry for the first time moved that Chairman Dixon disqualify himself and he did so <em>sua sponte </em>because he had been counsel to a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee investigating pricing practices of roofing manufacturers. Fry knew of Chairman Dixon\u2019s prior role when it had earlier presented to the full Commission its interlocutory appeals with respect to the subpoenas. Its subsequent motion for his disqualification did not complain of his participation in the decision of the interlocutory appeals, nor Was any such complaint made when the case came before the Commission for decision on the merits. Since the Commission had no opportunity to consider the matter, it may not be raised here. Unemployment Compensation Commission of Territory of Alaska v. Aragon, 329 U.S. 143, 155, 67 S.Ct. 245, 91 L.Ed. 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Petitioners assert that the Commission\u2019s order is improper because it joins Messrs. Fry Senior and Junior in their individual capacities. The cease and desist order refers to them \u201cindividually and as officers\u201d of Lloyd A. Fry Roofing Company. Complaint counsel twice proposed their inclusion in the order as individuals, without objection by petitioners. The complaint before the Commission named the Messrs. Fry \u201cindividually and as officers\u201d of the corporation. It alleged that they were \u201cpersonally and officially\u201d responsible for the practices assailed. They are Fry\u2019s majority stockholders. Petitioners have not challenged the Commission\u2019s findings that these two persons formulate and control Fry\u2019s practices and were responsible for and participated in these discriminatory practices. In similar situations, we concluded that individuals responsible for corporate activities may be joined in their individual capacities. Steelco Stainless Steel v. Federal Trade Commission, 187 F.2d 693, 697 (7th Cir. 1951); Surf Sales Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 259 F.2d 744, 747 (7th Cir. 1958). Petitioners rely on Flotill Products Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission, 358 F.2d 224 (9th Cir. 1966), pending on petition for certiorari, No. 668. October Term 1966, but that record did not show the individuals had violated or could be expected to violate the Clayton Act (p. 233). The Ninth Circuit continues to approve the inclusion of individuals in cease and desist orders where, as here, they set the policies and review the practices. Fred Meyer, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission, 359 F.2d 351, 368 (9th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Finally, petitioners attack the Commission\u2019s order on the ground that it fails to lay down a standard between permissible and proscribed conduct. The order requires petitioners to cease and desist from selling asphalt saturated felt \u201cto any purchaser at a price which is lower than the price charged any other purchaser at the same level of distribution, <em>where such lower price undercuts the lowest price offered to that purchaser by any seller having a substantially smaller annual volume of sales\u201d </em>of that product (italics supplied). This order was less stringent than proposed by complaint counsel. The Commission modified it to cover only territorial price discrimination that would probably cause the debilitation of smaller and weaker competitors. As Commissioner Elman noted, Fry would probably continue its price tactics unless stopped. This type of order was designed to prevent recurrences of unlawful conduct. It is appropriate because, as he observed, in a market where Fry\u2019s price is below its lowest price competitor\u2019s, Fry\u2019s price is likely to represent another \u201cattempt to discipline an upstart independent.\u201d A similar order was affirmed in Forster Manufactur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>ing Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 361 F.2d 340, 343 (1st Cir. 1966, certiorari denied 87 S.Ct. 706). If situations arise to plague petitioners, they may seek binding advice from the Commission as to the applicability of this order. Federal Trade Commission v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., 380 U.S. 374, 394, 85 S.Ct. 1035, 13 L.Ed.2d 904. The order is not to be read as forbidding justifiable area price differences.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">The petition will be dismissed. The Commission\u2019s order is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b333-22\">. A charge that Fry sold below cost in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45) was dismissed for want of proof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b334-8\">. Throughout this opinion, the Knoxville market area refers to that area within 100 miles of Knoxville. Until 1960, it, was served by Fry\u2019s Brookville, Indiana, plant and thereafter by its Memphis plant. Fry\u2019s customers in the Knoxville area included three distributors in Knoxville, two in Chattanooga, and one in Kingsport, Tennessee. All were \u201capproved distributors\u201d and were substantial customers of Fry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b334-16\">. A 10% discount was given on truckload or carload purchases and, in certain circumstances, an additional 6% was given on such purchases by \u201capproved distributors\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b337-66\">. Fry has not challenged the Commission\u2019s ruling that its price discriminations were not made in good faith to meet competition within the proviso in Section 2(b) of the Robinson-Patman Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b337-67\">. The Fry prices to dealers and \u201capproved distributors\u201d are computed by deducting all discounts for which they are eligible from the list price. Volasco\u2019s prices are taken from its sales records. They are not exactly comparable to Fry\u2019s dealer prices because almost all of Volasco\u2019s sales are such that if they had been made by Fry, the buyer would not be entitled to any quantity discount. Volasco made isolated sales outside the price ranges as listed here. To use them as the limits of the price range would be to present a distorted picture of Volasco\u2019s sales activity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b338-8\">. At the oral argument, the Court was advised that the Commission has cases in process against other roofing manufacturers. Cf. Universal-Rundle Corp. v. Federal Trade Commission, 352 F.2d 831 (7th Cir. 1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b338-15\">. In the <em>Volasco </em>ease, the jury rendered a verdict against Fry. A treble judgment was entered for Volasco, and that judgment was affirmed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
