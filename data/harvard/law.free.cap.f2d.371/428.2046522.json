Section 2(a) obligates a plaintiff to prove competitive injury and to meet a cost justification defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Plaintiff contends that the District Judge erred in treating the alleged \u201cfreight allowances or rebates\u201d as having to do with delivery which is specifically included in the provisions of \u00a7 2(a), rather than as payments for \u201chandling\u201d the product under \u00a7 2(d) or contributions to furnishing of service under \u00a7 2(e). We find the plaintiff\u2019s arguments in this regard unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The plaintiff also contends that the District Court mistakenly concluded that Congress intended to exclude from coverage under \u00a7\u00a7 2(d) and (e) such conduct as here is made the subject of the complaint. The plaintiff sees this error as arising from the District Court\u2019s consideration of certain statements in the legislative history out of context. In the District Judge\u2019s opinion, we find the following quotation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">* * * the existing evil at which this part of the bill [2(d) and 2(e)] is aimed is, of course, the grant of dis-criminations under the guise of payments for advertising and promotional services * * * 80 Cong.Rec. 9418 (1936).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-10\">[the] Committee discussed the bill and the provisions in paragraph (d) with relation to advertising allowances, and any member of that committee will tell you that that section refers to advertising allowances. 80 Cong.Rec. 8123 (1936).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">The plaintiff argues that a broader intent is apparent if one considers the first part of the above quotation in the context of the entire paragraph, in which the plaintiff emphasi2ies the following sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-13\">The prohibitions of the bill, however, are made intentionally broader than this one sphere in order to prevent evasion in resort to others by which the same purpose might be accomplished, * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-14\">The entire paragraph reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-15\">The bill prohibits the seller from paying the customer for services or facilities furnished by the latter in connection with the seller\u2019s goods unless such payment is available on proportionally equal terms to all other competing customers. The existing evil at which this part of the bill is aimed is, of course, the grant of dis-criminations under the guise of payments for advertising and promotional services which, whether or not the services are actually rendered as agreed, results in an advantage to the customer so favored as compared with others who have to bear the cost of such services themselves. The prohibitions of the bill, however, are made intentionally broader than this one sphere in order to prevent evasion in resort to others <em>by which the same purpose might be accomplished, </em>and it prohibits payment for such services or facilities whether furnished \u201cin connection with the processing, handling, sale, or offering for sale\u201d of the products concerned. 80 Cong.Rec. 9418-19 (1936) [emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-16\">We disagree that the paragraph read as a whole shows a Congressional intent to include within the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 2(d) and (e) such activity or conduct, clearly covered by \u00a7 2(a) as is here made the subject of the complaint before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>After study of the record and the authorities to which our attention has been invited by the briefs and oral argument of counsel, we have arrived at the same conclusions as those of the learned District Judge whose well reasoned opinion, published at 254 F.Supp. 83, we adopt as our own except insofar as it is inconsistent with the foregoing. The decision of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
