The claim was for injuries inflicted by Pennell\u2019s automobile in Orange County, New York, on July 1, 1961. The complaint was filed and a summons issued on January 6, 1965, but the defendant was not served until April 29, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">Pennell moved to dismiss on the basis of New York\u2019s three-year statute of limitations, CPLR \u00a7 214(5). Although Gra-ziano advanced other grounds for avoiding the time bar, the only one now seriously pressed is based on CPLR \u00a7 205(a), which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-12\">\u201cIf an action is timely commenced and is terminated in any other manner than by a voluntary discontinuance, a dismissal of the complaint for neglect to prosecute the action, or a final judgment upon the merits, the plaintiff * * * may commence a new action upon the same cause of action within six months after the termination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-13\">The facts alleged to bring plaintiff within that provision are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b816-14\">Shortly after the accident, on November 28, 1961, Graziano brought an action in the Supreme Court, New York County, obtaining jurisdiction over the defendant, then a New Jersey resident, by serving the New York Secretary of State pursuant to \u00a7 253 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 71. In early January, defendant answered and demanded a bill of particulars. Plaintiff never complied; therefore on September 18,1962, Mr. Justice Streit entered a 60 day preclusion order pursuant to R.C.P. 115, now CPLR R. 3042. No steps were ever taken to vacate such order, and no reasons have ever been given why plaintiff did not comply with it. After objection on the score of improper venue the action was then transferred to Orange County by consent. There it has lain dormant since, as we were told at argument, plaintiff cannot practically proceed in light of the preclusion order. Apparently in an effort to get out of this box Graziano commenced a second action against Pennell, then a New York resident, in the Supreme Court, New York County, on June 15, 1964. The second action, although brought within the three-year period of limitations, encountered a predictably inevitable motion to dismiss under CPLR R. 3211(a) (4) on the ground that \u201cthere is another action pending between the same parties for the same cause of action in a court of any state or the United States.\u201d The motion was granted on October 8, 1964, the state judge specifically declining to avail himself of the Rule\u2019s permission that he \u201cneed not dismiss upon this ground but may make such order as justice requires,\u201d on the basis that application for relief from the preclusion order should be made in the court where the first action was pending. Although plaintiff filed a notice of appeal, he did not perfect this and defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-15\">Dismissal of the second New York action, says the plaintiff, renders the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>stant federal suit timely under CPLR \u00a7 205(a). For, as he argues with impeccable literalness, the second action was \u201ctimely commenced\u201d and was terminated in a manner other than any of the three expressly mentioned. Plaintiff hurdles the remaining difficulty, that although the federal summons was issued within six months of the termination of the second state action, it was not served within that period, see Ragan v. Merchants Transfer &amp; Warehouse Co., 337 U.S. 530, 69 S.Ct. 1233, 93 L.Ed. 1520 (1949), by saying, with enviable assurance, that <em>Ragan </em>was overruled by Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. 460, 85 S.Ct. 1136, 14 L.Ed.2d 8 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">The passing of <em>Ragan </em>would bring no tears from us, see Hanna v. Plumer, supra, 380 U.S. at 476-477, 85 S.Ct. at 1146-1147 (concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Harlan); Hart, The Relations between State and Federal Law, 54 Colum.L.Rev. 489, 511 n. 72 (1954); and an able district judge in this circuit thinks <em>Hanna </em>in fact administered the happy dispatch, Sylvestri v. Warner &amp; Swasey Co., 244 F.Supp. 524, 527-528 (S.D.N.Y. 1965) (Wyatt, J.); see also Callan v. Lillybelle, Ltd., 39 F.R.D. 600, 602 (S.D.N.Y.1966), but compare Sylvester v. Messler, 351 F.2d 472 (6 Cir. 1965). However, we are not here required to pass upon that issue since the appeal fails on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\"> The obvious purpose of CPLR \u00a7 205(a) and its counterparts in many other states is to prevent the general statute of limitations from barring recovery because a court has ordered a timely action to be terminated for some technical defect that can be remedied in a new one. Such statutes have been said \u201cto be an outgrowth of the ancient common law rule of \u2018journey\u2019s account\u2019 \u201d, a period \u201callowed to permit a party, whose action had abated for matter of form, a reasonable time within which to journey to court to sue out a new writ.\u201d Baker v. Cohn, 266 App.Div. 236, 239, 41 N.Y.S.2d 765, 767 (1st Dept. 1943). Assuming that a federal court sitting in New York should apply CPLR \u00a7 205(a) in an appropriate case, see Marco v. Dulles, 177 F.Supp. 533, 537, 549-551 (S.D.N.Y.1959), and Annotation, 156 A.L.R. 1097, 1099-1102 (1945), citing many cases, cf. Baker v. Commercial Travelers Mutual Accident Ass\u2019n, 3 A.D.2d 265, 161 N.Y.S.2d 332 (4th Dept. 1957), it should not apply the statute in an overly literal fashion that would frustrate New York\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">The New York courts have often quoted Judge Cardozo\u2019s statement as to the forerunner of CPLR \u00a7 205(a) that \u201cThe statute is designed to insure to the diligent suitor the right to a hearing in court till he reaches a judgment on the merits. Its broad and liberal purpose is not to be frittered away by any narrow construction. The important consideration is that, by invoking judicial aid, a litigant gives timely notice to his adversary of a present purpose to maintain his rights before the courts.\u201d Gaines v. City of New York, 215 N.Y. 533, 539, 109 N.E. 594, 596, L.R.A.1917C, 203 (1915). However, Judge Cardozo was addressing himself to a situation in which the first suit was dismissed because the particular court chosen lacked jurisdiction over the defendant, an impediment that could be, and was, removed in the second suit. In our case a timely action is still pending and the obstacle to its prosecution is not readily curable by any act the plaintiff could take in a third state action. While the precise issue whether \u00a7 205(a) could ever apply when a timely action is pending is unlikely to arise in the New York courts, since any subsequent action would generally be dismissable on that ground alone, one New York decision where the movant had not sought dismissal on the ground of prior action pending expressly said that \u201cthe non-termination of the first action precludes the institution of the second action under the saving clause,\u201d Farnitano v. Gaydos, 198 N.Y.S.2d 795, 797 (Sup.Ct.Suffolk Co. 1960). Although appellant would distinguish the case on the basis that no action had been \u201cterminated,\u201d the broader reading that the saving statute can never apply when a timely action is pending accords with the manifest purpose of the statute and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>with what other New York courts have said. Russo v. City of New York, 258 N.Y. 344, 349, 179 N.E. 762 (1932); Holland v. Schwartz, 22 N.Y.S.2d 283 (Sup.Ct.Westchester Co.), aff\u2019d 259 App. Div. 1083, 22 N.Y.S.2d 197 (2d Dept. 1940). Such a reading seems especially appropriate when it is realized that to decide otherwise would enable a suitor, after expiration of the general statute of limitations, to ask a third judge to overrule the refusal of the second to exercise the discretion given him by CPLR R. 3211(a) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">It may well be that if Graziano had brought his action in the District Court within the three-year period, he could have circumvented the preclusion order in the first state action, since a federal court will usually not dismiss or even stay an action <em>in personam </em>because of a prior action pending in a state court. The general rule, stated in Kline v. Burke Construction Co., 260 U.S. 226, 230, 43 S.Ct. 79, 81, 67 L.Ed. 226 (1922), is that \u201cEach court is free to proceed in its own way and in its own time, without referece to the proceedings in the other court.\u201d But the fact, if it be one, that plaintiff\u2019s ability to invoke federal diversity jurisdiction might thus enable him to overcome his failure to comply with the procedural order of a New York court whereas a resident could not, does not mean that, having brought a second action in which New York declined to relieve him of the preclusion, he can then free himself from the much deeper policy embodied in New York\u2019s statute of limitations by utilizing the special relief provision of CPLR \u00a7 205(a) to accomplish in a federal court a result that New York never contemplated and its courts would not permit. Although \u201c \u2018Outcome determination\u2019 analysis was never intended to serve as a talisman,\u201d Hanna v. Plumer, supra, 380 U.S. at 466-467, 85 S.Ct. at 1141, it is not to be discarded but rather is to be applied with \u201creference to the twin aims of the Erie rule: discouragement of forum-shopping and avoidance of inequitable administration of the laws.\u201d 380 U.S. at 468, 85 S.Ct. at 1142. The years have trimmed some of the dicta in Guaranty Trust Co. of New York v. York, 326 U.S. 99, 65 S.Ct. 1464, 89 L.Ed. 2079 (1945), but the <em>Hanna </em>decision made clear that the core of the <em>Guaranty </em>case remained unaffected. When, as here, we deal with the very issue <em>sub judice </em>in <em>Guaranty, </em>the statute of limitations, it remains true that when no recovery on a right created by state law could be had in a state court because the action is effectually time-barred, \u201cthe accident of a suit by a non-resident litigant in a federal court instead of in a State court a block away, should not lead to a substantially different result.\u201d 326 U.S. at 107-109, 65 S.Ct. at 1470.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
