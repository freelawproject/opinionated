The tax year in question is 1963. Respondent was a domiciliary of Detroit, Michigan until April 1, 1963, at which time he moved to the District of Columbia. For the rest of 1963 and since that time he has been a domiciliary of the District. Respondent filed with the District an individual income tax return for the period from April 1, to December 31, 1963, reporting therein adjusted gross income for that nine-month period of $17,178.04, from which he took certain deductions prorated for the nine-month period reflected on his return. Respondent earned $5,142.42 for the three months of 1963 during which he was domiciled in Detroit. He paid to the State of Michigan an intangible personal property tax of $26.71 for this period and an income tax to the City of Detroit of $45.41, for a total of $72.12. Respondent did not include any of the income earned by him prior to April 1, 1963 in his District of Columbia return for 1963, nor did he claim any credit for the taxes he paid in Michigan during the three-month period. Respondent computed his tax to the District for the nine-month period at $467.12 which he duly paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-4\">Subsequently the District Finance Office assessed a deficiency in respondent\u2019s tax, finding that he should have computed his District tax on the basis of his income for the <em>entire year, </em>rather than for only the nine-month period. The new assessment resulted in a revised tax of $664.42 (before credits), making a deficiency in tax of $197.30. The Finance Office then allowed a credit of $72.12 for the Michigan and Detroit taxes (which credit respondent had not previously claimed), making a net deficiency of $125.18, which respondent thereafter paid under protest (together with interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">Respondent subsequently filed a petition with the District of Columbia Tax Court, seeking a refund of the deficiency assessed. The Tax Court reversed the determination of the Finance Office and ordered a refund (with interest) to respondent. The District of Columbia has petitioned this court to reverse the determination of the Tax Court. We affirm that decision, although on a somewhat different ground than that adopted by the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">Before both the Tax Court and us, respondent has argued that as a matter of statutory construction, the District of Columbia Income and Franchise Tax Act of 1947, as amended, does not tax income received by a taxpayer prior to his residence in the District. Alternatively, respondent has argued that if the Act is interpreted to tax this income, that portion upon which the District relies is unconstitutional since it taxes income beyond the jurisdiction of the District of Columbia and is, consequently, in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">The Tax Court rejected respondent\u2019s statutory interpretation argument, finding that the Act in question, literally interpreted, imposed a tax upon respondent\u2019s entire income for the taxable year 1963. However, the Tax Court held that to the extent the statute included as taxable the income earned by respondent prior to the time he became a resident and domiciliary of the District, it violated the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-10\">As is clear from the decision of the Tax Court, respondent has placed in issue in this case a question of grave constitutional significance. The Tax Court considered and decided the constitutional question, while at the same time refusing to hold the tax invalid as a matter of statutory construction. We believe that the sage words of Mr. Justice Holmes in United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, 241 U.S. 394, 401, 36 S.Ct. 658, 659, 60 L.Ed. 1061 (1916) have relevance for the resolution of the problem which we are confronted with in this case. He stated there that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-11\">\u201c[a] statute must be construed, if fairly possible, so as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is unconstitution<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>al, but also grave doubts upon that score.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">See also General Motors Corp. v. District of Columbia, 380 U.S. 553, 85 S.Ct. 1156, 14 L.Ed.2d 68 (1965) where the Supreme Court recently construed other sections of the same Act as is involved here so as to avoid the necessity of reaching constitutional questions. Moreover, it is a cardinal principle of statutory construction that if there are two possible interpretations of a statute, one which would raise a question of constitutionality, and another which would not, then the construction which fairly avoids the constitutional question must be adopted. International Ass\u2019n of Machinists v. Street, 367 U.S. 740, 749, 81 S.Ct. 1784, 6 L.Ed.2d 1141 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">Applying these general principles to this particular case, we believe, contrary to the Tax Court, that <em>as a matter of statutory construction </em>the income tax law involved here does <em>not tax </em>income received by a taxpayer prior to his becoming a \u201cresident\u201d of the District. While the Tax Court\u2019s determination of the constitutional question has much to recommend itself as both a logical and legal matter, we believe that the statute admits more readily of an interpretation that it was not intended to reach the income here in question, and we thus place our decision upon the nonconstitutional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">Respondent has set forth his statutory construction argument in a clear and succinct manner in his brief, and rather than attempt to paraphrase his excellent exposition, it is set forth here in its entirety :<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-8\">\u201cThere is no specific provision in the District of Columbia Income and Franchise Tax Act of 1947 (D.C.Code, \u00a7\u00a7 47-1551 et seq.) authorizing the taxation of income earned or received by individuals prior to their residence in the District. The tax law provides that a person domiciled in the District on the last day of the year shall be considered a resident of the District (Section 4(s) of Title I; Code Sec. 47-1551c(s)). There is no dispute as to the respondent having been both a resident and domiciliary within the District at all times since April 1, 1963. However, Section 4(s) of Title I (Sec. 47-1551c(s) of the Code) does not purport to tax income earned prior to domicile or residence in the District.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-11\">\u201cThe section actually imposing the tax states that there is levied for each year \u2018upon the <em>taxable </em>income of every resident\u2019 a tax at specified rates (Section 3 Of Title VI; Code Sec. 47-1567b; emphasis supplied). The phrase \u2018taxable income\u2019 is defined to mean the \u2018entire net income of every resident, in excess of the personal exemptions and credits for dependents\u2019 (Section 1 of Title VI; Code Sec. 47-1567). This language necessarily implies that the income must be taxable. It will be noted that the tax is not by its terms imposed on income for the \u2018entire\u2019 or \u2018whole\u2019 year, but merely for the \u2018taxable year.\u2019 It is therefore necessary to analyze the Act to consider the meaning of \u2018taxable year.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-12\">\u201cThe tax law expressly recognizes that the status of a taxpayer may change during the taxable year, and in those situations the law provides an apportionment of the personal exemptions and credit for dependents (Section 2 of Title VI, Code Sec. 47-1567a). Subsections (d) and (e) of the Section specifically provide for proration of exemptions and credits for dependents and for changes in marital status, or with respect to persons dying before the end of the year, respectively. Subsection (f) of the same section makes a more general provision covering the case of a return \u2018made for a fractional part of a taxable year.\u2019 The phrase \u2018taxable year\u2019 is specifically defined elsewhere in the law to include a \u2018return made for <em>a fractional part </em>of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>a calendar or fiscal year\u2019 (Section 4(k) of Title I; Code Sec. 47-1551c(k); emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-5\">\u201cSubsection (f) of Section 2 of Title VI (Code Sec. 47-1567a) would appear to be clearly applicable to respondent\u2019s situation, and in filing the return for the last nine months of 1963, claim was made for personal exemption only as to % of the full amount, or $750 (J.A. 13). Subsections (d) and (e) cover changes in marital status, and the death of the taxpayer, respectively. Subsection (f) is broader in its language and not limited to the special situations covered by Subsections (d) and (e). Hence it appears clearly to cover such a situation as respondent\u2019s, so as to authorize the filing of a return for a fractional part of a year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-6\">\u201cSince a return is authorized for a \u2018fractional part\u2019 of a year, that part of a year becomes the \u2018taxable year\u2019 within the meaning of Section 3 of Title VI (Code Sec. 47-1567b). So construed, the phrase \u2018taxable income\u2019 in the same section reaches only the income received from the <em>\u2018resident\u2019 </em>after he becomes such. Similarly, the phrase \u2018taxable year\u2019 in the credit provision (Section 5(a) of Title VI; Code Sec. 47-1567) is properly interpreted to be the \u2018fractional part of the year in which the taxpayer resided in the District.\u2019 \u201d Br. for respondent, pp. 22-25.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">We have given close scrutiny and study to respondent\u2019s statutory construction approach and are persuaded by it. We agree with respondent that construing the sections in question in the manner suggested comports more properly with accepted principles of jurisdiction and avoids the necessity of inquiring into the constitutional question. The question remains, however, as to whether the result suggested by respondent is that intended by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-9\">We have examined the legislative history (or lack thereof) relating to this statute, the decisional law and statutes from other jurisdictions, and the treatment of the question by federal taxing authorities in analogous contexts. We believe that our conclusion here is in conformity with the resolution of the question by these other authorities, as will be demonstrated by a brief review of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-11\">a. ) <em>Legislative history: </em>The Congressional committee reports concerning the present District of Columbia Income Tax Law, which was enacted in 1947, contain no specific provisions concerning this problem. The situation is the same with respect to the predecessor District Income Tax Law, enacted in 1939. However, the House Committee Report concerning the 1939 Law contains the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-12\">\u201caccounting periods, basis of returns, and other provisions relating to returns of the taxpayer are substantially the same as the Federal law relating to such subjects.\u201d H.R. No. 808, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1021-13\">b. ) <em>Federal tax authority: </em>Respondent has directed the court\u2019s attention to the case of Lee v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 6 B.T.A. 1005, a 1927 decision of the Board of Tax Appeals holding that the Federal income tax was not applicable to income earned by a nonresident alien prior to the time of becoming a resident of the United States. In <em>Lee </em>the taxpayer had lived part of the tax year in England and part in the United States. In holding for the petitioner-taxpayer the Board stated that \u201ctaxing statutes should not be extended beyond their clear import.\u201d (6 B.T.A. at 1006.) This holding of the Board was approved by a subsequent Treasury Decision, which set forth a General Counsel\u2019s Memorandum issued in 1932 (2 Cum.Bull. 99, GCM No. 10759). The <em>Lee </em>case, with its subsequent acceptance by the Treasury, is persuasive support for respondent\u2019s argument, particularly in review of the close affinity between the District of Columbia law and the Federal taxing statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-14\">c. ) <em>Statutes and state decisional law: </em>Respondent has cumulated an impressive array of statutes from various states demonstrating clearly that these states do not attempt to tax income received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>prior to residence in the state.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, numerous state courts have considered the question here involved under statutes not unlike the District law and have concluded that the various state legislatures did not intend to tax income earned in another state prior to domicile in the taxing state. <em>E.g., </em>Greene v. Wisconsin Tax Comm\u2019n., 221 Wis. 531, 266 N.W. 270 (1936); Kennedy v. Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation, 256 Mass. 426, 152 N.E. 747 (1926); Martin v. Gage, 281 Ky. 95, 134 S.W.2d 966, 126 A.L.R. 449 (1939); Forrester v. Culpepper, 194 Ga. 744, 22 S.E.2d 595 (1942). Perhaps the best statement in these cases of the conclusion reached by these courts that the statutes involved did not cover income received prior to residence in the state is that found in <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>wherein the court stated that this construction of the law</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-4\">\u201cavoids highly difficult constitutional questions which would be encountered if the sections were interpreted to subject a person removing to the Commonwealth in the latter part of any year to taxation on income received in a foreign jurisdiction while an inhabitant thereof, and thus at a time when such person derived no protection from our laws and owed them no duty.\u201d 152 N.E., at 749.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">For all of the foregoing reasons, therefore, the decision of the District of Columbia Tax Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">District of Columbia Income and Franchise Tax Act of 1947, as amended, 61 Stat. 328, ch. 258:</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">\n<em>Title I, See. 4(1c) (s), (t), D.C.
