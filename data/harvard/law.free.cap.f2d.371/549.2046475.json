Eventually he applied to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania for a Writ of Habeas Corpus. He frankly admits he had a hearing on this on August 6, 1965. He states that he attended \u201cbut for various reasons he was unable to secure witnesses or their deposition and thus prove pertinent facts and allegations of his petition.\u201d His claim is that he \u201cdid not have counsel at his plea, trial or sentencing, nor did he knowingly or intelligently waive counsel.\u201d He admits he refused the trial court\u2019s offer to appoint counsel for him. He says this is because the particular lawyer represented two co-defendants who were going to plead guilty and he intended to plead not guilty. He admits he would have been tried alone. He makes no denial of prison breach but claims to have been relying on \u201cthe mitigating circumstances of the prison breach.\u201d He says \u201cEven though Appellant refused counsel prior to trial the refusal did not act as an effective waiver until counsel was clearly, knowingly and intelligently waived before the trial Judge.\u201d He states he had initial indecision on the question of accepting counsel and that moments later he refused counsel. He quotes \u201cfrom p. 4 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>notes of testimony of trial * * * \u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">\u201cExamination by Mr. Warfel: (District Attorney)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">Q: Mr. Pletcher, do you desire Mr. Routch to represent you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">A: No; thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">Q: You don\u2019t want Mr. Routch as counsel ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-9\">A: No; thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-10\">Q: Do you desire the court to appoint any other person as counsel for you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-11\">A: No; thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-12\">By the Court: The court will direct that the case be proceeded with.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-13\">We have examined appellant\u2019s other contentions.
