Atty., Cincinnati, Ohio, on brief.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b868-7\">Before WEICK, Chief Judge, and PHILLIPS and EDWARDS, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b868-8\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">Appellant brought this action as ad-ministratrix of the estate of her husband under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b) (1964). Appellant alleged that her husband, an employee of the Officers Club at the United States Army Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal, Huntsville, Alabama, died on or about January 12, 1963, as the result of knife wounds inflicted by a fellow employee of the Club, who was under deceased\u2019s supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">The theory of appellant\u2019s claim was that the government was negligent in hiring the employee who committed the fatal assault because it had prior notice of his prior criminal record and propensities toward physical violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-12\">The government filed a motion to dismiss, based upon 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680 (1964), which says in part: \u201cThe provisions of * * * section 1346(b) of this title shall not apply to\u2014 * * * (h) Any claim arising out of assault * * Relying on this provision, the United States District Judge dismissed the complaint for want of jurisdiction, after noting in an opinion that the complaint did not state a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-14\">We do not, however, reach this issue. On appeal the government brief cited to this court, as an alternative ground for affirmance, a Federal statute which provides exclusive coverage for certain civilian employees not subject to laws administered by the Civil Service Commission under the same terms as the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 et seq. (1964). The government brief recited: \u201cSince it is apparent from the complaint that the decedent was a covered employee within the terms of 5 U.S.C. 150k-l, no action may lie under the Federal Tort Claims Act, and, consequently, the district court\u2019s action in dismissing the complaint was proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b868-15\">At oral argument appellant\u2019s counsel conceded that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 150k-l (1964), was applicable. We find therein:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-16\">\u201c(e) The liability of the United States or of any nonappropriated fund instrumentality described in section 150k of this title, with respect to the disability or death resulting from injury, as defined in section 902(2) of Title 33, of any employee referred to in subsection (a) or (b) of this section, shall be determined as provided in section 150k of this title and this section. <em>Such liability shall be exclusive and in the place of all other liability of the United States or such instrumentality to the employee, his legal representative, spouse, dependents, next of kin, and any person otherwise entitled to recover damages from the United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number><em>States or such nonappropriated fund instrumentality on account of such disability or death in any direct judicial proceedings, in a civil action, or in admiralty, or by proceedings whether administrative or judicial, under any workmen\u2019s compensation law or under any Federal tort liability statute.\u201d </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 150k-l(c). (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">It seems clear to us that the remedy-provided for appellant in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 150k-l is exclusive by its terms and must be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
