In the tax year in question plaintiff taxpayer was the sole owner of two brother-sister corporations \u2014 Industrial Realty Co., Inc. and Southern Comfort Realty Company. Industrial was a successful operation \u2014 yielding substantial profits. Southern had been losing money for several years and understandably plaintiff was anxious to liquidate it. Late in March 1961, upon the recommendation of plaintiff\u2019s accountant, a plan for Southern\u2019s liquidation was put into effect. The primary objective of this plan was to enable Industrial to set off Southern\u2019s losses against Industrial\u2019s profits. As a principal step, in accomplishing this, plaintiff transferred all his Southern stock to Industrial in exchange for an indebtedness of $125,700 created on Industrial\u2019s books.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-24\">The question before us is whether the creation of this indebtedness constituted a corporate distribution essentially equivalent to a dividend within the meaning of the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and taxable to plaintiff as ordinary income to the extent of Industrial\u2019s accumulated earnings and profits as of December 31, 1961.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his audit of plaintiff\u2019s 1961 income tax return<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Commissioner ruled that it did. The district court sustained this ruling in an able opinion which we approve.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-25\">In recent years this court has twice had occasion to review in detail the criteria to be applied in determining dividend equivalency and on both occasions we found that the transaction involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>was essentially equivalent to a dividend. United States v. Collins, 300 F.2d 821 (1st Cir. 1962); Bradbury v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 298 F.2d 111 (1st Cir. 1962). We think these cases are controlling here. In the instant case all the conditions necessary to constitute a dividend are fulfilled and we do not find those \u201cconspicuously countervailing considerations\u201d which might otherwise \u201cdispel the aura of dividend equivalence\u201d. <em>Bradbury, </em>supra at 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">While recognizing the significance of the holdings in these two cases plaintiff maintains that we must look at the totality of the circumstances from which the transfer in question cannot be severed. He argues that looking at it from this posture there are two factors in the instant case that distinguish it from <em>Collins </em>and <em>Bradbury: </em>(1) that this transaction was motivated by a legitimate business purpose and was not employed by plaintiff as a device to withdraw money from Industrial, and (2) that the same net result could have been obtained by other means without giving rise to a taxable distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\"> That the transaction was motivated by a legitimate business purpose is not disputed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But where, as here, the taxpayer is the sole or dominant stockholder of the distributing corporation, motive is irrelevant. For motive to have any meaningful significance at least the line between the shareholder and the corporation must be more sharply drawn than it is in this case. <em>Bradbury, </em>supra at 118. The real question here is what was accomplished by this transaction. The answer is that plaintiff received an unfettered indebtedness.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At least to the extent that profits were available, this was equivalent to a dividend, whether or not the taxpayer chose to think of it as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">Nor are we persuaded by plaintiff\u2019s second contention that he could have accomplished the same result by other means without these tax consequences. As we said in <em>Collins, </em>supra 300 F.2d at 825: \u201c * * * once a taxpayer elects a particular mode of business procedure, he cannot avoid the statutory ramifications of his action by indicating results whch might have obtained under alternate procedures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b871-14\">. Sections 302(b) (1) and 304(a) (1), Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 302(b) (1), 304(a) (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"ALV\">. Its accumulated earnings and profits as of that date were $120,070.80.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b871-26\">. This return was filed on a cash receipts and disbursements basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b871-28\">. Wiseman v. United States, 259 F.Supp. 90 (D.Me.1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b872-7\">. The trial court found that \u201cthe purpose of the transaction was to enable Industrial to obtain a tax loss upon the liquidation of Southern.\u201d 259 F.Supp. at 99.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b872-8\">. Plaintiff argues that he did not \u201creceive property,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 304, when the corporation merely entered an indebtedness on its books. Not only was the indebted<em>ness </em>noted without restrictions on time of payment, but plaintiff as sole stockholder of the corporation had the power to command payment at any time. Therefore, the district court was correct in treating the transaction as equivalent to a cash payment. Cf. Bazley v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 331 U.S. 737, 742, 67 S.Ct. 1489, 91 L.Ed. 1782 (1947); <em>Bradbury, </em>supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
