Atty., for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b190-5\">Before MERRILL, KOELSCH and BROWNING, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b190-6\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Appellant was charged with violating the Dyer Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2312, by transporting an automobile from New York City to Los Angeles, knowing it to have been stolen. The uncontradicted evidence established that appellant rented the vehicle from a car rental agency in New York City and drove it to Los An-geles where he was arrested. The sole issue was whether appellant acted with criminal intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Appellant\u2019s principal contentions on appeal relate to admission in evidence of incriminating statements made in absence of counsel. Appellant had been advised of his right to remain silent and of his right to consult counsel. Under the circumstances of this case, for the reasons set forth in Payne v. United States, 340 F.2d 748 (9th Cir. 1965), the statements were not rendered inadmissible by Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964). While the warnings given were insufficient to meet the standards of Miranda v. State of Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), trial here commenced September 1, 1964, and such standards are not to be retroactively applied. Johnson v. State of New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">In closing argument counsel for the Government stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-10\">\u201cNo one has shown a bit of evidence, particularly the defendant, that the defendant took one step to return the car.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">Appellant asserts that this remark amounted to a comment on his failure to take the stand and as such constituted prejudicial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-15\">The remark as a whole, while unfortunately and most ineptly phrased, was addressed to appellant\u2019s failure to establish a particular fact (a perfectly legitimate subject of comment) rather than to his failure to take the stand himself. Any improper collateral innuendo was, in our judgment, cured by the court\u2019s charge to the jury that the defendant need not testify and that no presumption or inference of any kind might be raised or drawn from such failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-16\">After the jury had been deliberating for close to six hours it reported itself unable to agree upon a verdict. The court nevertheless sent the jury back for further deliberation. Appellant asserts that the manner in which this was done was coercive. We cannot agree. We regard Jenkins v. United States, 380 U.S. 445, 85 S.Ct. 1059, 13 L.Ed.2d 957 (1965), the case upon which appellant relies, as distinguishable. There \u2014 as appears from the dissenting opinion in the Court of Appeals [117 U.S.App.D.C. 346, 330 F.2d 220 (1964)] \u2014 the trial judge had bluntly declared: \u201cNow I am not going to accept this. You have got to reach a decision in this case.\u201d Here the jury was not told that it must reach a verdict. Nor were the minority members of the jury singled out for a lecture, or urged to defer to the views of the majority. The jury was simply told to keep trying.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-17\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b190-18\">BROWNING, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Al8\">(dissenting) :</p>\n<p id=\"b190-19\">As the court notes, the sole issue was whether appellant acted with criminal intent. The testimony was brief, requiring less than one trial-day. The case was submitted to the jury at 11:55 a. m. At 3:13 p. m. the jury requested additional instructions on intent. At 3:31 p. m., at the request of defense counsel, the jury was recalled and was further instructed, at length, on this issue. One of the jurors (by his questions) indicated partic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>ular doubt as to the sufficiency of the evidence. At 4:45 p. m. the jury asked for a reading of the testimony of a key witness on intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">At 5:45 p. m. the jury sent the court a note reading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">\u201cWe the jury find it impossible to reach a verdict in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The court summoned the jury, and the following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: I don\u2019t know just exactly what that message means. I don\u2019t think I have ever, in 19 years, received a note just like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">The bailiffs will take you to dinner, and when 9:00 o\u2019clock comes, why, you will be taken to a hotel, if the verdict hasn\u2019t been reached.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">I am sorry, I have a dinner engagement, and I am going to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-10\">Now, if you reach a verdict, I will come in from Pasadena to receive it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-11\">The bailiff will make the arrangements to take the jury to dinner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-12\">If there is any reasonable doubt in your minds, that man is entitled to your verdict of not guilty. He is entitled not to have to run the gauntlet twice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-28\">But if there isn\u2019t any reasonable doubt, from the evidence \u2014 I heard the testimony but I haven\u2019t looked at any of the documentary evidence, so I can say I don\u2019t know what the evidence in the case is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-29\">If there is no reasonable doubt, the Government is entitled to a verdict of conviction. Both sides are entitled to the same fair trial at your hands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-30\">You may now retire to continue your deliberations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-31\">The clerk will enter an order directing the bailiffs to take you to dinner now at Government expense, and to take you to your hotel for the night by 9:00 o\u2019clock, if you have not reached a verdict at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-32\">If I am unable to get back here, the clerk will furnish you with an envelope for you to return a sealed verdict. And if you return a verdict before 9:00 o\u2019clock, then you may seal it, put it in an envelope, and return tomorrow morning at 9:30, and we will open the verdict at that time.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>At 9:20 p. m. the jury returned a verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">The court was not required to accept at once the jury\u2019s statement that it could not agree, but could insist that the jury deliberate further. See, e. g., DeVault v. United States, 338 F.2d 179, 182-183 (10th Cir. 1964); Mills v. Tins-ley, 314 F.2d 311, 312 (10th Cir. 1963); 5 Wharton, Criminal Law &amp; Procedure 300 (Anderson ed. 1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The difficulty with the court\u2019s response was that it implied that the jury must reach a verdict, either for the defendant or for the government. It may therefore have exerted a coercive influence upon individual jurors to relinquish their personal views in the interest of unanimity.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">A similar situation was before the Supreme Court in Jenkins v. United States, 380 U.S. 445, 85 S.Ct. 1059 (1965). There, as here, the trial court rejected the jury\u2019s announcement that it could not reach a decision the jury, in effect, that the case must be decided (see 330 F.2d at 221 n. 2). The Solicitor General conceded \u201cthe principle that jurors may not be coerced into surrendering views conscientiously held.\u201d The Supreme Court concluded that \u201cin its context and in all the circumstances the judge\u2019s statement had the coercive effect attributed to it,\u201d and reversed per <em>curi-am.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-17\">It is clear from <em>Jenkins, </em>and prior authority, that forbidden coercion exists whenever pressure to reach agreement is exerted upon the jury, unless it is accompanied by a clear and unequivocal reminder of the overriding obligation of each juror to adhere to his own conscientious convictions and to refrain from joining in a verdict merely because the juror is in a minority, or stands alone. In United States v. Rogers, 289 F.2d 433 (4th Cir. 1961), cited with approval in <em>Jenkins, </em>the court stated that the \u201cAllen charge\u201d (Allen v. United States, 164 U.S. 492, 501, 17 S.Ct. 154, 41 L.Ed. 528 (1896)), which contains language suggesting the desirability of agreement, approaches the limit of acceptability,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that the charge would constitute reversible error \u201cif it were stripped of its complementary reminder that jurors were not to acquiesce in the views of the majority or to surrender their well-founded convictions conscientiously held.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 289 F.2d at 435. See also United States v. Smith, 353 F.2d 166, 168 (4th Cir. 1965); Powell v. United States, 297 F.2d 318, 321 (5th Cir. 1951); Rhodes v. United States, 282 F.2d 59, 62-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>63 (4th Cir. 1960); cf. United States v. Kenner, 354 F.2d 780, 783-784 (2d Cir. 1965), and cases cited. Such a charge is permissible only \u201cso long as it makes plain to the jury that each member of the jury has a duty conscientiously to adhere to his own honest opinion and avoids creating the impression that there is anything improper, questionable, or contrary to good conscience for a juror to cause a mistrial\u201d (Thaggard v. United States, 354 F.2d 735, 739 (5th Cir. 1965)); for, \u201cindeed, a mistrial is as much a part of the jury system as a unanimous verdict.\u201d Williams v. United States, 119 U.S.App.D.C. 190, 338 F.2d 530, 533 (1964).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-13\">. The balance of the colloquy between the court and the jury was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A38\">\u201cJUROR HINSCH. May we call home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"art-dedup-0\">THE COURT: Yes. The bailiffs will call home for you. You may not call, but the bailiffs will call home for you. I think you might do that when you know what your situation is. The bailiffs will make a call for you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuE\">If you have parking problems, why the marshal will help them take care of those situations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWu\">The court will be in recess, subject to call, I will ask the alternates to remain in attendance, if they can. Can you, until 9:00 o\u2019clock?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Apm\">ALTERNATE TAYLOR: Your Hon- or, I also have a dinner engagement, and company coming to my house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8v\">THE COURT: It will be pretty late.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmX\">JUROR TAYLOR: Keep them waiting for dinner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9y\">THE COURT: Do you expect to cook the dinner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae_\">JUROR TAYLOR: I think I will have to because my husband doesn\u2019t cook.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-33\">ALTERNATE TEAMAN: I can stay until 9:00 o\u2019clock, but no later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-34\">THE COURT: 9:00 o\u2019clock. We all go to bed at 9:00 o\u2019clock. I have discovered over the years that we don\u2019t do much after 9:00 o\u2019clock in these matters. And oftentimes things look different to you when you sleep on them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-35\">I sleep on many tilings. Sometimes it takes a judge longer than this to make up his mind. So I am not criticizing you. I sleep on many cases. Sometimes the next morning, why, lightness comes to me \u2014 or, at least, doubt has been relieved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-36\">Is there any objection to excusing Mrs. Taylor at this time? And Miss Teaman can remain on until 9:00 o\u2019clock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-37\">GOVERNMENT COUNSEL: The Government has no objection, your Hon- or.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-39\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: The defendant has no objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-40\">THE COURT: Very well. You may be excused, Mrs. Taylor. And Miss Teaman may be excused, and counsel may be excused now until 7:30.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>The court will be in recess, subject to call. I will inform the bailiffs where they can reach me by telephone if you arrive at a verdict. I will come in from Pasadena to receive it, if it is at a seasonable hour.
