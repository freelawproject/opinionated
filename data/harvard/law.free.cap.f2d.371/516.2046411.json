He has appealed conviction of eleven counts. On appeal the sole contention is that the evidence is insufficient to constitute proof of the crimes charged in that it establishes that appellant did not himself use the mails in connection with any fraudulent transactions and he was not charged in the indictment with aiding and abetting under Title 18, U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (1964)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-17\">That section does not purport to define a distinct crime of aiding or abetting. It provides who may be charged as principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-18\">In Pereira v. United States, 347 U.S. 1, 8, 74 S.Ct. 358, 362, 98 L.Ed. 435 (1953), it is stated with reference to Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341 and 2314:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-19\">\u201cTo constitute a violation of these provisions, it is not necessary to show that petitioners actually mailed or transported anything themselves; it is sufficient if they caused it to be done.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-20\">In United States v. Provenzano, 334 F.2d 678, 691 (3d Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 947, 85 S.Ct. 440, 13 L.Ed.2d 544 (1964), it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-21\">\u201cAn individual may be indicted for commission of a substantive crime and convicted by proof showing him to be an aider and abettor * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-22\">See also Nye &amp; Nissen v.

United States, 209 F.2d 245, 246 (9th Cir. 1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-23\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-24\">Appellant has moved to be admitted to bail pending appeal.
