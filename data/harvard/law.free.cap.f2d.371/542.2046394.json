This condition was subject to repair and therefore did not prevent substantial gainful employment. While the reluctance of claimant to undergo surgery may permit him to escape work and give him the privilege of eating in his cell, he cannot at the same time base a right to compensation under the Act on such alleged disability.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
