He asserts error in the instructions, urging that under Levine v. United States, 104 U.S.App.D.C. 281, 261 F.2d 747, a special instruction on his theory of the case was required. The factual situation is sufficiently different to remove the case from any controlling effect of <em>Levine. </em>As to other aspects of the instructions, defense counsel, in response to inquiry by the court, expressed satisfaction with those given, in view of which, considering the case over-all, appellant may not require us to exercise the discretion available under Rule 52(b), Fed.R.Crim.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-26\">As to the long delay in the avail\u00e1bility to counsel of the trial transcript in preparing the appeal our affirmance cannot be attributed to this delay; and we are not called upon to consider, were we to reverse for a new trial, the effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>of such delay on the right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">We have considered other assigned errors and also find there no cause for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
