Cf. Clifton v. United States, 5 Cir., 341 F.2d 649. Here, the record before us does not disclose with certainty that the investigating officers knew that appellant had counsel immediately following his indictment by the grand jury. Thus, the undisputed testimony that Wilson spoke voluntarily and assured the officers that he did not need a lawyer, supports the trial court\u2019s finding of voluntary waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-19\">We have carefully considered the remaining assignments of error urged by appellant, and find that the trial court did not commit reversible error in any respect charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-20\">The Judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
