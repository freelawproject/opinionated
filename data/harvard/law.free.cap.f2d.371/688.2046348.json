On appeal to this court, the previous conviction was reversed. United States v. Moody, 339 F.2d 161 (C.A.6, 1964)'. This court held that defendant had been denied the right to introduce evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>pertaining to, and had been denied an instruction on, his claim that he owed no additional taxes for the disputed years.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">On retrial and reconviction defendant was again sentenced to five-year concurrent sentences on each of the four counts. On this appeal defendant complains of many aspects of the judge\u2019s charge to the jury. He also claims prejudicial error in several comments to the jury made by government counsel during closing arguments. And he likewise complains of the admission of hearsay evidence at the second trial by dint of cross-examination of a defense witness pertaining to what had happened at the first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Defendant is a medical doctor in private practice in Dyersburg, Tennessee. The indictment alleged (and proofs showed!) that defendant filed a tax return for the year 1956, showing $2,584.90 taxable <em>income, and no </em>federal <em>income </em>tax due; for the year 1957, showing taxable income of $3,639.64, and tax due of $53; for the year 1958, showing taxable income of $2,019.80, and tax due of $403.96; and for the year 1959, showing taxable <em>income </em>of $2,119.06, and tax due of $423.81. The indictments also charged that defendant knew his taxable income and tax due in those same years was 1956 \u2014 $6,503.73 and $1,350.82; 1957 \u2014$5,079.42 and $1,037.47; 1958\u2014 $8,576.59 and $1,829.91; and 1959\u2014 $13,633.39 and $3,210.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">As we have noted, the jury at this second trial found defendant guilty on all four counts. No issue pertaining to the sufficiency of the evidence to uphold this verdict is presented to us. But it seems essential to us in dealing with the legal and procedural problems which are advanced to note both the essential nature of the evidence from the prosecution and the essential nature of the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">The chief prosecution witness, a special agent with the Intelligence Division, Internal Revenue Service, made an analysis of the checking account operated during these four years by defendant. After adding the known items paid by defendant in cash during those years and deducting all deposits which were of a non-income nature, he arrived at the total taxable income for each year previously noted in the indictment. These proofs showed $33,793.13 of taxable income for the four years in question, whereas defendant\u2019s returns for those years showed a total of $10,363.40. As far as we are able to deduce, these totals are not in dispute in this appeal \u2014 nor apparently were they at the end of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">Secondly, the prosecution produced witnesses who testified to the amounts actually paid defendant by them for medical services and introduced the canceled checks for such services. Thus the prosecution demonstrated that in 132 instances (totaling $5,023.70) either these amounts were entirely omitted or were entered on the defendant\u2019s books (from which his tax returns were made up) in very much smaller sums. All of these items were based upon microfilms of canceled checks upon out-of-town banks which the government subpoenaed from the Dyersburg State Bank. But the proofs showed that the Dyersburg State Bank did not keep or make microfilms of local checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">The defense did not seek to establish the accuracy of the defendant\u2019s returns. Basically it contended before the jury, first, that as to the 132 items referred to above, their omission or inaccurate recor-dation was due to errors of the doctor\u2019s bookkeeper. The bookkeeper (defendant\u2019s mother-in-law) testified that during the years in question defendant saw 25 to 30 patients daily and that she could have made sufficient errors to account for the $5,000 discrepancy. It was clearly established, however, that the defendant received the fees and made all bank deposits and simply told the bookkeeper of the amount to enter. Defendant did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-12\">The second and principal defense was that because of various deductions (to which it was argued the doctor was entitled) and certain claimed loans during the period in question, the defendant actually owed the government no tax for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>the years in question. These claimed deductions and loans were over and above any similar items shown on the defendant\u2019s tax return and had not been referred to in those returns. If allowed in total, they would have served to offset the government claim of $6,547.45 tax due.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">Of course, we must read the jury verdict as resolving such factual disputes as were presented to it in favor of the government; and as we have noted, defendant submits no appellate issue as to weight or sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">On appeal the argument before this court was begun by appellant\u2019s counsel with the frank statement that defendant was an abortionist and that, hence, this court should take great care to see that his procedural rights in this tax evasion case were properly observed \u2014presumably because of the prejudicial effect that the source of his income might have had upon the judge or jury. The fact that income is procured by means which are illegal under state law does not, of course, constitute evidence of violation of federal tax statutes. Lurding v. United States, 179 F.2d 419 (C.A. 6, 1950). But, equally obviously, it does not create any immunity from them either.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">As to appellant\u2019s issues 4 through 12, based upon the judge\u2019s charge as given, or on his failure to give defendant\u2019s requests to charge, we find no reversible error. We have reviewed the charge in toto and considered each of defendant\u2019s detailed complaints about it. The trial judge was clearly under no obligation to give his instructions in language chosen by one of the contending parties. We believe those matters covered by defendant\u2019s request to charge, which should have been made part of the charge, were adequately and fairly set forth to the jury in the charge as given. The charge was full, informative, accurate and balanced and contained in our judgment no error which served to prejudice defendant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-13\">Appellant\u2019s principal reliance at oral argument was on his first two stated issues, which pertained to two claimed loans from one Eddie Adkins to defendant. At this trial defendant\u2019s counsel, without calling Adkins, cross-examined the principal witness for the prosecution on Adkins\u2019 previous testimony at the first trial. Over the government\u2019s objection, he read into the record an affidavit by Adkins stating that in 1958 he loaned Dr. Moody $5,000 and in 1959 he loaned Dr. Moody $4,000, and that Dr. Moody repaid approximately $1,000 and still owed Adkins $8,000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-14\">With defendant\u2019s counsel still cross-examining, there followed this colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-15\">\u201cQ. Now, you know that Adkins had asserted that he was a crap-shooter and had brought that money back from Burma from gambling in the Army in a money belt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-16\">\u201cHad\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-17\">\u201cA. The reason I wanted to hesitate, I thought there was something stated a few minutes ago that I could not testify that Mr. Adkins or anybody else had testified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-18\">\u201cThat is all conclusion\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-19\">\u201cMr. McTighe: We have no objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-20\">\u201cQ. You have hesitated, now, to go ahead and answer. But your lawyers are telling me it can be done, the lead can be done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-21\">\u201cNow, go ahead, answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-22\">\u201cA. Yes, sir. I didn\u2019t want to get in trouble with the Court on hearsay evidence. But, to answer your ques-_ tion, Mr. Adkins did testify that he did come back from overseas with this money strapped around his waist, and that he didn\u2019t let his wife know he had it, and carried it around the country, either around his waist or would stick it in the back of the car, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>or something, and that, although he was borrowing, he did not let his wife know that he had this money, and that Dr. Moody was a good friend of his, and he loaned it without charging him any interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-4\">\u201cQ. Well, now, in inquiring as to whether he received that money, did you inquire into his Army record, and find out from anybody that had served with him whether really he was a big gambler on the Lido Road as he had indicated ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-5\">\u201cA. No, sir. I did not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Subsequently defendant\u2019s principal witness, an ex-Revenue Agent, testified to a computation of defendant\u2019s income which accepted the Adkins\u2019 loans as nontaxable funds available to defendant in two of the years in dispute. Thereupon counsel for the government cross-examined him extensively seeking to establish the implausibility of Adkins\u2019 story. Much of this cross-examination clearly tended to show investigation by revenue agents of the \u201cAdkins lead\u201d because it consisted of documentary proofs of numerous loans and time payment arrangements entered into by Adkins or his wife during a period when he claimed to have $13,000 to $14,000 cash in his possession. Government counsel also cross-examined defendant\u2019s principal witness by asking him about his knowledge of Adkins\u2019 handling of his claimed Burma Road bonanza. In this cross-examination counsel for the government frequently sought to read Adkins\u2019 testimony at the previous trial (at which the witness had been present) in order to show that the witness knew that Adkins had claimed 1) to have brought the $13,000-$14,000 home from the Burma Road in cash carried in a money belt; 2) to have continued (apparently most of the time) to carry same in a money \"belt for the subsequent 20 years; 3) to have (at different times) buried the cash in his backyard and kept it in a wall safe in his G.I. loan financed house, all without his wife knowing anything about his having the money. This procedure of cross-examination was permitted by the trial judge over defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s objection on the theory that the reading of the record served to \u201crefresh the recollection\u201d of the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">On appeal appellant claims that the trial judge should have granted his request to instruct the jury to allow the Adkins loans because of the government\u2019s failure to run down the Adkins lead by investigating military records and seeking possible witnesses to Adkins\u2019 Burma Road gambling winnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">In this regard appellant relies upon Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121, 75 S.Ct. 127, 99 L.Ed. 150 (1954), where the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-10\">\u201cWhen the Government rests its case solely on the approximations and circumstantial inferences of a net worth computation, the cogency of its proof depends upon its effective negation of reasonable explanations by the taxpayer inconsistent with guilt. Such refutation might fail when the Government does not track down relevant leads furnished by the taxpayer\u2014 <em>leads reasonably susceptible of being checked, </em>which, if true, would establish the taxpayer\u2019s innocence. When the Government fails to show an investigation into the validity of such leads, the trial judge may consider them as true and the Government\u2019s case insufficient to go to the jury. This should aid in forestalling unjust prosecutions, and have the practical advantage of eliminating the dilemma, especially serious in this type of case, of the accused\u2019s being forced by the risk of an adverse verdict to come forward to substantiate leads which he had previously furnished the Government. It is a procedure entirely consistent with the position long espoused by the Government that its duty is not to convict but to see that justice is done.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Holland v. United States, supra at 135-136, 75 S.Ct. at 135.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">It seems clear to us, however, that the revenue agents met the requirements of this paragraph when the underlined language is taken into account. The de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>tailed investigation of Mr. and Mrs. Adkins\u2019 financial affairs in the period immediately preceding the claimed loans of 1958 and 1959 is much more relevant to the validity of the \u201clead\u201d than a check of a 20-year-old gambling bonanza. This record seems to us to demonstrate a reasonable effort to run down the Adkins lead. Buttermore v. United States, 180 F.2d 853 (C.A.6, 1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Appellant also claims reversible error in admission of the hearsay evidence just referred to concerning Adkins\u2019 first trial testimony. As to this issue appellant\u2019s counsel elected not to call Adkins but sought and was granted permission over appellee\u2019s objection to introduce Adkins\u2019 affidavit. Then counsel for appellant developed (this time without objection) other hearsay from Adkins\u2019 testimony at the earlier trial. Appellee claims, of course, that its subsequent cross-examination which developed still more of Adkins\u2019 previous trial testimony was only a fair balancing of the advantage which the earlier hearsay had given appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Under the circumstances we have outlined, we have no doubt that some \u201ccurative admissibility\u201d was in order. See 1 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 15 (3d ed. 1940). With the door opened this widely in favor of appellant, we cannot say that the District Judge\u2019s rulings in favor of appellee\u2019s proffered hearsay on the same subject was an abuse of judicial discretion or constituted reversible error. Crawford v. United States, 91 U.S.App.D.C. 234, 198 F.2d 976 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Lastly, appellant contends that the United States District Attorney\u2019s closing argument contained several improper remarks which constituted prejudicial error and entitled appellant to still another trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">Appellant\u2019s counsel did not interpose objections when the remarks were made and subsequently declined (as a matter of trial tactics) the District Judge\u2019s offer to admonish the jury about them.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">While all of the remarks objected to might better have been left unmade, only one might approach prejudice requiring a new trial. In summation the Assistant District Attorney said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-12\">\u201cAnd I have tried \u2014 and the United States Attorney\u2019s office has tried in this case to do what we consider to be our duty, to point out to you \u2014 to show you these things and say to you that we feel in the light of all this proof that this is one of the worst fraud cases \u2014 maybe not in amount because we can\u2019t prove everything we may think or feel or believe \u2014 but this is one of the worst fraud cases ever been here in this court, based on this type of testimony that has been attempted to use to explain it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-13\">Counsel plainly is not entitled to argue or cite facts or evidence which are not part of the record. Rommel-McFerran Co. v. Local 369, International Bhd. of Electrical Workers, AFL-CIO, 361 F.2d 658, 661 (C.A.6, 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-14\">But in this case appellees proved substantial unreported and unexplained income. The reference could have been to the fact (established by the record) that the Dyersburg State Bank\u2019s failure to keep local checks had prevented identification of the sources of some of this income.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-15\">Whether this is so or not, we do not believe that this was a close case (United States v. Rayborn, 310 F.2d 339 (C.A.6, 1962)), or on this total record that the comment amounts to error so prejudicial that this defendant was deprived of a fair trial. United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 60 S.Ct. 811, 84 L.Ed. 1129 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-16\">\u25a0 We, of course, do not have before us the probation report which was available to the United States District Judge prior to sentence to ascertain whether or not a prior felony record justified the administration of the maximum concurrent sentences of imprisonment in this case. Absent such a record, it appears to us that sentences totaling less than half of the sentence actually imposed would satisfy the federal interest in the violation of its tax laws detailed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>In United States v. West Coast News, this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-4\">\u201cUpon a mandate going down on the affirmance of the conviction of these defendants, it will be within the power of the District Judge under Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to reduce the prison sentences imposed. He can do this <em>sua sponte </em>without command from us or motion by defendants. Because of this, we need not now announce whether we consider that the District Judge abused his discretion in imposing the involved sentences, whether we consider that today\u2019s law permits us to change such sentences, or whether we consider that the sentences imposed by the District Judge offend the Eighth Amendment proscription of cruel and inhuman punishment. There will be time enough for us to further consider the matter should the District Judge conclude not to adopt our suggestion as to reduction of the sentences.\u201d United States v. West Coast News Company, 357 F.2d 855, 865 (C.A.6, 1966).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">We affirm this conviction and remand the case to the District Court for its reconsideration of the prison sentences in the light of this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b745-7\">. We note, of course, appellant\u2019s claim of error in the admission of the affidavit when offered by the government. This occurred, however, after appellant\u2019s counsel had already read the entire affidavit into the record from a copy and secured agreement from the principal government witness that he had seen same.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
