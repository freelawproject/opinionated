These compounds are prepared from 2,5-diarylamino-terephthalic acids in a condensation reaction in which two molecules of water are eliminated and two interior rings are formed. The process is known as a double ring-closure. \u201cRing-closing agents\u201d may be employed. Appellant has discovered that improved ring-closure is effected by the use of polyphosphoric acid (PPA) as a ring-closing agent. The improved process is marked by very high yields (e. g., 98%), product purity and other technological conveniences.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-28\">Claim 1 is typical:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-29\">1. The improvement in the process of preparing a quinacridone by ring-closure of a 2,5-diarylamino-tereph-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>thalic compound, which comprises carrying out ring-closure of the 2,5-diaryl-amino-terephthalic compound with the aid of a polyphosphoric acid as a ring-closing agent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">The other claims are drawn to various modifications of the process of claim 1. Claims 11-15 include a dilution of the reaction mixture with water. Claims 5-15 and 16-19 limit the 2,5-diarylamino-terephthalic compounds to acids and esters respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">The examiner relied on the following references:</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">Struve 2,821,530 Jan. 28, 1958</p>\n<p id=\"Aqig\">DuPont (British) 805,247 Dec. 3, 1958</p>\n<p id=\"Afr\">Liebermann, 18 Liebig\u2019s Annalen der Chemie 245-50 (1935)</p>\n<p id=\"AVG\">Uhlig, 66 Angewandte Chemie 435-36 (1954)</p>\n<p id=\"AnhA\">Brockmann et al., 89 Berichte Deut. Chem. 1379-97 (1956)</p>\n<p id=\"b941-13\">Liebermann discloses the basic reaction. The yields are described as less than satisfactory and the purification of the products as difficult. Bing-closing agents employed include zinc chloride, phosphorous pentachloride, aluminum chloride, aqueous hydrobromic acid, hydrogen bromide in glacial acetic acid, and phosphorous pentoxide in tetralin or ey-mene. With the latter, a yield of 44% is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-14\">Uhlig discloses the use of PPA as a \u201cnew cyclization agent in preparative organic chemistry\u201d and reports \u201csurprisingly high cyclic compound yields.\u201d Uhlig teaches that all cyclization reagents, previously used, including phosphorous pentoxide, are \u201csurpassed by PPA in many respects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b941-15\">Brockmann et al. disclose the use of PPA in the preparation of acridones.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-16\">The DuPont patent discloses a preparation of a quinacridone in which the reagents are diluted with water. The Struve patent teaches a process for the preparation of quinacridones from esters. Our resolution of this case renders consideration of the latter two references unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-17\">The only issue is whether the improved process as a whole would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-18\">The examiner summarized his rejection of appellant\u2019s claims as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-19\">All the claims stand rejected as unpatentable over Liebermann and Struve, of record, in view of Uhlig and the British Du Pont patent. The basis of the rejection is 35 U.S.C. 103. It is considered that <em>a chemist of ordinary skill would be led </em>by the Uhlig reference <em>to try polyphosphoric acid </em>in the cyclization process of Liebermann, since the cyclization reagents used by Liebermann, though operative, leave much to be desired, and since Uhlig states that P.P.A. has been found to offer many advantages over other previously used reagents. The mere fact that the results to be obtained are not absolutely predictable does not make its successful use unobvious. In re Wietzel et al., 400 O.G. 463. In re Moreton, [288 F.2d 940, 48 CCPA 928,] 129 U.S.P.Q. 288.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-20\">It being considered <em>obvious to try </em>P.P.A. in the cyclization step, it is further considered obvious to treat the resulting acid reaction mixture in the conventional manner, i. e. by dilution with water, to obtain the product in pigmentary form. The British Du Pont patent is cited to show that the step is in fact obvious to the chemist of ordinary skill. [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b941-21\">The board agreed with the examiner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-22\">The stated position of the Examiner is that a chemist would be led by the Uhlig reference to utilize polyphospho-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>ric acid in the cyclization process of Lieberman[n], in place of the cycliz-ing reagents disclosed by Lieberman[n] since the reagents of Lieberman[n], although operative, leave much to be desired and Uhlig states that polyphosphorie acid has been found to offer many advantages over previously utilized reagents. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-4\">* * * We are in full agreement with the Examiner\u2019s view that the fact that Lieberman[n]\u2019s cyclizing reagents were not entirely satisfactory would be an incentive to one skilled in the art to use other cyclizing reagents in Lieberman[n]\u2019s process as they become available, and in view of the Uhlig disclosure we are of the opinion that it would be obvious to a chemist to use polyphosphorie acid in that reaction, since Uhlig specifically teaches that polyphosphorie acid is a cyclizing reagent in organic chemical reactions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">It is seen that the board\u2019s conclusion is built on the unsatisfactory nature of the Liebermann process and the enthusiastic tenor of Uhlig\u2019s report. But the mere existence of an unsatisfactory process and the attendant incentive to seek improvement do not negative patentability. We think that one cannot fairly infer obviousness from the inadequacies of the prior art. The issue here is whether the elimination of those inadequacies by the means disclosed by appellant would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill \u2022 \u2014 whether the Uhlig disclosure would have made it <em>obvious </em>that the substitution of PPA for phosphorous pentoxide would change a generally unsatisfactory process into an excellent one.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">We do have, on the one hand, Uhlig's comments: \u201c[C]yclization experiments with polyphosphorie acid * * * [result] in surprisingly high cyclic compound yields. All reagents used hitherto for * * * [cyclization reactions] such as AlCls, FeCls, BF8, SnCI*, H2S04, H2F2, P205, HC00H-H8P04, and H2S04-H8P04, are surpassed by \u2018PPA\u2019 in many respects.\u201d On the other hand we have the countervailing considerations which would influence one of ordinary skill in the art in his evaluation of this intelligence. The generality of Uhlig\u2019s disclosure indicates the inappropriateness of literalism in its reading \u2014 the quotations relied on are but parts of the first two sentences of an article which later discusses the merits of PPA in detail, never referring to processes analogous to appellant\u2019s invention. Furthermore, the \u201csurprisingly high\u201d yields reported in the body of the article seem to be increases on the order of 15-25% \u2014 considerably less than appellant\u2019s increase of more than 100%. A skilled worker in the art would also be aware of the chemical similarity of PPA and phosphorous pentoxide and might well infer that the special problems in the Liebermann process would recur when PPA was used. He certainly would be cognizant of the extra difficulty associated with closure of the second ring in double-ring closure reactions and would not assume that the Uhlig catalogue of successful single-ring closures presaged success in <em>double-ring </em>closure. He would note that the only reactions involving five-ring compounds reported by Uhlig were not dehydration reactions, as are those of the invention. Nor from them would he derive an expectation of such increased yields since the yields reported in the preparation of five-ring compounds average <em>less than </em>those of the old Liebermann process.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">In the face of these considerations we conclude that only illusory support for the board\u2019s position can be derived from the Uhlig article.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-12\">The board felt \u201cstrengthened\u201d in its view by the disclosure of Brockmann et al. that acridones had been successfully synthesized with PPA. That synthesis too involves single-ring closure. Appellant protests again that the problem is in the second-ring closure and points out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>that several reagents effective for single-ring closure are ineffective for double-ring closure. This rebuttal seems convincing to us. The solicitor does not rely heavily on Brockmann et al.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">We therefore reverse the rejection of claims 1-10. The solicitor concedes that such a reversal is dispositive of the appeal as to all claims. Accordingly the rejection of claims 1-19 is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b940-32\">. Consisting of Duneombe, Examiner-in-Chief, author of the opinion, and Behrens and Wyman, Acting Examiners-in-Chief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b942-9\">. The solicitor points to the reported preparation of 3\u2019, 4-diketo-l, 2, 3, 4-tetra-hydro-1, 2-cyclopentenophenanthrene and 3', 4-diketo-7-methoxy-l, 2, 3, 4-tetrahy-dro-1, 2-eyclopentenoplienanthrene. Yields are reported as about 60% and 20% respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b943-7\">SMITH, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Akm\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">The examiner, in applying section 103, cast his inquiry in terms of \u201cobvious to try.\u201d The board while not using this terminology has employed the rationale of the examiner\u2019s statement in analyzing the issue presented under section 103. The solicitor abjures it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">There is, of course, nothing in the statute which permits application of such a test. In re Tomlinson, 363 F.2d 928, 53 CCPA 1421 (1966); In re Henderson, 348 F.2d 550, 52 CCPA 1656 (1965); In re Huellmantel, 324 F.2d 998, 51 CCPA 845 (1963); see In re Fay, 347 F.2d 597, 52 CCPA 1483 (1965). It not only involves an analysis for which there is no authorization but it precludes a consideration of the invention as a whole for which there is an explicit statutory directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">Considering the subject matter as a whole in view of the prior art of record, I agree with the majority that the claimed invention is unobvious.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b943-11\">WORLEY, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AbTo\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-12\">Viewing the references relied upon, particularly the Uhlig disclosure that yields of 90-99% may be obtained and \u201cno undesired secondary reactions need be feared\u201d when polyphosphoric acid is employed in place of, e. g. phosphorous pentoxide, as a ring closing agent in analogous reactions, I am satisfied the board has considered the subject matter as a whole and committed no reversible error in rejecting the claims. I would affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
