L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(11A), discrimination action, and the judge awarded her trial attorney\u2019s fees and costs under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9. We affirmed the judgments in an unpublished memorandum and order (95-P-948). See 40 Mass. App. Ct. 1118 (1996). Following the entry of judgment after rescript, the plaintiff successfully moved in the Superior Court for appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs and postjudgment interest on the awards of punitive damages and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>trial attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The defendants appeal from these post-rescript orders.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">1. <em>Trial attorney\u2019s fees. </em>The plaintiff is entitled to postjudgment interest on the award of trial attorney\u2019s fees. Compare <em>International Totalizing Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>PepsiCo, Inc., </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 424, 437 (1990)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (\u201cInterest on the portion of the award representing attorneys\u2019 fees should ... be calculated from the time judgment was entered on the c. 93A claim\u201d). The commands of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 9(4) and 11, and G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, that a court finding for a petitioner \u201cshall,\u201d in addition to other relief, award \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs,\u201d are sufficiently similar, see <em>Powers </em>v. <em>H.B. Smith Co., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 657, 667 (1997), to persuade us that postjudgment interest on trial attorney\u2019s fees should be assessed in discrimination cases. We find additional support for this conclusion in the liberal construction to be given to G. L. c. 151B, as stated in \u00a7 9, in order to accomplish its purposes. Compare <em>Gaulin </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 744, 748, 750 (1987) (pointing out that postjudgment interest on attorney\u2019s fees assessed for prevailing party in a civil rights action, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1988, parallels practice with respect to ordinary money judgments and that \u201c[i]f, in the end, fees awarded as reasonable were paid after delays, net of interest, the effect as a practical matter would be to reduce those fees by indeterminate amounts without an explicable logic\u201d). We find further support for this approach in Federal practice. Compare <em>id. </em>at 748 (citing cases); <em>Mill Pond Assocs. </em>v. <em>E &amp; B Giftware, Inc., </em>751 F. Supp. 299, 303 (D. Mass. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">2. <em>Punitive damages. </em>Both the postjudgment interest statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>G. L. c. 235, \u00a7 8, and the prejudgment interest statute, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B, are silent with respect to interest on punitive damages. Our court has ruled that prejudgment interest compensates a prevailing party for loss of use of money, and that such compensatory purpose would not be served by adding prejudgment interest to punitive damages. <em>Makino, U.S.A., Inc. </em>v. <em>Metlife Capital Credit Corp., 25 </em>Mass; App. Ct. 302, 320-321 (1988) . The defendants argue by analogy that postjudgment interest therefore should not be awarded on punitive damages. The plaintiff relies on <em>Fontaine </em>v. <em>Ebtec Corp., </em>415 Mass. 309, 326-328 (1993), in which a Superior Court jury found for the plaintiff on claims of age discrimination under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(1B), and under the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621 et seq. (1988), and awarded actual and liquidated damages. <em>Id. </em>at 310-311. The Supreme Judicial Court, treating the liquidated damages under the Federal statute as \u201cessentially punitive in nature,\u201d <em>id. </em>at <em>321, </em>ordered an award of postjudgment interest pursuant to G. L. c. 235, \u00a7 8. Drawing on <em>Fontaine </em>and the plain language of \u00a7 8, making it applicable to \u201c[ejvery judgment for the payment of money,\u201d we conclude the plaintiff here similarly is entitled to postjudgment interest on the punitive damages award.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">3. <em>Appellate attorney\u2019s fees. </em>Without a directive from this court, the Superior Court had no authority to award appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs. <em>Patry </em>v. <em>Liberty Mobilehome Sales, Inc., </em>394 Mass. 270, 272 (1985). The plaintiff does not deny she failed to request these fees in her brief in the prior appeal to this court, contrast <em>Yorke Mgmt. </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>406 Mass. 17, 18, 20</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">(1989) , but argues that because that appeal was decided without oral argument she had no opportunity to request fees at that time and that the issue, therefore, properly was before the trial court. She offers no citation or persuasive rationale in support of that argument. Nor does she argue that G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, mandates the award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees at this time. Compare <em>Powers </em>v. <em>H.B. Smith Co., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. at 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Accordingly, we vacate the order awarding appellate attorney\u2019s fees and affirm the award of postjudgment interest with respect to punitive damages and trial attorney\u2019s fees and costs. We deny the plaintiff\u2019s request for her costs and attorney\u2019s fees in this and her previous appeal. See <em>Anthony\u2019s Pier Four, Inc. </em>v. <em>HBCAssocs. </em>411 Mass. 451, 476 n.27 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The defendants make no argument in their appellate brief that postjudgment interest on costs should not have been allowed. The issue is therefore waived. See Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b487-8\">In <em>International Totalizing Sys. Inc., supra, </em>this court relied on <em>Patry </em>v. <em>Liberty Mobilhome Sales, Inc., </em>394 Mass. 270, 272 (1985), in ruling that interest on attorney\u2019s fees should be calculated from the time of judgment and not from the time the complaint was filed. We believe this is a correct interpretation of the statement in <em>Patry </em>that \u201c[n]o interest should have been allowed on the amount of trial court attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Review of the procedural background of the <em>Patry </em>case, including its three sojourns in this court, leads us to conclude that the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s rejection of the trial judge\u2019s order in 1983 that interest be added to the 1981 award of attorney\u2019s fees \u201cfrom the date of the award,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 271, may fairly be read as addressed solely to prejudgment interest on attorney\u2019s fees. See, e.g., <em>Mill Pond Assocs. </em>v. <em>E &amp; B Giftware, Inc., </em>751 F. Supp. 299, 302 (D. Mass. 1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
