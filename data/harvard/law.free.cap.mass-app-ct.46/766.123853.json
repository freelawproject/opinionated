He was driving at approximately fifty-five miles per hour in the passing lane of Route 128 south in Waltham when his vehicle suddenly swerved into the guardrail. He does not recall any details of the collision, having suffered a concussion (perhaps because his air <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>bag failed to deploy). The accident left his vehicle severely damaged. The State police responded to the scene of the accident and reported that on a clear, dry morning and on a highway free of defects Nercessian\u2019s vehicle had swerved to the left while braking, for some unknown reason, then hit the guardrail and swerved back into the travel lanes.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">The appellee, the Board of Appeal on Motor Vehicle Liability Policies and Bonds (board), acting pursuant to its statutory and regulatory authority,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> applied a presumption of fault against Nercessian arising from his involvement in the single-vehicle accident.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At his hearing before the board, Nercessian challenged the presumption and resulting surcharge by arguing (despite his failure of memory) that the accident had occurred as a result of mechanical failures in his car rather than his own acts or omissions. In support of his contention, he introduced a transcript of a taped telephone conversation between his attorney and a purported auto repairman discussing possible mechanical defects that \u201cmight have\u201d or \u201ccould have\u201d caused the accident. The board\u2019s hearing officer rejected this evidence as unreliable<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and determined that the regulatory presumption of fault, along with \u201cthe totality of evidence,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> justified upholding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>the surcharge. That conclusion was affirmed by the full board.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Nercessian proceeded to appeal the board\u2019s decision to the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113P, third par., which, as amended through St. 1983, c. 241, \u00a7 20, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-6\"><em>\u201cAny person </em>. . . <em>aggrieved </em>by any finding or order of the board <em>may appeal therefrom to the superior court department </em>of the trial court, <em>pursuant to the provisions of section fourteen of chapter thirty </em>A. . . . <em>Said court shall, </em>after such notice to the parties as it deems reasonable, <em>give a summary hearing on such appeal and shall have such jurisdiction in equity to review all questions of fact and law, </em>and to affirm or reverse such finding or order and may make any appropriate decree. Said court or justice may allow such appeal, finding or order to be amended. <em>The decision of the court or justice shall be final. . . . </em>Said court may make reasonable rules to secure prompt hearings on such appeals and a speedy disposition thereof.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">A judge of the Superior Court affirmed the board\u2019s decision, ruling that Nercessian had failed to bear his burden of demonstrating its invalidity and that it was supported by substantial evidence in the record, not merely the rejection of Nercessian\u2019s transcript evidence. Compare <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Pharmacy, </em>350 Mass. 246, 251-252 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">Appealing to this court from that affirmance, Nercessian contends that the board erred in disbelieving his evidence, which he claims undermines the regulatory presumption, and that the Superior Court judge erred in determining that the board\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. Relying on traditional principles of deferential judicial review of administrative agency action and the authorities cited in note 3, <em>supra, </em>the board urges us to approve the Superior Court\u2019s conclusion that the board had justifiably rejected, as insufficient to overcome the presumption of fault, Nercessian\u2019s unreliable speculations as to how the accident happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>At oral argument, we inquired about a question not addressed in the briefs, namely, whether we were empowered to decide the appeal in light of the words of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113P, that the decision of the Superior Court on appeal from the board \u201cshall be final.\u201d In response, the parties submitted arguments of limited assistance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nercessian asserts that Appeals Court jurisdiction is conferred by the provision of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 15, as amended by St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 3, which states that \u201c[t]he supreme judicial court and the appeals court shall have concurrent jurisdiction to review any proceedings had, determinations made, and orders or judgments entered in the superior court pursuant to section fourteen [of c. 30A].\u201d Since his \u00a7 113P appeal of the board\u2019s decision to the Superior Court had been by its very terms \u201cpursuant to the provisions of section fourteen of chapter thirty A,\u201d Nercessian maintains that an appeal to the Appeals Court clearly lies by virtue of the plain words of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 15. Unfortunately, Nercessian\u2019s argument makes no effort to reconcile the seeming conflict between the \u201cfinality\u201d language of \u00a7 113P and the all-encompassing jurisdictional statement of \u00a7 15, except to suggest that \u00a7 113P\u2019s words \u201cshall be final\u201d are to be ignored \u2014 a reading we would be loath to reach except as a last jurisprudential resort after it has been convincingly demonstrated to us (which Nercessian fails to do) that \u201cno other possible course is open.\u201d <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Greyhound Real Estate Fin. Co., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 282, 289 (1996), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McMenimon, </em>295 Mass. 467, 469 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">The board has been little more helpful on the issue posed by the panel. Without citation to authority or any reference to its apparent oversight heretofore,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the board conclusorily pronounces \u201cthat, in light of the plain language of [\u00a7 113P] . . . , <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>the Appeals Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over an appeal from the Superior Court of a Board decision. . . . [T]he explicit language of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113P would appear to control over the more general terms of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 15.\u201d Recalling pre-chapter 30A doctrine, the board argues that Nercessian and other similarly stymied motorists disappointed by an adverse Superior Court decision will always have a \u201climited right of appeal\u201d by way of a certiorari action pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, which is \u201csufficient due process\u201d \u201c[gjiven the limited magnitude and modest complexity of most surcharge appeals.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Despite the technically defective nature of the board\u2019s contentions on the jurisdictional point,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it is correct in its assertion that we should not address the merits of the instant appeal. Both parties have essentially posited that the finality language of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113P, and the jurisdictional provision of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 15, are irreconcilably conflicting and that one must yield to the other.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We do not accede to those positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">It is our duty to make every effort to give force and effect to \u201cevery word of a legislative enactment.\u201d <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Greyhound Real Estate Fin. Co., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 289, quoting from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number><em>Chatham Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn., </em>362 Mass. 216, 219 (1972). More generally, we must strive to construe allegedly inconsistent statutes \u201caddressing similar subject matter. . . together [in order] to make \u2018an harmonious whole consistent with the legislative purpose,\u2019 [as well as] to avoid rendering any part of the legislation meaningless,\u201d <em>Healey </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>414 Mass. 18, 25-26 (1992) (citation omitted); and we must do so \u201cin harmony with common sense and sound reason.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>371 Mass. 186, 190 (1976), quoting from <em>Atlas Distrib. Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>354 Mass. 408, 414 (1968). The fundamental goal is, as always, ascertaining as best we can the expressed or presumed intent of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Here, that intent can be gleaned from the procedural scheme established by G. L. c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 113B and 113P, particularly the use of presumptions of fault at the administrative level and \u00a7 113P\u2019s authorization of the Superior Court judge to whom an appeal is taken \u201cto review all questions of fact and law\u201d in a \u201cprompt\u201d but \u201csummary hearing on such appeal\u201d and to make \u201ca speedy disposition thereof.\u201d This statutory language bespeaks a legislative desire to streamline the review process, a design reflecting (as the board observes) \u201cthe limited magnitude and modest complexity of most surcharge appeals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Such an objective of expedition would be impeded, if not thwarted, by the addition of another layer of full-fledged appellate decision-making, which could easily aggravate delay in the efficient implementation of the board\u2019s task of dealing with the ubiquitous and seemingly inevitable phenomenon of automobile accidents in our society \u2014 a problem that has been recognized by the courts of this Commonwealth for at least three-quarters of a century. Cf. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>251 Mass. 569, 594-597 (1925); <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Lonergan, </em>285 Mass. 266, 268 (1934). The legislative purpose of speedy disposition of such matters would seem best served not only by the elimination of procedural \u201cformalities . . . [that] cause delay,\u201d <em>Summit Fid. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>333 Mass. 476, 481 (1956) \u2014 which \u00a7 113P explicitly authorizes the reviewing Superior Court to do \u2014 but, even more effectively, by making the Superior Court\u2019s appellate decision literally \u201cfinal\u201d and, as the board asserts, leaving surcharged motorists to, at most, a limited right of further appeal, arguably the extraordinary certiorari remedy under G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>Such a scheme appears at first blush validated by the decision (uncited by the board) in <em>Merchants Mut. Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Justices of the Superior Ct., </em>291 Mass. 164 (1935). That case involved G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113D, the provision (dealing with appeals from orders of motor vehicle insurance cancellation) on which the appeal mechanism in \u00a7 113P is plainly modeled,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which states that the decision of the Superior Court on appeal from an order of the board \u201cshall be final.\u201d The Supreme Judicial Court held in <em>Merchants Mutual </em>that, notwithstanding the finality language of \u00a7 113D, \u201cThis court has jurisdiction in certiorari concerning such a decision,\u201d 291 Mass, at 165, which it proceeded to exercise by reviewing only for errors of law appearing on the record, <em>id. </em>at 167, because the facts of record \u201cmust be accepted as true.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The modem version of certiorari might appear even more appropriate in light of the judicial broadening, over the last generation, of the statutory remedy beyond its historic common-law restrictions and technicalities. See <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Redev. Authy., </em>374 Mass. 37, 49-50 (1977); <em>Wightman </em>v. <em>Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Inst., Walpole, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 442, 445 (1985) (the scope of review on certiorari is a function of the nature of the judicial or quasi judicial action sought to be reviewed). Our courts now allow review on certiorari to extend, in appropriate cases, to determining whether the decision being challenged was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion, see <em>Caswell </em>v. <em>Licensing Commn. for Brockton, </em>387 Mass. 864, 877-878 (1983); whether such decision was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>supported solely by inadequate evidence, <em>Wightman, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. at 445-446; and even whether such decision was supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Boston Edison, </em>374 Mass, at 53-54. See <em>Bielawski </em>v. <em>Personnel Administrator of the Div. of Personnel Admin., </em>422 Mass. 459, 464 (1996); <em>Yerardi\u2019s Moody St. Restaurant &amp; Lounge, Inc. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Randolph, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 296, 300-301 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">We reject, however, the board\u2019s position that the only recourse of a surcharged motorist whose \u00a7 113P appeal is denied by the Superior Court is the certiorari route of G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, however liberalized, for several reasons. The first rests upon principles of sound judicial administration. A civil action in the nature of certiorari \u201cmay be brought [only] in the supreme judicial or superior court.\u201d G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. We cannot conceive that the Legislature could have acted with the essentially irrational intention of compelling a person in Nercessian\u2019s situation to undergo two successive and basically identical Superior Court proceedings relitigating the same issues.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Nor can we reasonably postulate a legislative intent to burden the Supreme Judicial Court (or a single justice thereof) with potentially voluminous matters of such minimal judicial significance. Cf. <em>Bartlett, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 290-291; Johnedis, Impact of the Appeals Court on the Supreme Judicial Court, 77 Mass. L. Rev. 146, 146-147, 149-150, 154 (1992).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Because of that consideration of judicial economy, combined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>with the canon of statutory construction that mandates our viewing no words of a statute as superfluous, we must attribute significance to the words of \u00a7 113P that characterize the initial appeal process as \u201cpursuant to the provisions of\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, against the background of \u00a7 15\u2019s conferring of jurisdiction on the Commonwealth\u2019s institutional appellate tribunals to review all Superior Court proceedings, orders and judgments made \u201cpursuant to [c. 30A] section 14.\u201d Indeed, the Supreme Judicial Court has already pointed in that direction, although only in dictum, in <em>Almeida </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>383 Mass. 226 (1981). There, the court dealt with an insurer whose attempted surcharge on the insured motorist (after denying the motorist\u2019s claim under the policy) was ordered rescinded by the board. The insurer did not exercise its right of appeal to the Superior Court under \u00a7 113P but persisted in denying the claim, which provoked a civil action for damages against the insurer by the motorist. Early in that litigation, the motorist obtained a trial court ruling that the board\u2019s surcharge decision conclusively precluded the insurer from relitigating the issue whether the motorist was more than fifty per cent at fault. On the insurer\u2019s appeal, and in the course of upholding the application of the doctrine of issue preclusion to the board\u2019s order to prevent relitigation of an issue before a different tribunal, the Supreme Judicial Court observed that \u201cwe would be required by G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113P, and G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, to uphold the board\u2019s decision on appeal if we found substantial supporting evidence and no other \u00a7 14 violation.\u201d 383 Mass, at 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The <em>Almeida </em>decision did not mention, much less focus' on, the finality provision of \u00a7 113P. It indicates, however, the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s apparent view that further review of a board surcharge decision, beyond the Superior Court, properly lies to a regular appellate tribunal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We are obligated, nonethe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>less, in deciding this case to give \u201csome measure of finality\u201d to the Superior Court\u2019s decision, \u201celse the word \u2018final\u2019 inserted [into the appeal provision of \u00a7 113P] . . . would itself be meaningless surplusage, contrary to the principle just discussed.\u201d Bartlett, 41 Mass. App. Ct. at 289-290. The right of further appeal from the Superior Court\u2019s \u00a7 113P appeal decision to this court cannot, therefore, be coextensive with G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7), as Nercessian argues, which would read \u201cfinal\u201d out of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">On the analogic strength of the discussion in <em>Bartlett, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 289-291 &amp; n.12,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> we conclude that the Superior Court\u2019s decision on appeal under \u00a7 113P is \u201cnot. . . exempt from review[] for error of law by a panel of the Appeals Court,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 291, and that any such asserted error will be \u201csubject to de novo judicial review\u201d by this court. <em>Raytheon Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>364 Mass. 593, 595 (1974). That review cannot, however, extend to examining the weight of the evidence to determine whether the Superior Court\u2019s decision \u2014 either upon its own findings of fact or those of the board adopted by the Superior Court \u2014 was justified, unless there is absolutely \u201cno basis in fact\u201d to support that decision. See <em>Estep </em>v. <em>United States, </em>327 U.S. 114, 122-123 (1946) (construing scope of judicial review under the Federal Selective Service Act which provided that classification decisions of local draft boards \u201cshall be final\u201d). See also <em>Cox </em>v. <em>United States, </em>332 U.S. 442, 448, 452-453 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>The finality language of \u00a7 113P thus operates to limit the scope of further review to a greater degree than the modern, liberalized certiorari remedy. See text accompanying note 12, <em>supra. </em>Cf. <em>Bartlett, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 291 n.12, quoting from <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Mayor of Cambridge, </em>253 Mass. 193, 199 (1925) (\u201cthe statute provides that \u2018The decision of the [district] court shall be final and conclusive upon the parties\u2019 ... as such [the] decision, so far as it relates to questions of fact, will not be reversed, yet the parties are not deprived of the right to have manifest errors of law corrected\u201d). Such a result is faithful to both the intended nature of surcharge proceedings and the applicable canons of statutory interpretation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Because the arguments Nercessian advances solely involve challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence on the basis of which the board upheld his insurer\u2019s merit rating surcharge on account of his single-car collision, his appeal addresses matters beyond the scope of our review.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b801-6\">See, with respect to this regulatory scheme, G.

However, the board failed to raise any objection to this court\u2019s review of the insured\u2019s appeal in <em>Merisme; </em>and the board itself launched the appeals in <em>Yazbek </em>and <em>Prescott.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b804-7\">Compare, e.g., <em>Swan </em>v. <em>Justices of the Superior Ct., </em>222 Mass. 542, 544-546 (1916) (statutory provision that \u201cthere shall be no appeal\u201d from a Superior Court decision does not preclude a writ of certiorari); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>251 Mass. 569, 616 (1925) (Supreme Judicial Court stated that despite language in a proposed act that the decree of the Superior Court \u201cshall be final,\u201d such a decree would still be subject to a writ of certiorari); <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Mayor of Cambridge, 253 </em>Mass. 193, 199-200 (1925); <em>Commissioners of Civil Serv. </em>v. <em>Municipal Ct. of Boston, </em>369 Mass. 84, 90 (1975) (statutes providing that decision of district or municipal court reviewing the removal of a municipal employee \u201cshall be final and conclusive\u201d does not prevent resort to certiorari to correct manifest \u201cerrors of law apparent on the record\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b804-8\">See Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975); <em>Lolos </em>v. <em>Berlin, </em>338 Mass. 10, 14 (1958) (parties have the duty to assist the court with appropriate citation of authority); <em>Langlitz </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Chiropractors, </em>396 Mass. 374, 376 n.2 (1985) (assertion \u201cmade without citation to authority or reasoned argument . . . does not rise to the level of [adequate] appellate argument\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b804-9\">Were the hypothesis of such irredeemable conflict correct, we would be obliged to agree with the board that \u00a7 113P, as the more recent and more specific expression of the Legislature\u2019s intent, would trump \u00a7 15. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. (No. 1), </em>425 Mass. 210, 215-216 (1997), and authorities there cited. Any attempt to obtain further review beyond the Superior Court would then have to be to the Supreme Judicial court by means of G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4 (certiorari), or G.

The appeal provisions of the third paragraph of \u00a7 113P are identical in all material respects to those of the third paragraph of \u00a7 113D \u2014 including the language mandating a \u201csummary hearing,\u201d conferring jurisdiction on the Superior Court to \u201creview all questions of fact and law,\u201d authorizing court rulemaking to secure \u201cprompt hearings\u201d and a \u201cspeedy disposition,\u201d and making the. court\u2019s decision \u201cfinal\u201d \u2014 with one significant exception: \u00a7 113D says nothing about G. L. c. 30A or the nature of the appeal, whereas \u00a7 113P specifies the appeal as being \u201cpursuant to the provisions of section fourteen of chapter thirty A.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b806-7\">Review only for substantial errors of law apparent on the face of the record and not of findings of fact or sufficiency of tire evidence was the traditional limited judicial function on a petition for a writ of certiorari.

App. Ct. 805, 810-812 (1979). There, we accepted a direct appeal from a Superior Court judge\u2019s findings in a proceeding under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 43A, for reasons of judicial economy, notwithstanding the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s earlier decision in <em>MacKenzie </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Ipswich, </em>342 Mass. 612, 613-614 (1961). <em>MacKenzie </em>had held that there could be no direct appeal of adverse Superior Court determinations under \u00a7 43A (which dealt with appeals from public school teacher dismissals and provided that \u201cThe decision of the [superior] court shall be final, except as to matters of law\u201d) and that a writ of certiorari was the only available method of review; and several decisions of this court before <em>Doherty </em>had applied <em>MacKenzie </em>to dismiss efforts to take direct appeals from judgments entered under \u00a7 43A. Our opinion in <em>Doherty </em>rested on the phenomenon that, following <em>MacKenzie, </em>litigants dissatisfied with Superior Court decisions under \u00a7 43A proceeded to commence actions in the nature of certiorari in the Supreme Judicial Court; the single justices of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>that court adopted the practice of transferring them to this court for disposition under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4A, by single justices; and our single justices typically reserved and reported them to a panel of this court. Such a circuitous process resulted in nothing but additional expense and delay. It is both premature and speculative to adjudge whether the <em>Doherty </em>rationale would ever be appropriate with respect to \u00a7 113P in light of the modem development of the certiorari remedy; it is, in any event, not an available option to us at this time, given our obligation to construe and apply the statutes applicable to the present controversy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b808-7\">By virtue of G. L. c. 211 A, \u00a7\u00a7 10 &amp; 11, and the inherent nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>intermediate appellate system, all applications for appellate review of Superior Court determinations (with exceptions not here relevant) are filed with the Appeals Court rather than the Supreme Judicial Court and remain to be decided here, subject to the transfer of the appeal by the Supreme Judicial Court on an order for direct appellate review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b809-7\">In <em>Bartlett, </em>we harmonized apparently conflicting provisions of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G, which stated that, on an appeal of a \u201cfrivolous claim\u201d fee sanction under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, from the Superior Court to a single justice of the Appeals Court, the decision of the single justice \u201cshall be final\u201d; but then went on immediately to state that \u201cAny appeal to the supreme judicial court or the appeals court shall proceed according to the Massachusetts Rules of Appellate Procedure.\u201d Applying the principles of statutory construction discussed above, we held that this \u201cfinality\u201d language could not preclude further review at least for errors of law in light of the provision plainly indicating the availability of some form of further review of the single justice\u2019s action; and we suggested, in dictum, that in all probability the finality contemplated by the statutory language related to the single justice\u2019s findings of fact. See 41 Mass. App. Ct. at 290-291 &amp; n.12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b810-7\">To the extent G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 15, as construed herein, makes the Superior Court\u2019s decision under \u00a7 113P reviewable by appeal to this court, an action in the nature of certiorari will not lie. See <em>Garden Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>District Ct. of Somerville, </em>336 Mass. 432, 434 (1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b810-8\">Nercessian purports, in the first of his two appellate arguments, to be attacking the board\u2019s \u201cerror of law\u201d in concluding that he had failed to overcome- the presumption that he was more than fifty per cent at fault. This label cannot, however, disguise the fact that he is arguing that he \u201cproduc[ed] sufficient evidence\u201d to overcome the presumption, see 211 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 74.03 (1995), contrary to the board\u2019s finding and the Superior Court\u2019s ruling that he did not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b810-9\">Were we to reach the merits of Nercessian\u2019s would-be appeal, we would agree with the board that the Superior Court judge was correct in sustaining the board\u2019s surcharge decision, for the dual reasons that Nercessian failed to produce sufficient contrary evidence to overcome the presumption of fault and that that presumption, combined with the other evidence in the record, constituted substantial evidence for imposing the surcharge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
