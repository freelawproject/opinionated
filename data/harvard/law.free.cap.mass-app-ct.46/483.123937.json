The following conference was held at side bar.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-17\">Defense counsel: \u201cYour Honor, naturally I would object <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>because [juror 3-16] is one of the very few people of color in the jury panel; and it would appear that I think she\u2019s the only African-American on the panel, and I would ask that she not be excused.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-5\">Judge: \u201cWell, to me \u2014 I wasn\u2019t even aware that the defendant was black. Is your client black?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-6\">Defense counsel: \u201cNo, the defendant is Hispanic, Your Honor. However, he has the option of selecting himself either black or Caucasian, as a Hispanic, and so for that same \u2014 I think he would be prejudiced by relieving the only African-American from the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-7\">Judge: \u201cBut he is Hispanic?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-8\">Defense counsel: \u201cYes, he is Hispanic.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-9\">Judge: \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll hear from the Commonwealth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-10\">Prosecutor: \u201cWell, I remove minority jurors from the panel with great hesitation and great trepidation. I think it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve done it this year. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any pattern. I am simply concerned about that particular juror\u2019s husband being on the Springfield Police Department. I believe it puts her in a very difficult position to listen to the testimony of other police officers. I would also say that I observed her smiling at [defense counsel] beforehand. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s acquainted with [defense counsel], but simply, that is the reason I exercised my challenge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-11\">Judge: \u201cWell, based on the fact that it appears to me that \u2014 I didn\u2019t even realize that the defendant was Hispanic, from his appearance. He appears to me to be Caucasian. To me, that\u2019s not a Hispanic name.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-12\">Prosecutor: \u201cWell, I think it is a Hispanic name. Calderon?\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-13\">Judge: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re right. I was thinking it was \u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>well, however, this is the same [juror] who came forward and said her husband was a police officer for twenty years; and I think that based on all the circumstances here, I\u2019m going to allow her to be excused, and I\u2019ll note your objection, counselor.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Generally, a trial judge\u2019s determination that the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>monwealth has a valid reason for exercising a peremptory challenge to exclude a juror is entitled to substantial deference on appeal, but that determination is not beyond review. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. 461, 489, cert, denied, 444 U.S. 881 (1979). In this case, juror 3-16 was the only African-American, and her exclusion created a jury panel where the \u201cminority representation\u201d was reduced to \u201cimpotence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass, at 488 n.32. \u201cIf the constitutional mandate of a jury which fairly reflects a cross section of the community is to signify more than hollow words in this Commonwealth, we cannot permit the peremptory challenge to be exercised with absolute and unbridled discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484. There were missteps leading to the exclusion of juror 3-16 from the defendant\u2019s jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The Commonwealth, in its brief, acknowledges that it would have been better if the judge had stated his finding on the record, but concedes that the judge implicitly recognized a prima facie showing of impropriety existed because he \u201casked the prosecutor to explain [his] reasons\u201d for the challenge. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Futch, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 174, 175 (1995). See and compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mathews, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 564, 569, 570-571 (1991). \u201cAfter the prosecutor offered an explanation for [his] challenges, the judge should have specifically determined whether they were bona fide or a mere sham. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fryar, </em>[414 Mass. 732, 739 (1993)]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, supra </em>at 491. Only when this procedure has been followed will an appellate court give due deference to the judge\u2019s conclusions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burnett, </em>418 Mass. 769, 771-772 (1994). Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>424 Mass. 78, 80-81 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roche, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 372, 378 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Compounding the incompleteness of the inquiry, the judge foreclosed any rebuttal by defense counsel of the Commonwealth\u2019s explanation for its peremptory challenge. \u201cBy so doing, the defendant^ [was] thwarted in [his] attempt to show that reasons offered by the prosecutor did not \u2018pertain to the individual qualities of the prospective juror.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>v. <em>Futch, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. at 177-178, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass, at 491. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>816 F.2d 421, 423 (8th Cir. 1987) (defendant must \u201cbe giv\u00e9n the chance to rebut the proffered explanation as a pretext\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">If the judge had taken the opportunity to flesh out the reasons he accepted the prosecutor\u2019s explanation, he would likely have concluded, as we do, that the record in this case does not support the decision to permit the peremptory challenge. \u201cSorting out whether a permissible or impermissible reason underlies a peremptory challenge is the function of the trial judge, and we do not substitute our judgment for his if there is support for it on the record.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Legendre, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 948, 949 (1988), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMatteo, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 547, 552 (1981). In <em>Legendre, </em>this court determined that, \u201c[o]n the over-all record, the judge was warranted in concluding that the grounds offered for the challenges . . . were pretexts.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Legendre, supra </em>at 949. There, we concluded that \u201cthe motivation behind the [prosecutor\u2019s] challenges was a belief\u201d that one gender would \u201cbe more sympathetic to the complaining witness and less sympathetic to the defendant.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The Commonwealth contends that the prosecutor gave legitimate reasons for the juror\u2019s impartiality that were unrelated to her ethnicity \u2014 namely, that her husband was a member of the Springfield police department and that the prosecutor noticed juror 3-16 smiling at the defense counsel beforehand. This was insufficient justification. It is remarkable here (to put it mildly) that it was not defense counsel but the prosecution objecting to the police officer relationship; the defendant wanted juror 3-16 to remain part of the jury venire, in spite of the fact that her husband\u2019s occupation was that of a police officer. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass, at 485 n.27; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fruchtman, </em>418 Mass. 8, 11, cert, denied, 513 U.S. 951 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Green, </em>420 Mass. 771, 774-775 (1995). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>424 Mass, at 84 (Fried, J., dissenting) (\u201cIf the potential juror\u2019s spouse had worked in a law enforcement agency would a challenge by a defense counsel have seemed the least bit remarkable?\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In this regard, that stated basis is unconvincing and for the most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>part counter-intuitive and provides inadequate record support for the judge\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">As to the Commonwealth\u2019s other argument below (which was not mentioned by the judge and, properly, is not emphasized on appeal), the so-called smirk or smile objection has long been discounted by this court. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMatteo, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 547, 553 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">A reversal of the defendant\u2019s convictions is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">2. <em>Definition of reasonable doubt. </em>Given that the defendant is entitled to a new trial, we need not pursue in depth his concerns regarding the jury instruction defining \u201creasonable doubt.\u201d We note for purposes of any retrial, however, that, \u201c[wjhere issues as important as reasonable doubt are concerned, judges would do well to follow approved models.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Burke, 44 Mass. App. Ct. 76, 81 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">3. <em>Disposition. </em>As noted, the defendant was convicted on two indictments. The ammunition conviction was placed on file with the defendant\u2019s consent. Because the errors discussed above also affected the conviction placed on file, we also reverse that conviction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chappee, </em>397 Mass. 508, 523 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. O\u2019Brien, 30 Mass. App. Ct. 807, 807 n.l (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">\n<em>Judgments reversed. Verdicts set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-18\">See note 3, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b518-14\">As an aside, the judge and both counsel were confused. In circumstances such as those present here, the ethnicity of the defendant is nearly irrelevant. The focus should have been on the ethnicity of the jury venire. See <em>Powers </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number><em>Ohio, </em>499 U.S. 400 (1991). See also <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Kiff, </em>407 U.S. 493 (1972); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roche, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 372 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Earlier, at side bar during the jury impanelment, the following exchange had occurred, which resulted in an initial decision that juror 3-16 would remain on the jury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-9\">Juror 3-16: \u201cMy husband is a Springfield police officer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-10\">Judge: \u201cWhat is his rank?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-11\">Juror 3-16: \u201cHe\u2019s a patrolman.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-12\">Judge: \u201cHow long has he been in the Department?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-13\">Juror 3-16: \u201cAbout twenty years, I think.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-14\">Judge: \u201cAnd is he in any particular department?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-15\">Juror 3-16: \u201cHe\u2019s in Property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-16\">Judge: \u201cProperty?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-17\">Juror 3-16: \u201cMm-hmm.
