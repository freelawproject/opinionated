His conviction was upheld on appeal, 32 Mass. App. Ct. 906 (1992). Critical to the Commonwealth\u2019s case was the testimony of three witnesses, Austin Price, Toryn Chambers, and Andrew Calkins. In a motion for a new trial filed in 1997, the defendant challenged the evidence elicited from the three: Price\u2019s on the ground that the judge and prosecutor mishandled a cooperation agreement in violation of the teaching of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa, </em>406 Mass. 257 (1989); Chambers\u2019s on the basis that the prosecution failed to disclose a cooperation agreement between the Commonwealth and Chambers; and Calkins\u2019s for the reason that the prosecutor not only failed to disclose that Calkins had recanted, but also threatened Calkins with perjury charges if he corrected his testimony. The defendant\u2019s motion also claimed error in the failure of the judge to give sua sponte a jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter on the theory of sudden combat. We affirm the denial of the motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">1. <em>Price\u2019s cooperation agreement. </em>Price testified that after the fracas, the defendant told him he had stabbed someone; that when he heard the youth had died, the defendant stated he was going to look for a knife he had dropped; and that subsequently the defendant asked Price to keep the matter quiet. On cross-examination, counsel for the defendant elicited testimony that before Price testified to the grand jury, he had entered into an agreement with the Commonwealth that he would not be prosecuted for any of the crimes arising out of Dresp\u2019s death. Price admitted that shortly after the incident, when the police executed a search warrant at Price\u2019s house, they found blood on Price\u2019s hand and in his bathtub. At that time, he had not told the police of the defendant\u2019s admissions nor of his own admission that he had stabbed someone.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">On cross-examination of Price, defense counsel asked several questions concerning Price\u2019s agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\"><em>Q: </em>\u201cAnd your deal, sir, that deal was to testify truthfully, right?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-8\">A: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number><em>Q: </em>\u201cAnd it\u2019s fair to say that it\u2019s your understanding that the person who determines whether it\u2019s truthful, is the person you entered the deal with, right?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">A: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\"><em>Q: </em>\u201cAnd that\u2019s [the prosecutor]?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">A: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-8\"><em>Q: </em>\u201cSo if he\u2019s happy with your testimony, you\u2019re not going to get prosecuted, right?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-9\">A: \u201cCorrect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-10\"><em>Q: </em>\u201cAnd you haven\u2019t been prosecuted, have you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-11\">A: \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-12\"><em>Q: </em>\u201cNo complaints or indictments have been issued against you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-13\">A: \u201cNone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-14\">On redirect examination, the prosecutor offered the agreement in evidence, and it was admitted over the defendant\u2019s objection that it was cumulative and self-serving. The agreement was a letter dated June 21, 1989, addressed to Price from the prosecutor and assented to by Price. It provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-15\">\u201cThis letter will confirm our agreement regarding the investigation into the stabbing death of Andreas Dresp, who died on June 11, 1989.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-16\">\u201cYou have represented to me that you did not participate in any way in said stabbing, but that you have information regarding the crime. You have agreed to testify truthfully before the grand jury, at any pre-trial proceeding, and at any trial that may result. In return, the Commonwealth hereby agrees that you will not be prosecuted for your actions on Saturday, and Sunday, June 10 and 11, 1989.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-17\">\u201cThis agreement shall be considered to have been breached by you in the event that you fail to testify truthfully at any such grand jury or pre-trial proceeding or trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>or if the Commonwealth establishes that you participated in the stabbing of Andreas Dresp.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa, supra, </em>the defendant claims a new trial is required because (1) the language of the Price agreement constituted impermissible vouching by the Commonwealth for the witness\u2019s reliability; (2) the prosecutor improperly used the agreement in closing argument; and (3) the judge failed to give proper cautionary instructions concerning Price\u2019s reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The standard for reviewing the manner in which the cooperation agreement was handled at trial, which was not raised on the defendant\u2019s direct appeal, is whether the errors, if any, created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>417 Mass. 619, 624-625 n.4, 626 (1994). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hallet, </em>427 Mass. 552, 553 (1998). There is no such risk here.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">We note first that <em>Ciampa </em>was decided after the defendant\u2019s trial had concluded, and it appears, as the Commonwealth suggests, that the case applies only to future trials.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>425 Mass. 382, 398 (1997). But cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>411 Mass. 719, 739-740 (1992) <em>(Ciampa </em>analysis applied to <em>pre-Ciampa </em>trial). In any event, the cooperation agreement and its use by the prosecutor were consistent with the principles of our cases and, in the circumstances, a cautionary instruction by the judge was not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">In <em>Ciampa, supra, </em>the court accepted the rule that, if appropriately handled, \u201ctestimony pursuant to a plea agreement, founded on a promise of truthful cooperation, and the plea agreement itself are admissible,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 261, and do \u201cnot constitute improper prosecutorial vouching for a witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 260. There are certain requirements for such admissibility, and since some of the provisions of the agreement in that case were too prejudicial, the court held they should have been redacted. A majority of the court considered that a \u201cstatement that the agreement was \u2018contingent upon the truthfulness of [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>witness\u2019s] representation to the Commonwealth that he, personally, did not shoot the victim,\u2019 \u201d could be read as an implicit assertion by the Commonwealth that the witness\u2019s representation was true. <em>Id. </em>at 262.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, it \u201cshould have been redacted on request by a defendant.\u201d3 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The defendant argues that, since the Price cooperation agreement, like the agreement of the witness in <em>Ciampa, </em>was contingent on the truth of Price\u2019s statements as to his own lack of involvement in the death of the victim, the Commonwealth, in effect, improperly vouched for or attested to the truth of Price\u2019s representation. The language of the Price letter, however, makes clear that it is Price who made the representation. In return for Price\u2019s agreement to testify truthfully, the Commonwealth agreed that he would not be prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">That the difference in language is important and that implicit vouching by the Commonwealth will not be readily found, is indicated by the agreement upheld in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>422 Mass. 816, 833-834 (1996). The last sentence of that agreement provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">\u201cThis promise is expressly conditioned on your representation that you did not participate in either stabbing mentioned above and on your complete and truthful cooperation with the Commonwealth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 834. The complete agreement considered in <em>Gordon </em>is set out in the margin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In rejecting the defendants\u2019 claim that the agreement of the witness required him \u201cto comport with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>particular factual scenario\u201d envisioned by the Commonwealth, the <em>Gordon </em>court, at 834, explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-5\">\u201cThe agreement does not say that the Commonwealth\u2019s performance is contingent on [the witness\u2019s] testimony conforming to the Commonwealth\u2019s version of the events. Rather, the Commonwealth\u2019s commitment is conditioned on [the witness\u2019s] noninvolvement in the two killings and his \u2018truthful cooperation\u2019 with the Commonwealth.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Price\u2019s agreement is not verbally \u201ccontingent\u201d on his representation (contrast <em>Ciampa, supra </em>at 262), is similar to the language discussed in note 3, <em>supra, </em>and can not, reasonably, be read as impermissible vouching by the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Although the defendant claims that the prosecutor in his closing improperly used the agreement to imply that the Commonwealth had verified that Price was telling the truth, the defendant\u2019s argument has no merit. \u201cA prosecutor in closing argument may restate the government\u2019s agreement with the witness and may argue reasonable inferences from the plea agreement\u2019s requirement of truthful testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 265. What he or she may not do is to suggest that the government has special knowledge by which it can verify the witness\u2019s testimony. This the prosecutor did not do. He asked the jury to read closely the letter to Price and \u201c[p]ay very close attention to the last paragraph,\u201d a paragraph which the prosecutor then read aloud. This was the only reference to the agreement and was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">There was also no reversible error in the judge\u2019s failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>give a cautionary instruction to consider the witness\u2019s credibility with particular care. It is true that \u201c[w]hen a prosecution witness testifies pursuant to a plea agreement containing a promise to tell the truth, and the jury are aware of the promise, the judge should warn the jury that the government does not know whether the witness is telling the truth.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meuse, </em>423 Mass 831, 832 (1996). The failure to instruct, standing alone, is, however, not reversible error. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, \u201c[tjhis case does not present the question presented in <em>Ciampa, </em>that is, whether the jury instructions <em>cured the errors </em>in failing to redact [prejudicial admission of certain portions of a written plea agreement and] the repeated references to the witness\u2019s obligation to tell the truth. . . . [Therefore, ... the defendant] [was] not entitled to a specific instruction that the jury should exercise special caution in evaluating [the witness\u2019s] testimony.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>411 Mass, at 740. This is especially true here where defense counsel\u2019s vigorous cross-examination of Price laid stress on his motives for pleasing the prosecutor. See <em>ibid. </em>See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brousseau, </em>421 Mass. 647, 654 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">In sum, there was no error, let alone a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, in the handling of the Price cooperation agreement at trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">2. <em>Alleged agreement of cooperation between Chambers and the prosecutor. </em>In his June 22, 1989, appearance before the grand jury, Chambers did not implicate the defendant in Dresp\u2019s death. He testified that the defendant never admitted the stabbing, but to the contrary, denied having done so. At trial, Chambers told a different story, devastating to the defendant, which included the defendant\u2019s admission to the stabbing.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">In support of his motion for a new trial \u2014 on the basis of newly discovered evidence \u2014 the defendant proffered an affidavit of Chambers dated January 28, 1997. Chambers there alleged:<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-9\">\u201c6. In June, 1989, I was arrested and charged with intimidation of a witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>\u201c7. After being arrested, I was held on $2,500 cash bail, which I was unable to post.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">\u201c8. A few days after being arrested and held on bail, I gave a statement to the police in the case involving Justin Holmes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">\u201c9. After giving the statement, I was told that if I testified for the government in the case against Justin Holmes, things would work out for me on the charge of intimidation of a witness pending against me, and I agreed to testify for the government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">\u201c10. A few days later, I was brought into Court and the government recommended that my bail be lowered to $1,000 cash, an amount which my family was able to pay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">Other documents and transcripts filed in support of the defendant\u2019s motion indicate that the intimidation charge, as well as an assault and battery charge against Chambers, arose out of an incident on June 28, 1989, in which Chambers confronted Price, told him he did not have to testify, and punched him.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At Chambers\u2019s arraignment on those charges on June 30, 1989, he was ordered held on $2,500 cash bail, which he was unable to post. On July 3, 1989, with counsel present, Chambers related a version of events to police substantially consistent with his later trial testimony. On the same day, Chambers petitioned the Superior Court for reduction of bail; bail was reduced to $1,000, the amount recommended by the prosecutor (the same prosecutor who prosecuted the defendant\u2019s case).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">On October 18, 1989, after the completion of the defendant\u2019s trial, Chambers and a codefendant pleaded guilty before the same judge who had presided at the trial in the defendant\u2019s case. When the judge, troubled by the leniency of the suggested sentence, asked why the prosecutor was recommending a less severe sentence \u2014 a suspended sentence \u2014 for Chambers, who was more culpable than his codefendant, the prosecutor gave the explanation set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He added that, had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Chambers not been in possession of critical evidence in the murder case, he would have sought a much higher sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Based on Chambers\u2019s affidavit and the favorable treatment received by him from the prosecution, the defendant claims that there was an undisclosed cooperation agreement between Chambers and the prosecution requiring a new trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Gilday, 382 Mass. 166, 178 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>386 Mass. 1, 9 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tucceri, </em>412 Mass. 401, 404-406 (1992). Since the defendant had specifically moved for evidence of promises and inducements, a failure to produce such materials would require a new trial unless the \u201cerror did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilday, supra, </em>quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 112 (1976), quoting from <em>Kotteakos </em>v. <em>United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 764 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The determination whether a new trial is required based on an affidavit that a key prosecution witness may have lied or may have received undisclosed promises is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>383 Mass. 253, 257, 259 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>424 Mass. 382, 397 (1997). In making that determination, the judge must consider \u201cnot only ... the seriousness of the issue asserted, but also ... the adequacy of the defendant\u2019s showing on the issue raised.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, supra </em>at 257-258.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">In the case at bar, the judge who denied the defendant\u2019s motion had considerable acquaintance with Chambers. He had been the trial judge and thus had heard Chambers\u2019s testimony, and he had also been the judge who had taken Chambers\u2019s plea, and had sentenced him in the intimidation case. While it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>have been preferable for the judge to specify that the affidavit did not raise a substantial question warranting a hearing, rather than rule as he did, see note 1, <em>supra, </em>in view of the record on appeal, we deem it unnecessary to remand for an explicit ruling for what was undoubtedly implicit in the judge\u2019s denial of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Chambers\u2019s assertion in his affidavit that an unidentified person had told him that things \u201cwould work out for him\u201d if he testified for the government and he agreed to so testify does not establish the existence of a cooperation agreement. \u201c[T]he fact that [he] expected to, and did, receive favorable treatment after the defendant\u2019s trial does not amount to a deal.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doherty, </em>394 Mass. 341, 348 n.9 (1985). In addition, Chambers\u2019s presentencing memorandum in the intimidation matter<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> unequivocally stated: \u201cIt should be noted that at no time did [the prosecutor] promise or even offer any lenience to Toryn.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Thus the affidavit, even when coupled with the favorable treatment received by Chambers, does not carry a measure of strength in support of the defendant\u2019s position that there was an agreement between Chambers and the prosecutor. Moreover, in view of the extensive and effective cross-examination of Chambers by the defendant\u2019s counsel, we are confident that even had Chambers testified in accordance with his affidavit, such additional testimony would not have \u201cinfluence[d] the jury, or [would have] had but very slight effect.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilday, </em>382 Mass, at 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">As in the case of Price, defense counsel vigorously cross-examined Chambers and laid stress upon his previous inconsistent stories to the police and the grand jury. He elicited evidence of Chambers\u2019s pending indictments for intimidation of a wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>ness and assault and battery. He highlighted the fact that Chambers went to jail, and that bail was reduced at about the same time that he changed his story. Chambers acknowledged that he did not want to be incarcerated, and that the assistant district attorney who was prosecuting the defendant was also in charge of his, Chambers\u2019s, case. Chambers admitted that he would \u201cmuch rather have a happy\u201d prosecutor than an \u201cangry\u201d one. Counsel asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\"><em>Q: </em>\u201cBecause if you can convince [the trial prosecutor] that you\u2019re telling the truth, he\u2019s going to recommend no time, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">A: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\"><em>Q: </em>\u201cYou sure hope he does, right?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-8\">A: \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">Counsel elicited that Chambers was informed by his attorney that perjury in a murder case was punishable by life imprisonment and that the prosecutor had the power to seek a perjury indictment. When Chambers was asked if he had been indicted for perjury, he answered, \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t, not yet.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In closing summation, defense counsel urged the jury to reject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Chambers\u2019s testimony as not credible. He laid stress on the fact that Chambers changed his story immediately after obtaining his freedom after having spent time in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">In view of the evidence brought out on Chambers\u2019s cross-examination, we are confident that, had Chambers\u2019s testimony incorporated the statements of his affidavit, it would have had but slight effect, if any at all, upon the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">3. <em>Calkins\u2019s affidavit. </em>At trial, Calkins testified that after the altercation between the Cambridge and Belmont youths, he, the defendant, and others were sitting on the couch in Price\u2019s living room. While Calkins was talking to the person on his right, the defendant who was sitting to his left,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">\u201clike tapped me, so when I turned to him, and it wasn\u2019t exactly clear, so I couldn\u2019t really quote it, but it\u2019s \u2018Got him, got him there, got,\u2019 something like that, \u2018got him here.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t like really elaborate. I, maybe, \u2018Hit him here, got him here,\u2019 something like that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Calkins, by pointing to his body, indicated that when the defendant made the foregoing statement, the defendant\u2019s hand was on Calkins\u2019s right side along his rib cage. (The medical testimony as to the location of the victim\u2019s stab wound was consistent with where the defendant had touched Calkins\u2019s body.)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">As he argues with respect to Chambers\u2019s evidence, the defendant claims that there is newly discovered evidence with reference to Calkins\u2019s testimony which requires a new trial. He contends that Calkins, after testifying to the grand jury, recanted, that the prosecutor became angry, and by threatening Calkins with perjury, precluded him from giving testimony favorable to the defendant. Calkins\u2019s affidavit is dated September 23, 1994, and was submitted two and one-half years later by the defendant with his motion for a new trial. Calkins\u2019s affidavit is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> An examination of the affidavit does not support the defendant\u2019s claims. There was no recantation by Calkins of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>either his grand jury testimony or his trial testimony. He did not claim that he lied or even that he testified inaccurately. Indeed, a comparison of his grand jury testimony with his testimony at trial is consistent with his affidavit, and shows that he was less certain at trial and that his grand jury testimony was more inculpatory.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Assuming that the prosecutor showed excessive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>anger \u2014 if true, such behavior was clearly troublesome and improper \u2014 the defendant has not shown any prejudice. The Calkins affidavit does not support the defendant\u2019s contention that Calkins was intimidated and therefore failed to give favorable testimony to the defendant. The affidavit not only does not claim or suggest that Calkins\u2019s trial testimony was inaccurate but it also does not claim that it was in any way affected by the prosecutor\u2019s alleged extreme irritation or threats.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Here again we deem it unnecessary to remand for an explicit determination by the trial judge that the Calkins affidavit did not raise a substantial issue requiring a hearing. We conclude there was no error in his denial of the defendant\u2019s motion on his claim relating to Calkins\u2019s trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">4. <em>Manslaughter instruction. </em>The judge properly denied the motion insofar as it claimed that the judge should have, sua sponte, given a manslaughter instruction. That issue was determined in our previous decision,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and in any event, a review of the record indicates the accuracy of the statement in that opinion: \u201cThere was no evidence that the defendant was provoked by the victim, faced sudden combat, or possessed the subjective state of mind to require a manslaughter instruction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>32 Mass.

App. Ct. 906 (1992) (rescript); indeed, the Appeals Court expressly disposed of the manslaughter issue, <em>id. </em>at 908.1 decline to act on this motion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b587-9\">We also note that <em>Ciampa </em>was a first degree murder case, where the court was applying the standard of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, <em>Ciampa, supra </em>at 268-269, rather than the standard of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556 (1967). The <em>Freeman </em>standard \u201cappears to be a harder one for a defendant to satisfy.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lennon, </em>399 Mass 443, 448-449 n.6 (1987). Moreover, many of the objections in <em>Ciampa </em>were preserved for appeal (and thus received a more generous standard of review).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b588-9\">Three judges dissented and considered that \u201c[t]he statement says no more than [what the dissent suggests the majority would also view as proper, namely] that, if [the witness\u2019s] representation indeed should turn out to have been false, the Commonwealth will have no obligation with respect to a sentencing recommendation.\u201d <em>Ciampa, supra </em>at 274 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b588-10\">In the present case there was no such request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b588-11\">The agreement provided:</p>\n<p id=\"Ad5T\">\u201cYou have stated to [an] Assistant District Attorney that you were present at, and have direct knowledge of, the robbery and stabbing of Jesse McKie and the stabbing of Rigoberto Carrion, both events occurring in Cambridge on January 25, 1990.

That the court also cited <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa </em>in the same paragraph, 422 Mass, at 834, as the language of the opinion quoted in the text above, strongly suggests that implicit vouching by the Commonwealth was not found in the promise conditioned on the witness\u2019s representation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b590-10\">Although it would have been \u201cthe better course,\u201d see <em>Ciampa </em>at 263 n.6, to delete the signature of the prosecutor, the failure to do so did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b590-11\">The affidavit does not contain any paragraphs bearing numbers 1-5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b591-10\">Others were involved in the incident and a codefendant was charged with the same offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b591-11\"> \u201cMr. Chambers was an eyewitness to a homicide, a murder which under-lied |&gt;z'c] this entire series of incidents.

But for that truthful testimony, and the fact that that truthful testimony was essential in order to obtain justice in the death of Andreas Dresp, and only for that reason, the Commonwealth thinks that, firmly believes that a penalty of incarceration now would result in a feeling on the street, and a recognition on the street, that if you cooperate with authorities, not only is it not going to help you, but it might very well end up hurting you. And in the interest of being able to ensure that law enforcement authorities are able to get the information they need to solve what is really the underlying crime, the serious crimes that we\u2019re talking about, that a recognition that there is a benefit to society and people on the street for telling the truth, for cooperating with the authorities, is essential.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b593-8\">The memorandum is contained in the Commonwealth\u2019s supplementary appendix. The Commonwealth asserts in its brief that it did not present the memorandum to the motion judge because the judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion on the day after it was filed and before the Commonwealth had had an opportunity to supplement the record. The Commonwealth argues that this court may take judicial notice of the memorandum as pleadings in an ancillary case. We do not rest on that ground, but note that the defendant in his reply brief makes reference to the memorandum and does not argue that it may not be considered.

At one point during the evening, Justin Holmes tapped me on my left side, to get my attention, and said something which I did not fully understand at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"AZyL\">\u201c4. Approximately one week later, after I heard that Justin Holmes was arrested for stabbing someone on the night of June 10/11, 1989, it occurred to me that Justin might have said T got him here,\u2019 but I was not sure whether that was what he said.</p>\n<p id=\"A7-\">\u201c5. When I was called to testify before the Grand Jury, I testified as to what I thought Justin might have said on the night in question.</p>\n<p id=\"APH\">\u201c6. Approximately one month after my testimony before the Grand Jury, I met with [the] Assistant District Attorney .... At that time I told [him] that I was not certain of what I had heard Justin say.</p>\n<p id=\"AAY\">\u201c7. When I told this to [the Assistant District Attorney], he became extremely angry, threw something down on the desk, slammed his hand on the desk, pushed back his chair, stood, and said to me in a loud voice that I had already testified before the Grand Jury and that I could not now change my story.</p>\n<p id=\"ALU\">\u201c8. [The Assistant District Attorney] then explained to me the penalties for perjury, and stormed out of the room, giving me no opportunity to reply or explain my prior statements.</p>\n<p id=\"Aju\">\u201c9. When [the Assistant District Attorney] returned, he said that I needed to decide whether to tell the truth or to protect a friend. At that time, I told [him] that I was not trying to protect anyone, but that I was just not sure if I had heard Justin make the statement to which I had testified before the Grand Jury.</p>\n<p id=\"Af9\">\u201cSigned under the pains and penalties of perjury,</p>\n<p id=\"AP3\">/s/ Andrew Calkins.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b596-15\">At the grand jury, Calkins testified that while he was on the couch at Price\u2019s house and people were talking about the stabbing, the defendant \u201cleaned over and whispered to me, he said that it was him, he did it.\u201d When asked what words the defendant had used, he answered, \u201cI couldn\u2019t quote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>him. He said, I was the one that stabbed him, or whatever, something like that.\u201d He also testified, \u201cHe said on the side,\u201d and touched Calkins on his right-hand side.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b597-9\">As the defendant concedes in his brief, it is not improper for a prosecuting attorney to advise a prospective witness of the penalties for testifying falsely. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Penta, </em>423 Mass. 546, 549-550 (1996). Of course, if the prosecutor went beyond that, and intimidated the witness, such behavior would have been highly improper. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 385 (1994). The timing of the judge\u2019s denial, see note 11, <em>supra, </em>may have precluded the filing of a counter affidavit by the trial prosecutor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b597-10\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, his brief on his direct appeal raised the exact issue upon which he now relies.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
