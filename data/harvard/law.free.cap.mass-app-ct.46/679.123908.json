He also claims that the administrative judge erred iii not finding him \u201cin the concurrent service of more than one insured employer\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The undisputed facts are as follows. The employee was employed as a \u201cgroundskeeper-custodian/mechanic\u201d with the Everett Housing Authority (housing authority). On November 2, 1989, he injured his back while in the course of his employment with the housing authority. Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, the worker\u2019s compensation carrier (insurer), accepted liability and began paying the employee $321.43 per week based on an average weekly wage of $482.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">In January, 1990, the employee filed a claim for further benefits based on additional wages he had earned while concurrently employed as a union welder. In 1992, the insurer filed a complaint for discontinuance of the employee\u2019s benefits. At a hearing in July, 1993, the two claims were consolidated, and the administrative judge heard evidence on both issues. In his decision, the administrative judge found that as of February 9, 1993, the employee was partially disabled and'had an earning capacity of $175 per week. He ordered the insurer to pay $204.76 per week from February 10, 1993, to date and continuing. The administrative judge denied the employee\u2019s claim for benefits based on concurrent employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Upon appeal by the employee, the reviewing board summarily affirmed the decision of the administrative judge. The employee then filed an appeal with the single justice of this court, who reported the case to a panel of justices for consideration. .</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">1. The employee\u2019s first contention is that the administrative judge erred in finding him to have a $175 per week earning capacity. That decision, the employee argues, rests on the administrative judge\u2019s error in adopting, carte blanche, the opinion of Dr. Geuss, the impartial medical examiner. In essence, the employee claims that the administrative judge leaned too heavily on Dr. Geuss\u2019s opinion, giving it more than the prima facie effect permitted by the third paragraph of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A, on the issue of his earning capacity. See <em>Scheffer\u2019s Case, </em>419 Mass. 251, 258 (1994). We disagree. Pursuant to \u00a7 11A(2), an impartial physician\u2019s report constitutes prima facie evidence only as to matters contained in the medical report. Earning capacity entails an assessment of other factors besides the employee\u2019s physical condition. Once the extent of the medi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>cal disability has been determined, an administrative judge may make an independent determination of the employee\u2019s earning capacity. <em>Scheffler\u2019s Case, </em>419 Mass, at 257. That decision, in turn, must focus upon factors such as the employee\u2019s work experience, education, training, and age. See <em>Ballard\u2019s Case, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 1068, 1068 (1982). \u201c[I]n the absence of testimony as to the earning capacity of the employee, the [administrative judge is] entitled to use [his or her] own judgment and knowledge in determining that question.\u201d <em>Mulcahey\u2019s Case, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 3 (1988), quoting <em>O\u2019Reilly\u2019s Case, </em>265 Mass. 456, 458 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The administrative judge stated in his decision that he accepted Dr. Geuss\u2019s conclusion that as of February 9, 1993, the employee was only partially disabled from his work-related injury. Implicit in Dr. Geuss\u2019s evaluation was the notion that the employee had the ability to engage in at least some sort of gainful employment. The administrative judge was not required to adopt the testimony of Dr. Conners, the employee\u2019s vocational expert, who stated in his report that as of August 11, 1992, when interviewed by him, the employee was \u201cunable to engage in substantial gainful activity.\u201d Dr. Conners also testified that he had not made \u201cany kind of assessment of whether [the employee] can do other types of work other than the work he did before [his back injury].\u201d See <em>Amon\u2019s Case, </em>315 Mass. 210, 215 (1943) (a fact finder may reject some or all of the testimony of an expert). The administrative judge heard testimony from the employee, a vocational expert, and numerous doctors. His findings demonstrate that he took into account the employee\u2019s relatively young age (43 at the time of the hearing), his transferable vocational skills, level of education, and lack of motivation to seek other jobs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Given these considerations, the administrative judge was warranted in concluding that the employee could perform some kind of \u201cwork other than his usual occupation.\u201d See Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 342 (2d ed. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">That the administrative judge in his subsidiary findings failed to mention the employee\u2019s vocational expert\u2019s evaluation does not vitiate his ultimate conclusion. As to the economic element of the incapacity issue, the administrative judge may use his own judgment and knowledge in determining the question of an earning capacity. See <em>O\u2019Reilly\u2019s Case, </em>265 Mass, at 458; <em>Per-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number><em>rival\u2019s Case, </em>268 Mass. 50, 54 (1929); <em>Mulcahey\u2019s Case, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The employee makes a related argument that the administrative judge mistakenly relied upon the independent medical examiner\u2019s report with respect to the degree of disability because the examiner failed to consider the employee\u2019s heart condition and depression as \u201ccontributing factors.\u201d There is nothing to this contention because the record shows that the administrative judge took these conditions, into consideration as they were independently established by other evidence. In fact, the administrative judge found that \u201cthe employee\u2019s depression is causally related to the . . . workplace injury and his treatment with Dr. C. Oliver for pulmonary problems [is] also related.\u201d However, there was other evidence implicitly credited by the administrative judge that, despite those conditions, the employee could operate his motor vehicle, do \u201ca little cooking now and then,\u201d do some yard work, and work around his swimming pool. This evidence indicates that the administrative judge had a sufficient basis to conclude that the employee could perform some work, albeit less arduous than his previous employment. In a case such as this, where there is more than one condition involved in the employee\u2019s treatment, any lacunae in the independent medical examiner\u2019s report may be supplemented by other evidence, including the employee\u2019s testimony, depositions, medical reports of other physicians, and hospital records. The independent medical examiner\u2019s report does not provide exhaustive criteria for assessing the nature and extent of the employee\u2019s disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">2. We now consider whether the administrative judge properly rejected the employee\u2019s claim of concurrent employment within the meaning of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(1), and thus correctly computed his average weekly earnings solely on the basis of his earnings from the housing authority.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">The undisputed facts relevant to the statutory conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>which permit assertion of concurrent employment in the employee\u2019s compensation claim are as follows: during 1989 (records were not submitted for prior years), the employee earned an annual salary of $25,000 from his day job with the housing authority. In addition, through the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers\u2019 Union Local 29, he was assigned to work evenings as an \u201con call\u201d welder and boilermaker, earning about $14,000 from three different employers. He remained \u201con call\u201d before his injury and had completed his last assignment as a welder about one month before his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The administrative judge denied the claim for concurrent employment on the basis of <em>Chartier\u2019s Case, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 7, 8-11 (1984). There, we stated, \u201cAs the claimant here \u2018quit\u2019 his [second] job at Belchertown, we are not called upon to review a situation where an employee is furloughed, discharged without good cause, or otherwise involuntarily released by one of his employers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10 n.5. This case raises the issue, alluded to in <em>Chartier\u2019s Case, </em>of whether substantial intermittent employment may be considered as concurrent under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The employee relies on <em>Nelson\u2019s Case, </em>333 Mass. 401, 403-404 (1956). Nelson had been employed as a jackhammer operator, and also worked as a taxi driver on Friday and Saturday evenings and other occasional times under a contract of hire with a taxi company. Unlike the situation presented here, he returned to work each week and on the same contract, and his work as a taxi driver was ongoing at the time of his work-related injury as a jackhammer operator. The <em>Nelson </em>court held that an employee could be found to be in concurrent service of more than one employer where during regular periods of the week he had undertaken to perform services for more than one employer. <em>Ibid. </em>The situation is somewhat different here. To earn additional wages as a welder, the employee was required to list himself on Local 29\u2019s \u201cout of work\u201d list and await a call for employment. The administrative judge found that, \u201c[a]s work was made available, the employee would be called in by the union local .... He was working (at various times in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>1989) at T. O\u2019Connor up to October 1989 when the job was over and the employee was terminated for lack of work. The [ejmployee testified, however, he was available for work.\u201d Implicit in his findings is the conclusion that the employee was available for welding work until he was injured in November, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Section 1(1) of G. L. c. 152 lacks precision as to whether intermittent employment which generates earnings for the employee can be used to calculate average weekly wages. When construing a statute, words or phrases used in any part of a statute should be related and considered in light of their context. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Essex, </em>387 Mass. 326, 337 (1982). In <em>Robinson\u2019s Case, </em>354 Mass. 282, 286 (1968), the injured worker was employed full-time at a supermarket and part-time at a local Jewish Community Center. The court held that the employee\u2019s average weekly wages, as defined under \u00a7 1(1), was to be derived from earnings from both employers. Worker\u2019s compensation benefits were not to be apportioned between the employers\u2019 insurers under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26B<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; rather, benefits were to be paid entirely by the insurer of the employer for whom the employee was working when injured. We learn from <em>Robinson\u2019s Case </em>that harmonizing the definition of concurrent employment under \u00a7 1(1) with the \u201cjoint and several\u201d language that appears in \u00a7 26B requires a broad interpretation, viewed in light of the worker\u2019s compensation statute\u2019s purpose to \u201cpromote the accomplishment of its beneficent design.\u201d <em>Neff </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Industrial Accs., </em>421 Mass. 70, 73 (1995), quoting from <em>Young </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>218 Mass. 346, 349 (1914). Likewise, in the instant case, where the employee did not leave his second job of his own volition, it would prove an irrational result were we to adopt the administrative judge\u2019s restrictive interpretation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>phrase \u201cconcurrent service,\u201d as it appears in \u00a7 1(1), to mean that the employee must be actually employed or under a contract of hire at the time of the injury. Here, it was beyond the employee\u2019s control whether his work as a welder was to be extended on a weekly basis. On the record before us, it appears that whether the employee obtained work as a welder depended on his ranking on the union\u2019s \u201cout of work\u201d list and the location of the welder\u2019s jobs that became available.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">From the language of \u00a7 1(1), its legislative history, and its context, it appears that the term \u201caverage weekly wages\u201d includes wages earned from concurrent employment where the employee is injured after involuntary termination from a second job from which income is derived. The worker\u2019s compensation statute is a remedial one and, as such, should be given \u201ca broad interpretation, viewed in light of its purpose.\u201d <em>Neff </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Industrial Accs., </em>421 Mass, at 73. \u201cThe history of work[er\u2019s] compensation in this Commonwealth shows that the Legislature gradually but consistently has enlarged the scope of the laws pertaining to it and that the courts have construed them liberally for the protection of the injured employee.\u201d <em>Roberge\u2019s Case, </em>330 Mass. 506, 509 (1953). We therefore conclude that when an employee would have remained \u201con call\u201d for work with an employer but for a compensable work-related injury sustained while in the concurrent employment of a different employer, he or she may receive worker\u2019s compensation benefits based on average weekly wages for both jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Where, by reason of what appears in the record, it is not possible to determine the correct benefits based on the employee\u2019s average weekly wages from both employments, remand of the case to the Department of Industrial Accidents is necessary. For purposes of computation of his worker\u2019s compensation rate, the employee is entitled to have his earnings from his job at the housing authority combined with his earnings as a welder for the twelve-month period prior to his injury. The applicable procedure is outlined in 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.07(2)(a) (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">The part of the decision of the Department of Industrial Accidents denying the employee benefits based on wages earned from concurrent employment is vacated, and the case is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>remanded for a recalculation of the employee\u2019s average weekly wage. In all other respects, the decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b715-7\"> The employee testified that he was not actively looking for work, and had no \u201cpresent plans to seek work in the open labor market.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b716-8\"> The definition of \u201caverage weekly wages\u201d appearing in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(1), as amended by St. 1935, c. 332, \u00a7 1, and St. 1943, c. 529, \u00a7 1, so far as material, reads, \u201cIn case the injured employee is employed in the concurrent service of more than one insured employer or self-insurer, his total earnings from the <em>several </em>insured employers and self-insurers shall be considered in determining his average weekly wages\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">Prior to the amendment of G.
