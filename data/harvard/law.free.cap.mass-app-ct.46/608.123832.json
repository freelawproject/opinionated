As a result, the defendant, the director of the division, suspended Silva\u2019s lobster permit for two years and prohibited any transfer of his permit. Silva brought this action<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> claiming that the administrative hearing violated the prohibition against double jeopardy contained in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and that the notice he received of the administrative hearing was inadequate, violated G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11, and deprived him of his constitutional right to due process. Silva and the defendant filed cross motions for judgment on the pleadings; the pleadings included the administrative record. A judge of the Superior Court affirmed the decision of the division. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">On September 4, 1995, during an administrative inspection at sea of the fishing boat \u201cThe Seagull,\u201d environmental police officers<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> found eighty-two live, egg-bearing female lobsters, all with yellow rubber bands on their claws, kept separately from the remainder of the catch of \u201cThe Seagull.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Silva, the captain of the boat and holder of a lobster permit, was on board during the inspection. Section 41 of c. 130, see note 1, <em>supra, </em>sets forth the criminal offense of possessing \u201cany female lobster bearing eggs.\u201d Charged with violating that statute, Silva was acquitted after a trial in the Orleans Division of the District Court Department. Subsequently, one of the environmental police officers who had participated in the administrative inspection and had taken photographs of the egg-bearing lobsters filed a notice of claim for an adjudicatory proceeding, and the division issued an order \u201cto show cause [to Silva] why [his] coastal commercial lobster permit no. 9794[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] should not be suspended or revoked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>for violations of the provisions of G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 41.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">1. <em>Double jeopardy. </em>Double jeopardy is violated if multiple criminal prosecutions are brought or multiple criminal punishments are imposed for the same offense. See <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>522 U.S. 93, 99 (1997); <em>Luk </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>421 Mass. 415, 430 (1995). The State may, however, impose both criminal and civil sanctions for the same act or omission. The double jeopardy clause requires only that the State not punish nor attempt to punish twice for the same offense. <em>Id. </em>at 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Relying on <em>Luk </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>421 Mass. 415, the Superior Court judge analyzed G. L. c. 130 and ruled that although \u201cthe suspension of the plaintiff\u2019s permit does have punitive aspects, its main purpose is to protect the public resources of marine fisheries rather than punishment and is properly characterized as a non-punitive measure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Subsequent to the opinion in <em>Luk </em>(and to the judge\u2019s decision in this case), the Supreme Court of the United States, in <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>522 U.S. 93, \u201cclarified the proper analysis for determining whether civil sanctions constitute punishment.\u201d <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>426 Mass. 534, 537-538 (1998). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 259, 262 (1998). Under that analysis, it has become even more evident that the suspension of Silva\u2019s permit is a civil sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">\u201cWhether a particular punishment is criminal or civil is, at least initially, a matter of statutory construction.\u201d <em>Hudson, supra </em>at 99. The court must first determine whether the Legislature has expressly or impliedly indicated whether the penalty is civil or criminal. <em>Ibid. </em>If it is determined that the Legislature has intended a civil penalty, the court must next examine \u201cwhether the statutory scheme [is] so punitive either in purpose or effect as to transform what was clearly intended as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(internal citations and quotations omitted). Certain factors, set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> provide \u201cuseful guideposts\u201d on this second inquiry, but \u201cthese factors must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>be considered in relation to the statute on its face . . . and only the clearest proof will suffice to override legislative intent and transform what has been denominated a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 100. (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Even a brief examination of G. L. c. 130 leaves no doubt as to the legislative intent. The sanctions the director is authorized to impose are an integral part of his function to promote the conservation of marine resources. The powers given to the director point to a legislative purpose to \u201cconserve, improve and increase the supply of fish in the coastal waters,\u201d and to promote and develop the commercial fishing industry. G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 17(3), (4). He is to cooperate with coastal cities and towns for the purpose of increasing the supply of shellfish and exterminating the enemies thereof. G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 20. Lobsters are specially protected (as are scallops) and a permit from the director is required to fish for lobsters or edible crabs. G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 38. For other fish, a permit is required to fish for commercial purposes. G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The director is authorized to adopt rules and regulations \u201cnecessary for the maintenance, preservation and protection of . . . marine fisheries resources,\u201d G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 17(10), as well as to issue rules and regulations \u201crelative to the form, contents, and use of all permits issued under this chapter\u201d (with certain exceptions). G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 80.\u00ae He is given the power to revoke permits for violation of his regulations, one of which specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>cally provides that \u201cany permit . . . may be suspended or revoked for . . . violation of any provision of M.G.L. c. 130.\u201d 322 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 7.01(9) (1993).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The administrative power to revoke or suspend licenses is obviously designed to assist the director in conserving the supply of fish and in developing the fishing industry. \u201cThat such authority was conferred upon [the director of an] <em>administrative agencfy] </em>is prima facie evidence that [the Legislature] intended to provide for a civil sanction\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Hudson, supra </em>at 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Silva argues that the proper standard to be used in the second inquiry \u2014 whether the statutory scheme is so punitive as to transform what was intended as a civil penalty into a criminal one \u2014 requires an analysis of the totality of the circumstances with specific emphasis on how the regulatory scheme was <em>applied to him </em>and not on the underlying regulatory goals of G. L. c. 130 and 322 Code Mass. Regs. This approach was explicitly rejected in <em>Hudson, supra </em>at 96, 101-102, disavowing in large part the method of analysis used in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Halper, </em>490 U.S. 435 (1989). Assessing (in accordance with <em>Halper) </em>the actual sanctions imposed to determine whether a particular sanction is \u201cpunitive,\u201d is \u201cill considered\u201d and \u201cunworkable.\u201d <em>Hudson, supra </em>at 101, 102. Rather, the statute must be evaluated on its face to determine whether it is so punitive as to be deemed criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">We now turn to the factors which <em>Hudson </em>considered \u201cuseful guideposts\u201d for determining whether the banking statute involved in that case was so punitive as to render it criminal. See note 7, <em>supra. </em>We quote, paraphrase, and adapt the <em>Hudson </em>analysis, <em>supra </em>at 104, to evaluate the sanctions in the statute at hand, c. 130, \u00a7 80. First, the \u201crevocation of a privilege voluntarily granted,\u201d such as the suspension or revocation of a license or permit, \u201cis characteristically free of the punitive criminal element.\u201d <em>Hudson, supra. </em>See <em>Luk </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>421 Mass, at 423; <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>426 Mass, at 539. \u201cSecond, the sanctions imposed do not involve an \u2018affirmative disability or restraint,\u2019 as that term is normally understood.\u201d <em>Hudson, su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number><em>pra. </em>While Silva is prohibited from fishing for lobsters for a period and may not transfer his permit, this is \u201ccertainly nothing approaching the infamous punishment of imprisonment.\u201d Third, the sanction does not come into play \u201conly on a finding of scienter.\u201d That the conduct for which sanctions are imposed may also be criminal is insufficient to render the sanction criminally punitive. Finally, even though the suspension of the permit \u201cwill deter others from emulating [Silva\u2019s] conduct, a traditional goal of criminal punishment[,] ... the mere presence of this purpose is insufficient to render a sanction criminal, as deterrence may serve civil as well as criminal goals.\u201d The sanction \u201cat issue here, while intended to deter future wrongdoing, also serve[s] to promote\u201d the conservation of marine resources in a rational and direct manner. \u201cTo hold that the mere presence of a deterrent purpose renders such sanctions \u2018criminal\u2019 for double jeopardy purposes would severely undermine\u201d the State\u2019s ability to engage in effective regulation of lobsters and other marine resources. <em>Hudson, supra </em>at 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">In sum, there is little showing, let alone the \u201cclearest proof that we require,\u201d <em>Hudson, supra </em>at 104, 105, that the suspension of Silva\u2019s license and the prohibition against transfer are punitive. The double jeopardy clause is not implicated.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Silva also argues that he was punished more severely than if he had been found guilty of the criminal offense because c. 130, \u00a7 2, provides for a license suspension of one month for the first violation of a law or regulation relating to marine fish and fisheries. That \u201cthe consequence for the subject of the proceeding may be as, or more severe, than some criminal sanctions\u201d is not determinative. <em>Hill, petitioner, </em>422 Mass. 147, 152, cert, denied, 519 U.S. 867 (1996). <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>426 Mass, at 539-540 (administrative suspension of driver\u2019s license had potential of lasting longer than suspension under criminal statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">2. <em>Inadequate notice. </em>Silva points to the fact that the order to show cause, see note 6, <em>supra, </em>did not notify him that the divi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>sion intended to raise conservation concerns at his revocation hearing. Without such notice, Silva claims, he was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to prepare and present evidence. Silva misconstrues the object of the hearing. While the legislative purpose to protect the lobster population was what gave the division the authority under the statute to conduct the hearing, the issue before the hearing officer was whether Silva\u2019s license should be revoked or suspended in view of the allegations that he had violated G. L. c. 130, \u00a7 41. Of that issue he had notice. Whether his actions impeded conservation was a matter irrelevant to the inquiry.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We note that Silva would have been able, but chose not, to introduce evidence that he came within the exception of c. 130, \u00a7 41, of immediately returning the lobsters to the water from which they were taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Since there was here no violation of the prohibition against double jeopardy, and since Silva received adequate notice of the administrative hearing, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b642-15\">In relevant part, G.
