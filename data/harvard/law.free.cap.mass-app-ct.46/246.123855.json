The question she raises on appeal is whether the evidence was sufficient to satisfy a rational trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt that she did not act in reasonable self-defense of herself or her property. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>426 Mass. 617, 620 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-14\">At a bench trial in the District Court on a charge of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, the defendant timely moved for a required finding of not guilty. Mass.R.Crim.P. 25(a), 378 Mass. 896 (1979). She neglected to move again for a required finding at the close of all of the evidence. We nevertheless address her claim because a verdict based on legally insufficient evidence is \u201cinherently serious enough to create a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGovern, </em>397 Mass. 863, 867-868 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>426 Mass. 617, 620-621 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">We briefly recite the pertinent facts, presenting them, as we must, in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilton, </em>398 Mass. 63, 64-65 (1986). The defendant\u2019s delinquent account drew the attention of Keith Danderante, Jr., an account manager at Rent-A-Vision, a leasing company located in Ware. Furniture, appliances, and electronic equipment are the company\u2019s staples. On March 6, 1997, he was dispatched to repossess merchandise for which the defendant\u2019s payments had lapsed. On that occasion there was no trouble and some items were taken back without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">On the following day, March 7, Danderante returned to the defendant\u2019s residence with a coworker, Jeff LaFleur, to complete the task of repossession. They drove a company van which had a Rent-A-Vision logo painted on it. In the defendant\u2019s driveway they met the defendant\u2019s teenage daughter and asked whether her mother was at home. She went inside saying, \u201cHold on, I\u2019ll be right back. I\u2019m going to get my mother.\u201d The two men found their way into the home and waited inside the front room of the house. After a brief delay, the defendant appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Argument about their visit, no doubt aggravated by a demand that the defendant pay the arrears or lose the household goods, burst into violence. The defendant asked them to leave. When they hesitated, the defendant repeated her request in no uncertain terms. The defendant began shouting and grabbed an instrument, described by Danderante as a \u201cfire poker.\u201d A startled LaFleur started to leave but within seconds the defendant struck him on the right thigh. He fended off a second blow aimed at his head. At this point, necessity and company policy required retreat. Both of them fled to a nearby convenience store to call the police for pacification. There was evidence that LaFleur went to the hospital and was treated for contusions to the leg and forearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">For her part, the defendant largely confirmed the Commonwealth\u2019s version of the facts \u2014 with one key exception. She testified that after she had asked the men to leave, LaFleur became abusive, shoving her as she attempted to prevent him from moving further inside her house. The defendant stated that LaFleur\u2019s manner and actions had put her in fear for her safety, and that she had attacked LaFleur with the fireplace tool in self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>defense and in defense of her property. Other pertinent facts are incorporated into our analysis as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">As we have stated, at trial the defendant relied on the affirmative defenses of self-defense and defense of property. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hakkila, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 129, 130 (1997). Where there is credible evidence to raise these defenses, the burden is on the Commonwealth to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted with force that was excessive in kind or degree. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>148 Mass. 529, 531, 532 (1889); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stokes, </em>374 Mass. 583, 591-593 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fluker, </em>377 Mass. 123, 127 (1979). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>427 Mass. 100, 102 (1998). The defendant argues that both defenses were fairly raised when she introduced her own version of the events in evidence and that the government\u2019s case was legally insufficient to prove that her conduct was not excused under either defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">In determining whether a defendant\u2019s otherwise unlawful use of nondeadly force may be justified as a valid exercise of self-defense, the fact finder must consider whether (1) the defendant has a reasonable concern for her safety, (2) the defendant pursued all possible alternatives to combat, and (3) the force used was no greater than required in the circumstances. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bastarache, </em>382 Mass. 86, 104-105 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>428 Mass. 393, 395 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pichardo, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 296, 301-302 (1998). Where deadly force<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is involved \u2014 it becomes a question for the fact finder whether the defendant\u2019s use of the fireplace tool constituted deadly or nondeadly force, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cataldo, </em>423 Mass. 318, 322-323 (1996); cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>380 Mass. 296, 304 (1980) \u2014 the second two prongs of the test are the same, but a defendant must show that she had a reasonable fear that she was \u201cin imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm, and that no other means will suffice to prevent such harm.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cataldo, supra </em>at 321. As for defense of property (at least in the sense intended here of ejecting trespassers),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the relevant inquiry is whether (1) the defendant used only nondeadly force, and (2) the force used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>was \u201cappropriate in kind and suitable in degree, to accomplish the purpose.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>57 Mass. 154, 158 (1849). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hakkila, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. at 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In applying these standards for the justification of self-defense and, in turn, use of force, no mandatory presumption arises from the fact that a defendant has met her threshold burden. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fluker, </em>377 Mass, at 127. Meeting the initial burden merely provides a permissible basis for an inference that the defense in question applies, and the judge is required to so charge the jury. The fact finder, however, ultimately remains free to disbelieve (or credit) any evidence offered by either party relating to the availability of such defenses in a particular case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Here, there was conflicting testimony as to whether LaFleur used force against the defendant or threatened her in any manner. Likewise, there was evidence that the defendant continued to strike at LaFleur even after he had begun to retreat. Finally, even assuming that the defendant was entitled to use force, it was an open question whether her decision to employ a wrought iron fireplace tool constituted, in the circumstances, the minimum necessary force to accomplish her purpose or whether her use of that weapon constituted deadly or nondeadly force.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">As we review the evidence brought out at trial, the judge may have found that the defendant\u2019s actual belief that the situation required the use of deadly force was simply not objectively warranted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Even if plausible, one must pause to ask whether the amount of force used was excessive. The right to use deadly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>force, such as swinging a fireplace poker at someone\u2019s head, arises at a somewhat higher level of danger than the right to use one\u2019s fists in self-defense. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baseler, </em>419 Mass. 500, 502 (1995), and cases cited. Finally, with respect to defense of property, the judge may have concluded that the use of deadly force was a miscalculation on the defendant\u2019s part. A person may use no more force than reasonably necessary to remove a trespasser.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">As stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fluker, </em>377 Mass, at 128, \u201c[t]here is no constitutional principle which bars the conviction of a defendant when there is evidence warranting [guilt] and also evidence warranting, but not requiring, a finding that the defendant acted in self-defense.\u201d In view of the existence of the various competing permissible inferences here, the judge properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b282-7\"> \u201cDeadly force\u201d is defined as force intended to cause death or serious bodily injury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cataldo, </em>423 Mass. 318, 322-323 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b282-8\">The concept of defense of property has been little explicated in the Commonwealth\u2019s case law. It relates to the right to use limited force to defend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>personal property from theft or destruction and real property from unwelcome invasion. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>148 Mass. 529, 531 (1889), the court held that \u201ca man may defend or regain his momentarily interrupted possession by the use of reasonable force, short of wounding or the employment of a dangerous weapon.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b283-10\">Nothing in what we have said here conflicts with our recent opinion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keita, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 550, 554-556 (1998). In that case, we did nothing to alter the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof where an affirmative defense is raised. In <em>Keita, </em>we simply held that the Commonwealth had failed to adduce sufficient evidence on all of the elements of the crime charged \u2014 including proof of sanity \u2014 to meet the traditional requirements of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b283-11\">With respect to the issue of self-defense, the defendant arguably relied at trial on evidence of so-called \u201cbattered women\u2019s syndrome,\u201d as that term is used in connection with G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 23F. Despite suggestions to the contrary in the defendant\u2019s appellate brief, the fact that the defendant may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>have been the victim of domestic abuse in the past does not provide a blanket justification for her to use force in resolving disputes. To the extent that such evidence was relevant at all to the issue of self-defense here, it was but one of many factors for the fact finder to consider in determining the reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
