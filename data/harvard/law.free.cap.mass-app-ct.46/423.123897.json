L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A, and possession of marijuana, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34. On appeal, he challenges his conviction on the cocaine distribution charge by arguing that the trial judge erred by excluding evidence relating to the defendant\u2019s state of mind and by giving a \u201cmissing witness\u201d instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-14\">We summarize the trial testimony. On the evening of August 20, 1996, Boston police Sergeant Detective Kevin Buckley was on undercover patrol near the Boston Common on the lookout for illegal drug activity. At some point he approached a man, later identified as Adrian Thompson, and attempted to purchase a twenty dollar package of cocaine. After a brief conversation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Thompson agreed to supply Buckley with the drugs and told Buckley that he had to \u201cget the drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">As Buckley watched, Thompson walked down the street and approached the defendant, who was standing nearby, apparently walking his dog. The two men talked briefly and then looked over at Buckley. Shortly thereafter, the defendant moved his hand toward Thompson\u2019s hand. From a distance of thirty yards, Buckley could not say whether anything had been transferred but, based on his training and experience, Buckley testified that what he had observed was consistent with \u201ca passing of drugs.\u201d Thompson then walked back toward Buckley.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Thompson produced a glassine bag containing rock cocaine. Buckley handed him a marked twenty dollar bill and took the drugs. Thompson then walked back to where the defendant was standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Buckley left the area and radioed a description of Thompson and the defendant. Approximately ten minutes later the two men were arrested. The marked twenty dollar bill was found in one of the defendant\u2019s pockets. In addition, a small bag of marijuana was seized from the defendant. The defendant was not found to be in possession of any cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">The defendant testified that he was walking his dog when he encountered Thompson, a man he had known for a long time. The defendant asked Thompson to lend him some money, but Thompson said he did not have any money at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">Defense counsel then asked the defendant, \u201cWhat happened after that?\u201d The defendant responded, \u201cI said okay. He says well if you\u2019re going to be around later, I can give it to you then. But right now . . . .\u2019\u2019At that point, the prosecutor objected to the testimony and moved to strike. The judge sustained the objection, and she struck Thompson\u2019s statement which she summarized as, \u201cI can\u2019t give it to you now, if you\u2019re going to be around later, I can give it to you then.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">Without objecting to the judge\u2019s ruling, defendant\u2019s counsel continued with the questioning. The defendant testified that he remained in the area, playing with his dog. Presently, according to the defendant, an officer rode up on a bicycle and asked everyone to leave the area, and the defendant walked away. Soon, he saw Thompson again; he was walking toward the defendant. At this point the judge, sua sponte, directed the defendant \u201cnot to testify to anything that this other person told you.\u201d Again, the defendant\u2019s counsel, without objecting to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>judge\u2019s ruling, proceeded with his questions, instructing his client to describe what happened next \u201cwithout saying anything that Mr. Thompson said to you. ...\u201d The defendant testified that there was more conversation and that Thompson handed him a twenty dollar bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Defendant\u2019s counsel then asked the defendant, \u201c[W]as it your intention to keep the twenty-dollar bill?\u201d The defendant answered, \u201cNo, my intention was to change it, and . . . .\u201d The prosecutor objected; the judge sustained the objection and struck the answer. The revised question was pressed, and the judge called for a sidebar conference. The defendant insisted that he could testify to his own state of mind. There was an extended colloquy, and finally agreement was reached that the defendant could be asked if he knew where Thompson got the money he gave to the defendant. Counsel did so; the defendant testified he did not know.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>The dispositive question in this appeal is whether Thompson might be regarded as the defendant\u2019s \u201cmissing witness\u201d so as to justify an unfavorable comment by the prosecutor in her summation, coupled with a \u201cmissing witness\u201d instruction from the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">The classic statement on this subject, which we set out in the margin, appears in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schatvet, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 130, 134 (1986).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>413 Mass. 193, 199 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lo, </em>428 Mass. 45, 50 n.8 (1998). At page 135 of <em>Schatvet </em>we added a distinguishing point of particular importance: \u201cCircumspection in this matter is especially called for where the inference would run against a defendant in a criminal prosecution, for the inference may come uncomfortably close to invading constitutional rights.\u201d We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>referred to the privilege against self-incrimination, the right to decline to testify without unfavorable inference, and the Commonwealth\u2019s burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 135 n.10.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Some of the reasons for caution<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were described in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>366 Mass. 284 (1974). \u201cAn inference which is unfairly urged or drawn may be decisive in the case. The failure to produce a witness may not necessarily be inconsistent with innocence of the defendant. A witness may be withheld because of his prior criminal record, or because he is susceptible to cross-examination on collateral issues, or for other tactical reasons. For the same reasons it may be tactically unwise for the defendant to offer explanation to the jury of the reasons for his failure to produce the witness. . . . All of these considerations may assume added importance where the comment of the prosecutor in argument is followed by a charge by the judge which permits the inference . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 294-295.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Adherence to these precautions is reflected in the frequency of cases in which the \u201cmissing witnesses\u201d are persons who are quite close to the defendant, easily satisfying the familiar, and critical, availability requirement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Finnerty, </em>148 Mass. 162 (1889) (children and tenants of the defendant); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>212 Mass. 438, 452-453 (1912) (defendant\u2019s wife); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bryer, </em>398 Mass. 9 (1986) (defendant\u2019s roommate); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olszewski, </em>416 Mass. 707, 723 (1993), cert, denied, 513 U.S. 835 (1994) (sister and father of the defendant); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Happnie, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>3 Mass. App. Ct. 193 (1975) (wife of the defendant); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 570, 581-582, <em>S.C., </em>418 Mass. <em>777 </em>(1994) (cousin of the defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Against this background, we turn to the relevant events in this case. On cross-examination, the prosecutor elicited from the defendant that the defendant had known Thompson a long time, that Thompson was a good friend of the defendant\u2019s family whom the family had known for a long time, that Thompson did not live near the defendant, that the defendant and Thompson did not get together from time to time, and the defendant does not see Thompson, and that the meeting with Thompson on the evening in question was happenstance. Following the defendant\u2019s testimony that Thompson did not live near him, the prosecutor asked, \u201cOh you don\u2019t know where he [Thompson] lives?\u201d The defendant answered, \u201cNot exactly.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The prosecutor left it at that.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">At the charge conference, the judge engaged in a detailed conversation with counsel. Counsel for the defendant argued that the defendant testified that \u201che hadn\u2019t seen Mr. Thompson lately and he didn\u2019t know where he is now,\u201d and that Thompson \u201cwas involved in a drug deal and . . . therefore is not available to this defendant.\u201d Thompson, counsel argued, was the foundation of the government\u2019s case against the defendant, and giving the instruction against the defendant, but not against the Commonwealth, would deprive the defendant of a fair trial. The defendant objected \u201cstrenuously\u201d to the proposed instruction favoring the Commonwealth. The prosecutor responded, \u201cIt\u2019s only because the defendant took the stand and told this story that the big question arises, why isn\u2019t Adrian Thompson here?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">The judge, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bryer, </em>398 Mass. 9, 12 (1986),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> concluded that, because the defendant testified and had told a story the key to which was Adrian Thompson and because Thompson was well known to the defendant and his family, \u201c[i]t\u2019s fair game to the Commonwealth to argue about that.\u201d The judge saved the defendant\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>In her summation, the prosecutor asked the jury to consider the question, \u201c[Wjhere is Adrian Thompson?\u201d, following which the judge charged the jury and included a missing witness instruction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">We decide the question of the sufficiency of the foundation for this instruction \u2014 just as the judge was required to do, and implicitly did do \u2014 as matter of law. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schatvet, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. at 135. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sena, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 463, 467 (1990). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 76, 81 (1993). \u201c[I]f the circumstances [in the case,] considered by ordinary logic and experience, suggest a plausible reason for nonproduction of the witness, the jury should not be advised of the inference. ...\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lo, </em>428 Mass, at 51, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>411 Mass. 279, 282-283 (1991). 2 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 290, at 216 (Chadboum rev. ed. 1976).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Regarding the availability of Thompson to the defendant \u2014 the question that is basic to any inquiry involving the inference, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>366 Mass, at 293 \u2014 the starting point, as we said recently in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Luna, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 90 (1998), is the \u201cprosecution\u2019s undertaking to show that it was likely such a person . . . would be available to the defendant if the defendant pursued him or her in good faith and with due diligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 95. Here, the prosecution undertook its task by cross-examination of the defendant. The prosecutor succeeded in establishing that Adrian Thompson was a long-time friend of the family, that the defendant did not see Thompson with any regularity, and that he did not know \u201cexactly\u201d where Thompson lived. Such was the showing made by the Commonwealth that it offers in support of the prosecutor\u2019s comment to the jury and the judge\u2019s instruction regarding the available unfavorable inference because of the nonproduction of Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The prosecution, however, had previously established, during the direct examination of Buckley, that Thompson had been arrested at the same time the defendant was arrested. The record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>is silent as to the outcome of the arrest, and whether Thompson remained in the custody of the Commonwealth; this material information was in the possession of the Commonwealth. Since the record establishes only that Thompson was arrested, it was more likely than not that he remained in the control of the Commonwealth or that Thompson was available to the Commonwealth. If the defendant was <em>not </em>innocent, as the Commonwealth claims, Thompson\u2019s inculpatory testimony<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> would rebut the only defense that the defendant had \u2014 that his transaction with Thompson was a loan, not a drug deal. Thus it may have been more appropriate for the missing witness instruction to have been given against the Commonwealth, or, failing that, that no instruction be given. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lo, </em>428 Mass, at 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Furthermore, during the colloquy with the judge, the defendant\u2019s counsel emphasized that Thompson was the person who was involved in selling drugs to Buckley. While the argument might have been made with greater particularity, counsel was directing the judge\u2019s attention to the likelihood that Thompson had a criminal record, making him singularly vulnerable on cross-examination. If Thompson\u2019s appearance had been compelled, there was the real possibility that (if not yet tried, convicted, and sentenced) he would refuse to testify on the basis of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, or that he would use the occasion to plea bargain with the prosecutor in return for testimony <em>against </em>the defendant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is entirely plausible, then, to assume that the defendant was innocent, and yet for rational, tactical reasons, he chose not to seek the appearance of Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The mere fact that the defendant testified does not in any respect diminish the plausibility, on this record, of his reasoned explanation for the nonproduction of Thompson, nor does it increase the likelihood that the nonappearance of Thompson was because the defendant \u201cwilfully attempted to withhold or</p>\n<p id=\"A4I\">conceal significant evidence . . . .\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lo, supra </em>at 51, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>411 Mass. 279, 282 (1991). This is not a \u201cclear case[],\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schatvet, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. at 134, contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 76 (1993), and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Commonwealth\u2019s attempt to justify the judge\u2019s instruction was inadequate as matter of law. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>429 Mass. 146 (1999) (where, in his opening statement, defendant\u2019s counsel told the jury that they would hear a named witness testify that the defendant was at home at the time of the murder, but the defendant failed to call that person as a witness, and where the named person was present at or outside the court house on at least two days of the trial, and where the absence of the named person was not explained by any other circumstance, held, that missing witness instruction given by the judge was not error).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Because one of the argued evidentiary issues may arise on retrial, we address it briefly here. The defendant contends that the judge erroneously sustained the prosecutor\u2019s motion to strike the defendant\u2019s testimony that Thompson said he could give the defendant the loan if the defendant would be around later on. This is so, argues the defendant, because Thompson\u2019s statement provided the reason for the defendant to wait for Thompson and to speak to him again. The evidence should have been admitted because it was obvious that its purpose was to show the defendant\u2019s state of mind. See McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 -249, at 103 (4th ed. 1992) (out-of-court statements \u201cwill frequently have an impermissible hearsay aspect as well as the permissible nonhearsay aspect\u201d); 6 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1789, at 314 (Chadboum rev. ed. 1976) (\u201cWherever an utterance is offered to evidence the <em>state of mind </em>which ensued <em>in another person </em>in consequence of the utterance, it is obvious that no assertive or testimonial use is sought to be made of it, and the utterance is therefore admissible, so far as the hearsay rule is concerned\u201d [emphases original]). On any retrial, in the event that the basis for the admissibility of this evidence is not clear to the trial judge, it will be incumbent on defendant\u2019s counsel to articulate the reason for its admission; this was not done here.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Because it was prejudicial error to permit the prosecutor\u2019s comments and to give the missing witness instruction, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schatvet, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. at 136, and cases cited, the judgment on the cocaine distribution charge must be reversed, and the verdict on that count must be set aside. The judgment on the charge of possession of marijuana is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b459-8\"> \u201cWhere a party has knowledge of a person who can be located and brought forward, who is friendly to, or at least not hostilely disposed toward, the party, and who can be expected to give testimony of distinct importance to the case, the party would naturally offer that person as a witness. If, then, without explanation, he does not do so, the jury may, if they think reasonable in the circumstances, infer that that person, had he been called, would have given testimony unfavorable to the party. . . . Because the inference, when it is made, can have a seriously adverse effect on the noncalling party \u2014 suggesting, as it does, that the party has wilfully attempted to withhold or conceal significant evidence \u2014\u25a0 it should be invited <em>only in clear cases, and with caution.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)
