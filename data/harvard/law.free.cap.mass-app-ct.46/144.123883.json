L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A), and possession of a firearm (G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10[a]).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">On appeal, the defendant alleges that the trial judge improperly (1) denied an individual voir dire on racial bias; (2) admitted evidence at trial that had not been timely disclosed to the defendant; (3) denied defense counsel\u2019s request for a mistrial based on the prosecutor\u2019s improper and bad faith cross-examination; (4) denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss based on the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to comply with a District Court\u2019s discovery orders; (5) denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress identifications; and (6) denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. The defendant also argues that the trial judge should have at a minimum granted him an evidentiary hearing on his motion for a new trial. Finally, the defendant argues that the combination of errors so unfairly prejudiced his jury trial that reversal of his convictions is required. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cancel, </em>394 Mass. 567, 576 (1985). For reasons set out below, we conclude that the defendant is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The facts in short summary are as follows. On December 31, 1993, an assailant shot and wounded Timothy Taddia outside of a restaurant and market in Somerville. According to witnesses, a group of young white women had been in the area buying take-out Chinese food when they were approached and allegedly harassed by a group consisting predominantly of young black males. One of the women telephoned her boyfriend, Taddia, and asked him to come and escort them home. When Taddia and his friends arrived at the scene, a fight ensued. In the course of that confrontation, one of the young men about whom the women had initially complained fired several shots into the air and then shot Taddia in the leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">We mention only such other facts as are relevant to the analysis of the legal issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">1. <em>Individual voir dire on the basis of racial bias. </em>The judge denied the defendant\u2019s request for an individual voir dire on racial bias, concluding that there was no substantial risk that the jurors would be affected by an extraneous issue. Pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cthe judge must examine the jurors individually when it appears that issues extraneous to the case might affect the jury\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grice, </em>410 Mass. 586, 588 (1991), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hobbs, </em>385 Mass. 863, 873 (1982). When the extraneous issue is racial prejudice, \u201csome limitations [have been placed] on a judge\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grice, supra. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 355 (1994). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 775, 779 n.6 (1975). \u201cThis is especially true where the crime charged is one of interracial violence and the defendant has moved to have such an inquiry made.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Core, </em>370 Mass. 369, 376 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\u201c[A]ppellate decisions have consistently encouraged trial judges to respond generously to motions that they question jurors individually about possible [racial] prejudice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 362, 364 (1991), and cases cited. In refusing to conduct an individual voir dire we think the trial judge abused her discretion provided under G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28, because there was a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d that the jurors would be affected by an \u201cextraneous issue.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grice, </em>410 Mass, at 588-589. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 923, 924 (1978) (Brown, J., concurring). On this record there is ample basis \u201cto suspect that a juror or jurors . . . [might] not be indifferent within the meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>372 Mass. 783, 793 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">It is generally understood that there are three types of crimes which present a substantial risk that extraneous issues will affect the impartiality of the jury so that the judge must conduct an individual voir dire of prospective jurors. Those crimes are interracial rape, interracial murder, and sexual offenses against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>children where the defendant and the child victim are from different races.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cActs of sex and violence between members of different races were placed in the \u2018requiring individual voir dires\u2019 category in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stephens, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. [461,] 465 [(1983)].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The defendant presses two points to show that the case involves racial issues and that the judge should have conducted an individual voir dire to avoid substantial bias. First, the defendant argues that numerous potential jurors who were called to sidebar during impanelment indicated that race would be an issue in this case. For example, one woman at sidebar told the judge, \u201cI live in Somerville, and I don\u2019t want scum like that walking around in the streets.\u201d Another told the judge at sidebar, \u201cI have a daughter who . . . last year was accosted by a black person . . . somebody looking very much like that in Porter Square, and I don\u2019t feel very objective.\u201d The defendant argues that these reactions to the judge\u2019s questions demonstrate that the defendant could have been a target of racial prejudice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Second, the defendant asserts that the jury heard testimony demonstrating that racial prejudice was an issue in this trial. There was percipient witness testimony describing the defendant as a member of a group of five to seven black men. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. at 365. For example, the victim testified that \u201cthere were some black kids, some white kids in there. . . . [One of the group] was Hispanic.\u201d One witness testified, \u201cI remember a white male with gray hair in there. I remember maybe five to seven black men in there and then us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">As discussed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. at 366, the trial judge has no way of knowing how the trial will play out, but it is advisable to conduct an individual voir dire when asked to do so. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 676, 681 (1993) (Brown, J., concurring), <em>S.C., </em>417 Mass. 348 (1994). In <em>Ramos, </em>we determined that \u201c[a] gang at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>tack by members of one racial group against members of another race is redolent with racial antagonism. . . . [I]t surely is an occasion to inquire of jurors whether racial feelings would affect the way they listened to and deliberated upon the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">In the case at bar the trial was not racially neutral and the \u201cseepage of racial prejudice into the jury\u201d was unavoidable and inevitable. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. at 366. Moreover, unlike <em>Ramos, </em>where \u201cthe racial composition of the defendant\u2019s group\u201d was unknown, <em>id. </em>at 365, here it was known<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>; not only was it apparent, it was highlighted.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The defendant was convicted of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. Although the crime did not involve either murder or rape, it did involve potential interracial murder and sexual overtones (the victim, who was white, was shot in the leg by a black man; and the jurors heard testimony that the group of black males had been \u201cflirting\u201d with and harassing the group of white girls,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> who later called their male friends to come and help them).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See generally Delgado, Rodrigo\u2019s Eighth Chronicle: Black Crime, White Fears \u2014 On the Social Construction of Threat, 80 Va. L. Rev. 503 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">In addition, testimony revealed that one of the black men went over to one of the white girls (there were six in the group) and \u201ckind of jumped right in [her] face and started asking [her] if [she] called him a nigger.\u201d Further, testimony at trial indicated that the first confrontation was with approximately five of the white males, who beat one of the black males<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> at a restaurant. It was after that incident that the confrontation escalated and one of the black males shot the victim in the leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">All of these factors taken together indicate that the jurors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>should have been questioned individually as to whether racial feelings and beliefs would affect their deliberations. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. at 365. As the defense counsel noted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grice, </em>410 Mass, at 588 n.4, questions that inquire of people\u2019s feelings about race are of a very sensitive nature, particularly in the Boston area, and \u201cindividuals are unwilling to bring these kinds of feelings to the attention of the court while they are in the group, in the venire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">2. <em>Motion to suppress. </em>The defendant contends that the motion judge improperly denied his motion to suppress the pretrial photo array and the lineup and in court identifications. See generally Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 10.3 (6th ed. 1994). In considering whether to suppress such evidence, the judge should consider the totality of the circumstances attending the confrontation to determine whether it was unnecessarily suggestive. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Botelho, </em>369 Mass. 860, 865-869 (1976). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>420 Mass. 458, 463-464 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Police investigation of this incident led to the prompt identification of one Donald Mills as having been a member of the group of young black men. A cellular phone belonging to Mills, whose true name was eventually discovered to be Simon Foley, was found at the scene.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The identity of the suspect who discharged the weapon had not yet been ascertained. On January 1, 1994, several mugbooks, each containing approximately sixty to eighty photographs, were shown to the witnesses; two pictures of the defendant were included, but no picture of him was selected. On January 29, 1994, the investigating officer showed an eight-photo array to five of the eyewitnesses. That array included two pictures of LaFaille, one taken in 1992 and another, with a different hairstyle, taken in 1993.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Two of the witnesses picked out the 1992 photograph of LaFaille as closely resembling the shooter. The victim, Taddia, picked out La-Faille\u2019s 1993 photograph as that of the man who had shot him.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The Commonwealth correctly asserts that \u201c [duplication of a defendant\u2019s photograph in one or more arrays [is] not . . . sufficient by itself to compel the suppression of a resulting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>identification.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>417 Mass. 126, 129 (1994), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paszko, </em>391 Mass. 164, 169 (1984). The instant circumstances, however, are distinct from Wallace<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in that here there was only one photo array. Moreover, two of the three witnesses who viewed the array had previously failed to select the defendant\u2019s picture from three to five mug books (which, as mentioned above, contained two pictures of the defendant), although they had at that time selected photographs of Donald Mills (also known as Simon Foley) and Gary Selenxey. In addition, the small photo array, which was not shown to the witnesses until twenty-nine days after the incident, was not viewed in a timely fashion. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>378 Mass. 392, 395-396 (1979) (thirteen photos viewed twenty-one days after the crime). We think in these circumstances the photographic array was impermissibly suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">As this was strictly an identification case, at any retrial the judge should revisit both the subsequent lineup and in-court identifications, giving particular attention to the question (not reached by the motion judge) whether the Commonwealth is able to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the lineup identification had an independent basis in the witnesses\u2019 observations of the defendant at the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">3. <em>Evidence not disclosed to the defendant in timely manner. </em>We think that the defendant was prejudiced by the delayed disclosure of the records of a cellular telephone belonging to Simon Foley.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See and compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>401 Mass. 437, 442 (1988); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Molari, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 941, 942 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caracino, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 787, 793 (1993). In light of our decision to order a new trial we need say nothing further.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> However, we note in passing that the Commonwealth had also been very tardy in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>providing the photo of and the print-out information concerning the man (one Gary Selenxey) that witnesses had identified as being present \u201cat the scene attempting to stop some of his friends from harassing the girls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">4. <em>Improper cross-examination. </em>Consistent with its efforts to tie Foley and the defendant together, the Commonwealth attempted to show that the two men were related. It was improper for the prosecutor repeatedly to ask Paul Riley and Lisa Ann Sivits whether they knew that Donald Mills (Simon Foley)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> was the defendant\u2019s cousin. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, 361 </em>Mass. 280, 285 (1975). The defendant and Foley, in fact, are not cousins. \u201cIt is error for a prosecutor \u2018to communicate impressions by innuendo through questions which are answered in the negative . . . when the questioner has no evidence to support the innuendo.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fordham, </em>417 Mass. 10, 20 (1994). \u201cA prosecutor may not conduct cross-examination \u2018in bad faith or without foundation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The prosecutor did several improper things during cross-examination. First, the prosecutor did not have an expectation of an affirmative answer when he asked Riley and Sivits if Simon Foley was the defendant\u2019s cousin. The prosecutor asked Riley, \u201cYou know that this Donald Mills and the defendant, or Simon Foley, whatever his name is, and the defendant are cousins?\u201d An objection to the question was sustained. The prosecutor then asked, \u201cSo you don\u2019t know about this person and any relationship they had?\u201d The witness responded by saying, \u201cLike I say, I don\u2019t know. As far as like, if you say \u2014 one thing I know is, like, up here, everybody calls themselves cousins, so I wouldn\u2019t know about that because I don\u2019t even know the kid.\u201d The prosecutor later also asked Sivits, \u201cAre you aware that that person is the defendant\u2019s cousin?\u201d Defense counsel\u2019s timely objection again was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">In response to defense counsel\u2019s motion for a mistrial, the judge, at sidebar, admonished the prosecutor, concluding his remarks with the statements: \u201cYou put in no evidence on that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>point. Now, I\u2019m going to deny [the] request [for a mistrial], but I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re on a slippery slope . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The Commonwealth contends that two questions out of a ninety-five-page cross-examination do not amount to such error as could not be cured by the curative instructions that the judge gave. It is not the number of allegedly improper questions that raises concerns about prosecutorial misconduct in this case. See and compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Long, 17 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 707, 708-709 (1984). The problem lies in the innuendo that was communicated to the jury, linking the defendant to Foley (Donald Mills). It is unlikely that this innuendo was ameliorated by the curative instruction. Further, the prosecutor went against the judge\u2019s orders by repeatedly asking the questions at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">5. <em>District Court dismissal. </em>Prior to this trial, the District Court had dismissed the complaints against the defendant because of the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to comply with discovery orders. The defendant claims that this dismissal, which he asserts was with prejudice, bars a subsequent prosecution of him in the Superior Court. Passing over the question whether the defendant\u2019s failure to file an affidavit in the District Court and that court\u2019s failure to hold a hearing and make findings that late disclosure caused such irreparable harm that the defendant could not receive a fair trial preclude a dismissal with prejudice, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>421 Mass. 272, 277-279 (1995), we think the defendant\u2019s contention is answered adversely to him by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zannino, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 73, 76 &amp; n.3 (1983). See <em>Monahan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>414 Mass. 1001, 1002 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">6. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons discussed above, we reverse the judgments and set aside the verdicts. Because the errors also affected the convictions placed on file, we also reverse those convictions.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-9\">The defendant\u2019s convictions of possession of ammunition and discharge of a firearm within 500 feet of a building (G.
