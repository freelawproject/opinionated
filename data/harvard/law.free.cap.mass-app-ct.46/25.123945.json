L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32C, and also a violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>because the former offenses are alleged as having occurred within 100 feet of a public park in Malden. These charges arose from the execution of a search warrant by Malden police in an apartment building located on land abutting Bell Rock Memorial Park. One boundary of the park is alleged to be less than 100 feet from the rear edge of the building. The defendants sought to dismiss the counts under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, asserting that the statute is unconstitutionally vague because it does not sufficiently define \u201cpublic park or playground.\u201d The judge held an evidentiary hearing,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> denied the motions to dismiss, and reported the constitutional question to us pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 34, 378 Mass. 905 (1979).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\u201cAs generally stated, the void-for-vagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>Kolender </em>v. <em>Lawson, </em>461 U.S. 352, 357 (1983). The defendants essentially contend \u201cthat the statute contains no standards and thus, . . . does not provide sufficient notice to satisfy due process requirements.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohmer, </em>374 Mass. 368, 371 n.6 (1978).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he question is whether the statute, or, more closely, the particular words objected to, identify for citizens and law enforcement authorities a core of condemned conduct.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Love, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 541, 545 (1988), and cases cited.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Initially, we reject the defendants\u2019 argument, made without benefit of citation to authority or legislative history, that the statute, notwithstanding its use of the disjunctive between the words \u201cpark\u201d and \u201cplayground,\u201d should be read conjunctively to mean parks which contain playgrounds for children. \u201cThe word \u2018or\u2019 is given a disjunctive meaning unless the context and the main purpose of all the words demand otherwise.\u201d <em>Nuclear Metals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Low-Level Radioactive Waste Mgmt. Bd., </em>421 Mass. 196, 212 (1995), quoting from <em>Eastern Mass. St. Ry. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>350 Mass. 340, 343 (1966). See generally 1A Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 21.14 (5th ed. 1992 &amp; Supp. 1998). See also G. L. c. 45, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 14, distinguishing between parks and playgrounds. Here, the use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d unambiguously serves to distinguish places in or near which an offense may be committed under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">\u201cThe void for vagueness -doctrine requires that criminal statutes be defined in terms that are sufficiently clear to permit a person of average intelligence to comprehend what conduct is prohibited .... The use of general terms in a statute will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>make it constitutionally inadequate.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spano, </em>414 Mass. 178, 180 (1993) (citations omitted). We look to whether the word \u201cpark\u201d would permit a person of average intelligence to know what the statute proscribes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the absence of a statutory definition of \u201cpark,\u201d we first look to the usual and accepted meaning of that word. We derive such meaning \u201cfrom sources presumably known to the statute\u2019s enactors, such as their use in other legal contexts and dictionary definitions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zone Book, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 366, 369 (1977). See 2A Sutherland Statutory Construction, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 46.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Dictionary definitions of the word \u201cpark\u201d include the following: \u201c[A] tract of land maintained by a city or town as a place of beauty or of public recreation.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Inti. Dictionary 1642 (1993 ed.). \u201c[A]n area of land set aside for public use, as: . . . a piece of land with few or no buildings within ... a town, maintained for recreational and ornamental purposes. ... A landscaped city square.\u201d The American Heritage Dictionary 1316 (3d ed. 1992). \u201c[A]n inclosed pleasure-ground in . . . a city, set apart for the recreation of the public.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1116 (6th ed. 1990). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>207 Wis. 2d 413 (Ct. App. 1996) (applying recognized dictionary definition for word \u201cpark\u201d not defined in statute enhancing penalty for drug trafficking).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">We next look to the definitions and meanings given to \u201cpark\u201d in other legal contexts such as case law and statutes. \u201c[T]he term \u2018park\u2019 usually signifies an open or inclosed tract of land set apart for the recreation and enjoyment of the public; or, \u2018in the general acceptance of the term, a public park is said to be a tract of land, great or small, dedicated and maintained for the purposes of pleasure, exercise, amusement, or ornament; a place to which the public at large may resort to for recreation, air, and light.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 271, 278 (1992), quoting from <em>Salem </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>344 Mass. 626, 630 (1962). Also, G. L. c. 45, \u00a7 1, as inserted by St. 1967, c. 790, \u00a7 1, defines park as including \u201ca city or town common dedicated to the use of the public.\u201d Viewing the word \u201cpark\u201d in the context of one of the apparent purposes of \u00a7 32J, that of discouraging distribution of illegal drugs near children, see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>413 Mass. 243, 250 (1992), the invitation to public recreation inherent in these common definitions .of \u201cpark\u201d suggests the likelihood of the presence of children. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1987 Mercury Cougar Auto., </em>413 Mass. 534, 537-538 (1992) (interpretations of statutory language must remain faithful to the purpose of the statute). In sum, notwithstanding that there may be no precise definition of \u201cpark,\u201d see <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Lynn, supra, </em>its use in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, does not result in vagueness because the statute sets forth a \u201ccomprehensible normative standard so that [persons] of common intelligence will know its meaning.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, </em>373 Mass. 577, 580 (1977), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Orlando, </em>371 Mass. 732, 734 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">We conclude that the word \u201cpark\u201d as used in \u00a7 32J is \u201csufficiently clear to permit a person of average intelligence to comprehend what conduct is [made criminal],\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spano, </em>414 Mass, at 180, without guesswork or speculation. Moreover, we perceive no vagueness such as would likely lead to arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, supra. </em>See also <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>378 Mass. 822, 826-827 (1979). Treating the reported question as raising the issue of the correctness of the judge\u2019s rulings on the motions to dismiss, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>415 Mass. 402, 403 (1993), we affirm the denials of these motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b59-16\">The statute provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny person who violates the provisions of section thirty-two, thirty-two A, thirty-two B, thirty-two C, thirty-two D, thirty-two E, thirty-two F or thirty-two I while in or on, or within one thousand feet of the real property comprising a public or private elementary, vocational, or secondary school whether or not in session, <em>or within one hundred feet of a public park or playground </em>shall be punished . . . .\u201d The italicized language was inserted by St. 1993, c. 335.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The judge\u2019s special findings of facts, made after the hearing, are not relevant to our determination whether the statute is unconstitutionally vague. We summarize them to provide a factual background. The judge describes Bell Rock Memorial Park as being seventy to eighty yards in width (and there was unchallenged testimony that its approximate length is 100 yards). It abuts three public ways, and has park benches, grassy areas, a Civil War monument, and a flag pole. In addition to its purpose \u201cfor people to pay homage to the heroes for whom it is dedicated,\u201d it also \u201cis used by the public for walking, sitting on the benches and grass, enjoying open space and playing non-organized games.\u201d It is maintained by the public works and recreation departments of the city of Malden.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Rule 34 provides that, prior to trial, where \u201ca question of law arises which the trial judge determines is so important or doubtful as to require the decision of the Appeals Court, the judge may report the case so far as necessary to present the question of law arising therein.\u201d A parenthetical heading of rule 34 and the reporter\u2019s notes state that the rule is applicable to the Superior Court and to District Court jury sessions. Our record does not indicate whether the defendants have elected a jury trial. In any event, District Court judges sitting in nonjury sessions were given the power to report questions of law to the Appeals Court by St. 1992, c. 379, \u00a7 139, amending G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 26A, and effective for cases commenced after January 1, 1994. See St. 1993, c. 12, \u00a7 9. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>420 Mass. 142, 145-146 &amp; n.3 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b60-8\">The vagueness asserted in this case does not implicate the overbreadth doctrine because G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, is not the kind of statute that \u201cappears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>to trench on First Amendment (or similar) rights.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Love, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 541, 545 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b61-9\">Because the challenge here is not to the application of the statute, it was unnecessary for the judge in this case to take evidence at a hearing and make special findings describing Bell Rock Memorial Park. \u201c [Appropriate action on the motionfs] [to dismiss] based on the vagueness of the statute as applied depends on the evidence presented at trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kwiatkowski, </em>418 Mass. 543, 545 (1994). \u201cGenerally, a challenge to the constitutionality of a statute <em>as applied </em>should be preserved in a motion for a required finding of not guilty under Mass. R. Crim. P. 25, as amended, 389 Mass. 1107 (1983). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jasmin, </em>396 Mass. 653, 655 (1986) (\u2018a challenge to ... a statute as applied might properly be raised before trial, but it need not be raised until the Commonwealth has presented its evidence showing the circumstances in which the statute would be applied to a defendant\u2019) (emphasis original).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oakes, </em>407 Mass. 92, 94 (1990). Thus, any consideration of the defendants\u2019 conduct in relation to Bell Rock Memorial Park must await trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Love, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. at 545 (\u201c[T]he question is . . . whether this case, as it shaped up, appears to be within the core [of condemned conduct]: the inquiry is contextual\u201d). See generally Smith, Criminal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7\u00a7 6, 2212, &amp; 2213 (2d ed. 1983 &amp; Supp. 1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b62-7\">We are aware of no appellate decision directly interpreting the meaning of public park or playground as these terms are used in \u00a7 32J. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v.- <em>Burke, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 76, 78-79 (1997) (applying dictionary definitions of \u201celementary school,\u201d not otherwise defined in \u00a7 32J).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
