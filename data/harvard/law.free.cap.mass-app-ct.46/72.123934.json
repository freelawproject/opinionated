The plaintiffs have appealed an order of the Superior Court ordering the arbitration to proceed and the entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendants. The availability of that appeal is the central issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-15\">The material facts are not in dispute. The plaintiff Weston Securities Corporation is a member of the NASD. The plaintiffs Biggar and Horowitz are registered principals, and Robbat a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>registered representative, of Weston Securities Corporation. Each plaintiff is signatory to a Uniform Application for Securities Industry Registration or Transfer (U-4 form), under the terms of which each plaintiff agreed to arbitrate all disputes required to be arbitrated under the NASD Code of Arbitration Procedure (NASD code). Section 12(a) of the NASD code requires Weston to arbitrate any \u201cdispute, claim or controversy . . . between a customer and a member and/or associated person arising in connection with the business of such member or in connection with the activities of such associated persons . . . upon the demand of the customer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">In June, 1994, the defendants, claiming to be customers of Weston, each filed- a Uniform Submission Agreement (agreement) for arbitration with the NASD. The agreements bound the defendants to arbitrate all their claims against Weston.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Weston refused to execute the agreements, claiming that the defendants\u2019 claims either were not arbitrable under the NASD code or, to the extent that they fell within the scope of the NASD code, were barred by the six-year rule.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On April 5, 1995, Weston applied to the director of arbitration of NASD (director) to dismiss the defendants\u2019 claim to arbitration. On October 30, 1995, the director ruled that the defendants were public customers of Weston, and therefore had standing to compel arbitration against each of the plaintiffs. The director referred all the defendants\u2019 claims to a panel of arbitrators, other than claims prior to June 16, 1988. Weston brought this action following the director\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">In June, 1996, a judge of the Superior Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from proceeding with arbitration at the NASD, and ordered the parties to submit cross motions for summary judgment. In response to the submissions of the parties, the same judge denied Weston\u2019s motion for summary judgment, allowed the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, and entered an order compelling Weston to proceed with arbitration before the NASD.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Weston filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>notice of appeal from that order. Weston then filed a motion before a single justice of this court to stay arbitration pending appeal, which was denied. Weston\u2019s appeal from the single justice\u2019s denial was consolidated with its appeal from the Superior Court judge\u2019s order compelling arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Weston argues, inter alia, that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16 (1994), which, in cases involving interstate commerce, permits an appeal from an order compelling arbitration,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> preempts the Massachusetts Uniform Arbitration Act, G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 18. Section 18 does not permit such an appeal. See <em>Old Rochester Regional Teacher\u2019s Club </em>v. <em>Old Rochester Regional Sch. Dist., </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 117, 118 (1984) (section 18, by failing to enumerate orders compelling arbitration as occasions for the exercise of the right of appeal, precludes an appeal from such an order); <em>Coughlan Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Rockport, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 994, 995 (1987). Whether the \u00a7 18 denial of an immediate appeal from an order compelling arbitration is preempted by the FAA appears not to have been the subject of any decision by our appellate courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The defendants preliminarily argue that the FAA does not preempt \u00a7 18 because the arbitration agreement in this case does not involve interstate commerce. See <em>Southland Corp. </em>v. <em>Keating, </em>465 U.S. 1, 14-15 (1984) (the \u201cinvolving commerce\u201d requirement is a constitutionally \u201cnecessary qualification\u201d on the FAA\u2019s reach, marking its permissible outer limit); <em>Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. </em>v. <em>Dobson, </em>513 U.S. 265, 277 (1995) (the FAA \u201capplies where there is \u2018a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce\u2019 \u201d). See also <em>Loche </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 296, 301-302 (1988). We need not consider whether the arbitration agreement \u201cinvolves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>interstate commerce,\u201d because we conclude that the FAA, assuming it is applicable, does not preempt \u00a7 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The FAA was designed \u201cto overrule the judiciary\u2019s longstanding refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate.\u201d <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. </em>v. <em>Byrd, </em>470 U.S. 213, 219-220 (1985). To achieve that goal, the FAA created a body of Federal substantive law applicable in State and Federal courts, <em>Southland Corp. </em>v. <em>Keating, </em>465 U.S. at 12; <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>482 U.S. 483, 489 (1987), which enforced \u201cthe duty to honor an agreement to arbitrate.\u201d <em>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hosp. </em>v. <em>Mercury Constr. Corp., </em>460 U.S. 1, 25 n.32 (1983). There resulted a strong Federal policy favoring arbitration, and \u201cany doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration, whether the problem at hand is the construction of the contract language itself or an allegation of waiver, delay, or a like defense to arbitrability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Nevertheless, the FAA does not contain any express preemptive provision, \u201cnor does it reflect a congressional intent to occupy the entire field of arbitration.\u201d <em>Volt Information Sciences, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Jr. Univ., </em>489 U.S. 468, 477 (1989). \u201c[T]he federal courts\u2019 jurisdiction to enforce the Arbitration Act is concurrent with that of the [Sjtate courts.\u201d <em>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hosp. </em>v. <em>Mercury Constr. Corp., </em>460 U.S. at 25. The FAA does preempt State law, however, but only \u201cto the extent that it \u2018stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u2019 <em>Hines </em>v. <em>Davidowitz, </em>312 U.S. 52, 67 (1941).\u201d <em>Volt Information Sciences, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Jr. Univ., </em>489 U.S. at <em>All.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Thus, States may ordinarily establish their own procedural rules for the arbitration process, see <em>Volt Information Sciences, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Jr. Univ., supra </em>at 476 (\u201c[tjhere is no federal policy favoring arbitration under a certain set of procedural rules; the federal policy is simply to ensure the enforceability, according to their terms, of private agreements to arbitrate\u201d); see also <em>Felder </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>487 U.S. 131, 138 (1988) (it is a \u201cgeneral and unassailable proposition . . . that States may establish the rules of procedure governing litigation in their own courts\u201d), but those procedural rules are preempted by the FAA if the effect of the State rule \u201cwould undermine the goals and policies of the FAA.\u201d <em>Volt Information Sciences, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Jr. Univ., supra </em>at 477-478.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">The narrow question on this appeal, then, is whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Massachusetts procedural rule depriving Weston of an immediate appeal from the judge\u2019s order compelling it to arbitrate the defendants\u2019 claims before the NASD undermines the Federal goal of enforcing agreements to arbitrate in State and Federal courts. We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">There is no reason to suppose that the <em>timing </em>of the exercise of the right of appeal from an order compelling arbitration is other than a procedural matter which does not alter the substantive rights of either party \u2014 the right of Weston not to be bound by an illegal award, and the right of the defendants to enforce a binding agreement to arbitrate. Federal decisional authorities under \u00a7 16 of the FAA suggest strongly that this is so. See, e.g., <em>Pacific Reinsurance Mgmt. Corp. </em>v. <em>Ohio Reinsurance Corp., </em>935 F.2d 1019, 1022 (9th Cir. 1991) (section 16 of the FAA, which identifies both the events from which an immediate appeal may be taken and those interlocutory orders which postpone the time for an appeal, merely \u201caddresses remedies and procedures\u201d); <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Stapleton, </em>877 F.2d 1401, 1403 (9th Cir. 1989) (section 16 of the FAA \u201caddresses remedies and procedures\u201d); <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Dominick &amp; Dominick, Inc., </em>872 F.2d 358, 361 (11th Cir. 1989) (\u201c[section 16] does not affect substantive rights; only the timing of appeals is at issue\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">As to the Massachusetts procedural scheme regarding arbitration, it may be said that Weston\u2019s right to challenge the legality of any arbitration award continues to be available and may be asserted in opposition to the application of the defendants to confirm any award in the defendants\u2019 favor, see G. L. c. 251, \u00a7\u00a7 11,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 12,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and 13, and Weston may, under G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 18(a)(3), appeal an order of the Superior Court confirming any unfavorable award of the arbitrator. Weston\u2019s rights being fully preserved, the order compelling arbitration may be seen as being a procedural point which is not in derogation of the Federal goal of enforcing agreements to arbitrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">A persuasive decision directly on point is <em>Marr </em>v. <em>Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., </em>116 Or. App. 517 (1992). There, the investors applied for an order compelling the defendant brokers to arbitrate before the NASD pursuant to the parties\u2019 brokerage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>contract. The order was granted, and the brokers appealed to the Oregon Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal under Oregon law.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The language of the Oregon court, 116 Or. App. at 523-524, is particularly apt. \u201cIt is merely a procedural happenstance that, had the federal trial court entered the order that the state court entered, it would have been a final decision [see note 6, supra] insofar as whether it is appealable. . . . The object that Congress sought to achieve is simply that the aggrieved party have a right to appeal at some time. The brokers will be able to appeal the arbitrability decision when judgment is entered on the arbitration award in the [Sjtate proceeding.\u201d See <em>Berger Farms </em>v. <em>First Interstate Bank of Or., N.A., </em>148 Or. App. 33, 37 (1997), review granted, 327 Or. 192 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">We conclude that the order of the Superior Court compelling arbitration does not \u201cstand[] as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d <em>Volt Information Sciences, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Jr. Univ., supra </em>at 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">For these reasons, the appeal is to be dismissed. However, the parties have extensively briefed whether a judge or an arbitrator determines the arbitrability issue, that is, whether the defendants\u2019 claims against Weston are properly the subject of arbitration before the NASD. Rather than remand the case to the Superior Court without instructions on this issue, leaving open the possibility of another appeal on an issue already addressed by the parties but not decided by this court, we express our views on the issue in the interest of judicial economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">As a preliminary matter, it is important to recognize that the paradigm for arbitration is a clause in a commercial agreement describing the mutual obligations of the parties to arbitrate their disputes under the agreement. It may be assumed, in such a case, that the parties considered and agreed upon the wording of the clause. In that event, the question, who decides the issue of arbitrability, turns on \u201cwhat the parties agreed about <em>that </em>matter\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>First Options of Chicago, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>514 U.S. 938, 943 (1995). The point to be made is that the case before us does <em>not </em>involve a negotiated arbitration clause in a commercial agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">In its U-4 form, Weston unilaterally agreed to arbitrate \u201cany dispute, claim or controversy that may arise between me and ... a customer . . . that is required to be arbitrated\u201d under the NASD code. We noted earlier that \u00a7 12(a) of the NASD code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>requires that \u201c[a]ny dispute, claim, or controversy . . . between a customer and a member and/or associated person arising in connection with the business of such member or in connection with the activities of such associated person shall be arbitrated under this Code . . . <em>upon the demand of the </em>customer\u201d (emphasis added). Section 35 of the NASD code provides that \u201c[t]he arbitrators shall be empowered to interpret and <em>determine the applicability of all provisions under this Code . </em>. .\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The defendants are not parties to any of the foregoing documents requiring Weston to arbitrate; the defendants are merely third party beneficiaries of Weston\u2019s promise to arbitrate \u2014 customers of Weston who have demanded arbitration. See <em>Choate,Hall &amp; Stewart </em>v. <em>SCA Servs., Inc., </em>378 Mass. 535 (1979); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 304 (1981). Thus, our task is to determine the appropriate construction to be put on \u00a7 35 of the NASD code, not to calculate the \u201cmanifestation of mutual assent\u201d of the parties.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 17(1) (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The construction of \u00a7 35 must be undertaken in the context of the manifest purpose of the NASD code \u2014 that the interests of securities dealers are best served by eschewing litigation in favor of arbitration. The importance of this policy is demonstrated by the requirement that membership in the NASD is conditioned upon the applicant\u2019s agreement to be bound by the NASD code, at the demand of a customer, in regard to all disputes with the customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Nevertheless, the Federal courts of appeal, applying Federal law, are divided on the interpretation of \u00a7 35. In our view, the First, Second, and Eighth Circuits have the better of the argument. In <em>FSC Sec. Corp. </em>v. <em>Freel, </em>14 F.3d 1310 (8th Cir. 1994), the court noted that the parties had adopted the entire NASD code, \u201cincluding Section 35,\u201d and held that whether or not the six-year time bar of \u00a7 15 of the NASD code, see note 4, <em>supra, </em>is a \u201csubstantive limitation on what disputes are \u2018eligible for submission\u2019 to the arbitrators,\u201d is for the arbitrators to decide. <em>Id. </em>at 1312. This is because \u00a7 35 <em>\u201cis </em>a \u2018clear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>unmistakable\u2019 expression [emphasis in original] . . . [that] section 35 commits interpretation of all provisions of the NASD [c]ode to the arbitrators.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1312-1313. In <em>PaineWebber Inc. </em>v. <em>Bybyk, </em>81 F.3d 1193 (2d Cir. 1996), the court\u2019s alternative holding was that \u00a7 35 \u201ccommits all issues, including issues of arbitrability and timeliness, to the arbitrators.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1202. In <em>PaineWebber Inc. </em>v. <em>Elahi, </em>87 F.3d 589 (1st Cir. 1996), the court, concluding that the applicability of the NASD code provision for a six-year time bar (\u00a7 15) was an issue for the arbitrator, not the courts, said that the \u00a7 35 provision \u201cempowering the arbitrator to \u2018interpret and determine the applicability of all provisions under this Code,\u2019 strongly undercuts any argument that the parties intended the section 15 time bar to be an arbitrability issue to be decided only by the courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601. Contrast <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>62 F.3d 381, 384 (11th Cir. 1995); <em>Cogswell </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>78 F.3d 474, 478-481 (10th Cir. 1996); <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Flume, </em>139 F.3d 1130, 1134 (7th Cir.), cert, denied, 119 S. Ct. 74 (1998), all relying on the statement in <em>First Options of Chicago, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>514 U.S. at 944, that in construing an agreement to arbitrate \u2014 which is undertaken by applying \u201cordinary state-law principles that govern the formation of contracts\u201d \u2014 the claim that the parties agreed to arbitrate the issue of arbitrability must be shown by \u201c \u2018clea[r] and unmistakable]\u2019 evidence that they did so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">As we observed in note 9, <em>supra, First Options </em>construed a bilateral agreement to arbitrate; it did <em>not </em>construe \u2014 or even mention \u2014 \u00a7 35 of the NASD code. For that reason, we decline to follow the Federal cases that rely on <em>First Options </em>in construing \u00a7 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The text of \u00a7 35 points directly in favor of the arbitrator deciding arbitrability in the first instance. That section empowers the arbitrators to \u201cinterpret <em>and </em>determine the applicability of all provisions under this Code. . .\u201d (emphasis added). \u201cApplicability\u201d has to do with \u201cthe quality or state of being applicable.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l. Dictionary 105 (1993). Thus, the arbitrator is empowered to determine whether the NASD code \u2014 the arbitral process \u2014 is applicable to the facts before him. Under the NASD code it is the arbitrator \u2014 not the court \u2014 who first determines whether the code can be applied to the claims asserted.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Finally there remains an issue of waiver raised in Weston\u2019s reply brief. There, Weston argues that on June 16, 1997, Weston served its brief upon the defendants, and that subsequent to that date (i.e., on or about August 5, 1997), the defendants filed an amended complaint against Weston in the Norfolk Superior Court setting forth, for the first time, the same claims as appear in the NASD arbitration proceedings.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On November 19, 1997, Weston filed its reply brief arguing, inter alia, that the defendants had waived their right to proceed with their claim to NASD arbitration. The defendants responded by moving to strike that portion of Weston\u2019s brief dealing with the alleged waiver. See <em>Assessors of Boston </em>v. <em>Ogden Suffolk Downs, Inc., </em>398 Mass. 604, 608 n.3 (1986) (\u201cAny issue raised for the first time in an appellant\u2019s reply brief comes too late, and we do not consider it\u201d). Since the defendants\u2019 amended complaint was filed <em>after </em>Weston filed its original brief, the defendants\u2019 motion to strike must be denied. Such are the bare bones of the waiver controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">A party may waive the right to arbitrate an arbitrable issue. See <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Norwood, </em>395 Mass. 159, 162 (1985); <em>Home Gas Corp. of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Walter\u2019s of Hadley, Inc., </em>403 Mass. 772, 775 (1989). Under both Federal and Massachusetts law, \u201c[t]he essential question is whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the defaulting party acted \u2018inconsistently\u2019 with the arbitration right.\u201d <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Norwood, </em>395 Mass, at 162, quoting from <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Heinold Sec., </em>661 F.2d 638, 641 (7th Cir. 1981) (Federal law). <em>Home Gas Corp. of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Walter\u2019s of Hadley, Inc., </em>403 Mass, at 775 (Massachusetts law).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Under Massachusetts law \u2014 that is to say, in cases where interstate commerce is not involved \u2014 the issue of waiver is ordinarily for the court to determine, not the arbitrator. See <em>Home Gas Corp. of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Walter\u2019s of Hadley, Inc., supra </em>at <em>11 A. </em>Certainly this is so where the party demanding arbitration has previously litigated his case, lost, and then demanded arbritation. <em>Id. </em>at 778.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>In the case before us, where we continue to consider the case, as the plaintiffs argue, on the basis that this controversy involves interstate commerce, it is the applicable Federal law which determines whether arbitration has been waived. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Norwood, </em>395 Mass, at 162.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hosp. </em>v. <em>Mercury Constr. Corp., </em>460 U.S. at 24-25, states the Federal rule: \u201cThe Arbitration Act establishes that, as a matter of federal law, any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration, whether the language at hand is the construction of contract language itself <em>or an allegation of waiver, delay, or a tike defense to </em>arbitrability.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">This is not a case in which the defendants have actively litigated and only later demanded arbitration. Here, the defendants have been pursuing their arbitration claim since June, 1994, and their action was not filed until three years after their demand for arbitration. Recently, a Federal court, distinguishing cases in which the party demanding arbitration had actively participated in litigation prior to the demand, made it clear that \u201cordinarily a defense of waiver ... is a matter to be decided by the arbitrator.\u201d See <em>S &amp; R Co. of Kingston </em>v. <em>Latona Trucking, Inc., </em>159 F.3d 80, 82-83 (2d Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Our conclusion that the waiver issue should be determined by the arbitrator is reinforced by \u00a7 35 which, as we have seen, empowers the arbitrator to decide whether the NASD code is applicable to the facts before him \u2014 the core issue of arbitrability \u2014 and \u00a7 35 assigns initial responsibilty for that determination to the arbitrator. This was the commitment of Weston, accepted by its customers.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the order compelling arbitration is dismissed.
