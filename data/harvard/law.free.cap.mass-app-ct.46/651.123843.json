L. c. 152, \u00a7 35, is to be treated as earnings or as a fringe benefit. The administrative judge concluded, on undisputed facts, that the employee\u2019s vacation pay counts as wages, to be included in the calculation of the amount of his compensation benefits for the weeks in dispute. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-13\">1. <em>The undisputed facts. </em>About two weeks after he was injured in the summer of 1993, Stephen T. Bradley (employee) returned to work at the Commonwealth Gas Company (employer) in a light duty position. Because his pay in this post-injury position was less than what he previously had earned as a serviceman, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>he received partial incapacity benefits from the employer\u2019s licensed self-insurer, Commonwealth Energy Systems (insurer).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">In July, 1994, Bradley took the vacation he was allowed under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement between the employer and its employees. According to those terms, employees are entitled to receive two weeks\u2019 vacation, with pay, \u201cprovided their continuous regular employment preceded January 1st of the current vacation year.\u201d Employees with longer continuous service were entitled to longer vacation periods, and, in July, 1994, Bradley, who had worked for the employer for over twenty years, took three weeks of vacation. As provided in the bargaining agreement, a week\u2019s vacation pay was to be computed on the basis of the employee\u2019s \u201cprior year W-2 earnings divided by the number of pay periods in the year,\u201d with certain adjustments for holidays, sick leave, and union activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">2. <em>The disputed method of computation. </em>Partial incapacity compensation benefits are determined in accordance with the terms of \u00a7 35, which, as amended by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 63, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-7\">\u201cWhile the incapacity for work resulting from the injury is partial, during each week of incapacity the insurer shall pay the injured employee a weekly compensation equal to sixty percent of the difference between his or her <em>average weekly wage before the injury </em>and the weekly wage he or she is <em>capable of earning after the injury, </em>but not more than seventy-five percent of what such employee would receive if he or she were eligible for total incapacity benefits under section thirty-four. An insurer may reduce the amount paid to an employee under this section to the amount at which the employee\u2019s combined weekly earnings and benefits are equal to two times the average weekly wage in the commonwealth at the time of such reduction.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">As here relevant, the meaning of \u201caverage weekly wage,\u201d defined in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(1), as amended by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 13, is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ani\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>\u201cExcept as provided by sections twenty-six and twenty-seven of chapter one hundred forty-nine, such fringe benefits as health insurance plans, pensions, day care, or education and training programs provided by employers shall not be included in employee earnings for the purpose of calculating average weekly wages under this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>\u201c[T]he earnings of the injured employee during the period of twelve calendar months immediately preceding the date of injury, divided by fifty-two ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>The parties have stipulated that, for the three weeks in issue, \u201ctwo times the average weekly wage in the commonwealth\u201d (\u00a7 35) was $1,131.88, and that Bradley\u2019s pre-injury average weekly wage (\u00a7 1[1]) was $1,469. In calculating the amount of \u00a7 35 benefits due Bradley for each of those weeks, the self-insurer treated his vacation pay as his actual earnings for that week, applied the statutory cap (\u201ctwo times the average weekly wage in the commonwealth\u201d) and reduced the amount of his benefits accordingly.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bradley protested, claiming that his vacation pay was a fringe benefit of his employment, like health insurance, and should not have been included in the calculation of his \u00a7 35 benefits. The administrative judge concluded that, because the \u201camount of vacation pay received, be it higher or lower than what the employee earns for nearby weeks actually worked, is the employed\u2019s wage earned for that week,\u201d the self-insurer\u2019s computation of benefits due was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>Section 35 benefits are intended to compensate an employee for a loss of earning capacity caused by a work-related injury. See <em>Federico\u2019s Case, </em>283 Mass. 430, 432 (1933); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept, of Industrial Accs., </em>415 Mass. 218, 222 (1993). Prior to 1985, the Legislature had not specified the method for computing the average weekly wage an employee was capable of earning after sustaining a work-related injury, and much was left to the department\u2019s specialized knowledge and technical competence. See <em>Sjoberg\u2019s Case, </em>394 Mass. 458, 460 (1985), construing \u00a7 35, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 978, \u00a7 6. However, \u00a7 35 must now be read with \u00a7 35D(1), as added by St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 45, which provides, as here relevant, that the post-injury weekly wage the employee is capable of earning is the \u201cactual earnings of the employee during each week.\u201d Put another way, the weekly amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>Bradley\u2019s \u00a7 35 benefits was determined on the basis of the difference between his weekly post-injury actual earnings and his pre-injury average weekly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Bradley reads the term \u201cearnings\u201d expansively in one instance (\u00a7 1[1]) and narrowly in others (\u00a7\u00a7 35, 35D[1]), in order to increase the amount of the difference between his preinjury average weekly wage and his actual post-injury weekly earnings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Borofsky\u2019s Case, </em>411 Mass. 379, 380 (1991). It is, however, an established rule of statutory interpretation that \u201cthe same words in different parts of a statute enacted at the same time, barring some contrary indication in the statute, should receive the same meaning.\u201d <em>Green </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Provincetown, </em>404 Mass. 571, 573 (1989), and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">In <em>Borofsky\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 380, the employee argued that, for purposes of determining his average weekly wage, the value of his employer-paid health insurance benefits constituted earnings. Citing <em>Powers\u2019s Case, </em>275 Mass. 515, 518-520 (1931), the court concluded that because the value of health insurance benefits did not \u201cbear a close analogy to wages\u201d it was not to be considered in determining the average weekly wage and left the matter to the Legislature to address the issue. The Legislature responded with St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 13, which expressly excludes the value of health insurance benefits from the calculation of an employee\u2019s average weekly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">No mention of vacation pay is made in St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 13. However, and as earlier noted, <em>Borofsky\u2019s Case, supra, </em>makes clear that the crucial test for determining whether vacation pay falls within the meaning of \u201cearnings\u201d is whether the pay received by Bradley from his employer while on vacation \u201cbear[s] a close analogy to wages.\u201d See <em>Gunderson\u2019s Case, </em>423 Mass. 642, 644 (1996); <em>Louis\u2019s Case, </em>424 Mass. 136, 140 (1997). Based upon that analysis, tips, commissions, room and board, and partial disability payments have been included in determinations of an employee\u2019s average weekly wage. See <em>Powers\u2019s Case, </em>275 Mass. at 520; <em>Perkins\u2019s Case, </em>278 Mass. 294, 301-302 (1932); <em>Louis\u2019s Case, </em>424 Mass. at 140; <em>Palomba\u2019s Case, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 881, 881 (1980). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Org. of State Engrs. &amp; Scientists, </em>423 Mass. 667, 670 (1996) (under G. L. c. 32; \u00a7 28K, vacation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>pay which was keyed to work performed was salary and not benefit).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\"><em>Herbst\u2019s Case, </em>416 Mass. 648, 651 (1993), is closest to the point. In that case the court held that a public school teacher\u2019s paid summer vacation was properly included in the calculation of the teacher\u2019s average weekly wage. In reaching that conclusion the court looked to the formula set out in \u00a7 1(1) for determining an employee\u2019s average weekly wage, as well as the facts that the teacher received his income throughout the year, including the time he was on vacation; he was free to work during his vacation; he was ineligible for unemployment benefits during his vacation; and his health insurance benefits were not terminated during the summer.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">There is textual authority for the proposition that an employer or insurer should not be allowed a credit or reduction in compensation benefits on account of vacation pay. See generally 4 Larson, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7\u00a7 57.41 \u2014 57.46(c) (1998), and cases therein collected. For Massachusetts, see Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 612, at 734-735 (2d ed. 1981); wherein it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-7\">\u201cAn employer may continue to pay wages to an injured employee or make other payments to him during the period of his disability. If these payments are not earned by services rendered during the period of claimed disability but represent payment for past services, a return on investment, fulfillment of a contractual obligation, or a gratuity, the insurer\u2019s obligation to pay compensation is not impaired, and the payments made may not be deducted from the award. There may be a controversy as to whether the payments demonstrate an employee\u2019s capacity to earn wages despite his disability. But to the extent that they are <em>unearned, </em>they are not a credit against compensation payable by the insurer.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">That statement is consistent with what the court, in a different context, subsequently held: \u201cThe date on which wages are <em>paid . </em>. . must be distinguished from the date on which they are earned\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Gunderson\u2019s Case, </em>423 Mass. at 645, quoting from <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>Hannaford Bros., </em>396 A.2d 1007, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>1009 (Me. 1979).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">As we read the applicable terms' of the bargaining agreement in the instant case, Bradley did not receive vacation pay based upon his 1993 W-2 earnings because of past services. Rather he was entitled, under the bargaining agreement, to a three-week vacation at a rate of pay based upon his 1993 earnings because of services performed during the period of his disability. Although the number of vacation days and the rate of pay to which Bradley was entitled were established prior to his injury, we conclude that he <em>earned </em>that pay for work performed subsequent to his injury. Our holding is based upon the circumstances presented and the limited portion of the bargaining agreement before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">In reliance upon the cases cited throughout this opinion as well as the applicable provisions of the bargaining agreement, the very purpose of compensation benefits, see <em>Louis\u2019s Case, </em>424 Mass. at 140, and basic rules of statutory interpretation, see <em>Green </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Provincetown, </em>404 Mass. at 573, we conclude that where, as here, vacation pay is earned during the employee\u2019s period of disability, that pay is properly included in the calculation of the employee\u2019s actual \u201cearnings\u201d within the meaning of that word as used throughout c. 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Because our response to the report of the single justice requires no further action on his part, we need not remand the matter to him for entry of an appropriate direction of further action by the department. The order of the reviewing board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b687-7\">For the first week of Bradley\u2019s vacation, the pay he received from his employer ($1,136.40)\" exceeded the statutory cap by $4.52, and the self-insurer paid no benefits. The second week, the employer paid $1,089, and the self-insurer $42.88. The third week, Bradley received $971.48 from the employer and $160.40 from the self-insurer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b688-8\">Bradley makes no complaint or argument concerning the inclusion of vacation pay in the calculation of his pre-injury average weekly wage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b690-9\">In <em>Gunderson\u2019s Case, supra, </em>the court concluded that, based upon a retroactive pay increase resulting from the settlement of a labor dispute after the occurrence of the employee\u2019s injury, an employee receiving compensation benefits was entitled to a recalculation of his pre-injury average weekly wage.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
