Robert Evans, retired from his teaching position. For thirty-eight years, from September, 1956, through June, 1994, he had taught health and physical education in the Boston public schools (with service also as a coach). In some fourteen of those years, he taught U.S. history and civics in public summer schools at various Boston locations and was separately paid for each term served. Retirement withholdings were made from his ordinary salaries, but there were no such withholdings from his summer school salaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>On August 5, 1994, the plaintiff wrote to the Boston school department asking, in effect, that they bill him for an amount to represent retirement withholdings from his summer school salaries in the consecutive years 1991, 1992, and 1993 ($2,880 each). This request was intended as a predicate for his claim that the amount of his summer salaries should be added to his ordinary salaries to figure in the base for calculating his retirement benefits for the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">On August 30, 1994, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney wrote more formally to the Boston retirement board, offering the amount of the omitted withholdings and presenting the claim that the summer earnings for the three years should be treated as \u201cregular compensation\u201d under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1, and the interpretive regulation, 840 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.03 (1989), thus enhancing the base of the retirement calculations as carried out under c. 32, \u00a7 5(2)(a), noted in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Preparing to answer counsel\u2019s claim, the Boston retirement board had an exchange with the Boston school department (letters of September 15 and 23, 1994). The board wrote, \u201cAs you know, retirement deductions are not withheld from wages paid for this type of service [in summer schools].\u201d The department said the contract between the Boston school committee and the Boston teachers union set the length of the school year (1993-1994) at 183 days, and (referring particularly to the regulation) \u201csummer school positions are not an extension of a teacher\u2019s regular work year.\u201d The department also said that applications for summer school positions are solicited each year by a personnel circular, contingent on funding; selections are made by the director of adult education from the pool of applicants; there is no assurance of future summer employment. The summer workday is from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., and the semester runs thirty-four days. Summer school rates of pay are set out in the contract with the Boston teachers union (a separate schedule).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">On October 13, 1994, the Boston retirement board wrote to the plaintiff\u2019s counsel rejecting his claim. The plaintiff took his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>appeal to the defendant Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB), which referred the matter to the Division of Administrative Law Appeals. An administrative magistrate on January 7, 1996, after hearing, decided against the plaintiff upon findings covering the facts above stated, and CRAB on August 15, 1996, affirmed, adopting the magistrate\u2019s findings as its own and incorporating her decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The plaintiff petitioned for review of the CRAB decision under the State Administrative Procedure Act, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. A judge of the Superior Court rendered judgment affirming the decision. From this judgment the plaintiff took the present appeal. The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>We sum up the case, adding little to the analysis by the retirement board, CRAB (by adoption), and the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Section 1 of G. L. c. 32, as amended through St. 1979, c. 681, reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">\u201c \u2018Regular compensation\u2019 . . . shall mean the salary, wages or other compensation in whatever form, lawfully determined for the individual service of the employee by the employing authority, not including bonus, overtime, severance pay for any and all unused sick leave, early retirement incentives, or any other payments made as a result of giving notice of retirement....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">\u201cIn the case of a teacher employed in a public day school who is a member of the teachers\u2019 retirement system, salary payable under the terms of an annual contract for additional services in such a school and also compensation for services rendered by said teacher in connection with a school lunch program or for services in connection with a program of instruction of physical education and athletic contests as authorized by section forty-seven of chapter seventy-one shall be regarded as regular compensation rather than as bonus or overtime and shall be included in the salary on which deductions are to be paid to the annuity savings fund of the teachers\u2019 retirement system.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">The first portion of text just quoted states a general theme which is particularized in the second portion applicable to teachers in public day schools. \u201c[Sjalary payable under the terms of an annual contract for additional services in such a school . . . shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>be regarded as regular compensation rather than as bonus or overtime\u201d and \u201cshall be included in the salary on which deductions are to be paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">One can argue that summer salary is payable under an \u201cannual\u201d contract for the given year, and the summer services are \u201cadditional\u201d because outside the claimant\u2019s ordinary full-time program. The defendants would think such a reading quite strained. Against the background of teachers\u2019 usual bargained arrangements, the \u201cannual contract\u201d mentioned seems rather to be the year-to-year collective bargaining agreement, and the \u201cadditional services\u201d look to those that could be specified by that agreement for performance in an extension of the normal period, here the 183 days of the ordinary school year. Salary for such \u201cadditional services\u201d is to be \u201cincluded in the salary on which deductions are to be paid.\u201d The fact that there never have been withholdings from summer school earnings suggests that the summer school period has not been regarded as an extension of the normal period, but as a separate period of service, outside the category of \u201cregular compensation.\u201d See note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Entering into the discussion is the regulation of the Division of Public Employee Retirement Administration that applied generally to public employees, 840 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.03.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">\n<em>\u201cRegular Compensation.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">\u201c(1) During any period of active service subsequent to the effective date of this subsection the term \u2018regular compensation\u2019 as defined by M.G.L. c. 32, \u00a7 1, shall include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">(a) the member\u2019s annual rate of compensation as provided in an approved salary schedule ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-10\">\u201c(2) During such period the term \u2018regular compensation\u2019 as so defined shall not include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-11\">(a) Any amounts paid for hours worked beyond the member\u2019s normal work schedule. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">Again it may be suggested that \u201cannual rate\u201d and \u201capproved salary schedule\u201d can apply to the single year engagement for summer work, and that the exclusion of 2(a) does not apply because summer pay is for hours worked on a schedule normal for summer work and not for hours \u201cbeyond.\u201d The defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>would answer that the regulation is centering its attention on the ordinary collective agreement: while this sets the rate for summer work, the summer period is not an extension of the normal school year, it is a separate period \u201cbeyond\u201d it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">On the whole we think the defendants have the better of the argument about the meaning of the statutes and regulation. But the question here on appeal is not a matter of a court\u2019s considered preference unconfined by what the administrators have had to say. In such matters of interpretation the court is admonished by G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7), as amended by St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 3, to give \u201cdue weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency, as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u201d See <em>Massachusetts Org. of State Engrs. &amp; Scientists </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>389 Mass. 920, 924 (1983); <em>United States Jaycees </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>391 Mass. 594, 600 (1984). In the notoriously difficult, sometimes tortuous, field of retirement rights and calculations, there is particular reason for giving deference to the agency\u2019s expertness, see <em>Lisbon </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 257 n.10 (1996), and cases cited, and so the judge below recognized in his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The judge thought the agency decision was consistent with the general view of \u201cregular compensation\u201d expressed in <em>Boston Assn, of Sch. Admrs. &amp; Supervisors </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>383 Mass. 336 (1981). At issue were early retirement incentive payments; the court held they were not to be considered regular compensation under the statutes (perhaps an easier case than ours). The court said: \u201cThe yearly amount of a retirement allowance is by [G. L. c. 32,] \u00a7 5(2)(a) to be based on the \u2018average\u2019 rate of \u2018regular compensation\u2019 over the three years. The expression seems to us to point to recurrent or repeated amounts of compensation not inflated by extraordinary ad hoc payments. This view is confirmed when we go to the definition of \u2018regular compensation\u2019 in \u00a7 1 ... . [T]he whole refers to remuneration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>geared to work or services performed; moreover \u2018regular,\u2019 as it modifies \u2018compensation,\u2019 imports the idea of ordinariness or normality as well as the idea of recurrence .... Taking \u00a7 5(2)(a) together with \u00a7 1 we find a safeguard against the introduction into the computations of adventitious payments to employees which could place untoward, massive, continuing burdens on the retirement systems.\u201d 383 Mass, at 341.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Omitting some qualifiers in the text, \u00a7 <em>5(2)(a), </em>as amended through St. 1961, c. 190, \u00a7 1, states: \u201cThe normal yearly amount of the retirement allowance for any member .' . . who has paid the full amount of regular deductions on the total amount of regular compensation . . . shall ... be based on the average annual rate of regular compensation received by such member during any period of three consecutive years of creditable service for which such rate of compensation was the highest. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The plaintiff complains that the administrative magistrate in the course of her decision referred to 807 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 602(2), a regulation of the Teachers Retirement Board which states expressly that regular compensation shall not include amounts paid for summer work unless the annual contract requires the teacher to work for eleven or twelve months. The magistrate of course understood that regulations of the Teachers Retirement Board did not extend to the Boston Retirement Board; she pointed out that the position of the Boston Board was consistent with that of the Teachers Board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b268-6\">By St. 1979, c. 681, enacted pending the <em>Boston Assn, </em>case but not relied on by the court in reaching its decision, \u201cearly retirement incentives\u201d were expressly excluded from regular compensation, as defined in c. 32, \u00a7 1. These incentives are similarly excluded by 840 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.03(2)(e) (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
