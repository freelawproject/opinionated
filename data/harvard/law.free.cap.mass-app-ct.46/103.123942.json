Opposing counsel rose to ask the judge whether he had heard what the defendant had said. Responding to the judge\u2019s inquiries, the defendant claimed lack of recall but then stated that he told opposing counsel that he now would \u201cget discovery up the ying-yang.\u201d Pressed further, the defendant reluctantly admitted that he had used the word \u201cass.\u201d The judge stated that he considered such conduct to be contemptuous and that he would hold a summary contempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>proceeding after he finished his motion list.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following a hearing conducted about fifteen minutes later, the judge rejected the defendant\u2019s request to be represented by counsel, confirmed his adjudication of contempt, and ordered the defendant to pay $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">On appeal, the defendant acknowledges that he said \u201cif you want discovery, you\u2019re going to get discovery up the ass.\u201d He argues, however, that these words posed no threat to the orderly administration of justice and that nothing he said or did supports the use of summary contempt powers under Mass.R. Crim.P. 43, 378 Mass. 919 (1979).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That rule provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">\u201c(a) Availability of Summary Proceedings. A criminal contempt may be punished summarily when it is determined that such summary punishment is necessary to maintain order in the courtroom and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">\u201c(1) the contemptuous conduct could be seen or heard by the presiding judge and was committed within the actual presence of the court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">\u201c(2) the judgment of contempt is entered upon the occurrence of the contemptuous conduct; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-9\">\u201c(3) the punishment imposed for each contempt does not exceed three months imprisonment or a fine of five hundred dollars.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">\u201cTrial judges have the inherent power to deal with contumacious conduct in the court room in order to preserve the dignity, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>order, and decorum of the proceedings. [Citations omitted.] Such power is not without limitation. Unless the contempt occurs in the presence of the judge and immediate punishment is needed to prevent \u2018demoralization of the court\u2019s authority,\u2019 <em>In re Oliver, </em>333 U.S. 257, 275 (1948), or to enforce \u2018lawful orders essential to prevent a breakdown of the proceedings,\u2019. . . many of the due process safeguards available in criminal proceedings should apply to a contempt proceeding. [Citations omitted.] Summary punishment for direct contempt \u2018is warranted only when essential to the orderly administration of justice.\u2019 <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>[314 Mass. 767,] 784 [(1943)].\u201d <em>Sussman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>374 Mass. 692, 695-696 (1978). \u201cViewed as a whole, [rule 43] provides that \u2018[s]ummary contempt should be used only when the contemptuous behavior constitutes a threat that immediately imperils the administration of justice. Thus, where time is not of the essence, summary contempt proceedings are inappropriate.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corsetti, </em>387 Mass. [1,] 8 [(1982)] (citations omitted).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 179, 182 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">There is no indication in this record that the defendant\u2019s statement to opposing counsel created an immediate peril to the administration of justice or that it directly and materially disrupted the court\u2019s business. Nowhere does the judge state that what he saw or heard at the time he heard the word \u201cass\u201d caused him to conclude that the defendant\u2019s conduct was contemptuous. Only after opposing counsel reacted and the defendant responded to several inquiries did the judge conclude that contumacious conduct had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">We readily agree with the judge that the defendant\u2019s statement was \u201ccrude, unprofessional,\u201d and \u201cvulgar,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but there is no indication from the record or the judge that it threatened or actually thrust the court into disorder or was violative of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>previous warning.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As a general matter, \u201cto maintain order\u201d must be construed narrowly to guard against arbitrary imposition of penalty without due process. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 206, 208 (1996), and cases cited. \u201c[I]n view of the heightened potential for abuse posed by the contempt power,\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>418 U.S. 488, 500 (1974), application of rule 43 must be limited to those egregious cases where \u201cthe necessities of the administration of justice require such summary dealing with obstructions to it.\u201d <em>Offutt </em>v. <em>United States, </em>348 U.S. 11, 14 (1954). See <em>In Re Gustafson, </em>619 F.2d 1354, 1359 (9th Cir. 1980). \u201cThe exercise of the summary power of contempt is \u2018a delicate one and care is needed to avoid arbitrary or oppressive conclusions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sussman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>374 Mass, at 696, quoting from <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 194, 202 (1968). The need for restraint by trial judges in the use of summary contempt powers against attorneys is underscored by the fact that the right of appeal may not seem a satisfactory safeguard to a lawyer who regularly must appear before the judge who invoked those powers against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Faced with courtroom incivility by an attorney that does not require immediate redress to preserve order,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> a judge nevertheless has several options: (1) If the judge deems the conduct contumacious,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> he may initiate or recommend a contempt proceeding under Mass.R.Crim.P. 44, 378 Mass. 920 (1979).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 209 (\u201cwhen [the] element of urgency or immediacy is absent, the lawful procedure, assuming some plausible charge of contempt, is to go under rule 44 and proceed more deliberately, with customary procedural safeguards familiar to ordinary criminal trial\u201d). If the judge wishes to impart the lesson to other attorneys present, he may also announce in open court that he intends to cite the offender for contempt. (2) In addition to, or in lieu of a rule 44 proceeding, \u201ca judge may refer conduct which violates the Code of Professional Responsibility to the Board of Bar Overseers for disciplinary action.\u201d <em>Beit </em>v. <em>Probate &amp; Family Ct. Dept., </em>385 Mass. 854, 861 n.13 (1982).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (3) Also, a judge may deliver a public or private admonition, combined in the judge\u2019s discretion with a warning, cautioning that repetition would be grounds for contempt proceedings. See <em>Sussman </em>v. <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number><em>monwealth, </em>374 Mass, at 697, 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">In the circumstances, the use of summary contempt proceedings was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\n<em>The judgment is reversed and the finding of summary contempt is set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b138-11\">There being no transcript of these events, we rely entirely on the judge\u2019s findings for factual and procedural background. The judge also found that the defendant\u2019s statement was made \u201cin open Court, within the bar enclosure and in front of the bench, and in a tone that could be heard by others attending the motion hearing.\u201d He also stated that the statement could be interpreted as threatening, harassing, and retaliatory discovery, and warned the defendant that he would issue further sanctions if discovery procedures were to be improperly used.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b138-12\">While no rule is cited by the judge, we construe this record as indicating that he generally adhered to rule 43. There is no contention that Mass.R. Crim.P. 44, 378 Mass. 920 (1979), governing \u201c[a]ll criminal contempts not adjudicated pursuant to rule 43,\u201d was followed. See note 9, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b138-13\">The remainder of rule 43 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b138-14\">\u201c(b) Nature of the Proceedings. Before making a judgment of contempt and imposing punishment, the presiding judge shall give the contemnor notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>of the charges and at least a summary opportunity to adduce evidence or argument relevant to guilt or punishment. If the judge then determines that the sentence he would impose may be in excess of three months imprisonment or a fine of five hundred dollars, he shall bind the contemnor over for trial to be held in accordance with rule 44. The judgment of guilt of contempt shall include a recital of those facts upon which the adjudication of guilt is based and shall be signed by the judge and entered on the record. Where the interests of orderly courtroom procedure and substantial justice require, the presiding judge may defer imposition or execution of sentence until after the trial is completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">\u201c(c) Appeal. The contemnor\u2019s only right of appeal shall be to the Appeals Court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b139-9\">We also acknowledge, as Justice Powell observed in his concurring opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>in <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Tulsa, </em>415 U.S. 697, 700 (1974), \u201c[i]t may well be, in view of contemporary standards as to the use of vulgar and even profane language, that this particular petitioner had no reason to believe that this expletive would be offensive or in any way disruptive of proper courtroom decorum. Language likely to offend the sensibility of some listeners is now fairly commonplace in many social gatherings as well as in public performances.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b140-11\">This case does not fall within the ambit of those decisions which caution that \u201cthe trial judge should not exercise the power of summary contempt in the absence of a prior warning as to the conduct which would place the offender in contempt.\u201d <em>Sussman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>374 Mass, at 697.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b140-12\">We distinguish courtroom incivility from failure by an attorney to appear for trial, which may invite the imposition of costs against the attorney after he has been given notice and an opportunity to be heard. In that event, \u201ca judge need not provide the attorney with the full panoply of rights afforded to criminal defendants\u201d as required under.Mass.R.Crim.P. 44. <em>Beit </em>v. <em>Probate &amp; Family Ct.

Rule 3:07, DR 7-106(C), 382 Mass. 787 (1981), which states: \u201cIn appearing in his professional capacity before a tribunal, a lawyer shall not: ... (6) Engage in undignified or discourteous conduct which is degrading to a tribunal.\u201d He also stated that the defendant violated DR 7-102(A), 382 Mass. 785 (1981) (\u201c[i]n his representation of a client, a lawyer shall not: ...
