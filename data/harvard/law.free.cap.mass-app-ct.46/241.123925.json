Porter, as sole trustee of L. A. Realty Trust (trust), and against Mr. Porter and his wife, Helen R. Porter, individually as cobeneficiaries of the trust. The action was brought by the FDIC to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>recover a $2,000,000 deficiency resulting from the bank\u2019s foreclosure sale of a shopping center known as Hyannis Village. Before the foreclosure sale, Hyannis Village was owned by the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The Porters moved for summary judgment on count II of the FDIC\u2019s amended complaint.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That count alleged, among other things, that the Porters, as cobeneficiaries, were personally liable for the deficiency. The Porters claim that prior to making the loan, the bank had agreed that the trust would be the sole obligor under the note if there was a default. The FDIC cross-moved for summary judgment, claiming that, as a matter of law, the Porters, as beneficiaries of a nominee trust, were individually liable for the trust\u2019s obligations. After a hearing, a Superior Court judge issued a memorandum of decision which denied the Porters\u2019 motion for summary judgment and granted the FDIC\u2019s motion as to liability.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The Porters filed a motion for reconsideration which was denied without a hearing. They then filed a second motion for reconsideration and various other motions, including a motion for the FDIC to elect a judgment against either the trust or the individual defendants. The FDIC opposed the motions and filed a motion to strike and for sanctions, which the Porters opposed. The judge denied the Porters\u2019 second motion for reconsideration and allowed the FDIC\u2019s motion to strike, but denied any sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">On appeal, the Porters claim that the judge committed error in allowing the FDIC\u2019s motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> They also argue that the judge erred when he failed to consider, and subsequently struck, Mr. Porter\u2019s supplemental affidavit and the deposition testimony of Peter Conley, a bank loan officer; the testimony allegedly contradicted Conley\u2019s affidavit which the FDIC had submitted in support of its summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">1. <em>The allowance of the FDIC\u2019s summary judgment motion. </em>The basic facts \u2014 although not the material ones \u2014 are not disputed. In June, 1989, Mr. Porter, as trustee of the trust and as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>directed by the beneficiaries, executed and delivered a promissory note (note) to the bank in the amount of $2,999,000. The note was secured by a mortgage and security agreement on Hyannis Village. The note and all of the documents relating to it were signed by Mr. Porter as follows: \u201cRonald A. Porter, as Trustee of L. A. Realty Trust and not individually.\u201d The last three words were added to the signature block in handwriting and underscored.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Conley, who was the senior loan officer and vice-president of the bank, was responsible for negotiating the loan to the trust. During negotiations, Conley asked Mr. Porter to provide the bank with a personal guaranty; Porter refused. The bank then agreed to accept a $120,000 certificate of deposit from Mr. Porter as additional security. Mr. Porter also subordinated a $735,000 mortgage that he personally held on Hyannis Village.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\u2019 In August, 1990, the terms of the original loan were modified and Mr. Porter again signed the modification agreement, \u201cTrustee of L. A. Realty Trust and not individually.\u201d Again, the words \u201cand not individually\u201d were added in handwriting and the word \u201cnot\u201d was underscored. Some time in June, 1991, the trust defaulted on the note. In October, 1991, the bank sent three demand letters for payment to the Porters, one to Mr. Porter as trustee of the trust, one to him individually, and one to Mrs. Porter individually. On March 6, 1992, the bank obtained title to Hyannis Village through foreclosure. The proceeds received by the bank at the foreclosure sale were approximately $2,000,000 short of the principal and the interest then due on the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">In allowing summary judgment in favor of the FDIC, the motion judge found that the trust was a nominee trust and, as such, the Porters were individually liable as beneficiaries. The judge ruled that Mr. Porter\u2019s signing of the documents \u201cas Trustee of L. A. Realty Trust and not individually\u201d arguably limited his liability as trustee, but that it did not limit the liability of the Porters as beneficiaries of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">Our review of the issues raised by the Porters is \u201cconfined to an examination of the materials before the court at the time the rulings were made.\u201d <em>Fidelity Mgmt. &amp; Research Co. </em>v. <em>Ostrander, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 195, 200 (1996), quoting from <em>Cullen Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Property Ins. Underwriting Assn., </em>399 Mass. 886, 889-890 n.9 (1987). See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number><em>Voutour </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>761 F.2d 812, 817 (1st Cir. 1985), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Saugus </em>v. <em>Voutour, </em>474 U.S. 1100 (1986).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">As has been stated, Mr. Porter is the sole trustee of the trust and both he and his wife are the only beneficiaries. \u201cWhen there is a parallel identity of trusteeship and ownership in connection with the holding of title to real estate by trustees, it may be inferred that the trust vehicle is a \u2018nominee trust,\u2019 a common device for holding title to real estate in Massachusetts and one which affords certain tax advantages.\u201d <em>Apahouser Lock &amp; Security Corp. </em>v. <em>Carvelli, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 385, 388 (1988). Here, the parallelism was imperfect because Mr. Porter was trustee for himself and his wife. The declaration of the trust, however, provided for a degree of control by the beneficiaries that is consistent with a nominee trust. We agree with the motion judge and the parties that the trust is a nominee trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\u201cIn the case of nominee trusts, liability has been imposed directly upon the beneficiaries, see <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Lennett, </em>415 Mass. [857], 862 [(1993)], the theory being that the relationship created by such an instrument is in the nature of a partnership and not a trust, see <em>First Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Chartier, </em>305 Mass. 316, 320 (1940), or that the trustees were merely the agents \u2018for the principals\u2019 convenience.\u2019 <em>Apahouser Lock &amp; Sec. Corp. </em>v. <em>Carvelli, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 385, 388 (1988).\u201d <em>Sylvia </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 483, 485-486 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">However, a beneficiary\u2019s liability in a nominee trust may be limited by express language either in the trust agreement itself (where the creditor knew or should have known of the language), see <em>Sylvia </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 485-487, or express language in the note or contract. See <em>First Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Chartier, supra </em>at 322 (beneficiaries in a nominee trust hable in a breach of contract action on the grounds that \u201c[t]he note of the company that [was] held by the [creditor] [did] not express a contract that the holder must look only to the funds or property of the company for its payment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Whether the party entering the contract with the trustee has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>agreed to look only to the trust assets for payment \u201cis a classic question of the parties\u2019 intention. If the contract is unambiguous on the point, it will, absent fraud, govern.\u201d <em>First Eastern Bank, N.A. </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>413 Mass. 654, 662 (1992). <em>Sylvia </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 486 (\u201cthe underlying issue is the intention of the parties\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">What emerges from the conflicting affidavits in the present matter is that Mr. Porter\u2019s insertion and the bank\u2019s acceptance of the words \u201cand not individually\u201d in the loan documents created an ambiguity as to the parties\u2019 intentions about whether the bank would look only to the trust res for payment in case of default. \u201cWhen intent is at the core of a controversy, summary judgment seldom lies.\u201d <em>Madden </em>v. <em>Estin, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 392, 395 (1990). The handwritten and underscored words \u201cand not individually\u201d that were added to the loan documents are powerfully suggestive of a nonrecourse note. See <em>Rand </em>v. <em>Farquhar, </em>226 Mass. 91, 96-98 (1917); <em>Sylvia </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 486-487. It is the formulation often used to declare that a note and other debt instruments are given on a nonrecourse basis. If that were the intent, neither Mr. Porter nor Mrs. Porter is personally liable on the Hyannis Village loan documents. Whether a nonrecourse loan was the intended consequence of the handwritten words of limitation is appropriately a matter for trial rather than summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Therefore, the summary judgment in favor of the FDIC is reversed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b276-9\">Count I was against the trust.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b276-10\">The parties later filed a stipulation that the damages amounted to $2,146,118.98 as of February 9, 1996. The Porters did not admit liability and reserved all rights of appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b276-11\">The Porters did not appeal the judge\u2019s denial of their summary judgment motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b278-9\">Because of our decision in this matter, we do not reach the Porters\u2019 claim that the judge committed error in allowing the FDIC\u2019s motion to strike certain documents, and the judge\u2019s denial of other Porter motions filed after the judge ruled on the summary judgment motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">Because we are limiting our review to the materials before the motion judge, we deny the FDIC\u2019s motion to dismiss the Porters\u2019 appeal because of alleged improper briefs and appendix.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b279-8\">The FDIC argues that if we hold that Mr. Porter is not liable individually, Mrs. Porter, in any event, is liable as a matter of law. The record shows that Mrs. Porter, as a cobeneficiary, joined in directing the trustee, Mr. Porter, to sign the note and accompanying documents. We can find nothing in this record that would support the allowance of summary judgment against her alone.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
