A few minutes later, when one of her cases was called, the defendant, an attorney, was not present. Concluding that some action was necessary \u201cto preserve the integrity of the court,\u201d the judge announced he would deal with her when she returned. Upon her return, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>defendant acknowledged hearing the judge\u2019s order, but explained that she had thought she could leave the court room because she was trying to resolve one of her cases and had left to talk to a client in custody. The judge told her she would be assessed fifty dollars for her conduct. After requesting and being given a day to consider her options, the defendant returned the next day and, claiming she did not intend to be contemptuous, sought a further hearing. Subsequently, represented by counsel, she filed a motion requesting a proceeding under Mass-.R.Crim.P. 44, 378 Mass. 920 (1979). In his written ruling the judge denied the motion, reaffirmed his conclusion that the defendant\u2019s conduct \u201ccomprised a criminal contempt of court [under] Mass.R.Crim.P. 43,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and ordered her to pay the assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\u201cEvery judge \u2018must exercise his inherent powers as necessary to secure the full and effective administration of justice.\u2019 <em>O\u2019Coin\u2019s, Inc. </em>[v. <em>Treasurer of the County of Worcester, </em>362 Mass. 507,] 514 [(1972)].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>418 Mass. 760, 764 (1994). \u201cOf necessity, a judge\u2019s inherent powers must encompass the authority to exercise \u2018physical control over his courtroom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.., </em>quoting from <em>Chief Administrative Justice of the Trial Ct. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>404 Mass. 53, 57 (1989). The judge\u2019s order that counsel remain in the court room reasonably was related to the necessity for ensuring the effective disposition of cases and clearly was a valid exercise of his inherent powers. His reaction to violation of that order by his own account and by the record of this case was to impose a criminal sanction, a result that may be obtained only by adherence to the rules applicable to criminal procedure. Although Mass.R.Crim.P. 43(a), 378 Mass. 919 (1979), states that \u201c[a] criminal contempt may be punished summarily when it is determined that such summary punishment is necessary <em>to maintain order </em>in the courtroom\u201d (emphasis added), we must view the summary contempt power as \u201cconceived narrowly and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>[to be] used with great restraint.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 206, 208 (1996). The defendant\u2019s violation of the judge\u2019s order did not \u201cdirectly and materially disrupt[] the court\u2019s business.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diamond, ante </em>103, 105 (1999). Nor did her tardy return to the court room constitute an obstruction to the administration of justice which required summary action under rule 43.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Offutt </em>v. <em>United States, </em>348 U.S. 11, 14 (1954); <em>Sussman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>374 Mass. 692, 695-696 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Viera, supra </em>at 208.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">We do not imply that an attorney\u2019s absence or tardiness can never be the subject of a contempt action. When confronted with extreme circumstances which the judge believes to be contumacious he or she may initiate or recommend a rule 44 or like proceeding.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Additionally, the judge may report conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>violative of the Rules of Professional Conduct to the Board of Bar Overseers. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diamond, supra </em>at 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Where, as here, the defendant\u2019s conduct was not so disruptive as to warrant a summary contempt punishment but nevertheless interfered with the efficient administration of justice, an assessment of costs may be an effective judicial option in maintaining procedural control of a court room. \u201c \u2018Counsel for litigants, no matter how \u201cimportant\u201d their cases are, cannot themselves decide when they wish to appear or when they will file those papers required in a law suit. Chaos would result. . . . There must be . . . some respect shown to the convenience and rights of other counsel, litigants, and the court itself.\u2019 <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>308 F.2d 15, 18 (9th Cir. 1962). ... If judges lacked power to compel attorneys to appear, \u2018the orderly administration of justice [would] be removed from the control of the trial court and placed in the hands of counsel.\u2019 <em>Link </em>v. <em>Wabash R.R., </em>291 F.2d 542, 547 (7th Cir. 1961), aff\u2019d, 370 U.S. 626 (1962).\u201d <em>Beit </em>v. <em>Probate &amp; Family Ct. Dept., </em>385 Mass. 854, 859 (1982). \u201cAmong a judge\u2019s inherent powers is the authority to make the court\u2019s lawful orders effective. Exercising this power, a judge may impose reasonable court costs on an attorney who . . . delays . . . adjudication . . . and squanders limited judicial resources.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 859-860. Accordingly, a judge may order an attorney to pay court costs for a failure to appear for a scheduled trial. See <em>id. </em>at 860.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It follows that a judge may also assess costs against an attorney for engaging in other forms of conduct that similarly interfere with efficient court room proceedings and are wasteful of judicial resources.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Compare <em>Masiello </em>v. <em>Perini Corp., </em>394 Mass. 842, 850 (1985) (\u201cJudges have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>authority and discretion to discourage [use of disqualification motions as harassment and dilatory tactics] through the imposition of costs\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">An attorney required to pay costs must be given \u201cfair notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>Beit </em>v. <em>Probate &amp; Family Ct Dept, supra </em>at 860. Fair notice may vary in the circumstances, from timely announcements in open court to publication of formal rules or standing orders.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A reasonable opportunity to be heard need not involve a separate or formal hearing, but the record must reflect that the party ordered to pay costs was given an opportunity to contest the assessment. Also, the judge should enter a brief recitation of the reason and financial basis for the assessment. In all such cases, assessment of costs reasonably must relate to the resources wasted or unnecessarily expended as a result of the attorney\u2019s conduct. These costs need not be precisely determined, and may be approximated. Essentially nominal assessments may be treated as presumptively reasonable in amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">While a summary contempt judgment was not warranted in the circumstances, the defendant received fair notice of the judge\u2019s order and an opportunity to be heard as to her reasons for noncompliance. We cannot say that the judge\u2019s rejection of her excuse was an abuse of discretion or that the essentially nominal assessment of fifty dollars was unreasonable in terms of the waste of the court\u2019s time caused by the defendant. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment and set aside the finding of summary criminal contempt. We affirm the order to pay fifty dollars as a reasonable assessment of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-13\">The principal events in the court room are not recorded in the transcript in our record. We rely on the undisputed background facts provided in the judge\u2019s memorandum.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Although the judge\u2019s ruling states a criminal contempt under Mass.R. Crim.P. 43, 378 Mass. 919 (1979), the judge qualified that ruling by adding: \u201c[Rule 43], <em>a fortiori, </em>authorizes the court\u2019s \u2018lesser included\u2019 disposition effected here, the reprimand and assessment.\u201d However, \u201c[i]f the contempt proceeding is criminal even in part, \u2018the criminal feature must be regarded as dominant and fixing the character of the trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Furtado </em>v. <em>Furtado, </em>380 Mass. 137, 142 (1980), quoting from <em>Root </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>260 Mass. 344, 367 (1927). On appeal, the defendant and the Commonwealth treat this case as a rule 43 matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b145-6\">There is no contention that the judge followed Mass.R.Crim.P. 44, 378 Mass. 920 (1979). Because of our decision we also have no occasion to consider whether the judge erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a proceeding under that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The judge made- reference to the defendant\u2019s absence as taking place \u201cin court,\u201d apparently in further support of his conclusion that the defendant should be summarily punished. In view of our conclusion that the defendant\u2019s absence was not disruptive of the order in the court room, we need not consider whether the defendant\u2019s conduct constituted what traditionally has been referred to as a \u201cdirect contempt\u201d justifying summary punishment. Moreover, the failure of an attorney to appear has been said to be analogous to the designation of \u201cindirect- contempt.\u201d See <em>Beit </em>v. <em>Probate &amp; Family Ct. Dept., </em>385 Mass. 854, 861 n.12 (1982). We note that there is disagreement among other jurisdictions as to whether absence from the court room is a contempt committed in the presence of the judge. See generally Annot., Attorney\u2019s Failure to Attend Court, or Tardiness, as Contempt, 13 A.L.R. 4th 122 (1982 &amp; Supp. 1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b145-8\">We do not regard the defendant\u2019s disobeying the judge\u2019s order as a violation of a warning constituting an independent ground supporting a judgment of summary contempt. \u201c[A] trial judge should not exercise the power of summary contempt in the absence of a prior warning as to the conduct which would place the offender in contempt. The nature of such warning is that it must be made clear to the attorney that such conduct is impermissible <em>and </em>that specified sanctions may be imposed for its repetition\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Sussman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>374 Mass, at 697. There is no indication in this record that the order issued by the judge contained a clear warning of a criminal sanction for noncompliance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b145-9\">The Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure apply only to proceedings in the Superior, District, Juvenile, and Boston Municipal Courts. See Mass.R. Crim.P. 1(b), 378 Mass. 842 (1979), and 2(b)(7), 378 Mass. 845 (1979). However, judges of other courts possess similar contempt powers under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>common law and by statute. See <em>Blankenburg </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>260 Mass. 369, 372-373 (1927); G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 25A; G. L. c. 185C, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b146-7\">We are aware that, in some instances, courts have used their inherent powers to dismiss the offending attorney\u2019s case or to order his client to pay costs. The better rule appears to be to \u201csave the action for the client and impose a penalty directly on the attorney.\u201d <em>Beit </em>v. <em>Probate &amp; Family Ct. Dept., supra </em>at 860 n.ll. See Annot., Authority of Trial Judge to Impose Costs or Other Sanctions Against Attorney Who Fails to Appear at, or Proceed With, Scheduled Trial, 29 A.L.R. 4th 160 (1984 &amp; Supp. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">A judge\u2019s inherent powers may also permit an assessment of the opponent\u2019s counsel fees against the offending attorney. See <em>Roadway Express, Inc. </em>v. <em>Piper, </em>447 U.S. 752, 765 (1980), recognizing the inherent power of Federal courts to assess such fees \u201cin narrowly defined circumstances.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b146-9\">For a comprehensive discussion of summary assessment practices in other jurisdictions see Note, Financial Penalties Imposed Directly Against Attorneys <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>in Litigation Without Resort to the Contempt Power, 26 U.C.L.A.
