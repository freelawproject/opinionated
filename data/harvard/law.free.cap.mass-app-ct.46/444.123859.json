L. c. 62C, \u00a7 73(/)(l), as inserted by St. 1983, c. 233, \u00a7 41, of wilfully filing materially incorrect Massachusetts income tax returns for the years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>1987, 1988, and 1990.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The statute provides criminal penalties for a \u201cperson who . . . [w]illfully makes and subscribes any return . . . that is made under the penalties of peijury, and that he does not believe to be true and correct as to every material matter.\u201d Our review of the defendant\u2019s appeal from those tax perjury findings centers on two issues: (1) the sufficiency of the evidence, and (2) the effect of the judge\u2019s allowance of one of the defendant\u2019s requests for rulings. We reverse the findings and remand the case to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">1. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>There is ample evidence that the returns for the years in question were signed by the defendant under the penalties of peijury and that they materially understated his income. The defendant argues, however, that there was insufficient evidence that he acted \u201cwilfully\u201d when he made and signed the returns. This court, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 129, 134 (1998), in defining \u201cwilfully\u201d as contained in our tax evasion statute, G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 73(a), applied the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the cognate Federal income tax provision which construed the word to mean the \u201cvoluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty.\u201d <em>Cheek </em>v. <em>United States, </em>498 U.S. 192, 201 (1991). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>412 U.S. 346, 359-360 (1973); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pomponio, </em>429 U.S. 10, 11 (1976). Given that this definition has \u201ca uniform meaning in the several [Federal tax] statutes,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bishop, supra </em>at 359, and the absence of any contrary indication under our law, we accept it for purposes of the tax perjury statute here involved. Consistent with interpretations of the Federal tax peijury statute, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1) (1994), the Commonwealth is required, in a prosecution under G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 73(/)(l), to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant subscribed to false returns for the years in question \u201cwith the specific intent to violate the law.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hanson, </em>2 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir. 1993).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>monwealth, is as follows: Over the years at issue, the defendant conducted a public relations consulting business in addition to serving as a deputy tax collector for the city of Springfield. In the course of his municipal duties, the defendant collected overdue taxes and a collection fee directly from taxpayers and faithfully followed the reporting process established by the city, providing it with a detailed accounting of his collections. He pursued his private consulting business through a separate office and bank account. Income from both occupations was reported by the defendant in his tax returns on a single line on a Schedule C \u201cProfit and Loss from Business\u201d form.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In exchange for his services, the defendant\u2019s private clients paid him by check and generally, but not invariably, issued a form 1099 reflecting the amount reported to the taxing authorities as having been paid.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On occasion, the amount reported in a form 1099 was less than the amount paid to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">In each of the years in question, the defendant reported consulting income which was greater than the amount reflected in the forms 1099 received by him but less than his actual gross income. The unreported amounts were approximately $55,475 for 1987, $58,900 for 1988, and $21,200 for 1990.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The 1987 discrepancy primarily reflected the difference between the amount reported on a client\u2019s 1099 and the amount actually paid to the defendant, and a lump sum of $50,000 paid by check by a limited partnership which did not issue a form 1099. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>The 1988 discrepancy included a $3,500 difference between income received from a client and the amount reported on that client\u2019s form 1099. Unreported also in that year was the defendant\u2019s one-half share of the proceeds from the sale of real estate in Maine.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The 1990 discrepancy included differences between the amounts received by the defendant and the amounts reflected on forms 1099 of two clients and $15,000 from a Ghent who did not provide the defendant with a form 1099. During the periods in question, the defendant\u2019s returns also accurately reflected receipts from several clients who did not supply the defendant with forms 1099. His unreported income represents approximately twenty-seven percent, twenty-three percent, and ten percent of his gross income in 1987, 1988, and 1990 respectively.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The amount of the defendant\u2019s unreported income, his meticulous record keeping and reporting of his tax collection income, his accurate accounting of monies paid by some clients who did not provide him with forms 1099, and his faithful reporting of all his income from consulting and tax collecting in 1989 and 1991, all support a reasonable inference that the defendant was aware of precisely what was paid to him in each of the years in question. This inference, especially when coupled with the reasonable inference that the defendant was unlikely to have overlooked the receipt of the $50,000 lump sum payment in 1987 (his largest single receipt in that year), of substantial real estate profits in 1988, and of $15,000 from one client in 1990, support the further conclusion that the defendant specifically intended not to report all of his receipts in the years in question and that he signed his tax returns for those years knowing of the underreported income. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty properly was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">2. <em>The defendant\u2019s request for rulings. </em>At the close of the evidence, the defendant filed twenty-six numbered requests for rulings pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 26, 378 Mass. 897 (1979). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Such requests \u201care \u2018intended to secure for the purpose of review a separation of law from fact in cases where the trial judge acts both as factfinder and applier of law.\u2019 Reporters\u2019 Notes to [rule 26].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schafer, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 682, 692 (1992). See generally Smith, Criminal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 1945 (2d ed. 1983). Four days after taking the case under advisement and the day before he entered his verdict, the judge filed his order with respect to each of the defendant\u2019s requests for rulings. At issue is the effect of the judge\u2019s allowance, without comment, of request for ruling number 13 which states: \u201cThe Commonwealth\u2019s evidence failed to prove any common scheme, absence of mistake, intent or motive.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant claims that this ruling entitles him to a reversal of his convictions because it concerns his affirmative defense of mistake, and effectively nullifies the intent required to support a general finding of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The Commonwealth argues that the defendant takes ruling 13 out of context because it pertains solely to its claim of an alleged conflict of interest between the defendant\u2019s municipal and private endeavors and not to the issues of mistake and intent. In support, the Commonwealth notes that ruling 13 appears in the midst of several other rulings sought by the defendant to establish a lack of nexus between any such conflict and the crimes charged. Consequently, it claims that ruling 13 must be construed narrowly in light of the judge\u2019s denial of other of the defendant\u2019s requested rulings to the effect that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient to prove wilful underreporting. We cannot give ruling 13 such a limited construction. A fair reading of the transcript indicates that the judge, before and immediately following closing arguments, ruled that he was removing as an issue in the case any connection between the defendant\u2019s alleged conflict of interest and his underreporting of income. Shortly thereafter, defendant\u2019s counsel announced his waiver of requests for rulings dealing with conflict of interest, starting with those numbered 8 and 9. When the judge suggested his ruling \u201ctakes us through [request] 15,\u201d defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>counsel responded: \u201c[W]ith one exception, your Honor. I think that 13 is different \u2014 a different matter. That\u2019s the standard language of the cases on common scheme, or absence of mistake, intent or motive under the cases.\u201d After defendant\u2019s counsel cited by name three cases purportedly representing the case law to which request for ruling 13 applied, the judge unequivocally acknowledged that ruling 13 was not waived by stating: \u201cAll right, you\u2019re retaining 13.\u201d Given this acknowledgment and the fact that the judge did not explicitly limit his ruling, as he carefully did with several other requests, we consider ruling 13 literally and as stated and not limited to any alleged motive or conflict of interest. We address only the questions relating to \u201cabsence of mistake\u201d and \u201cintent\u201d because they were the only live issues at the time ruling 13 was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The Commonwealth concedes that mistake is an affirmative defense in a tax perjury case. \u201cIt is a complete defense to the crime of filing a false tax return to make a good-faith mistake in the return or to have a good-faith belief that the tax laws have been satisfied.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>20 F.3d 1111, 1115 n.4 (11th Cir. 1994), citing <em>Cheek </em>v. <em>United States, </em>498 U.S. at 202. It argues, however, that the defendant did not \u201cpresent evidence\u201d of mistake or sufficiently raise it as an affirmative defense. While the only evidence introduced by the defendant was in the form of character witnesses who testified to his reputation for truthfulness and veracity, testimony was elicited during cross-examination of witnesses called by the prosecution to the effect that certain clients underreported monies paid to the defendant on 1099 forms prepared by them while others did not supply him with 1099 forms and that the defendant\u2019s reliance on a 1099 from a client could be reasonable. Also, during direct examination of the defendant\u2019s tax preparer, the Commonwealth adduced testimony that the defendant was not \u201cdetailed\u201d in his record keeping and provided him only with \u201ca pack of 1099\u2019s and a yellow sheet of paper . . . that would have the sources of income and the amount.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel, in argument, stressed the defense of good-faith mistaken rebanee on the 1099s received by the defendant, and \u201cconfusion as to the law in Maine.\u201d The prosecutor recognized the issue by arguing \u201c[w]hat is required by the Commonwealth is to show that [unexplained underreporting] was not an inadvertent error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Whether a defense has been fairly raised is a matter of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>for the court. We are informed by the cases dealing with the analogous issue of when sufficient evidence of an affirmative defense has been introduced as to require an instruction that it is the Commonwealth\u2019s burden to disprove it beyond a reasonable doubt. Such a defense may be raised not only through witnesses offered by the defendant but also \u201cmay enter the case during the prosecution\u2019s case in chief, either . . . [by] direct questioning or . . . cross-examination.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kostka, </em>370 Mass. 516, 526-527 &amp; n.7 (1976). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Laliberty, </em>373 Mass. 238, 245 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monico, </em>396 Mass. 793, 798 (1986). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>858 F.2d 809, 814 (1st Cir. 1988) (\u201c[A] defendant may shoulder this burden of production by pointing to evidence adduced during the government\u2019s case ... or ... by reference to any probative material in the record\u201d). Viewed in the light most favorable to the defendant, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>428 Mass. 614, 615 (1999), the evidence of good faith mistake, although it did not address the entire spectrum of the government\u2019s proof, was sufficient to warrant a ruling requiring the Commonwealth to assume the burden of proving absence of mistake.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">When viewed in the context of the judge\u2019s careful and adroit management of the trial, his rejection of rulings stating that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient to prove willful underreporting, and his incredulity, expressed during the trial, that large sums such as the $50,000 from the limited partnership and the proceeds from the sale of Maine real estate mistakenly could have been overlooked, it might appear that ruling 13 is simply an anomaly, or the byproduct of the judge having become ensnared by an ambiguous and misleading request for ruling. See <em>Stella </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>348 Mass. 458, 461 (1965). Such speculation, however, is belied by the judge\u2019s otherwise careful treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>ment of the other requests for rulings. Moreover, if the judge viewed ruling 13 as applying solely to the issue of good faith mistake as it related to some of the smaller amounts of gross receipts not reported by the defendant, he could have expressly limited ruling 13 to those amounts. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Giles, </em>353 Mass. 1, 17 n.12 (1967). \u201cIf that, however, was his intention the judge did not make this clear. The ruling leaves us sufficiently uncertain how the judge instructed himself [on the issue of mistake] to cause us to reverse the judgments].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18. Our uncertainty is only compounded by the inclusion in ruling 13 of the word \u201cintent,\u201d given the necessity of proof by the Commonwealth that the defendant specifically intended to violate the law when he signed the returns for the years in question. While the meaning of the word \u201cintent\u201d in the context of the ruling that \u201c[t]he Commonwealth\u2019s evidence failed to prove any . . . intent . . .\u2019\u2019is not clear, we cannot ignore that its inclusion in the ruling may reflect a conclusion by the judge, based on his weighing of the evidence, that an elemental aspect of tax perjury had not been proved. The findings, therefore, must be set aside. Because, as we previously have indicated, the evidence viewed from the Commonwealth\u2019s perspective was sufficient to convict, we do not order judgment for the defendant but remand the case to the Superior Court for further proceedings.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b479-7\">The defendant was indicted on two other counts.
