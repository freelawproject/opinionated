L. c. 272, \u00a7 17.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was also indicted for indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen, and assault and battery. The charges arose as a result of certain allegations made by his daughter Nora (a pseudonym).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-17\">Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the incest indictments on the ground that the grand jury did not receive sufficient evidence to find probable cause in regard to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>those crimes. In particular, the defendant argued that the term \u201csexual intercourse\u201d appearing in the statute requires the Commonwealth to produce evidence before the grand jury that he had penetrated Nora\u2019s vagina with his penis. Because there was no such evidence, the defendant claimed that the incest indictments should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">A hearing on the motion was held before a Superior Court judge. It was undisputed that Nora had testified before the grand jury that the defendant, who was her father, had fondled her in an inappropriate manner after she was eleven years old, and that after she reached the age of sixteen, the defendant had inserted his finger into her vagina and also had her perform oral sex on him. There was no evidence that the defendant had ever inserted his penis into her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Based on Nora\u2019s testimony, the Commonwealth argued that digital penetration of Nora\u2019s vagina and oral intercourse constituted sexual intercourse under the statute and, therefore, the grand jury had heard \u201creasonably trustworthy information . . . sufficient to warrant a prudent [person] in believing that the defendant had committed or was committing an offense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>385 Mass. 160, 163 (1982), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stevens, 362 </em>Mass. 24, 26 (1972) (other citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">The judge ruled, however, that digital penetration and oral intercourse did not constitute \u201csexual intercourse\u201d as required by the incest statute. Therefore, because there was no evidence before the grand jury that the defendant had inserted his penis into his daughter\u2019s vagina, the judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion and dismissed the incest indictments. The Commonwealth appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">The Legislature never explicitly defined the meaning of the term \u201csexual intercourse\u201d found in the incest statute. Further, Massachusetts case law has not addressed the question of which types of sexual conduct are forbidden by that statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>to ascertain the Legislature\u2019s intention, we turn to G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22 (the rape statute), to determine how the term \u201csexual intercourse,\u201d appearing in that statute, has been defined by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Historically, the crime of rape was defined as the \u201cravishing and carnal knowledge\u201d of a female by force and against her will. See St. 1893, c. 466, \u00a7 1; R. L. 1902, c. 207, \u00a7 22. In 1974, however, the Legislature amended G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22. See St. 1974, c. 474, \u00a7 1. Among other things, the term \u201cravishing and carnal knowledge\u201d was replaced with the term \u201csexual intercourse,\u201d and the crime of rape was amended to include both \u201csexual intercourse or unnatural sexual intercourse.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Legislature did not amend the incest statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, </em>373 Mass. 577 (1977), the court discussed the 1974 amendments to G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22, and other related statutes. The court noted that the Legislature replaced \u201c[t]he archaic terminology of \u2018ravishing\u2019 and \u2018camal knowledge\u2019 ... by the more contemporary \u2018sexual intercourse\u2019. . . [and] [b]y sexual intercourse, the Legislature undoubtedly intended the traditional common law notion of rape, the penetration of the female sex organ by the male sex organ, with or without emission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 584. Further, the court defined the term \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d to include \u201coral and anal intercourse, including fellatio, cunnilingus, and other intrusions of a part of a person\u2019s body or other object into the genital or anal opening of another person\u2019s body.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">The addition by the Legislature of the term \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d to the rape and related statutes is of considerable significance in our analysis. If the Legislature had intended that the term \u201csexual intercourse\u201d in the rape statute was to include such acts as fellatio or digital penetration of the vagina \u2014 acts which the defendant allegedly committed in this matter \u2014 it would have been unnecessary for the Legislature to broaden the scope of rape and similar crimes to include a separate category of acts deemed \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>Further, \u201c[t]he Legislature must be assumed to know the preexisting law and the decisions of [the Supreme Judicial C]ourt.\u201d <em>Gillette Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>425 Mass. 670, 677 (1997), quoting from <em>Selectmen of Topsfield </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>324 Mass. 309, 313 (1949). For decades, the Supreme Judicial Court had defined the term \u201csexual intercourse\u201d to mean the penetration of a woman\u2019s vagina by the male penis. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hussey, </em>157 Mass. 415, 416 (1892); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, supra </em>at 584, and cases cited.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In view of the court\u2019s definition of sexual intercourse in the <em>Gallant </em>decision, coupled with the Legislature\u2019s decision not to amend the incest statute,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we conclude that the term \u201csexual intercourse\u201d in the incest statute encompasses only \u201cthe penetration of the female sex organ by the male sex organ, with or without emission.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">The Commonwealth urges us to follow <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fouse, </em>417 Pa. Super. 534 (1992). The Pennsylvania incest statute prohibited sexual intercourse with an ancestor or descendent. The statute did not define \u201csexual intercourse\u201d and the defendant in <em>Fouse </em>argued that its meaning did not extend to his alleged acts of anal intercourse with his son. The court, however, applied the definition of \u201csexual intercourse\u201d which was contained in a different statute. That definition defined \u201csexual intercourse\u201d to include not only traditional acts of intercourse, but also oral and anal intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>We do not follow <em>Fouse </em>because the language and structure of our statutes mandate a different result. Unlike the Pennsylvania legislative scheme, our statutes explicitly define some sexual offenses such as rape, rape of a child, and statutory rape to include both \u201csexual misconduct\u201d and \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d while defining the crime of incest as merely involving \u201csexual intercourse.\u201d It is that distinction which leads us to the conclusion that the term \u201csexual intercourse\u201d does not encompass the defendant\u2019s alleged acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Finally, the Commonwealth argues that because the defendant\u2019s alleged conduct is so shocking and abhorrent, we should extend the definition of \u201csexual intercourse\u201d to include such conduct. Of course, the defendant\u2019s conduct, if true, is shocking and abhorrent. However, \u201c[t]he scope of the authority of [an appellate] court to interpret and apply statutes is limited by its constitutional role as a judicial, rather than a legislative, body. See art. 30 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.\u201d <em>Pielech </em>v. <em>Massasoit Greyhound, Inc., </em>423 Mass. 534, 539 (1996), cert, denied, 520 U.S. 1131 (1997). We have no right to read into the incest statute \u201ca provision which the Legislature did not see fit to put there . . . .\u201d <em>King </em>v. <em>Viscoloid Co., </em>219 Mass. 420, 425 (1914). To do so would amount to judicial legislation, which is forbidden by art. 30 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. See Justice Qua\u2019s comments in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Isenstadt, </em>318 Mass. 543, 548 (1945). See <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Christmas Tree Shops, Inc., </em>429 Mass. 91, 93 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">In sum, because there was no evidence before the grand jury that the defendant had inserted his penis into his daughter\u2019s vagina, the judge did not commit error in dismissing the incest indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">\n<em>Order allowing motion to dismiss indictments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b856-18\">General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 17, states in relevant part as follows: \u201cPersons within the degrees of consanguinity within which marriages are prohibited or declared by law to be incestuous and void, who intermarry or have sexual intercourse with each other, shall be punished . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b857-9\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Domaingue, </em>397 Mass. 693, 704 n.6 (1986), the court held that there was sufficient evidence to withstand a motion for a required finding of not guilty when, although the victim testified generally about \u201chaving sex\u201d with her father, she also testified that \u201che put his penis into my vagina.\u201d In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Taylor, 319 Mass. 631, 633 (1946), the court held that evidence that the defendant had penetrated his daughter\u2019s vagina with his penis was sufficient to withstand a motion for a required finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>not guilty of the crime of incest.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">However, neither case is helpful in determining whether digital penetration and oral intercourse, by themselves, are sufficient to constitute \u201csexual intercourse\u201d under the incest statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b858-10\">At the same time that the Legislature amended G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22, it also amended G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A (forcible rape of a minor), see St. 1974, c. 474, \u00a7 2, and G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23 (statutory rape), see St. 1974, c. 474, \u00a7 3, to include both \u201csexual intercourse or unnatural intercourse.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b859-6\">The Commonwealth urges us to adopt the definition of \u201csexual intercourse\u201d found in Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 1079 (1983), which states, inter alia, that sexual intercourse \u201cinvolvefs] genital contact between individuals other than penetration of the vagina by the penis.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Inti. Dictionary 2082 (1993), however, gives as its first choice the following definition of \u201csexual intercourse\u201d: \u201cheterosexual intercourse involving penetration of the vagina by the penis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">Dictionary definitions are helpful but not dispositive in statutory interpretation cases, see <em>Oxford </em>v. <em>Oxford Water Co., </em>391 Mass. 581, 587 (1984). Here, however, we have a clear, concise definition of \u201csexual intercourse\u201d by the court in the <em>Gallant </em>decision, and we need not consider dictionary definitions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b859-8\">We do not suggest that the omission of the Legislature to amend the statute was necessarily inadvertent. The Legislature was undoubtedly aware that one of the important reasons for punishing incest is to prevent biological or genetic mutations which might occur in children bom from such conduct. See 42 CJ.S. Incest \u00a7 2(b) (1991). Obviously, a child could not be conceived by digital penetration or oral intercourse. Therefore such sexual conduct would not frustrate one of the purposes of the enactment of the incest statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">Further, the Legislature might have thought that misconduct of the type here would be punished by other criminal statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
