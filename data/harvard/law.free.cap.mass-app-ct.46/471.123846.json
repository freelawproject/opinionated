This incident led to argument, to arrest, and, ultimately, to Zettel\u2019s conviction (by a jury) as a disorderly person under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-15\">Represented by counsel on appeal \u2022 \u2014 \u25a0 she had appeared pro se in the District Court \u2014 the defendant claims there was insuf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>ficient evidence to convict her of the offense and that the judge improperly permitted the jury to consider constitutionally protected speech in determining the defendant\u2019s intent. We agree with the defendant\u2019s first contention and, therefore, need not reach the second claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Based on the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence presented through its sole witness, police officer Robert Deschenes, the jury could have found the following facts. The Wixon Elementary School is located at the comer of Whipple and Hamlet Streets in Fall River. Whipple Street, a one-way street, is extremely congested, particularly around school drop-off and release times. Buses double-park on a portion of the street (where the road is wider), and, during school release times, vehicles tend to double-park, obstructing the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">On January 14, 1997, at school release time, there was a traffic tie up on Whipple Street. Using his siren and hom, Officer Deschenes managed to move to the front of the line of traffic and noticed that two vehicles, double-parked directly behind the buses, were causing the problem. One moved at his command, but the second, driven by the defendant, did not. Despite his informing her that her car was illegally parked and was a safety hazard for the children, she refused to budge, stating that she was picking up her child. After again unsuccessfully trying to persuade her to move, Deschenes gave her a ticket insisting that the car be moved. When the defendant left the car and walked to the schoolyard, Deschenes raised his voice and informed her that the vehicle would be towed. She returned and drove into a private driveway on the opposite side of the street, leaving the nose of the car still in the roadway, obstructing the sidewalk. Once again he told her she would have to move the car or it would be towed. She responded, \u201cYou have nothing better to do. I\u2019m here to pick up my kid.\u201d Because she was \u201cbecoming loud,\u201d \u201chad refused to park the car legally,\u201d and because \u201cit was becoming a pretty serious safety hazard,\u201d Deschenes decided to place the defendant under arrest. She attempted to resist, saying she wasn\u2019t going to be arrested; she was there to get her child and would not leave until she picked up her child. Deschenes straggled with the defendant and handcuffed her. She kicked him, and was taken to the police station and booked. The car was towed, and Deschenes arranged for the school to keep the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">The statute at issue, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, set forth in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>margin,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> renders \u201cidle and disorderly\u201d conduct a punishable criminal offense. As pointed out in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feigenbaum, </em>404 Mass. 471, 473-474 (1989), \u201c[j]udicial construction of the term \u2018idle and disorderly\u2019 has had a tortured history in the case law of this Commonwealth.\u201d In <em>Alegata </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>353 Mass. 287, 302 (1967), the term \u201cidle\u201d was considered neutral; thus, \u201c[t]he gravamen of the offence is necessarily contained in the word \u2018disorderly.\u2019 \u201d The clause withstood constitutional challenge on the ground of vagueness by reference to the behavior \u201csingled out in \u00a7 250.2 of the Model Penal Code (Proposed Official Draft[, 1962]).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304. See Smith, Criminal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 6 (2d ed. 1983 &amp; 1998 Supp.). Subsequently, terming the statute \u201carchaic,\u201d the court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, </em>368 Mass. 580, 587-599 (1975), narrowed the definition of \u201cidle and disorderly\u201d to exclude subsection (b) of \u00a7 250.2 of the Model Penal Code<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2014 \u201cdisorderly\u201d conduct may now only be \u201cvalidly . . . applied to conduct which involves no lawful exercise of a First Amendment right.\u201d As thus construed, and as reiterated in <em>Feigenbaum, </em>404 Mass, at 474, \u201cdisorderly\u201d conduct, in accordance with \u00a7 250.2 of the Model Penal Code,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">\u201cA person is guilty of disorderly conduct if, with purpose to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">\u201c(a) engages in fighting or threatening, or in violent or tumultuous behavior; or . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>\u201c(c) creates a hazardous or physically offensive condition by any act <em>which serves no legitimate purpose of the </em>actor\u201d (emphasis supplied in <em>Feigenbaum).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The Commonwealth argues that the evidence supports both sections of the definition \u2014 the defendant\u2019s actions constituted tumultuous conduct and also created a hazardous condition by acts which served no legitimate purpose of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">1. <em>Tumultuous behavior. </em>Turning to the ordinary dictionary definition, we find that \u201ctumultuous\u201d is defined as \u201c1: marked by tumult: full of commotion and uproar: riotous, stormy, boisterous ... 2: tending or disposed to cause or incite a tumult <em>... 3: </em>marked by violent or overwhelming turbulence or upheaval.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Inti. Dictionary 2462 (1993).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Massachusetts cases are in accord with these definitions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>368 Mass, at 597 (noting that the statute covers \u201c \u2018tumultuous behavior,\u2019 which, while perhaps not physically violent, may nevertheless be characterized as involving riotous commotion and excessively unreasonable noise so as to constitute a public nuisance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Other cases inform. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>369 Mass. 443, 448 (1976), the defendants were held to have engaged in \u201cfighting\u201d and in \u201cviolent or tumultuous behavior.\u201d Due to their actions \u2014 drinking alcohol in a crowded mall, resisting arrest, punching and cursing police \u2014 a crowd of some two hundred people became hostile and abusive and threw \u201cbundles of newspapers, books, and other debris\u201d at the police. <em>Id. </em>at 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carson, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 920, 921 (1980), campus police responding to a complaint of a \u201cdisturbance\u201d found the defendant, a college student, drunk and belligerent. Cursing at the police officers, he attracted a crowd of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>fifty people, some of whom \u201claugh[ed] or yell[ed] abuse at the police.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>His intoxication, belligerence, and his manner of resisting apprehension \u201ccould be fairly characterized as \u2018tumultuous\u2019 \u201d and needlessly exacerbated a situation which \u201cmight have moderated of its own accord.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">In another case, the \u201cdefendant\u2019s actions of removing his hands from the [police] cruiser, flailing them in an agitated and belligerent manner while berating [police] Officer Rivera with loud profanities, and shoving his hands into the pockets of his baggy shorts, especially in light of Officer Rivera\u2019s previous encounter with the defendant on a gun charge, constituted tumultuous or threatening behavior beyond protected expressive speech or conduct.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mulero, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 963, 965 (1995). Such actions, which led a crowd of about thirty persons to gather, provided the police with probable cause to arrest the defendant on a charge of disorderly conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 963-965.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">In the present case, by contrast, the jury were not warranted in finding that the defendant, \u201cwith purpose to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof,\u201d engaged in tumultuous behavior as defined by statute, case law, or lexicon.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">2. <em>Conduct which serves no legitimate purpose. </em>While the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence that the defendant did not heed the officer\u2019s warnings, failed to move her car, and illegally parked in a private driveway, warranted, perhaps, a finding that the defendant created \u201ca hazardous or physically offensive condition,\u201d the Commonwealth offered no evidence to show that the defendant\u2019s action served no legitimate purpose. In <em>Feigenbaum, </em>404 Mass, at 475, the court held that although behavior which was motivated by political purposes could be found to have created a hazardous condition, and might be considered \u201ccriminal under the common law or by some statute,\u201d such behavior \u201cdoes not constitute disorderly conduct under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53,\u201d because it has \u201ca legitimate purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">The Commonwealth would have us confine <em>Feigenbaum </em>and the term \u201cno legitimate purpose\u201d to situations involving political expression. However, neither the opinion nor the Model Penal Code suggests such a limitation. Indeed, another section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>of the Model Penal Code, \u00a7 250.4, defining \u201charassment,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> described in the comment as \u201ca companion offense to disorderly conduct under \u00a7 250.2,\u201d contains the same phrase. Model Penal Code \u00a7 250.4 comment 1, at 360. Commenting on the catchall language of subsection (5) of \u00a7 250.4, which covers \u201cany other course of alarming conduct serving no legitimate purpose of the actor,\u201d the drafters stated, \u201cThe import of the phrase ... is broadly to exclude from this subsection any conduct that directly furthers some legitimate desire or objective of the actor.\u201d Model</p>\n<p id=\"At7\">Penal Code \u00a7 250.4 comment 5, at 368. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wheaton, </em>409 Pa. Super. 622, 628 (1991) (defendant\u2019s efforts to maintain his water supply constituted a legitimate purpose precluding conviction of harassment). See also <em>DiDonna </em>v. <em>DiDonna, </em>72 Misc. 2d 231, 233 (N.Y. Fam. Ct. 1972) (preservation of marriage a legitimate purpose).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">While the comment to \u00a7 250.4 of the Model Penal Code is noteworthy, far more significant is the language of \u00a7 250.2(c), as construed by <em>Feigenbaum. </em>There is no reason provided by that case or other authority to view a political cause as anything other than one of a number of \u201clegitimate purposes\u201d under \u00a7 53. Surely, a mother\u2019s interest in picking up her six and one-half year old son when he was released from school falls within the definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The judgment of conviction for being a disorderly person is reversed, and the verdict is set aside.
