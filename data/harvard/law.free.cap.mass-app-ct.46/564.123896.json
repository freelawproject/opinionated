(Farrell), a holding company,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals from the refusal of the Commissioner of Revenue (commissioner) to abate, in part, its 1991 corporate excise tax that was assessed under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 39, for the year 1991. The single issue on appeal is whether the net operating losses incurred in taxable years <em>prior </em>to 1991 by three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>members of the corporate group consisting of Farrell and its six subsidiaries may be carried forward to offset the income of the group as a whole, where the three members in question reported no taxable Massachusetts income in 1991. Both the commissioner and the Appellate Tax Board (board) determined that Farrell could not apply the unused net operating losses incurred by its three subsidiaries to offset the group\u2019s combined net income.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\"><em>Background. </em>The material facts are not in dispute. Farrell and its subsidiaries have filed Federal consolidated income tax returns and Massachusetts combined excise returns since 1975. For the purpose of apportionment, the parties have stipulated that one hundred per cent of the income of each of the corporations is Massachusetts source income.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Three of Farrell\u2019s subsidiaries, Kelco Metals Servicenter, Inc. (Kelco), McKie Company (McKie) and Morse Diving Equipment Company, Inc. (Morse), had no taxable Massachusetts income for the 1991 tax year. However, each of these subsidiaries had a net operating loss (NOL) carry forward<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that was attributable to the years 1989 and 1990.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">On September 15, 1992, Farrell filed a 1991 Massachusetts combined excise return with the commissioner. On this original return, neither Farrell nor any of its subsidiaries claimed a deduction for any NOL attributable to the losses of Kelco, Mc-Kie, or Morse. The original return stated that the group\u2019s combined income was $420,655. Farrell reported a total excise due in the amount of $39,506.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It also reported interest due on the unpaid balance in the amount of $5,046. No payment was made with this return.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">On February 17, 1993, Farrell filed an amended 1991 Massachusetts combined excise return. On the amended return, Farrell applied the unused NOL of its three subsidiaries to offset the income of the profitable subsidiaries in the combined group. On that basis, Farrell reported that the group\u2019s combined net <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>income now totaled $52,766. Farrell reported a total excise due in the amount of $5,013, and it determined that interest was due on the unpaid balance in the amount of $820. No payment was made with the amended return.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">On May 17, 1993, Farrell filed an application for abatement with the commissioner seeking an abatement of taxes in the amount of $34,949. This amount reflected the difference between the excise reported as due on Farrell\u2019s original return and the excise shown due on its amended return. The commissioner denied the application on October 26, 1993. Farrell appealed the decision to the board. On September 25, 1995, the board affirmed the commissioner\u2019s denial of the abatement. It subsequently issued a written decision on June 25, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\"><em>The controversy. </em>If two or more corporations participate in the filing of a Federal consolidated income tax return,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> those corporations may, under the provisions of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 32B, elect to calculate their Massachusetts corporate excise tax based upon their \u201ccombined net income.\u201d If two or more corporations choose to file a combined return, the excise is assessed to all of the corporations and may be collected from any one or more of them. <em>Ibid. </em>Farrell and its subsidiaries elected to file a Massachusetts combined tax return for the year 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">At issue is the proper calculation of the group\u2019s \u201ccombined net income\u201d for the purpose of assessing the group\u2019s corporate excise tax. The commissioner argues that a NOL carry forward may be deducted only from the income of that group member which generated the carry forward. If the commissioner\u2019s argument is followed, the unused NOL of each of the three unprofitable subsidiaries would not be available to offset the taxable income of Farrell\u2019s three profitable subsidiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">Farrell argues that the income of each of the individual members must be combined prior to the deduction of any NOL carry forward. If Farrell\u2019s argument is followed, the NOL carry forward of each of the three subsidiaries would be available to offset the taxable income of the profitable members of the group. In other words, Farrell\u2019s argument is to treat the group as a single taxable entity, with the tax attributes of each member available to the members as a group.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\"><em>Discussion of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 32B. </em>General Laws c. 63, \u00a7 32B <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>\u2014 the statutory provision which governs this dispute \u2014 was introduced by St. 1973, c. 927, \u00a7 2. Originally \u00a7 32B provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-5\">\u201cIf two or more domestic business corporations or foreign corporations participated in the filing of a consolidated return of income to the federal government, the net income measure of their excises imposed under section thirty-two or section thirty-nine may, at their option, be assessed upon their combined net income, in which case the excise shall be assessed to all said corporations and collected from any one or more of them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Section 32B was amended by St. 1988, c. 202, \u00a7 15,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which added the second and third paragraphs now appearing in \u00a7 32B, including, for the first time, the following provision regarding the method of calculating a corporate group\u2019s \u201ccombined net income\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">\u201cThe combined net income shall be determined as follows: (a) the taxable net income of each such corporation apportioned to this commonwealth . . . <em>shall first be separately determined.-, </em>and <em>(b) </em>the taxable net income of each such corporation, as so determined, <em>shall then be added together </em>and shall constitute their combined net income taxable under this chapter\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Section 32B requires that the determination of a group\u2019s combined net income proceed in the following sequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">First, the taxable net income of each group member must be \u201cseparately determined.\u201d Section 32B, par. second (a). The computation of an individual member\u2019s taxable net income begins with a calculation of its gross income as defined in G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30(3), as amended by St. 1992, c. 133, \u00a7\u00a7 400, 595.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>PMAG, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>429 Mass. 35, 39 (1999) (\u201c[t]he starting point for calculating the corporate excise tax in Massachusetts is Federal gross income\u201d). Once a corporation\u2019s gross income is determined, its \u201cnet income\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>must then be calculated. Net income is defined in G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30(4), as amended by St. 1992, c. 133, \u00a7\u00a7 401, 595,\u00ae as \u201cgross income less the deductions, but not credits, allowable under the provisions of the Federal Internal Revenue Code.\u201d It is at this point that NOL carry forwards are factored into the computation. NOL carry forwards are considered to be deductions pursuant to G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30(5)(6), as amended by St. 1992, c. 133, \u00a7\u00a7 403, 595; such losses may be carried forward for not more than five years, and may not be carried back.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">When all of a corporation\u2019s deductions have been subtracted, thereby determining its net income, its \u201ctaxable net income\u201d is then calculated by making certain adjustments as set forth in G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38(a). The corporation\u2019s taxable net income must then be apportioned by determining the amount of income derived from business that is taxable within Massachusetts and the amount of income derived from business that is taxable in other states. See G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38(6) \u2014 <em>(j).</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This process is repeated for each member of the corporate group.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Then, as set forth in \u00a7 32B, par. second (6), the apportioned, taxable net incomes of all of the individual members are merely \u201cadded together\u201d to determine the group\u2019s combined taxable net income. In sum, the calculation of combined taxable net income of a corporate group under \u00a7 32 requires a simple mathematical addition of the apportioned, taxable net incomes of the individual members, and the \u201cplain language\u201d of the statute must be followed. <em>Commissioner of Rev. </em>v. <em>Cargill, Inc., 429 </em>Mass. 79, 82 (1999).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\"><em>Farrell\u2019s authorities. </em>Farrell argues that interpreting \u00a7 32B in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>the manner just described is inconsistent with the legislative purpose of permitting combined tax returns, namely, to treat all the group members as if they were one entity. Because a combined group is to be viewed as a single entity, the argument continues, \u00a7 32B must be construed in a manner which allows the group as a whole to utilize the NOL carry forwards of its members. Farrell cites to a number of cases, including <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>402 Mass. 523 (1988); <em>Walter Kidde &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>389 Mass. 577 (1983); and <em>State Tax Commn. </em>v. <em>La Touraine Coffee Co., </em>361 Mass. 773 (1972). None supports its position.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The issue decided in <em>General Electric, </em>the most recent case cited by Farrell, was whether the apportionment of income to Massachusetts should occur before or after the combination of the net incomes of the members of a combined group. In ruling on this question, the court stated that \u201c[t]he purpose of consolidated financial statements is to reflect the financial condition of a parent corporation and its subsidiaries <em>as if they were a single </em>organization.\u201d 402 Mass, at 527 (emphasis in original), quoting from <em>State Tax Commn. </em>v. <em>La Touraine Coffee Co., </em>361 Mass, at 779. Applying this construct, the language of \u00a7 32B, in effect at that time, and the legislative history of \u00a7 32B, the court held that apportionment should take place <em>after </em>the net incomes of the members are combined. Similarly, Farrell contends that the deduction of NOL carry forwards should also occur after the combination of the group members\u2019 incomes.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Although Farrell correctly states the holding in <em>General Electric, </em>that case, and all other cases which Farrell relies on, were decided prior to the 1988 amendment to G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 32B. When the <em>General Electric </em>decision was released on June 9, 1988 (approximately forty-five days prior to the effective date of the amendment of \u00a7 32B, see note 6, <em>supra), </em>\u00a7 32B contained no explicit language regarding the method of calculating a group\u2019s combined taxable net income. Section 32B, as amended, calls for the determination of combined taxable net income <em>after </em>deducting from the net income of each member <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>any available NOL. The introduction of the \u00a7 32B method of calculating \u201ccombined net income\u201d of a corporate group after July 26, 1988, leaves no room for the <em>General Electric </em>construct of a \u201csingle organization.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Lennett, </em>415 Mass. 857, 863 (1993) (\u201c[i]t can be assumed that new legislation alters existing law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Farrell argues further that the amendment to \u00a7 32B was intended solely to reverse the narrow holding in <em>General Electric </em>regarding the timing of apportionment and that it has no application to the deduction of NOL carry forwards. We disagree. Chapter 63, as we have seen, sets forth a comprehensive procedure for determining combined net income. The amendment to \u00a7 32B establishes that it is only when this process is completed that the sums may be combined to arrive at the group\u2019s combined net income. Thus, the scope of the amendment to \u00a7 32B is broader than that suggested by Farrell; it is not limited merely to changing the timing of apportionment in the calculation of combined net income. See <em>Pielech </em>v. <em>Massasoit Greyhound, Inc., </em>423 Mass. 534, 539 (1996), cert, denied, 520 U.S. 1131 (1997) (\u201c[w]e must construe the statutes as they are written,\u201d quoting from <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>Election Commrs. of Boston, </em>423 Mass. 784, 789 [1942]).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Farrell also cites to <em>Walter Kidde &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>389 Mass. 577, in support of its claim for abatement. In <em>Walter Kidde &amp; Co., </em>corporations that had elected to file a combined return under \u00a7 32B were treated as a single entity. That is to say, the court allowed an investment credit claimed by one of the corporations under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 31A(a), to offset the total excise due from the group under the combined return, even though the credit due that corporation exceeded what would have been its own excise liability had it filed a separate tax return. <em>Id. </em>at 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">At the same time that G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 32B, was amended in 1988, the investment credit statute involved in <em>Walter Kidde &amp; Co., </em>G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 31 A, was also amended by the enactment of St. 1988, c. 202, \u00a7 13. The amendment added paragraph <em>(h) </em>to \u00a7 31A which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>\u201cAny corporation entitled to a credit for any taxable year under this section shall apply it only to its excise for any of the eligible taxable years. <em>Such credit may not be applied against the excise liability of any other corporation pursuant to an election under the provisions of section thirty-two B.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">This amendment reversed the holding in <em>Walter Kidde &amp; Co. </em>by prohibiting the use of investment credits by any corporation other than the one that generated the credit. Thus, contrary to Farrell\u2019s assertions, the enactment of St. 1988, c. 202, \u00a7\u00a7 13 (regarding investment credits) and 15 (regarding the calculation of combined net income of a corporate group), displays a general legislative intent to treat members of a corporate group filing a combined return as <em>separate </em>entities, whose taxable net incomes are merely \u201cadded together\u201d to yield a combined net income. See note 10, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The regulations enacted by the commissioner regarding the calculation of combined net income are consistent with the provisions of \u00a7 32B. Specifically, 830 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 63.32B.l(9)(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\"><em>\u201cNet operating losses, to the extent that they maybe [sic] carried from year to year and used under Massachusetts law, are deductions taken by individual corporations in calculating their net incomes under M. G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30(5)(b). </em>NOL therefore affects whether a member corporation has a loss (i.e. a negative net income and taxable net income) in a taxable year which, after apportionment, may offset income of other group members under the provisions of 830 C.M.R. [\u00a7] 63.32B.1(7). <em>Because NOL is a deduction taken by an individual corporation in calculating its individual net income, NOL is carried from year to year separately by each combined group member, not by the group as a whole.\u201d </em>(Emphases added.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Similar language is contained in 830 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 63.32B.l(9)(c)(l) (1993), which states that \u201c[a]ny unexpired NOL in excess of the amount permitted to be deducted must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>carried over by the individual corporation to the following taxable year.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Generally, we accord such regulations the same deference we extend to statutes. See <em>American Family Life Assur. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>388 Mass. 468, 477, cert, denied, 464 U.S. 850 (1983); <em>Massachusetts Eye &amp; Ear Infirmary </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Med. Assistance, </em>428 Mass. 805, 813 (1999). This means we \u201climit our determination to whether the State action is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. To that end we apply all rational presumptions in favor of the validity of the administrative action.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(Citations omitted.) We see no arbitrary or capricious agency action.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">True, the Massachusetts statute and regulations regarding combined returns do not follow the Federal regulations regarding the filing of consolidated income tax returns which explicitly permit the NOL carry forwards of all of the members to be aggregated and made available in the calculation of a group\u2019s consolidated income. See 26 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1.1502-11(a)(2) and 1.1502-21T (1998).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The commissioner concedes this point but argues correctly that Massachusetts is not required to follow Federal procedure with respect to this matter. See <em>Parker Affiliated Cos. </em>v. <em>Department of Rev., </em>382 Mass. 256, 263 (1981) (\u201c[t]he determination to forbid the Federal treatment of loss is clearly within the taxing power and prerogative of the Legislature\u201d).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The relevant statutes and regulations provide that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>a NOL carry forward is available only to the corporation that created the loss. Because Farrell\u2019s three subsidiaries had no income for the tax year 1991, the NOL carry forward of those three subsidiaries was unavailable to the group\u2019s combined tax return. The board correctly denied Farrell\u2019s application for abatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b598-14\">Farrell owns all or substantially all of the outstanding capital stock of six subsidiaries: Farrell Dock &amp; Terminal, Inc.; Farrell Ocean Services, Inc; Farrell Ocean Services of Boston; Kelco Metals Servicenter, Inc.; McKie Company; and Morse Diving Equipment Company, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b599-9\">The availability of net operating losses as a deduction is limited to a percentage of the net income of the taxpayer, and net operating losses may be carried forward by the taxpayer for not more than five years, and may not be carried back.

Modifications to the separate taxable incomes of federal consolidated group members under Treas. \u00a7 1.1502-12, which generally include deferrals and eliminations for intercompany transactions, are not used when determining the Massachusetts net income of combined group members, even for transactions exclusively involving members of a Massachusetts group. The net income of each corporation should, if necessary, be adjusted to compensate for any such federal modifications.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
