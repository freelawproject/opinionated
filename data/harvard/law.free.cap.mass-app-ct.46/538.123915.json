Hudson, an inmate serving his sentence at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Cedar Junction (MCI, Cedar Junction),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was subjected to restrictive confinement and a prison disciplinary proceeding in June, 1996, on a charge of fighting with another inmate. The proceeding resulted in a finding that Hudson was guilty of assaulting the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>inmate and a sanction of loss of television, radio, canteen, and telephone privileges for two weeks, suspended for sixty days. He continued in restrictive confinement until July 23, 1996. On that date, Hudson commenced an action in the nature of certiorari, pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, against the named defendants in Superior Court challenging his prison disciplinary process. His complaint also sought declaratory relief under G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 1, damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and an order for civil contempt (see note 5, <em>infra), </em>all on account of the defendants\u2019 alleged deprivation of his rights by virtue of the restrictive confinement and defects in the disciplinary process. After a hearing on cross motions for summary judgment, a Superior Court judge allowed the defendants\u2019 motion as to all of Hudson\u2019s claims and ordered entry of final judgment for the defendants. In his appeal, Hudson challenges the Superior Court\u2019s ruling as erroneous on a number of grounds. We conclude that none of his contentions presents a ground for reversal and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The essential facts underlying this controversy are undisputed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As of June 1, 1996, Hudson was residing in a cell in a general population unit of the prison called \u201cEssex II.\u201d On that date, he and another inmate, Antwine, were placed on \u201cawaiting action\u201d status in Essex II<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in connection with an investigation of an apparent bloody altercation in or about a stairwell of the unit earlier in the day. Three days later, on June 4, 1996, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Hudson was transferred to the more restrictive \u201cEssex I\u201d unit of the prison and was formally notified that he had been placed on \u201cawaiting action/pending investigation\u201d status in connection with his role in a June 1 assault on Antwine and his suspected involvement in a subsequent assault on Antwine on June 4<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by several other inmates in the Essex II unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">On June 11, 1996, a disciplinary report was issued to Hudson alleging that he had assaulted inmate Antwine on June 1, 1996, and was implicated in the subsequent June 4, 1996, assault on Antwine. Those incidents were stated to constitute offenses contrary to 130 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 430.24(2), (8), (18) (1993) (violating prison rules or regulations; interfering with or disrupting the security or the orderly running of the prison; fighting with or assaulting another person). A disciplinary hearing was scheduled for June 19, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Prior to the hearing, Hudson requested that he receive certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>documentary evidence and that correction officer Turner, unit manager Devine, unit sergeant Bailer, and inmate Antwine be called as witnesses. Hudson was provided with copies of the relevant incident reports and (at the hearing) a copy of the informant checklist; his request to examine the informant reports themselves was denied because of the risk of exposure of the informant, and his request for Antwine\u2019s medical records was denied on the ground of confidentiality. (Hudson did not, apparently, ask Antwine to waive confidentiality). His request to call Antwine was denied on the basis of security concerns, but he was permitted to submit an affidavit from Antwine (which, to the extent the almost illegible copy in the record can be deciphered, exculpated Hudson). Hudson\u2019s request for Bailer\u2019s testimony was denied because that testimony would have been cumulative of Turner\u2019s and Devine\u2019s. The hearing officer denied Hudson\u2019s request to tape record the hearing (apparently made only at the hearing) because Hudson had not taken the appropriate steps in a timely fashion under the regulations to make funds (which he sufficiently had in his savings account) available for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The hearing took place on June 19 and 20, 1996, with Hudson in attendance. On June 20, 1996, the hearing officer issued his written decision, finding Hudson guilty, by a preponderance of the evidence (including physical evidence, observations of correction officers, and reliable and credible information from an informant with personal knowledge), of the 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.24(18) offense, involvement in the June 1, 1996, fight with Antwine. The other charges were dismissed. The hearing officer recommended a sanction of two weeks\u2019 loss of television, radio, canteen, and telephone privileges, all sanctions suspended for sixty days.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Hudson appealed the decision of the hearing officer to the superintendent, whose deputy denied the appeal. Hudson remained in the Essex I unit for approximately thirty days after the hearing officer issued his decision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Hudson\u2019s principal appellate claim is that the Superior Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>judge erred in not ruling that his placement in the more restrictive confinement of the Essex I unit on June 4, 1996, and his remaining there for a period of approximately six or seven weeks, constituted a violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, in that it denied him his Federal and State guaranteed due process rights.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There is no merit to his position for the simple reason that he received all process due him as a regulatory and constitutional matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">It is clear that his placement and confinement, both before and after his disciplinary hearing, were explicitly authorized by unchallenged applicable regulations. See note 4, supra; 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 430.21(1) &amp; 430.25(1) (1993). Contrast <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>390 Mass. 425, 429-430 (1983); <em>DeLong </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, ante </em>353, 356-358 (1999). Moreover, he received the limited procedural safeguards required to justify the decision to place in administrative segregation an inmate who has (as Hudson asserts he does, but see discussion, <em>infra </em>at 546-548) a liberty interest: notice of the charges and an opportunity to present his position to the appropriate prison official. See <em>Hewitt </em>v. <em>Helms, </em>459 U.S. 460, 476 (1983); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Plaut, </em>131 F.3d 163, 170-171 (D.C. Cir. 1997), cert, denied, 118 S. Ct. 2346 (1998).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See also <em>Daigle </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>564 F.2d 884, 885-886 (1st Cir. 1977); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Fair, </em>697 F. Supp. 567, 570-571 (D. Mass. 1988); <em>Leacock </em>v. <em>DuBois, </em>937 F. Supp. 81, 83 (D. Mass. 1996); <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>427 Mass. 611, 617-619, cert, denied, 119 S. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>543 (1998). In short, Hudson could lawfully be deprived of the liberty interest he asserts once the State afforded him the requisite due process. <em>McGuinness </em>v. <em>DuBois, </em>891 F. Supp. 25, 35 (D. Mass. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Contrary to Hudson\u2019s reiterated contention (made without citation to relevant supporting authority) that his due process rights under the Massachusetts Constitution are greater than those available under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, his claims also fail under the State Constitution. The Supreme Judicial Court has never held that the due process provisions of our State Constitution (Part n, c. 1, \u00a7 1, art. 4; arts. 1, 10, and 12 of the Declaration of Rights) provide inmates with more extensive rights than those available under the Federal Constitution; rather, the court has consistently equated as comparable, both generally and in the prison environment, the due process protections of the two fundamental documents. See <em>Pinnick </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>360 Mass. 1, 14 n.8 (1971); <em>Zeller </em>v. <em>Cantu, </em>395 Mass. 76, 83-84 (1985); <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Keene Corp., </em>406 Mass. 301, 308 n.8 (1989); <em>Carleton </em>v. <em>Framingham, </em>418 Mass. 623, 630 (1994); <em>Hastings </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>424 Mass. 46, 51-52 (1997); <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>427 Mass, at 617-619 &amp; n.ll; <em>\u2018Abdullah </em>v. <em>Secretary of Pub. Safety, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 387, 390, 391, 393 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Indeed, as a matter of State law, our courts have long recognized the broad discretion of the Commissioner of Correction to transfer inmates within the prison system or within a particular institution. See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>388 Mass. 700, 703 (1983); <em>Hastings </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>424 Mass, at 49-50. Neither the governing statutes nor our State Constitution impose substantive standards that limit prison officials\u2019 discretion to transfer an inmate \u201cto higher security,\u201d so long as the exercise of that discretion does \u201cnot affect the duration of . . . [his] sentence[] or subject [him] to conditions different from those customarily applied to other inmates . . . ,\u201d even if the officials\u2019 action results in the inmate \u201csuffer[ing] a serious loss.\u201d <em>Hastings, </em>424 Mass, at 52 (upholding against Federal and State constitutional challenge the transfer, from work-release status at pre-release facilities to imprisonment inside a correctional institution, of individuals who had had exemplary institutional and work records, a far more severe and less merited deprivation than that complained of by Hudson).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>One of the \u201cconditions . . . customarily applied\u201d to inmates of Massachusetts prisons is, as the judge below accurately noted, the reasonable use of \u201cawaiting action\u201d status by correctional officials in managing their institutions, including its use in the form of administrative segregation as an investigative tool. See <em>Lamoureux </em>v. <em>Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Inst., Walpole, </em>390 Mass. 409, 411-412 n.7 (1983). Cf. <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>390 Mass, at 429-430 (holding that placement in \u201cawaiting action\u201d in an administrative segregation area is an acceptable status pending an investigation or a disciplinary hearing, but it is a temporary status and may not be used for an unreasonable or indefinite time, and keeping an inmate in it for two years without a hearing or any review was unreasonable). Being placed in administrative segregation on awaiting action status \u201c \u2018is the sort of confinement that inmates should reasonably anticipate receiving at some point in their incarceration\u2019 and it does not involve an interest independently protected by the due process clause\u201d of either the Federal or the State Constitution. <em>Real </em>v. <em>Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Inst., Walpole, </em>390 Mass. 399, 407 (1983), vacated sub nom. <em>Ponte </em>v. <em>Real, </em>471 U.S. 491, <em>S.C., </em>396 Mass. 1001 (1985), quoting from <em>Hewitt </em>v. <em>Helms, </em>459 U.S. 460, 468 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Under the \u201crule of reason\u201d by which the duration of an administrative segregation confinement on awaiting action status is tested, see <em>Puckett </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 448, 451 (1990), Hudson\u2019s situation (a total of six or seven weeks\u2019 confinement, with each stage consistent with the regulations and validated by a hearing) easily passes muster. Compare <em>Lamoureux </em>v. <em>Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Inst., Walpole, </em>390 Mass, at 411, 413, 417-418 (no due process violation involved in inmate\u2019s being held in administrative segregation for at least thirteen and possibly as many as eighteen weeks). Contrast <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>390 Mass, at 427, 429-430 (being held in administrative segregation for a period of over two years without a hearing or status review unreasonable); <em>Puckett </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, supra </em>(restrictive detention on awaiting action status for over five and one-half months without any explanation or justification unreasonable as matter of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">A final aspect of Hudson\u2019s due process attack on his confinement is his contention that he was denied the \u201cfifteen day review\u201d specified by the regulations during the approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>thirty days he spent in Essex I following the determination of his guilt. Even assuming that his status during that period was a continuation of \u201cawaiting action\u201d (see note 7, <em>supra) </em>and that he received no reviews,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> his argument is misplaced. As the regulations make clear (see note 10, <em>supra), </em>the time periods for review are made discretionary, not unmistakably mandatory, so that even under the authorities relied on by Hudson, the defendants neither violated their own regulations nor created any constitutionally protected liberty interest. Cf. <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>390 Mass, at 428-429; <em>Kenney </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>393 Mass. 28, 32-34 (1984); <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>409 Mass. 472, 476-479 (1991); <em>Watson </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>92 F.3d 31, 37-38 (2d Cir. 1996); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Fair, </em>697 F. Supp. at 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Moreover, our courts have consistently analyzed the lawfulness of a term of administrative segregation by reference to the reasonableness of its duration and the existence of valid justification for and fair process in its imposition, not merely whether regulations were technically violated or periodic reviews were omitted during the confinement. See <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>390 Mass, at 430 &amp; n.9; <em>Puckett </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. at 451. Contrast <em>\u2018Abdullah </em>v. <em>Secretary of Pub. Safety, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. at 391-392 (prison officials did not comply with regulations requiring notice of the reasons for the inmate\u2019s transfer and for the convening of a classification hearing; new hearing ordered not merely because of such noncompliance but rather because it was in fact prejudicial, i.e., it deprived the inmate of a meaningful hearing and opportunity to contest the reasons for transfer and a meaningful opportunity for administrative review of the adverse decision); <em>DeLong </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, supra </em>at 357-358. Cf. <em>Martino </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 710, 720-721 (1994) (despite prison personnel\u2019s failure to comply with regulations calling for pretransfer hearings and other procedures, \u201c[i]t is implausible to imagine that the Legislature, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>in granting the department [of correction] authority to promulgate regulations . . . was empowering the department to create possible civil liability against the officials\u201d who violated the regulations).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">In their brief, the defendants maintain that the Superior Court judge\u2019s allowance of their summary judgment motion on the due process counts of Hudson\u2019s complaint can and should be affirmed on the ground specifically relied on by the judge, namely the revised constitutional standard for evaluating inmates\u2019 due process claims set forth in <em>Sandin </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>515 U.S. 472 (1995). In order to prove a \u00a7 1983 claim for due process violation under that decision, a prisoner must show either that he has been subjected to an \u201catypical and significant hardship ... in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 484, or that the alleged deprivation \u201cwill inevitably affect the duration of his sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487. See <em>Dominique </em>v. <em>Weld, </em>73 F.3d 1156, 1163 (1st Cir. 1996); <em>Neal </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>131 F.3d 172, 174-175 (D.C. Cir. 1997), cert, denied, 119 S. Ct. 46 (1998). In the absence of such a showing, the Supreme Court held, a prisoner has no liberty interest giving rise to due process protections.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">A number of unsettled and difficult questions remain regard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>ing how to apply the <em>Sandin </em>analysis, among them (1) what are the criteria for determining whether the restrictive hardships challenged by the prisoner are or are not \u201catypical and significant\u201d deprivations; and (2) what circumstances or conditions are to be taken as representing \u201cthe ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Hanks, </em>128 F.3d 1173, 1174-1176 (7th Cir. 1997); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Plant, </em>131 F.3d at 169-170; <em>DeLong </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, supra </em>at 357-358.* ****&amp;******13 14See also <em>Sandin, </em>515 U.S. at 490 n.2, 496-497 (Ginsburg, J., &amp; Breyer, J., dissenting) (criticizing the uncertainty of the new standard); The Supreme Court, 1994 Term \u2014 Leading Cases, 109 Harv. L. Rev. 111, 144-150 (1995). In the instant case, however, we do not and need not address such issues or rest our decision upon Sandin14 because, as the previous discussion demonstrates, to the extent Hudson could claim due process rights,15 they were not violated but were rather recognized and provided. Compare <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Plaut, </em>131 F.3d at 170-172.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Hudson\u2019s remaining contentions require only brief discussion:</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">(1) His claim that, at some unspecified point during his challenged confinement, he was denied exercise for seventeen days is contradicted by the record.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It is also devoid of factual support for the requisite showings, under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 26 of the Declaration of Rights (both of which he invoked below), that (even assuming his assertion to be true) the defendants acted in this regard with deliberate indifference to the claimed unlawful conditions and that those conditions constituted extreme deprivation and the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain grossly disproportionate to the severity of his offense. See <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>452 U.S. 337, 347 (1981); <em>Helling </em>v. <em>McKinney, </em>509 U.S. 25, 36 (1993); <em>Farmer </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994); <em>Miga </em>v. <em>Holyoke, </em>398 Mass. 343, 349-351 &amp; n.9 (1986); <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>427 Mass, at 613-616.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">(2) Hudson attacks, on unspecific due process grounds, a number of supposed flaws in his disciplinary hearing. His challenges do not, however, undermine the decision below, which rejected them on the basis of the defendants\u2019 compliance with all applicable regulations.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> His request to tape record the hearing clearly failed to comply with 103 Code Mass. Regs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>\u00a7 430.12(3) (1993); and the use of a confidential informant\u2019s inculpatory statement at his hearing complied with the relevant provisions of 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.15 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">(3) Hudson finally contends that the judge abused his discretion in allowing the defendants\u2019 motion for a protective order, pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.R 26(c), as amended, 423 Mass. 1401 (1996), to stay his discovery pending a ruling on their motion to dismiss or in the alternative for summary judgment. He makes no showing, however, as is necessary, that the judge abused the broad discretion with which he is invested in dealing with protective orders, see <em>Merles </em>v. <em>Lerner, </em>391 Mass. 221, 226 (1984); nor that even assumed abuse resulted in prejudicial error. See <em>Solimene </em>v. <em>B. Grauel &amp; Co., KG, </em>399 Mass. 790, 799 (1987).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Indeed, his entire argument is premised on the supposed constitutional right of pro se litigants to procedural indulgences \u2014 a supposition contrary to the law of this Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>399 Mass. 385, 392 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>419 Mass. 716, 719-720 (1995); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>424 Mass. 1019 (1997). In any event, since the protective order was sought and granted in connection with the defendants\u2019 defense of qualified immunity from suit as well as from liability, its allowance in this procedural context was well within the judge\u2019s discretion. See <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 817-819 (1982); <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 526-527 (1985); <em>Siegert </em>v. <em>Gilley, </em>500 U.S. 226, 231 (1991).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b572-17\">The record does not reveal what Hudson\u2019s sentence was or of what crimes he was convicted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b573-6\">See note 5, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b573-7\">\u201c \u2018Awaiting action\u2019 constitutes a status in which an inmate may be placed pending a disciplinary hearing, an investigation of a possible disciplinary offense, a transfer or reclassification, or imposition of isolation time sanction when the inmate\u2019s continued presence in the general population poses a serious threat. See [103 Code Mass. Regs.] \u00a7 430.19(1) [(1978)]. When placed in \u2018awaiting action\u2019 status, an inmate may be confined to an area or areas designated by the superintendent .... Such confinement is administrative segregation.\u201d <em>Lamoureux </em>v. <em>Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Inst., Walpole, </em>390 Mass. 409, 411-412 n.7 (1983). <em>See Royce </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>390 Mass. 425, 429-430 (1983). The applicable form of the \u201cawaiting action\u201d regulation as of the date of Hudson\u2019s difficulties was 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.21(1) (1993), which stated that \u201c[a]t the discretion of the Superintendent or his designee ... an inmate who is under investigation for a possible disciplinary offense or has been charged with or found guilty of a disciplinary offense, may be placed on awaiting action status at the institution where he is then confined. Such status may include more restrictive confinement as deemed appropriate by the Superintendent or his designee.\u201d Hudson has not challenged the validity of any correctional regulations in this proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Hudson repeatedly asserts that summary judgment for the defendants was inappropriate because of a material disputed fact: whether he was transferred to Essex I on June 4 before or after the assault on Antwine that day. Hudson argues that the transfer to a more restrictive unit prior to the second assault not only removed him from awaiting action status to a disciplinary segregation unit but also violated a court order issued on January 5, 1996, in Gilchrist <em>vs. </em>DuBois, Superior Court Civ. No. 93-6300-D, which he construes as requiring the provision of various due process protections prior to a transfer to more restrictive confinement. (This supposed violation of the Gilchrist order is also the basis for Hudson\u2019s claim that the defendants should be held in contempt.) As the Commonwealth correctly points out, however, the regulation, 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.21(1), cited immediately above in note 4, expressly authorized such a transfer; to the extent process was due, he received it within fifteen days as required by the regulations. See 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 421.08(3) (1994). Cf. 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.22(2) (1993); G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 40. Moreover, at the time of Hudson\u2019s transfer, the original injunctive order in Gilchrist applied only to inmate Gilchrist himself and was not amended to apply to other prisoners until August 19, 1996, eleven weeks after Hudson\u2019s transfer. (That latter fact alone disposes of Hudson\u2019s claim for a contempt sanction.) Further, Gilchrist v\u00ed. DuBois involved (as the judge below observed) a so-called \u201cphase system\u201d under which Gilchrist was transferred to more restrictive confinement, without notice or hearing, \u201cpursuant to a routine evaluation of his \u2018overall adjustment to maximum security\u2019 \u201d and not, as was Hudson, pursuant to the express authority of the awaiting action regulation and the need to investigate a serious, violent incident in which Hudson was the prime suspect. The judge thus effectively determined that the supposed factual dispute was not material to the gravamen of Hudson\u2019s case, which was the validity of his confinement on awaiting status before and after his disciplinary hearing, even assuming his version of the timing were correct. We agree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b575-7\">From all that appears in the record, as a result of the sixty-day suspension of the disciplinary sanctions, Hudson was never actually subjected to them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Hudson\u2019s affidavit in support of his summary judgment motion avers, in conclusory fashion, that his continued confinement in Essex I was a standard punishment for those found guilty in disciplinary hearings. Nothing in the regulations or this record supports Hudson\u2019s averment. Nor does the record indicate that his continued stay in Essex I following his guilty finding was on \u201cadministrative segregation\u201d status. The defendants assert that he remained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>there only pending his appeal and the availability of a cell in Essex II, which Hudson\u2019s affidavit appears to acknowledge. In any event, had Hudson been continued on restrictive status beyond the disciplinary hearing, explicit authorization to do so could be found in 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u25a0 430.21(1), the validity of which he has not contested, and no due process violation was implicated.

Regs. \u00a7 421.23 (1994), however, states that those time limits are \u201cdirectory,\u201d i.e., advisory but not compulsory. See Webster\u2019s Third New Inti. Dictionary 641 (1993) (\u201cdirectory . . . providing guidance that is advisory and authoritative but not compulsory . . .

Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 430.21 [1] &amp; 430.23 [1993]); or rather was (as Hudson appears to claim) on \u201cdepartmental segregation,\u201d which entitled him to review every fifteen days. See 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 420.08(3). The record does not clearly support either position, but the issue is immaterial on our disposition of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b580-8\">Prior to <em>Sandin </em>(which was a 5-4 ruling), Supreme Court precedent called for courts to examine the language in State statutes and regulations, to determine whether it was unmistakably mandatory or merely discretionary, rather than the nature of the deprivation suffered by the inmate, in order to determine whether a liberty interest existed. See 515 U.S. at 477-481. In <em>San-din, </em>the Court held that a prisoner\u2019s placement in strict disciplinary segregation for thirty days (on account of his physical interference with a prison officer) did not support a \u00a7 1983 claim for deprivation of due process rights under this new standard. <em>Id. </em>at 485-487. Notwithstanding the fact that Sand-in\u2019s disciplinary segregation essentially amounted to solitary confinement and represented a reduction of out-of-cell time from eight to twelve hours per day to fifty minutes per day <em>(id. </em>at 486 &amp; n.8; <em>Neal, </em>131 R3d at 175), the Supreme Court majority determined that such confinement \u201cmirrored those conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>imposed upon inmates in administrative\" segregation and protective custody,\u201d \u201cdid not exceed similar, but totally discretionary, confinement in either duration or degree of restriction,\u201d and did not represent an atypical or significant hardship or disruption even when compared with inmates in the general population. 515 U.S. at 486. The four dissenters saw the confinement rather as effecting \u201ca severe alteration\u201d in the conditions of the prisoner\u2019s incarceration compared to the general population, amounting to a deprivation of liberty within the meaning of the due process clause. <em>Id. </em>at 488 &amp; 493 (Ginsburg, J., &amp; Breyer, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b581-11\">The defendants here syllogistically argue that no detailed factual comparison of Hudson\u2019s challenged confinement with other prison conditions is required: if solitary confinement for thirty days (as in Sandin) did not rise to the level of an \u201catypical and significant hardship,\u201d they assert, then Hudson\u2019s less severe, or at least comparable, deprivation should not give rise to a liberty interest.

He fails, however, to demonstrate by reference to any authority that the violation of such regulations creates a private right of action for affected inmates.
