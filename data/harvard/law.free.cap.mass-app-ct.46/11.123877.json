The passengers filed suit against Clerger who, in turn, requested that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>insurer, the defendant, Commerce Insurance Company (Commerce), provide him with a defense to the passengers\u2019 suit. Commerce refused, citing to \u201cPart 1. Bodily Injury to Others,\u201d of Clerger\u2019s automobile insurance policy, which states: \u201cWe will not pay: 1. For injuries to guest occupants of your auto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Clerger filed suit against Commerce,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seeking a declaration that Commerce was obligated to provide him with a defense, as well as to reimburse him for accrued attorney\u2019s fees. Both parties moved for summary judgment, and, on September 25, 1996, a Superior Court judge allowed Clerger\u2019s motion. On Commerce\u2019s motion, final judgment for Clerger, pursuant to Mass.R. Civ.P. 54(b), 365 Mass. 821 (1974), was entered. Clerger appeals from the allowance of the 54(b) certification; in a cross-appeal, Commerce appeals from- the judgment itself. We first consider the issues raised by Commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">1. <em>Commerce\u2019s appeal. </em>Commerce argues that the motion judge erred in granting Clerger\u2019s motion for summary judgment because there is no liability insurance coverage for guest occupants under the policy. \u201c[Wjhen the allegations in the underlying complaint lie expressly outside the policy coverage and its purpose, the insurer is relieved of the duty to investigate or defend the claimant.\u201d <em>Timpson </em>v. <em>Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 344, 347 (1996), quoting from <em>Terrio </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 163, 168 (1983). In this case, Clerger\u2019s policy expressly states that there will be no coverage for injuries to guest occupants of his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Nonetheless, the plaintiff points to <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 532 (1994), as imposing a duty to defend. Under cases previous to <em>Skinner, </em>an injured passenger, despite the absence of recourse to any other insurance policy, could not recover under the uninsured motorist provision of the driver\u2019s policy. In those cases, it was held that \u201cuninsured motorist protection is not additional liability insurance but rather is \u2018limited personal accident insurance chiefly for the benefit of the <em>named insured\u2019 Cardin </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., </em>394 Mass. 450, 452 (1985) . . . .\u201d <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lund, </em>403 Mass. 1006, 1007 (1988) (emphasis supplied). See <em>Freundlich </em>v. <em>Holyoke Mut. Ins. Co., </em>411 Mass. 1002 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">In 1988, however, the Legislature added subsection (5) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L, which provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[a]ny injured occupants who are not named insureds on a policy and who are not insured on a resident relative\u2019s policy may obtain uninsured motorist coverage from the named insured\u2019s policy covering the vehicle they occupy when injured.\u201d Thus, for insurance policies written after January 1, 1989, like the one in this case, injured passengers who do not have recourse to any other insurance policy may collect under the uninsured motorist provision of the driver\u2019s policy. See <em>Skinner, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. at 532.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Clerger argues that, because he has no liability coverage for guest occupants of his vehicle, he is an uninsured motorist. Pointing to language in the policy that states that Commerce has \u201cthe right and duty to defend any lawsuit brought against anyone covered under this policy for damages, which might be payable under this policy,\u201d Clerger then reasons that, because the passengers may collect under the uninsured motorist provision, Commerce has a duty to defend him from the passengers\u2019 suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The flaw in Clerger\u2019s reasoning is that neither the amendment to \u00a7 113L nor <em>Skinner </em>expanded the rights of the named insured under the policy. The amendment served only to enable an injured passenger to collect directly from the driver\u2019s insurer. Clerger\u2019s theory is based on an erroneous premise that, should the passengers succeed in a suit against Clerger, Commerce must indemnify Clerger for any amounts due the passengers. Such is not the case. Rather, the passengers, <em>in addition to </em>a suit against Clerger, may also file a claim with Commerce for benefits under the uninsured motorist provision of Clerger\u2019s policy. Thus, the passengers\u2019 tort claim against Clerger is a separate action from any claim which they may choose to make under the uninsured motorist section of Clerger\u2019s policy. The availability of the uninsured motorist benefits does not trigger a duty to defend Clerger from suit by the passengers. See generally, concerning uninsured motorist benefits, <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>American Cas. Co., </em>419 Mass. 138, 141-142 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">2. <em>Clerger\u2019s appeal. </em>Clerger\u2019s procedural arguments are without merit. He argues, among other things, that this court should not hear the defendant\u2019s appeal of the Superior Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>order, since, he contends, the order was interlocutory, and the defendant was obligated to file an interlocutory appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118. However, \u00a7 118 is entirely discretionary, both as to whether the aggrieved party may file the petition and as to whether the single justice must hear it or grant relief. See <em>Rollins Envtl. Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Ct., </em>368 Mass. 174, 181 (1975). Section 118 does not preclude a party from seeking the entry of a final judgment under Mass.R.Civ.P. 54(b), and the defendant filed a timely appeal from that judgment. In view of our disposition of Commerce\u2019s appeal, any remaining issues raised by Clerger\u2019s appeal need not be addressed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The judgment entered pursuant to the order allowing summary judgment for Clerger is reversed. A new judgment shall enter granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and declaring that Commerce has no duty to defend the plaintiff in a suit by a guest occupant of the plaintiff\u2019s auto.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b46-9\">Clerger also named Christopher Koskoras Insurance Company as a party; the motions and the 54(b) judgment do not pertain to it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b47-8\"><em>.Skinner </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 532, 535 n.3 (1994), thoroughly explains the proper party from whom an injured person may seek uninsured motorist benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Clerger also complains of Commerce\u2019s failure to comply with the initial order in his favor that imposed a duty to defend on Commerce. The motion for sanctions on that ground was denied because a final judgment had not yet been entered. While we do not disagree with this disposition of the motion for sanctions, we do not condone Commerce\u2019s delay in seeking the 54(b) certification under the circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
