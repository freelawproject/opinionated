A different conclusion is not required by the fact that defendant was in prison serving an 18-month sentence at the time of such service, or that she may have lived with her boyfriend for several months before going to prison <em>(see, Bernardo v Barrett, </em>87 AD2d 832, <em>affd </em>57 NY2d 1006). We also agree with, the IAS Court that Correction Law \u00a7 620 merely authorizes an alternative method of service on a prisoner. We have considered defendant\u2019s other arguments and find them to be without merit. Concur\u2014Sullivan, J. P., Carro, Rosenberger, Wallach and Rubin, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
