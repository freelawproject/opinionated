Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, it was his testimony which brought out an alternative theory to support every requisite element of the crime charged. Nevertheless, neither the prosecutor\u2019s summation nor the court\u2019s jury instructions deviated from the theory advanced in the indictment and bill of particulars. Concur\u2014Murphy, P.
