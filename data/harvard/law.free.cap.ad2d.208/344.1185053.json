Jordon, was admitted to the practice of law in the State of New York by the First Judicial Department on June 27, 1978. At all times pertinent to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>proceeding respondent had maintained an office for the practice of law within the First Judicial Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">By order of this Court entered October 6, 1994 (202 AD2d 141), respondent was suspended from the practice of law nunc pro tunc as of June 21, 1994 upon the ground that she was suffering from a disability by reason of mental infirmity or illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">On or about July 13, 1994, respondent pleaded guilty in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, to one count of grand larceny in the second degree, in violation of Penal Law \u00a7 155.40 (1), which is a class C felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">On or about September 20, 1994, respondent was sentenced by the Honorable Herbert J. Adlerberg to five years\u2019 probation. As a condition of probation, respondent was directed to seek psychiatric counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The Departmental Disciplinary Committee now seeks an order striking respondent\u2019s name from the roll of attorneys pursuant to Judiciary Law \u00a7 90 (4) (b) upon the ground that she has been disbarred upon her conviction of a felony as defined by Judiciary Law \u00a7 90 (4) (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Judiciary Law \u00a790 (4) (a) provides: \"Any person being an attorney and counsellor-at-law who shall be convicted of a felony as defined in paragraph e of this subdivision, shall upon such conviction, cease to be an attorney and counsellor-at-law, or to be competent to practice law as such.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">Judiciary Law \u00a7 90 (4) (e) provides in pertinent part as follows: \"For purposes of this subdivision, the term felony shall mean any criminal offense classified as a felony under the laws of this state\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">Respondent stands convicted of grand larceny in the second degree, in violation of Penal Law \u00a7 155.40 (1), which is a felony according to the New York Penal Law. Thus, pursuant to Judiciary Law \u00a790 (4) (a), respondent ceased to be an attorney by operation of law upon her conviction of a criminal offense which is classified as a felony under the laws of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">Accordingly, the Disciplinary Committee\u2019s petition is granted and respondent\u2019s name is stricken from the roll of attorneys pursuant to Judiciary Law \u00a7 90 (4) (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Sullivan, J. P., Asch, Nardelli, Williams and Tom, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\">Petition granted and respondent\u2019s name directed to be struck from the roll of attorneys and counselors-at-law in the State of New York, effective March 23,1995.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
