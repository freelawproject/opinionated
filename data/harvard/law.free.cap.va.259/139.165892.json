The Russell County Department of Social Services reassigned its employee, Sheilah Jackson O\u2019Quinn, from a position of child protective services worker to a different position within the Department of Social Services. O\u2019Quinn considered the reassignment a demotion, and she filed a grievance utilizing the Russell County grievance procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>James Gillespie, Russell County Administrator, ultimately determined that O\u2019Quinn should be reinstated to her former position as a child protective services worker. The Department of Social Services filed a bill of complaint for declaratory judgment in the circuit court, styled <em>Russell County Department of Social Services </em>v. <em>O\u2019Quinn, </em>and requested that the court declare that the county administrator had erroneously determined that O\u2019Quinn\u2019s complaint was grievable. The circuit court dismissed the bill of complaint because the court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-3\">O\u2019Quinn instituted this proceeding by filing a suit for declaratory and injunctive relief. She requested that the circuit court compel the Department of Social Services to reinstate her to the position of child protective services worker. She also requested attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The circuit court entered a decree which, among other things, ordered O\u2019Quinn\u2019s reinstatement and established a schedule for the filing of O\u2019Quinn\u2019s verified petition for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Subsequently, the court considered O\u2019Quinn\u2019s petition for attorney\u2019s fees, and memoranda submitted by counsel for O\u2019Quinn and the Department of Social Services, and entered a decree which awarded O\u2019Quinn $6,405 in attorney\u2019s fees and $1,075 in costs. The court stated in its decree that a \u201c[cjourt, sitting in equity, is vested with the authority and discretion to award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs as \u2018further relief\u2019 pursuant to . . . Code . . . \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-186 and 8.01-191.\u201d The Department of Social Services appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Code \u00a7 8.01-186 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-5\">\u201cFurther relief based on a declaratory judgment order or decree may be granted whenever necessary or proper. The application shall be by motion to a court having jurisdiction to grant the relief. If the application is deemed sufficient the court shall, on reasonable notice, require an adverse party whose rights have been adjudicated by the declaration of right to show cause why further relief should not be granted forthwith.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Code \u00a7 8.01-191 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">\u201cThis article is declared to be remedial. Its purpose is to afford relief from the uncertainty and insecurity attendant upon controversies over legal rights, without requiring one of the parties interested so to invade the rights asserted by the other as to entitle him to maintain an ordinary action therefor. It is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>be liberally interpreted and administered with a view to making the courts more serviceable to the people.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">The Department of Social Services argues that the circuit court erred in awarding attorney\u2019s fees to O\u2019Quinn because neither the Virginia Declaratory Judgment Act nor any other statute provides for such an award. Responding, O\u2019Quinn asserts that Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-186 and -191 authorize a circuit court to award attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing litigant. Continuing, O\u2019Quinn contends that Code \u00a78.01-191 mandates that courts liberally construe the statutes contained in the Virginia Declaratory Judgment Act and that the words \u201cfurther relief\u201d contained in Code \u00a7 8.01-186 authorize a court to make an award of attorney\u2019s fees. We disagree with O\u2019Quinn.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The plain language contained in Code \u00a78.01-191 requires that the courts interpret and administer the Virginia Declaratory Judgment Act \u201cwith a view to making the courts more serviceable to the people.\u201d This statute, however, does not authorize a court to make an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">We have repeatedly stated that the \u201cgeneral rule in this Commonwealth is that in the absence of a statute or contract to the contrary, a court may not award attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party.\u201d <em>Prospect Development Co. </em>v. <em>Bershader, </em>258 Va. 75, 92, 515 S.E.2d 291, 300 (1999); <em>accord Gilmore </em>v. <em>Basic Industries, Inc., </em>233 Va. 485, 490, 357 S.E.2d 514, 517 (1987). Even though we have recognized that there are certain exceptions to this rule, none of those exceptions is pertinent here. <em>See Bershader, </em>258 Va. at 92, 515 S.E.2d at 300. Rather, O\u2019Quinn must identify a specific statutory grant of authority that enables a court to award attorney\u2019s fees to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Contrary to O\u2019Quinn\u2019s assertion, the phrase \u201cfurther relief\u201d contained in \u00a7 8.01-186 does not authorize a court to award attorney\u2019s fees to a litigant. Rather, that term permits a court to enter necessary orders to implement or enforce a declaratory judgment entered by the court. <em>See Winborne </em>v. <em>Doyle, </em>190 Va. 867, 872-73, 59 S.E.2d 90, 93 (1950). We simply cannot, and will not, infer that the General Assembly intended to authorize a court to award attorney\u2019s fees in a declaratory judgment action when the Virginia Declaratory Judgment Act fails expressly to grant such authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">The Department of Social Services also contends that the circuit court erred in awarding costs to O\u2019Quinn that included costs she incurred in the first proceeding that the Department of Social Services initiated, and the present proceeding. The Department of Social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Services asserts that the proceedings are two distinct proceedings, and O\u2019Quinn is not entitled to recover for costs incurred in the former proceeding. The Department of Social Services also asserts that the circuit court abused its discretion by awarding certain costs because such costs are not recoverable. O\u2019Quinn argues that the Department of Social Services failed to raise these issues in the circuit court and, therefore, these issues cannot be asserted for the first time on appeal. We agree with O\u2019Quinn.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">The Department of Social Services argued in the circuit court that the decision to award costs was within the discretion of the court, but it \u201cwould not be \u2018just and proper\u2019 \u201d to award costs to O\u2019Quinn. The Department of Social Services did not assert in the circuit court the arguments that it raises here. We will not permit the Department of Social Services to raise these issues for the first time on appeal. Rule 5:25.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Accordingly, we will affirm that portion of the circuit court\u2019s judgment which awards costs to O\u2019Quinn, we will reverse that portion of the judgment which awards attorney\u2019s fees, and we will enter final judgment here.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
