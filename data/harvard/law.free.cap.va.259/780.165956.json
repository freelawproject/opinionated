Commonwealth, </em>Record No. 2130-97-2 (March 2, 1999). <em>See Burks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 18 (1978). We awarded the Commonwealth an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">The evidence of record shows that Andrew Taylor, the victim of the felony, testified that he and a friend named Joseph had \u201cstarted drinking about 6:00 that morning\u201d and had consumed \u201cabout four or five quarts of beer.\u201d Looking across the city street where they were standing, he saw Smith approaching. Speaking to Taylor, Smith said, \u201cI know you are mad ... because I got your wife.\u201d Taylor testified that as he \u201cturned to walk away,\u201d Smith hit him \u201c[rjight here in the stomach.\u201d He said that he \u201chit me again, and I grabbed him, and after that I don\u2019t remember much more than that.\u201d He did \u201cremember walking away from him\u201d and that \u201call of a sudden the lights went out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Taylor remained unconscious until he \u201ccame to\u201d in a hospital emergency room. He said that medical personnel were \u201csewing me in the back.\u201d He explained that he \u201chad knife stabs,\u201d that he was \u201cbleeding,\u201d that he \u201chad to be stitched,\u201d and that some of his wounds were located at the \u201c[sjame spot\u201d where Smith had been \u201chitting\u201d him. Taylor testified on direct examination that he did not see \u201canything in the defendant\u2019s hand\u201d when Smith was hitting him and, again on cross-examination, that \u201c[i]f it was a weapon used, I didn\u2019t see it.\u201d Asked if he had seen any blood, Taylor replied that he had not. In response to counsel\u2019s statement that \u201c[y]ou don\u2019t know that Willard Smith did anything to you other than hit or punch you,\u201d Taylor said, \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Smith moved to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence \u201con a reasonable doubt basis.\u201d The trial judge overruled the motion, and Smith elected to rest. The court found Smith guilty of malicious wounding and imposed a sentence of 20 years imprisonment with execution of 16 years of that sentence suspended during good behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">The Court of Appeals held that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">We have said that \u201cwhere a fact is equally susceptible of two interpretations one of which is consistent with the innocence of the accused, [the trier of fact] cannot arbitrarily adopt that interpretation which incriminates [the accused].\u201d <em>Burton and Conquest v. Commonwealth, </em>108 Va. 892, 899, 62 S.E. 376, 379 (1908). Additionally, \u201cthe burden is upon the Commonwealth to prove the guilt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>of the accused to the exclusion of every reasonable hypothesis consistent with his innocence ....\u201d <em>Spicer v. Commonwealth, </em>156 Va. 971, 973, 157 S.E. 566, 566 (1931). In <em>LaPrade v. Commonwealth, </em>191 Va. 410, 418, 61 S.E.2d 313, 316 (1950), we stated the following principles that are pertinent here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-4\">[I]f the proof relied upon by the Commonwealth is wholly circumstantial, as it here is, then to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt all necessary circumstances proved must be consistent with guilt and inconsistent with innocence. They must overcome the presumption of innocence and exclude all reasonable conclusions inconsistent with that of guilt. To accomplish that, the chain of necessary circumstances must be unbroken and the evidence as a whole must satisfy the guarded judgment that both the corpus delicti and the criminal agency of the accused have been proved to the exclusion of any other rational hypothesis and to a moral certainty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Concerning the identity of the criminal agent, the Commonwealth\u2019s hypothesis relies principally upon the fact that \u201c[t]he victim described at least some of the stab wounds as being in the \u2018same spot[s]\u2019 where the defendant had struck him.\u201d But the evidence, or lack of evidence, supports a different hypothesis.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Taylor testified that Smith attacked him with his fists and that, with respect to that attack, he had seen no weapons or blood indicative of a stabbing attack. Joseph was never called as a witness to contradict that testimony. The record at trial contains no evidence of the time or duration of the fist attack, the length of time Taylor lay unconscious on the sidewalk, or what transpired in the interval of time preceding his arrival at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">The evidence of record supports two hypotheses. First, that the period of unconsciousness resulted from a fist attack that developed into a knife attack by Smith when Taylor started \u201cwalking away from him.\u201d Second, that Taylor\u2019s unconsciousness resulted from his state of intoxication which inspired an unidentified pedestrian present at the scene (or one arriving later) to use a knife to terrorize the victim in order to achieve some ulterior motive. Consequently, the Commonwealth failed \u201cto prove the guilt of the accused to the exclusion of every reasonable hypothesis consistent with his innocence ....\u201d <em>Spicer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>156 Va. at 973, 157 S.E. at 566. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>We agree with the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeals that \u201c[t]he evidence raises no more than a suspicion of Smith\u2019s guilt.\u201d \u201cSuspicion, however, no matter how strong is insufficient to sustain a criminal conviction.\u201d <em>Stover </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 618, 624, 283 S.E.2d 194, 197 (1981). Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b803-16\"> Code \u00a7 18.2-51 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b803-17\">If any person maliciously shoot, stab, cut, or wound any person or by any means cause him bodily injury, with the intent to maim, disfigure, disable, or kill, he shall, except where it is otherwise provided, be guilty of a Class 3 felony.
