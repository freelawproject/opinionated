Williams was tried at a bench trial in the Circuit Court for the City of Richmond and found guilty of the charged offenses. The circuit court fixed his punishment as follows: life imprisonment for the murder conviction, life imprisonment for the robbery conviction, and 20 years imprisonment for the statutory burglary conviction. Williams appealed the circuit court\u2019s judgment to the Court of Appeals, claiming that the circuit court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained from a warrantless search and seizure of his boots that were in the possession of the Sheriff of the City of Richmond. Williams also argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions. The Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Appeals affirmed the judgment of the circuit court, <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>29 Va. App. 297, 512 S.E.2d 133 (1999), and Williams appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">On Sunday morning, November 3, 1996, the victim, Leslie Anne Coughenour, left her home in Henrico County and went to a law office, where she was employed, at 416 West Franklin Street in the City of Richmond. Coughenour had informed her roommate, Andrea Melillo, that Coughenour would return to their home on Sunday evening. When Melillo arrived at their home about 8:00 p.m. that evening, she was concerned because Coughenour was not there. Melillo made a telephone call to Coughenour\u2019s office, but no one answered the telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Around 10:30 p.m., Melillo went to Coughenour\u2019s office, but she was unable to enter the building. Melillo observed Coughenour\u2019s car parked in front of the building. Melillo placed a note on the car, returned to her home, and waited for Coughenour to arrive.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Sometime after midnight, Melillo placed a telephone call to the Richmond Police Department, and it dispatched a police officer who met her at Coughenour\u2019s office around 1:00 a.m. The police officer checked the exterior of the building and found nothing unusual.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">Melillo returned to her home, and she made a telephone call to a friend, who contacted Coughenour\u2019s employer, Carolyn Carpenter. Carpenter met Richmond police officer Charles A. Bishop and another officer at the building about 3:25 a.m. Monday morning, November 4, 1996. When they entered the building, they learned that the office alarm system was not activated. However, an inner set of doors, which should have been locked, was unlocked. The doors to a cabinet were open, and certain items had been removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">The officers walked up a stairway to the second floor of the building. Officer Bishop opened the door to a storage room, examined the room using his flashlight, and found Coughenour\u2019s body situated in a swivel chair, which was tied to a radiator. The body was bound to the chair with two sets of ligatures. The victim\u2019s hands were tied to the chair, and her ankles were also bound. The victim\u2019s head was covered with a scarf. A plastic bag, which contained a rubber ball, had been placed in the victim\u2019s mouth so tightly that the bag filled the entire outer part of the victim\u2019s oral cavity. The victim\u2019s throat had been slashed. The victim\u2019s right wrist had been cut, and a number of tendons and the radial artery had been severed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Carpet on the floor below the victim\u2019s right hand was soaked with blood. The victim had contusions and abrasions to her head and had suffered a hemorrhage to her brain caused by the infliction of blows to the side of her head. She had bruises on her arm. Dr. Glen R. Graben, a medical examiner, testified that the cause of Coughenour\u2019s death was asphyxiation, with bleeding from the wrist as a contributing factor. He opined that her death would have occurred within three to five minutes after the plastic bag had been forced into her mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Melillo testified that when Coughenour left their home about 11:45 a.m. on November 3, she had about ten dollars in cash. She was wearing a gold rope chain bracelet, a gold herringbone necklace, and a gold diamond and sapphire ring. She also wore a diamond earring in her left ear and other assorted earrings in both ears and a \u201cMickey Mouse\u201d watch. She had in her possession a laptop computer and a black and gold Central Fidelity bank card which bore her name. The card could be used to access a joint account that Coughenour and Melillo shared. The police officers did not find any of these items at the murder scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">An examination of the crime scene revealed that a window in a men\u2019s restroom on the second floor of the building had been broken. The window is adjacent to a fire escape. Broken glass from the window had been placed in a trashcan in the restroom. Occupants of the office building testified that the window had not been in that condition on the Friday before Coughenour\u2019s death. Additionally, a hole had been \u201cknocked in\u201d a wall adjoining the room where the victim\u2019s body was found. This damage did not exist on the Friday before the victim\u2019s body was found. Tenants of the building reported that two laptop computers, a computer printer, a black portable compact disc player which contained a compact disc entitled \u201cClassical Cuts,\u201d a Rolodex address and telephone card index, a small pair of Bushnell brand binoculars, a small, folding multi-purpose tool, and $50 in cash were missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The police investigators found an imprint of the bottom of a boot on a plywood wall panel near the top of the stairs on the second floor. Forensic detectives removed this piece of plywood from the wall and forwarded it to a forensic laboratory for an analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">On Saturday night, November 2, 1996, the evening before Coughenour was last seen alive, Cherry A. Wright had a party at her apartment in the Gilpin Court housing development in Richmond. Several persons, including the defendant, attended the party. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>ing to Wright, everyone was \u201cdrinking and doing cocaine.\u201d The defendant became \u201cfrustrated\u201d and \u201cangry\u201d because he did not have any cocaine or money to purchase cocaine. The defendant removed some of his clothing and traded it for $10 or $15 worth of cocaine. Williams left Wright\u2019s apartment at 2:00 a.m., November 3, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Between 10:30 and 11:00 p.m. on November 3, the defendant returned to Wright\u2019s apartment. When she opened the door, the defendant asked if she was alone. When she responded yes, he entered her apartment and told her that he had a box he wished to place in her closet. He also had a \u201cliquor box\u201d and a compact disc player. Williams asked Wright did she \u201cwant to party,\u201d he \u201cpulled out some cocaine,\u201d \u201c[h]e pulled out a watch,\u201d and \u201che had a ring on his finger.\u201d He also had \u201ca wad of money.\u201d The ring that he was wearing looked like the ring that had been taken from Coughenour. The defendant gave Wright $25, a small quantity of cocaine, and a \u201cMickey Mouse\u201d watch which looked like Coughenour\u2019s watch. The portable compact disc player that the defendant had taken to Wright\u2019s apartment was similar to the compact disc player that had been taken from the murder scene, and the compact disc player contained a compact disc entitled \u201cClassical Cuts,\u201d the identical name of the compact disc that had been taken from the murder scene. The defendant also had a small pair of Bushnell brand binoculars and a small hand tool that resembled similar items removed from the building where the murder occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">On Wednesday, November 6, 1996, the defendant returned to Wright\u2019s apartment and told her \u201che was broke and that he needed some more money ... to get high.\u201d He directed her to retrieve the box which he had hidden in her closet. He opened the box, which contained two laptop computers and a computer printer.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Wright\u2019s son, William Wright, found a black and gold Central Fidelity bank card in Wright\u2019s apartment. When the defendant saw that Wright\u2019s son had the card, the defendant took the card and stated that \u201cI thought I got rid of this.\u201d Wright also observed that the defendant had a small card with telephone numbers which resembled the Rolodex address and telephone card that had been taken from the building where the victim worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Cynthia Lafawn Tyler, a resident of the Gilpin Court housing development, saw the defendant \u201ca day or two\u201d after November 2, 1996. The defendant had a compact disc player that she wanted to buy, but the defendant would not sell it to her. The defendant reached in his pocket, \u201cpulled out his own [cocaine] and his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>money. He flashed it.\u201d lyier testified that the defendant\u2019s actions meant that he had his own money and cocaine and that he did not need her money. The defendant had a \u201cMickey Mouse\u201d watch and a ring that looked like the victim\u2019s ring. The defendant asked Tyler to take him to a 7-Eleven store on Chamberlayne Avenue in Richmond because he wanted to use an ATM machine that did not have a video camera that recorded automated transactions. Someone used Coughenour\u2019s ATM card to obtain $300 in cash, from the account the victim shared with Melillo, utilizing ATM machines, including the ATM machine at the 7-Eleven store where Tyler had taken the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Guy Lee Robinson, another resident of the Gilpin Court housing development, gave the defendant $150 worth of cocaine in return for one of the laptop computers and a printer. Robinson saw the \u201cMickey Mouse\u201d watch that the defendant had given to Wright. Later, Robinson\u2019s sister-in-law acquired the watch. Robinson destroyed the watch and threw the computer and printer in a creek when he learned that the defendant may have taken these items from the building where Coughenour\u2019s body was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The defendant was arrested for a parole violation and placed in a jail. When he was released from jail, the defendant had a conversation with Wright. Wright informed him that people in the neighborhood had been talking and asking questions; so she asked him whether he had anything to do with the lawyer. The defendant said \u201cthat it had to do \u2014 [do you] want to know what happened with the lawyer?\u201d Wright said no.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">On November 30, 1996, the defendant was incarcerated at the Richmond City Jail on an unrelated charge. When he was processed as a prisoner, he was relieved of his property, including his clothing, a strip search was conducted, and an inventory was taken of his property. The only items that he was allowed to keep were his socks and underwear.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">In accordance with the Richmond Sheriff\u2019s policies and procedures, each prisoner\u2019s property is placed in a separate bag, and the prisoner\u2019s initials are affixed to the bag. A prisoner does not have free access to the property. Fifteen officers who work in the jail\u2019s quartermaster section have access to any property seized from prisoners. The property is returned to a prisoner when the prisoner is released from custody. Lieutenant Clarence L. Jefferson, a deputy sheriff, testified that prisoners\u2019 shoes are taken from them and prisoners are issued \u201cjail shoes\u201d because hard-sole shoes or street shoes have hard heels which are dangerous to officers and inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Richmond police detective James Hickman received a \u201ctip\u201d that Williams\u2019 boot matched the boot impression that was found at the scene of the crimes. The Richmond Sheriff\u2019s deputies received a request to examine the defendant\u2019s boots from the Richmond police officers. The deputy sheriffs gave the defendant\u2019s boots to the police officers without a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Robert B. Hallett qualified as an expert witness on the subject of shoe print impressions. He conducted tests on the defendant\u2019s boots. Hallett testified that the boot impression on the wall at the murder scene was either made by the defendant\u2019s right boot or a boot that was identical in size, shape, tread pattern, and the locations and configurations of two cuts which had been inflicted on the bottom of the defendant\u2019s boot by sharp objects. Even though there was a deviation in general wear between the boot that left the impression at the crime scene and the boot that was taken from the defendant, Hallett testified that he had never seen two different boots with such identical characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Richmond police detective James Hickman testified that when he served the indictments upon the defendant, the defendant stated that he had been in New York from October through the end of December 1996. Richmond police sergeant Gary Keith Ladin, however, testified that he saw the defendant in Richmond on November 29, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Keitha Lasha Thomas, the defendant\u2019s girlfriend, testified that while she was incarcerated at a correctional facility in Goochland County, the defendant sent a letter to her describing his crimes. The defendant stated, in the letter, that he entered the building where the victim worked when it was \u201cdark outside\u201d and that the victim arrived when \u201cit had got[ten] light.\u201d The defendant told Thomas that he had taken some computers, the victim\u2019s ring, and a bank card because she did not have much money. The defendant stated that \u201che tried to smother the bitch but the bitch wouldn\u2019t die fast enough.\u201d He stated that \u201che cut her throat. Then he went on to say he cut her wrists.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">The defendant testified that he did not commit the crimes, but admitted possession of some of the stolen property. He claimed that he obtained the stolen property and the boots from a man whom he identified as Mark Cromartie. The defendant denied that he told Detective Hickman that he had been in New York from October through December and insisted that he had said he had been in New York until the end of November instead. The defendant also admitted that he acquired money to purchase drugs by committing \u201cB&amp;E[sj.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>HI.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">The defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence related to the examination of his boot. He argued that the Richmond police officers violated his rights guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment when the officers obtained his boots from the Richmond Sheriff and conducted tests on the boots. The circuit court denied the defendant\u2019s motion, and the Court of Appeals agreed with the circuit court\u2019s ruling. The defendant makes the same argument on appeal. We disagree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Initially, we observe that the Fourth Amendment protects the privacy interests of persons. <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 350-51 (1967). In <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>United States, </em>466 U.S. 170, 177 (1984), the Supreme Court stated that: \u201c[s]ince <em>Katz </em>. . . the touchstone of [Fourth] Amendment analysis has been the question whether a person has a \u2018constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 360 (Harlan, J., concurring). The Amendment does not protect the merely subjective expectation of privacy, but only those \u2018expectation^] that society is prepared to recognize as \u201creasonable.\u201d \u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 361.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>415 U.S. 800 (1974), the Supreme Court considered whether the Fourth Amendment required that police officers obtain a search warrant before searching an arrestee\u2019s clothing. Edwards was lawfully arrested and charged with attempting to break into a post office. He was taken to a local jail. An investigation revealed that the perpetrator of the crime for which Edwards was charged had attempted to gain entry into the post office through a wooden window which had been pried with a pry bar, thereby causing paint chips to fall on a window sill and a wire mesh screen. <em>Edwards, </em>415 U.S. at 801-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Edwards spent the night in the jail. The next morning, jail officials seized the clothing that he had been wearing at the time of and since his arrest and held the clothing as evidence. Examination of the clothing revealed paint chips that matched the samples taken from the post office window. Edwards\u2019 clothing and evidence of the paint chips were admitted in evidence at trial over Edwards\u2019 objection. <em>Id. </em>at 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">The Supreme Court, approving the admission of the evidence without a search warrant, held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">\u201cWith or without probable cause, the authorities were entitled at that point [in the booking process] not only to search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Edwards\u2019 clothing but also to take it from him and keep it in official custody. There was testimony that this was the standard practice in this city. The police were also entitled to take from Edwards any evidence of the crime in his immediate possession, including his clothing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 804-05. Moreover, the Supreme Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">\u201cIndeed, it is difficult to perceive what is unreasonable about the police\u2019s examining and holding as evidence those personal effects of the accused that they already have in their lawful custody as the result of a lawful arrest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 806. Concluding, the Supreme Court stated in Edwards:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">\u201c \u2018While the legal arrest of a person should not destroy the privacy of his premises, it does \u2014 for at least a reasonable time and to a reasonable extent \u2014 take his own privacy out of the realm of protection from police interest in weapons, means of escape, and evidence.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 808-09 (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>DeLeo, </em>422 F.2d 487, 493 (1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">We conclude that the defendant, Williams, had no expectation of privacy in his boots that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable. The boots were in the custody of the Richmond City Sheriff pursuant to administrative booking policies and procedures. We hold that when a person, such as the defendant, has been lawfully arrested and his property has been lawfully seized by law enforcement personnel pursuant to that arrest, the arrestee has no reasonable expectation of privacy in that property, and later examination of the property by another law enforcement official does not violate the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>28 F.3d 981, 983 (9th Cir. 1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 1158 (1995) (postal service inspector\u2019s removal of a cap without a warrant from defendant\u2019s property bag at a jail does not violate the defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights because initial search and seizure of defendant\u2019s personal items was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>lawful); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>837 F.2d 673, 676 (5th Cir. 1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 832 (1988) (subsequent inspection of keys by a federal agent did not unduly intrude upon defendant\u2019s expectation of privacy when police lawfully viewed the keys earlier at the time of inventory); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>820 F.2d 1065, 1072 (9th Cir. 1987); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Burnette, </em>698 F.2d 1038, 1049 (9th Cir. 1983), <em>cert. denied </em>461 U.S. 936 (1983) (\u201conce an item in an individual\u2019s possession has been lawfully seized and searched, subsequent searches of that item, so long as it remains in the legitimate uninterrupted possession of the police, may be conducted without a warrant\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>607 F.2d 808, 809-10 (8th Cir. 1979); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Oaxaca, </em>569 F.2d 518, 524 (9th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 926 (1978) (seizure of defendant\u2019s shoes six weeks after his arrest while defendant was still in custody at the county jail did not violate defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>496 F.2d 57, 73 (2nd Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 925 (1975) (federal agent can view money to compare serial numbers when police seized the money after arresting defendant on unrelated state charges and kept money in an envelope in a jail safe for safekeeping apart from defendant\u2019s other belongings); <em>State </em>v. <em>Copridge, </em>918 P.2d 1247, 1251 (Kan. 1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>519 A.2d 289, 292 (N.H. 1986); <em>Contreras </em>v. <em>State, </em>838 S.W.2d 594, 597 (Tex. App. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Williams argues that the evidence is insufficient to support his convictions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Applying well-established principles of appellate review, we must consider the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party below. <em>Phan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 506, 508, 521 S.E.2d 282, 282 (1999); <em>Derr </em>v. <em>Commonwealth </em>242 Va. 413, 424, 410 S.E.2d 662, 668 (1991). The burden is upon the Commonwealth, however, to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the perpetrator of these crimes. <em>Phan, </em>258 Va. at 511, 521 S.E.2d at 284. Additionally, circumstantial evidence is as competent, and entitled to the same weight, as direct testimony, if that circumstantial evidence is sufficiently convincing. <em>Epperly </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 214, 228, 294 S.E.2d 882, 890 (1982); <em>Stamper </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 260, 272, 257 S.E.2d 808, 817 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 972 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>The evidence, which is summarized in Part II of this opinion, and which we need not repeat here, was sufficient to permit the circuit court to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the perpetrator of these crimes. Moreover, as we have already stated, the defendant admitted to Thomas that he killed Coughenour and he asked Wright if she wanted to know how the murder occurred. The defendant admitted that he often committed \u201cB&amp;E[s]\u201d when he needed money to purchase cocaine. The defendant possessed property taken from the scene of the murder soon after the crimes occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">We find no merit in the defendant\u2019s remaining arguments. For the reasons stated, we will affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b408-11\"> We find no merit in Williams\u2019 argument that <em>Edwards </em>is not controlling because the clothing examined in <em>Edwards </em>related to the charge for which Edwards had been arrested. This distinction is legally insignificant because the dispositive inquiry remains whether the defendant, Williams, had an expectation of privacy in the seized items. The defendant had no such expectation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
