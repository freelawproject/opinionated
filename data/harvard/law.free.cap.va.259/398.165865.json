(Pardoe), a real estate brokerage firm. Schulz alleged that Pardoe intentionally interfered with Schulz\u2019s contractual relationship with Lake Manassas Limited Partnership (the developer), and prevented Schulz from constructing homes in the developer\u2019s residential subdivision in Prince William County known as Lake Manassas.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Pardoe filed a counterclaim against Schulz, alleging that Schulz owed Pardoe a 6% commission, or in the alternative, a 2.5% commission, on Schulz\u2019s sale of a custom home to Edward and Paula A. Carlton. Schulz built the home for the Carltons on a lot in Lake Manassas that they had owned for about two years before their home was constructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The following evidence was presented in a jury trial. In 1992, Dale K. Schulz, who was president of Schulz, signed a document entitled \u201cApproved Speculative Builder Application and Agreement\u201d (Builder Application). This document set forth the requirements for builders seeking to be \u201capproved\u201d by Lake Manassas\u2019 owner to purchase lots and construct homes in the development for sale to the public.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Under Paragraph 5 of the Builder Application, Schulz agreed that when it purchased a lot in Lake Manassas for the purpose of constructing a \u201cspeculative\u201d home, Schulz would sign a six-month exclusive listing agreement with the developer\u2019s designated sales agent, Pardoe. This paragraph further provided that Schulz would pay Pardoe a 6% commission on the sale of a \u201cspeculative\u201d home that Schulz constructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">Warren B. Watkins, the developer\u2019s project director, testified that an amendment to the Builder Application form (Application Amendment) was presented to the approved builders, including Schulz, and discussed at a meeting in November 1993. Under the Application Amendment, Pardoe was entitled to a 2.5% commission when an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>\u201capproved\u201d builder constructed a custom home on a lot in Lake Manassas already owned by the purchaser of the home. Schulz did not sign the Application Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">In November 1994, Schulz entered into a contract with the Carltons to construct a home on their lot in Lake Manassas. Edward Carlton testified that when he and his wife decided to build a home on their lot, they went to the developer\u2019s on-site sales office that was staffed by Pardoe\u2019s agent, David Johnson. Johnson directed the Carltons into a room where there were displays containing photographs and descriptions of home models offered by the various \u201capproved\u201d builders. The Carltons solicited bids from three of the \u201capproved\u201d builders and ultimately selected Schulz to construct their custom home.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Johnson testified that at the time Schulz and the Carltons entered into their contract, he spoke with Dale Schulz and indicated that he would send a document entitled \u201cReport of Sale and Commission Earned\u201d to Dale Schulz for his signature. This document contained an acknowledgement that Schulz would pay a 2.5% commission to Pardoe based on the final price of the Carltons\u2019 home. Johnson testified that Dale Schulz told him that there was \u201cno need\u201d to send the document, since Schulz recognized Johnson as the agent and agreed to \u201chonor the builder\u2019s agreement\u201d and to pay the commission. Since he believed that he had a \u201cgood working relationship\u201d with Schulz, Johnson made a notation on the document that he had talked with Dale Schulz and did not obtain his signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Contrary to Johnson\u2019s testimony, Dale Schulz testified that he never agreed to pay Pardoe a commission on the home Schulz sold to the Carltons. He also stated that he recalled receiving a document entitled \u201cReport of Sale and Commission Earned,\u201d which was prepared by Johnson, but \u201cdidn\u2019t take any action\u201d after receiving the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">At the close of the evidence, the jury was instructed, among other things, that a \u201ccontract is an agreement, either written or oral, for consideration, between two or more parties.\u201d The jury returned a verdict in favor of Pardoe on its counterclaim against Schulz and awarded Pardoe damages in the amount of $12,088.13, which was equal to 2.5% of the price that the Carltons paid Schulz for construction of their home.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">Schulz filed a motion to set aside the jury verdict on the counterclaim on the ground that the statute of frauds barred Pardoe\u2019s \u201cclaim for a real estate commission.\u201d The trial court issued an opinion letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>in which it ruled that Pardoe\u2019s counterclaim against Schulz \u201cis a claim for a real estate commission and is subject to \u00a7 11-2 of the Code of Virginia (the statute of frauds).\u201d Holding that Schulz had not signed a written document entitling Pardoe to a commission on the Carlton home, the court entered a final order setting aside the jury verdict on the counterclaim and awarding judgment in favor of Schulz on that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">On appeal, Pardoe argues that the oral contract on which the jury verdict was based was not an \u201cagreement or contract for services to be performed in the sale of real estate,\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 11-2(7). Thus, Pardoe contends that the statute of frauds did not bar Pardoe from recovering damages based on that oral agreement to pay Pardoe a commission on the sale to the Carltons. Pardoe also asserts that since this oral agreement was not subject to the statute of frauds, the trial court erred in concluding that the evidence did not support the jury verdict on the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">In response, Schulz does not dispute the jury\u2019s finding that there was an oral contract but argues that the contract was unenforceable based on the statute of frauds because it related to the sale of a house to be affixed to land. Schulz asserts that in the absence of written documentation of an agreement by Schulz to pay Pardoe a commission on that sale, Code \u00a7 11-2(7) barred Pardoe\u2019s claim and the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support the jury verdict on the counterclaim. We disagree with Schulz\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The General Assembly codified the statute of frauds in Code \u00a7 11-2, which states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-7\">Unless a promise, contract, agreement, representation, assurance, or ratification, or some memorandum or note thereof, is in writing and signed by the party to be charged or his agent, no action shall be brought in any of the following cases:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-8\">6. Upon any contract for the sale of real estate, or for the lease thereof for more than a year;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-9\">7. Upon any agreement or contract for services to be performed in the sale of real estate by a party defined in \u00a7 54.1-2100 or \u00a754.1-2101;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">In applying the language of Code \u00a7 11-2(7), we must answer the question whether Pardoe\u2019s oral contract with Schulz was an \u201cagreement or contract for services to be performed in the sale of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>real estate by a party defined in \u00a7 54.1-2100 or \u00a7 54.1-2101.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We first observe that Code \u00a7 11-2 does not define the term \u201creal estate.\u201d Further, while Code \u00a7\u00a7 54.1-2100 and -2101 define the terms <em>\u201creal estate </em>broker\u201d and <em>\u201creal estate salesperson\u201d </em>in the context of statutory provisions regulating those occupations, the term <em>\u201creal estate\u201d </em>also is not defined in Title 54.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, we turn to the general definition of \u201creal estate\u201d in Code \u00a7 1-13.12, which provides in material part: \u201c[T]he words \u2018real estate\u2019 shall be construed to include lands, tenements and hereditaments, and all rights and appurtenances thereto and interests therein, other than a chattel interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">The word \u201ctenement\u201d means either an estate or holding of land, or a house or other building used as a residence. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1480 (7th ed. 1999); <em>see </em>1 Raleigh Colston Minor &amp; Frederick Deane Goodwin Ribble, <em>The Law of Real Property </em>\u00a7 17 (2d ed. 1928). The term \u201chereditament,\u201d in general, signifies any interest in real property that may be inherited by an owner\u2019s heirs. <em>See </em>1 Raleigh Colston Minor &amp; Frederick Deane Goodwin Ribble, <em>The Law of Real Property </em>at \u00a7 17; Caroline N. Brown, 4 <em>Corbin on Contracts </em>\u00a7 17.1 (rev. ed. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The words used in Code \u00a7 1-13.12 to define the term \u201creal estate\u201d plainly do not encompass a building that is unattached to land. Since construction of the Carlton home had not begun at the time of the oral contract between Pardoe and Schulz, the home was neither an \u201cappurtenance\u201d to land nor a \u201ctenement,\u201d within the meaning of the statutory definition. We hold that under the definition of \u201creal estate\u201d in Code \u00a7 1-13.12, a \u201ccontract for services to be performed in the sale of real estate,\u201d as contemplated by Code \u00a7 11-2(7), does not include an agreement such as the oral contract between Pardoe and Schulz. Thus, an oral contract providing for a sales commission is not subject to the statute of frauds when that contract is based on the sale of a house to be affixed to land that does not include a contemporaneous sale of the land to which the house will be attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Our conclusion is in accord with other authorities that have considered this subject. Generally, \u201ccontracts to erect buildings or other structures upon land are not within the [s]tatute [of frauds], <em>although the structures when completed will be real estate.\u201d 9 </em>Samuel Williston &amp; Richard A. Lord, <em>A Treatise on the Law of Con</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number><em>tracts </em>\u00a7 25:15 (4th ed. 1999) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>Caroline N. Brown, 4 <em>Corbin on Contracts </em>\u00a7 17.1 (rev. ed. 1997); <em>Hastings </em>v. <em>Matlock, </em>171 Cal. App. 3d 826, 836-7 (Cal. Ct. App. 1985); <em>McCaffrey </em>v. <em>Strainer, </em>439 N.Y.S. 2d 773, 774 (N.Y. App. Div. 1981). Thus, since Pardoe\u2019s counterclaim did not require proof of a writing executed by Schulz obligating it to pay a commission on the sale of a home to the Carltons, we hold that the trial court erred in concluding that the statute of frauds barred Pardoe\u2019s recovery of damages under an oral contract.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">For these reasons, we will reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment setting aside the jury verdict on the counterclaim and enter final judgment for Pardoe on the counterclaim in accordance with the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b422-9\"> The claims set forth in Schulz\u2019s motion for judgment are not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b422-10\"> At the time Schulz signed the \u201cApproved Speculative Builder Application and Agreement,\u201d Lake Manassas was owned by D.C. Land Group, Ltd. The developer later succeeded D.C. Land Group, Ltd. as the owner of the project.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b425-7\"> The terms \u201creal estate broker\u201d and \u201creal estate salesperson\u201d are not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b426-6\"> The trial court\u2019s final order set aside the jury verdict on the counterclaim \u201cupon the grounds assigned by [Schulz] as being contrary to the law and the evidence in this case and without evidence to support it.\u201d The grounds Schulz raised in the trial court exclusively addressed the issue of the statute of frauds and the absence of any written document containing an agreement by Schulz to pay a real estate commission on the sale of the home to the Carltons. Schulz did not argue in the trial court that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding of an oral contract between Pardoe and Schulz and, as noted above, Schulz has not raised this argument on appeal. Thus, we do not address the sufficiency of the evidence apart from our holding above.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
