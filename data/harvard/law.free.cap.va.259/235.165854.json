Because we conclude that there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the circuit court\u2019s judgment that the acquittee does not satisfy the requirements for conditional release, we will affirm that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Brigitte Daniele Mercer was found not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI) on charges of carjacking, grand larceny, maiming, and robbery. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-182.2,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the circuit court remanded Mercer to the custody of the Commissioner of the Department of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse Services (the Commissioner). In January 1997, the court conditionally released her from custody pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-182.7.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the circuit court required Mercer to undergo a 30-day inpatient evaluation in June 1997 after Mercer claimed that she had been raped and had sustained a stab wound to her thigh. The court eventually recommitted Mercer to the custody of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Mercer next appeared before the circuit court on August 25, 1998, pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-182.5,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for the purpose of determining whether she continued to need inpatient hospitalization. At that hearing, the court heard testimony from two expert witnesses, Evan S. Nelson, Ph.D., a licensed clinical psychologist, and Christine A. Bryant, Psy.D., also a licensed clinical psychologist. Both experts examined Mercer prior to the hearing and submitted written reports to the court pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-182.5(B). Based on their evaluations, Dr. Bryant and Dr. Nelson opined that Mercer suffers from antisocial personality disorder (APD) and polysubstance dependence (PSD). However, they expressed differing opinions with regard to whether either APD or PSD falls within the definition of a mental illness in Code \u00a7 37.1-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Relying primarily on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (4th ed. 1994) (DSM-IV), Dr. Bryant testified that both APD and PSD are mental illnesses. She described APD as being \u201cthe disregard for authority or for social rules and mores,\u201d and defined PSD as the addiction to multiple drugs. According to Dr. Bryant, Mercer has been \u201cdrug free\u201d only during her periods of hospitalization. With regard to Mercer\u2019s risk of harm to other persons, Dr. Bryant stated that Mercer\u2019s history of aggressive behavior, demonstrated by her \u201cextensive legal history,\u201d was one of several risk factors requiring continued inpatient hospitalization. Dr. Bryant believed that Mercer \u201ccontinues to be a risk for future aggressive behavior,\u201d and that she cannot be adequately controlled as an outpatient.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Dr. Nelson did not categorize Mercer\u2019s APD as a mental disease or illness. Instead, he drew a distinction between the multiaxial diagnostic system in the DSM-IY, upon which Dr. Bryant relied, and the conditions that courts may consider to be mental illnesses under the Code. However, Dr. Nelson seemingly contradicted himself because he also testified that, under the Code, both APD and PSD are considered mental diseases. He admitted that if the court believed Mercer is mentally ill, continued commitment is warranted. Like Dr. Bryant, Dr. Nelson also believed that Mercer poses a \u201cvery, very high risk\u201d for future dangerousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Based on this evidence, the circuit court found that Mercer suffers from a mental illness because of her history of drug abuse and addiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court concluded \u201cthat Mercer does not meet the conditions for conditional release . . . because: 1) Mercer is mentally ill and in need of inpatient hospitalization; 2) it is highly probable that Mercer will violate the terms of the conditional release; 3) her conditional release will present an undue risk to public safety.\u201d We awarded Mercer this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Mercer acknowledges on brief that the sole issue before the Court is whether APD and PSD are mental illnesses. She relies on <em>Foucha v. Louisiana, </em>504 U.S. 71 (1992), in arguing that APD can never be classified as a mental illness. Mercer further contends that PSD is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>a mental illness because, according to her, the definition of the term <em>\u201c[m]entally ill\u201d </em>in Code \u00a7 37.1-1 expressly excludes drug addiction and alcoholism from its purview for the purpose of determining if an NGRI acquittee should remain in the custody of the Commissioner. Therefore, she asserts that Dr. Bryant\u2019s testimony that PSD is a mental illness was insufficient, as a matter of law, to support the circuit court\u2019s finding that Mercer suffers from a mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">The Commonwealth argues that Mercer misconstrues the decision in <em>Foucha </em>as well as Code \u00a7 37.1-1, and that, at any rate, this Court\u2019s focus should be on PSD, not APD, since the circuit court did not base its decision on Mercer\u2019s APD. The Commonwealth finally asserts that the question whether an individual suffers from a mental illness is a factual determination to be made by the court after hearing the testimony of mental health experts. We agree with the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">As a preliminary matter, we note that the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Foucha </em>did not, as Mercer argues, state that APD can never, as a matter of law, be classified as a mental illness. Rather, the Court held that a finding of both mental illness and future dangerousness must be present in order to continue the confinement of an NGRI acquittee. <em>Foucha, </em>504 U.S. at 80. In that case, there was no medical evidence that Foucha was mentally ill at the time of his hearing, although the testimony regarding his future dangerousness was uncontested. <em>Id. </em>at 74-75. The government in <em>Foucha </em>did not argue that Foucha\u2019s APD was a mental illness; rather, it relied on the trial court\u2019s finding that the APD made Foucha a danger \u201cto himself or others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78. Thus, the Supreme Court did not decide in <em>Foucha </em>whether APD is a mental illness, but simply affirmed the principle that a state cannot confine an individual with a mental illness absent a showing by clear and convincing evidence \u201cthat the individual is mentally ill and dangerous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 80 (quoting <em>Jones v. United States, </em>463 U.S. 354, 362 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">However, as the Commonwealth points out, the circuit court in the present case did not rest its decision on Mercer\u2019s APD, but instead focused on her PSD. Accordingly, we will now address that diagnosis and the circuit court\u2019s analysis of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">As already noted, Mercer argues that Code \u00a7 37.1-1 expressly excludes drug addicts,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and thus individuals with PSD, from the defi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>nition of <em>\u201c/mjentally </em>ill\u201d when deciding whether to continue the confinement of an NGRI acquittee. That Code section provides, in pertinent part, \u201cthat for the purposes of Chapter 2 (\u00a7 37.1-63 <em>et seq.) </em>of this title, the term \u2018mentally ill\u2019 shall be deemed to include any person who is a drug addict or alcoholic.\u201d According to Mercer, this language means that neither drug addiction nor alcoholism can serve as the basis for a finding of mental illness except for the purposes of Chapter 2. <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">The language of Code \u00a7 37.1-1 does not squarely address the question whether PSD qualifies as a mental illness for purposes other than Chapter 2, such as satisfying the standard for Mercer\u2019s continued commitment as an NGRI acquittee. In other words, it neither compels nor forbids a finding of mental illness based on PSD in situations that are not covered by Chapter 2. However, we believe that it would strain credulity to say, as Mercer suggests, that PSD qualifies as a mental illness when deciding whether to voluntarily or involuntarily admit an individual who has not committed an unlawful act to a hospital for treatment, but is never a mental illness when determining whether to continue the inpatient hospitalization of an NGRI acquittee.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Instead of focusing solely on the definition of <em>\u201c[mjentally </em>ill\u201d in Code \u00a7 37.1-1, we believe that the analysis should include the provisions of Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-182.3 and -182.5, which set forth the criteria that must be satisfied in order to continue Mercer\u2019s commitment to the custody of the Commissioner. Specifically, Code \u00a7 19.2-182.5 provides that the court can retain an NGRI acquittee in the custody of the Commissioner if the acquittee \u201ccontinues to require inpatient hospitalization based on consideration of the factors set forth in \u00a7 19.2-182.3.\u201d Under Code \u00a7 19.2-182.3, \u201cmental illness includes any mental illness, as this term is defined in \u00a7 37.1-1, <em>in a state of remission </em>when the illness may, with reasonable probability, become active.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In contrast, the definition of <em>\u201c[mjentally ill\u201d </em>in Code \u00a7 37.1-1 does not include the phrase \u201cin a state of remission.\u201d Thus the term \u201cmental illness\u201d in Code \u00a7 19.2-182.3 is not limited solely to the definition of <em>\u201c[mjentally ill\u201d </em>in Code \u00a737.1-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Code \u00a7 19.2-182.3 also establishes four factors that the circuit court had to consider in determining whether to continue Mercer\u2019s commitment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">1. To what extent the acquittee is mentally ill or mentally retarded, as those terms are defined in \u00a7 37.1-1;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">2. The likelihood that the acquittee will engage in conduct presenting a substantial risk of bodily harm to other persons or to himself in the foreseeable future;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">3. The likelihood that the acquittee can be adequately controlled with supervision and treatment on an outpatient basis; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\">4. Such other factors as the court deems relevant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">In <em>Kansas v. Hendricks, </em>521 U.S. 346 (1997), the Supreme Court of the United States acknowledged that it had never \u201crequired State legislatures to adopt any particular nomenclature in drafting civil commitment statutes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359. Instead, the Court \u201cleft to legislators the task of defining terms of a medical nature that have legal significance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consequently, the Court recognized that states have \u201cdeveloped numerous specialized terms to define mental health concepts\u201d and that those \u201cdefinitions do not fit precisely with the definitions employed by the medical community.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">Accordingly, we conclude that the determination with regard to whether Mercer suffers from a mental illness, and therefore should continue to be committed to the custody of the Commissioner, is a question of fact to be resolved by the trial court based upon consideration of the relevant Code provisions, and the report and testimony of mental health experts. The circuit court in this case heard testimony from Dr. Bryant and Dr. Nelson, and also had the benefit of their written reports. While the experts agreed that Mercer still presents a high risk of engaging in aggressive behavior and harming others, they disagreed about whether Mercer is mentally ill. Thus, the circuit court had to resolve that conflict in the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">There are several established principles that guide our review of the circuit court\u2019s resolution of the conflict in the testimony of the two witnesses. \u201cConflicting expert opinions constitute a question of fact . . . .\u201d <em>McCaskey </em>v. <em>Patrick Henry Hospital, </em>225 Va. 413, 415, 304 S.E.2d 1, 2 (1983). It is within the province of the finder of fact \u201cto assess the credibility of the witnesses and the probative value to be given their testimony.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Richardson, </em>242 Va. 242, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>246, 409 S.E.2d 148, 151 (1991). The factual determinations of the trial court, like those of a jury, are binding on this Court, and we will reverse such findings \u201conly if they are plainly wrong or without evidence to support them.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Considering the evidence in this case in light of these established principles, we conclude that the circuit court correctly determined that Mercer continues to need inpatient hospitalization in accordance with the terms of Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-182.3 and -182.5. There is evidence in the record to support the court\u2019s conclusion that Mercer suffers from a mental illness and presents a substantial risk of bodily harm to other persons because of her long history of drug abuse, drug addiction, and violence. Although not dispositive of the issue before us, it is significant that the circuit court also found that Mercer meets the definition of the term <em>\u201c[d]rug </em>addict\u201d in Code \u00a737.1-1. Finally, Dr. Bryant and Dr. Nelson disagreed only with regard to whether PSD is a mental illness. In resolving that conflict, the circuit court is not necessarily bound by the definitions employed by the medical profession. <em>See Hendricks, </em>521 U.S. at 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">For these reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-7\"> Code \u00a7 19.2-182.2 requires, in pertinent part, that a person acquitted by reason of insanity shall be placed in the temporary custody of the Commissioner of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse Services \u201cfor evaluation as to whether the acquittee may be released with or without conditions or requires commitment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b260-8\"> Code \u00a7 19.2-182.7 provides that upon consideration of an NGRI acquittee\u2019s need for inpatient hospitalization, the acquittee must be conditionally released if the court finds that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">(i) based on consideration of the factors which the court must consider in its commitment decision, he does not need inpatient hospitalization but needs outpatient treatment or monitoring to prevent his condition from deteriorating to a degree that he would need inpatient hospitalization; (ii) appropriate outpatient supervision and treatment are reasonably available; (iii) there is significant reason to believe that the acquittee, if conditionally released, would comply with the conditions specified; and (iv) conditional release will not present an undue risk to public safety.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b260-10\"> Code \u00a7 19.2-182.5(A) requires that a \u201ccommitting court shall conduct a hearing twelve months after the date of commitment to assess each confined acquittee\u2019s need for inpatient hospitalization.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b261-9\"> The circuit court did not rest its decision on Mercer\u2019s APD.
