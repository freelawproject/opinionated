The Taxpayers sought a declaration that the County lacked the authority to extend coverage to the newly defined category of domestic partners under its self-funded health insurance benefits plan. The Taxpayers also sought to enjoin the County from implementing the provision of benefits to domestic partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Holding that \u201cArlington County\u2019s coverage for domestic partners in its self-funded health benefit plan for County employees violates the Dillon Rule,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the trial court granted the Taxpayers\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denied the County\u2019s motion. We awarded the County this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">The record shows that in an <em>Employee Relations Benefits Newsletter, </em>issued in May 1997, the County announced that, effective July 1, 1997, \u201c[tjhe definition of eligible dependents has been expanded under the [County\u2019s self-funded] health plan\u201d to allow \u201cfor coverage of one adult dependent, who can be [an employee\u2019s] spouse, domestic partner, or other adult who is claimed as a dependent on [the employee\u2019s] federal income tax return.\u201d The <em>Newsletter </em>listed eight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>criteria in defining an \u201cadult dependent\u201d as \u201c[t]he domestic partner ... who\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-5\">- has resided with the employee for a 1 year period;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">- shares with the employee the common necessities of life and basic living expenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-7\">- is financially interdependent with the employee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-8\">- is involved with the employee in a mutually exclusive relationship of support and commitment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-9\">- is not related by blood to the employee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-10\">- is not married to anyone;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-11\">- was mentally competent at time of consent to relationship;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-12\">- is 18 years of age or older.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-13\">A stipulation entered into by the parties states that \u201c[a] \u2018domestic partner\u2019 eligible for coverage as an adult dependent of a County employee under the County\u2019s health benefits plan may be either a same-sex or opposite-sex domestic partner of a County employee,\u201d that \u201c[a]n employee applying for domestic partner coverage must certify that the employee and the domestic partner meet the criteria established by the County,\u201d and that \u201c[t]here are individuals who currently are covered as domestic partners of County employees under the County\u2019s health benefits plan, and who have received benefits under the plan.\u201d It was also stipulated that \u201c[fjunds used by Arlington County to provide health benefits coverage for County employees and their adult dependents under the County\u2019s self-funded plan include local tax dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-14\">Citing Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.2-1517(A) and 51.1-801, the County correctly points out that \u201c[t]he General Assembly specifically authorizes a local government to provide self-funded health benefit programs for its employees and their dependents.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The County notes that neither statute defines the term \u201cdependent\u201d or refers to other statutory provisions that define the term for different purposes. Continuing, the County further notes that no express statutory provision specifies which employee dependents are eligible to participate in a locality\u2019s self-funded health benefits plan or by what method their eligibility is to be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Under these circumstances, the County correctly maintains, \u201c[t]he power to determine who is an employee\u2019s dependent ... is fairly and necessarily implied.\u201d Furthermore, the County asserts, \u201cthe locality must make [the] determination itself\u201d; indeed, it \u201ccould not carry out its authority without exercising its discretion.\u201d In the process, the County submits, the term \u201cdependent\u201d should be given its plain and ordinary meaning as one \u201c[rjelying on ... the aid of another for support.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>The American Heritage Dictionary </em>501 (2nd College Ed. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">In the end, the County opines, the \u201cappropriate inquiry is whether [its] decision to include domestic partners as dependents in its plan is a reasonable method of implementing its authority.\u201d This inquiry, the County concludes, must be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-5\">Under Dillon\u2019s Rule, [local governing bodies] have only those powers which are expressly granted by the state legislature, those powers fairly or necessarily implied from expressly granted powers, and those powers which are essential and indispensable. Where the state legislature grants a local government the power to do something but does not specifically direct the method of implementing that power, the choice made by the local government as to how to implement the conferred power will be upheld as long as the method selected is reasonable. Any doubt in the reasonableness of the method selected is resolved in favor of the locality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-6\"><em>City of Virginia Beach </em>v. <em>Hay, </em>258 Va. 217, 221, 518 S.E.2d 314, 316 (1999) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">In light of these principles, we must decide whether the County\u2019s inclusion of domestic partners as defined by the County is a reasonable implementation of the County\u2019s authority to define an employee\u2019s dependent for purposes of coverage in the County\u2019s self-funded health benefits plan pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.2-1517(A) and 51.1-801. For the reasons that follow and giving the County the ben<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>efit of any doubt, we conclude that the County\u2019s definition of dependent is not reasonable and, therefore, violates the Dillon Rule.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">In 1997, responding to an inquiry from a member of the General Assembly, the Attorney General issued an opinion that the statutory scheme which permits local governments \u201cto provide for their officers and employees [self-funded] group life, accident, and health insurance programs ... [does not] contain any language from which a general legislative intent to extend insurance coverage to persons within the definition of \u2018domestic partner\u2019 may be inferred.\u201d 1997 Op. Va. Att\u2019y Gen. 130, 131-32. Citing prior interpretations applying the Dillon Rule and its corollary to the statutes at issue, <em>id. </em>at 131 n.8, the Attorney General concluded that \u201c[i]n the absence of any statutory authority indicating an intent to permit a local governing body to extend health insurance coverage provided employees to persons other than the spouse, children or dependents of the employee ... a county lacks the power to provide such coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 132. In reaching this conclusion, the Attorney General expressly noted that the requirement that the employee be \u201cfinancially interdependent\u201d with the \u201cdomestic partner\u201d was contrary to the established definition of a \u201cdependent\u201d as one who \u201cmust receive from the taxpayer over half of his or her support for the calendar year.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The County\u2019s benefit plan extends coverage to a County employee and one other adult, who may be the employee\u2019s spouse, another adult who is properly claimed as a dependent on the employee\u2019s federal tax return, or the employee\u2019s \u201cdomestic partner.\u201d The County\u2019s definition of \u201cdomestic partner\u201d includes eight criteria. Only two of these criteria address financial dependency \u2014 sharing expenses and being \u201cfinancially interdependent.\u201d Neither of these criteria is synonymous with \u201cfinancially dependent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">The inclusion of a spouse as a dependent for the purpose of coverage under the County\u2019s benefit plan does not eliminate the significance of this distinction. It is a matter of common knowledge and experience that a spouse may or may not be financially dependent on the employee-spouse. However, including a spouse as a dependent for coverage such as this is of such long standing that, even in the absence of financial dependence, there can be no dispute that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>General Assembly contemplated that a spouse would be included for coverage under local benefit plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">It is, nevertheless, equally clear that the General Assembly in leaving the definition of dependent to the local governing bodies which adopt self-funded health insurance benefit plans did not contemplate adoption of a definition that does not require some aspect of financial dependence rather than mere financial interdependence. This is the essential position of the Attorney General\u2019s opinion cited above and, in our view, it is sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Considering Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.2-1517(A) and 51.1-801 and the Attorney General\u2019s opinion, we are of opinion that the expanded definition of dependents eligible to receive coverage under the self-funded health insurance benefits plan adopted by the County is not a reasonable method of implementing its implied authority under those statutes and is, therefore, an <em>ultra vires </em>act. Accordingly, the judgment below will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b732-10\"> \u201c[T]he powers of boards of supervisors are fixed by statute and are limited to those conferred expressly or by necessary implication.\u201d <em>Board of Supervisors v. Horne, </em>216 Va 113, 117, 215 S.E.2d 453, 455 (1975). This rule is corollary to the Dillon Rule that municipal corporations are similarly limited in their powers. <em>Id. </em>at 117, 215 S.E.2d at 455-56.

Moreover, as a term of art, a \u201clegal dependent\u201d is defined as \u201c[a] person who is dependent according to law; a person who derives <em>principal support </em>from another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Nevertheless, these definitions do not control our resolution of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b735-8\"> Accordingly, we need not address the Taxpayers\u2019 argument that the County has attempted to legislate in the field of domestic relations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b736-7\">JUSTICE KINSER,</author>\n<p id=\"AAG\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">I join the majority opinion. However, I write additionally to point out that the central issue presented in this case is not, as stated in the dissenting opinion, whether \u201cArlington County [has] the legal authority to recognize common law marriages or \u2018same-sex unions\u2019 by conferring certain health insurance benefits upon domestic partners of County employees who are engaged in these relationships.\u201d Rather, the following comprise the assignments of error in this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-9\">1. The Court below erred by finding that Arlington County\u2019s coverage of domestic partners in its self-funded health benefits plan violates the Dillon Rule, and in granting Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-10\">2. The Court below erred by not finding that the County has authority to define the term \u201cdependents\u201d to include domestic partners for its self-funded health benefits plan for County employees, and in failing to grant the County\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-11\">3. The Court below erred in failing to recognize that the County has authority under the reasonable selection of method rule to define \u201cdependents\u201d to include domestic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>partners for purposes of administering its self-funded health benefit plan for County employees, and in failing to grant the County\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Furthermore, in the appellee Taxpayers\u2019 brief filed in this appeal, only one of their three main arguments in support the circuit court\u2019s judgment addressed the issue that the dissent calls \u201cfundamental\u201d and \u201ccentral.\u201d In fact, the rationale utilized by the majority to affirm the circuit court\u2019s judgment is the same as that contained in the Taxpayers\u2019 first argument on brief, i.e, that Arlington County\u2019s definition of the term \u201cdependent\u201d to include individuals who are merely \u201cinterdependent\u201d violates the Dillon Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">If the present case were decided on the basis that Arlington County\u2019s definition of \u201cdependant\u201d for purposes of its self-funded health benefit plan is not a reasonable method of implementing its implied authority because the definition bestows a governmental benefit on certain relationships that contravene Virginia\u2019s public policy concerning marriage, the same could be said with regard to the tax benefit conferred pursuant to Code \u00a7 58.1-322(D)(2)(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under that section, a Virginia taxpayer can claim a deduction for each personal exemption available to the taxpayer for federal income tax purposes. Under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 151, a federal income tax exemption is available for each \u201cdependent\u201d of the taxpayer. The term \u201cdependent\u201d is defined in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 152. In pertinent part, that section states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-7\">the term \u2018dependent\u2019 means any of the following individuals over half of whose support, for the calendar year in which the taxable year of the taxpayer begins, was received from the taxpayer: ... (9) An individual (other than an individual who at any time during the taxable year was the spouse ... of the taxpayer) who, for the taxable year of the taxpayer, has as his principal place of abode the home of the taxpayer and is a member of the taxpayer\u2019s household.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">Subsection (b)(5) of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 152 further states that \u201c[a]n individual is not a member of the taxpayer\u2019s household if at any time during the taxable year of the taxpayer the relationship between such individual and the taxpayer is in violation of local law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>If, as the dissent asserts, \u201c[t]he County\u2019s expanded definition of eligible dependents is nothing more than a disguised effort to confer health benefits upon persons who are involved in either common law marriages or \u2018same-sex unions,\u2019 \u201d then the allowance of an income tax deduction in Virginia based on the Internal Revenue Code\u2019s definition of \u201cdependent\u201d could also be deemed a \u201cdisguised effort\u201d to confer a governmental benefit on taxpayers involved in the same kinds of relationships. Aside from the requirement of financial interdependence, as opposed to dependency, an individual satisfying Arlington County\u2019s definition of \u201cdomestic partner\u201d could also qualify as a \u201cdependent\u201d under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(a)(9). That fact does not mean that such an individual can violate Virginia\u2019s criminal statutes proscribing lewd and lascivious cohabitation, Code \u00a7 18.2-345; fornication, Code \u00a7 18.2-344; and consensual sodomy, Code \u00a7 18.2-361.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">I do not intend in any way to suggest that I condone common law marriages or \u201csame-sex unions.\u201d Nor do I question that such relationships do, indeed, violate the public policy of Virginia. However, neither my personal beliefs nor Virginia\u2019s public policy make it necessary to decide this appeal on grounds that could call into question other sections of Virginia\u2019s laws.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b737-9\"> The Taxpayers argue on brief that Arlington County\u2019s definition of \u201cdependent\u201d conflicts with the definition of that term under state and federal income tax laws.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b738-9\"> I also note that under Virginia\u2019s State and Local Government Conflict of Interests Act, the term \u201cdependent\u201d is defined as \u201ca son, daughter, father, mother, brother, sister or other person, <em>whether or not related by blood or marriage, </em>if such a person receives from the officer or employee, or provides to the officer or employee, more than one-half of his financial support.\u201d (Emphasis added.)

Even though a review of the briefs and record filed in this appeal demonstrates that this question is the primary issue raised in this appeal, the majority decides this case on another legal basis. Arlington County, the appellant, agreed in its brief that \u201c[t]he central question in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>case is whether Arlington County\u2019s action of including its employees\u2019 domestic partners as dependents in the County\u2019s self-funded health benefits plan violates Dillon\u2019s Rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s decision to ignore the central issue raised in this appeal. This Court has a duty, as well as an obligation, to decide issues of great importance to the citizens of this Commonwealth when, as here, those issues are properly presented to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Arlington County implemented a self-funded health benefits plan for its employees. Pursuant to the plan, effective July 1, 1997, County employees were permitted to \u201cadd <em>one </em>adult dependent to their health and/or dental policy.\u201d The County stated, in its <em>Employee Relations Benefits Newsletter </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-8\">\u201cThe adult dependent may be:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-9\">\u201ca. The employee\u2019s legal spouse;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqF\">\u201c- or -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-11\">\u201cb. The domestic partner of the employee who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-12\">\u201c- has resided with the employee for a 1 year period;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-13\">\u201c- shares with the employee the common necessities of life and basic living expenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-14\">\u201c- is financially interdependent with the employee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-15\">\u201c-is involved with the employee in a mutually exclusive relationship of support and commitment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-16\">\u201c-is not related by blood to the employee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-17\">\u201c- is not married to anyone;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-18\">\u201c- was mentally competent at time of consent to relationship; \u201c- is 18 years of age or older.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0D\">\u201c- or -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-20\">\u201cc. Other adult dependent who meets the IRS definition of dependent and whom the employee claims as a dependent on his/her federal income tax return.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-21\">The County made the following stipulations of fact in the circuit court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-22\">\u201cAn employee who applies for health insurance benefits coverage must complete a form to certify the eligibility of any dependents for whom coverage is requested. An employee applying for domestic partner coverage must certify that the employee and the domestic partner meet the criteria estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>lished by the County. Arlington County may require documentation to support eligibility for coverage. Any employee who provides false information is subject to disciplinary action and appropriate legal action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Andrew White, Diana White, and Wendell Brown, residents and taxpayers of Arlington County, initiated this proceeding by filing a bill of complaint in the circuit court challenging the County\u2019s authority to confer health insurance benefits upon \u201cunmarried domestic partners of its employees.\u201d They sought a declaration that the County lacked the statutory or constitutional authority to grant health insurance benefits to the unmarried domestic partners, and that Arlington County\u2019s policy of extending health insurance benefits to the unmarried domestic partners of Arlington County employees violates state public policy favoring marriage of two adults over the unmarried cohabitation of two adults. The taxpayers sought to enjoin the County from granting health insurance benefits to the domestic partners of its employees or from expending any tax money on the health insurance benefits for domestic partners of Arlington County employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The primary issue that the taxpayers raised in the circuit court was that the County had violated the Dillon Rule because the General Assembly had not conferred upon the County the power to grant health insurance benefits to domestic partners of County employees. The circuit court entered a judgment in favor of the taxpayers which states in relevant part that \u201cArlington County\u2019s coverage for domestic partners in its self-funded health benefit plan for County employees violates the Dillon Rule.\u201d The circuit court, however, did not articulate the precise reasons it relied upon in reaching its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">On appeal, the County argues that the circuit court erred because the County\u2019s health insurance coverage for its employees\u2019 domestic partners in its self-funded benefit plan does not violate the Dillon Rule. The County also argues that it has authority to determine which dependents are eligible for coverage and that its decision to include domestic partners of County employees as dependents in the County\u2019s self-funded health benefits plan must be approved as long as the County\u2019s action is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">We stated in <em>City of Chesapeake </em>v. <em>Gardner Enterprises, </em>253 Va. 243, 246, 482 S.E.2d 812, 814 (1997), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>\u201c[t]he Dillon Rule of strict construction controls our determination of the powers of local governing bodies.

To imply a particular power from a power expressly granted, it must be found that the legislature intended that the grant of the express also would confer the implied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-5\">\u201cIn determining legislative intent, the rule is clear that where a power is conferred and the mode of its execution is specified, no other method may be selected; any other means would be contrary to legislative intent and, therefore, unreasonable. A necessary corollary is that where a grant of power is silent upon its mode of execution, a method of exercise clearly contrary to legislative intent, or inappropriate to the ends sought to be accomplished by the grant, also would be unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">\u201cConsistent with the necessity to uphold legislative intent, the doctrine of implied powers should never be applied to create a power that does not exist or to expand an existing power beyond rational limits. Always, the test in application of the doctrine is reasonableness, in which concern for what is necessary to promote the public interest is a key element.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-7\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arlington County Board, </em>217 Va. 558, 577, 232 S.E.2d 30, 42 (1977) (citations omitted); <em>accord Tidewater Ass\u2019n of Homebuilders, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Virginia Beach, </em>241 Va. 114, 119, 400 S.E.2d 523, 526 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">The County\u2019s expanded definition of the word \u201cdependents\u201d clearly and unequivocally violates the Dillon Rule. This definition is an unreasonable method of implementing the power granted to the County under Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.2-1517(A) and 51.1-801. The County\u2019s expanded definition of eligible dependents is nothing more than a disguised effort to confer health benefits upon persons who are involved in either common law marriages or \u201csame-sex unions,\u201d which are not recognized in this Commonwealth and are violative of the public policy of this Commonwealth. The General Assembly, by enacting Code \u00a7 20-45.2, expressly prohibited marriage between persons of the same sex. This Code provision states in relevant part that \u201c[a] marriage between persons of the same sex is prohibited.\u201d Also, we have held that Virginia does not recognize common law marriages. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Holland, </em>237 Va. 212, 219-220, 377 S.E.2d 363, 367-68 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>Furthermore, and just as important, the County\u2019s expanded definition of dependents is inappropriate because it permits the County to legislate in the area of domestic relations, a prerogative that lies within the exclusive domain of the General Assembly of this Commonwealth. <em>See Cramer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 561, 564-65, 202 S.E.2d 911, 914, <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 875 (1974). The General Assembly, not a county, is entrusted with the responsibility of recognizing and defining marital relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Certainly, the General Assembly did not intend, by its enactment of Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.2-1517(A) and 51.1-801, to grant counties, like Arlington, the power to recognize common law marriages or \u201csame-sex unions.\u201d Even a cursory review of Arlington County\u2019s eligibility criteria demonstrates that Arlington County seeks to recognize such relationships because the criteria require that the employee, who seeks to add a non-employee as a dependent in the County\u2019s health plan, certify that the employee has resided with his or her domestic partner for a period of one year, \u201cnot [be] married to anyone,\u201d \u201c[share] with the employee the common necessities of life and basic living expenses,\u201d \u201c[be] financially interdependent with the employee,\u201d \u201cnot [be] related by blood to the employee,\u201d and \u201c[be] involved with the employee in a mutually exclusive relationship of support and commitment.\u201d There can be no question or doubt that Arlington County seeks to recognize, tacitly, relationships that are violative of the public policy of this Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The County states, in a footnote in its reply brief filed in this Court, that \u201cVirginians] state tax law permits one member of an unmarried couple living together to claim the other as a dependent for individual tax return purposes.\u201d The County relies upon an Attorney General\u2019s opinion as authority for this proposition. <em>See </em>1985-1986 Att\u2019y. Gen. 278, 279. Continuing, the County says that \u201cif state tax law permits this, then it does not contravene state public policy for the County to provide health benefits to an employee\u2019s domestic partner.\u201d The County\u2019s contention is neither persuasive nor meritorious. The General Assembly did not, in the State\u2019s taxation statutes, alter Virginia\u2019s public policy prohibition against common law marriages or \u201csame-sex unions.\u201d Moreover, the state taxation statutes do not confer upon a county in this Commonwealth the authority to recognize, tacitly, common law marriages or \u201csame-sex unions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">The majority holds that Arlington County\u2019s decision to provide health benefits to domestic partners of County employees violates the Dillon Rule only because the County\u2019s health benefits plan requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>that the domestic partner be \u201cfinancially interdependent with the employee.\u201d As I have already stated, the majority\u2019s opinion ignores the central issue in this appeal. The majority\u2019s decision to do so is troublesome because if the Arlington County Board of Supervisors deletes from its health benefits plan the provision that the majority finds offensive, and implements a health benefits plan that confers benefits upon partners of County employees who are involved in common law marriages or \u201csame-sex unions,\u201d the taxpayers will be compelled to file another lawsuit to challenge the legality of the County\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">I think that a purpose of the appellate process is to render decisions that will adjudicate the primary principles of an appeal, thereby ending the litigation when possible. Unfortunately, because the majority has chosen to ignore the primary issue in this appeal, the taxpayers and the County may incur additional legal fees to relitigate an issue that is already before the Court. The majority\u2019s decision to ignore this issue may also result in a waste of judicial resources because, presumably, the circuit court and this Court will confront this issue again. For these reasons, I cannot join in the opinion of the majority.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
