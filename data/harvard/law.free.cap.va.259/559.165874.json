As pertinent here, one class of such intangible personal property is defined in Code \u00a7 58.1-1101(A)(2) as \u201c[cjapital which is personal property, tangible in fact, used in manufacturing . . . businesses.\u201d The tax on tangible personal property used in a sales business is assessed by localities. Code \u00a7 58.1-3500 (all tangible personal property taxed by localities except property classified as intangible personal property under Code \u00a758.1-1100 or merchants\u2019 capital taxable under Code \u00a7 58.1-3510).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Roanoke, Inc. (the taxpayer) filed an application in the circuit court under the provisions of Code \u00a7 58.1-3984 seeking a correction in Botetourt County\u2019s assessment of the taxpayer\u2019s 1994 local tangible personal property taxes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The taxpayer alleged that the county improperly assessed vending equipment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>as personal property used in a sales business. The county filed an answer denying that the assessment was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">After overruling the taxpayer\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the pleadings, the court heard evidence and viewed the taxpayer\u2019s plant. Following argument and consideration of memoranda from counsel, the court denied the taxpayer\u2019s petition, holding that the property in issue was not used in the taxpayer\u2019s manufacturing business, but was used as part of the taxpayer\u2019s separate sales business. The taxpayer appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The evidence, substantially undisputed, shows the following. The taxpayer operates under a license from the holder of a franchise from The Coca-Cola Company for the production, distribution, and sale of Coca-Cola products. The taxpayer\u2019s portion of the franchise area encompasses southwestern Virginia, a portion of the southern Piedmont of Virginia, a portion of northeastern Tennessee and a portion of southeastern West Virginia. The taxpayer\u2019s license had the required approval of The Coca-Cola Company and is subject to the terms of the licensor\u2019s franchise.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Most of the taxpayer\u2019s product is mixed and bottled in its Roanoke plant, moved into its warehouses located throughout its franchise territory, and distributed from the warehouses to the wholesale purchasers. Approximately one-third of the taxpayer\u2019s employees are engaged in the manufacture of its product. The remainder are engaged in administration, distribution and sales activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">The taxpayer wholesales most of its product to retailers such as supermarkets, convenience stores, discount retailers, hotels, motels, restaurants, gasoline filling stations, and other such retail outlets. The taxpayer\u2019s wholesale customers retail some cooled drinks in cooling and dispensing equipment furnished by the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">The taxpayer retails a smaller, but substantial, portion of its product in coin operated machines owned or rented by it. The tax status of the vending machines, coolers, and fountain equipment which the taxpayer owns or rents from others is the subject of this opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">Citing <em>County of Chesterfield v. BBC Brown Boveri, Inc., </em>238 Va. 64, 380 S.E.2d 890 (1989), the taxpayer argues that if a substantial part of a firm\u2019s business consists of the actual process of manufacturing, the firm is a manufacturing business for tax purposes notwithstanding its performance of non-manufacturing activities. And the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>taxpayer points out that the trial court found that a substantial part of its business consisted of manufacturing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-3\">However, for a number of reasons, the taxpayer contests the court\u2019s finding that it conducted a separate sales business in which it used the taxed equipment. This finding subjected the taxpayer to another statutory provision that if a taxpayer is engaged in more than one business, the taxpayer \u201cshall pay the tax provided by law on each branch of . . . its business.\u201d Code \u00a7 58.1-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">The taxpayer\u2019s first contention is that the franchise agreement, which controlled its licensing agreement, did not permit either the taxpayer\u2019s manufacturing or sales \u201cactivity [to] be performed independently of the other.\u201d Although the franchise agreement is not a part of the record, we will assume that the taxpayer correctly characterizes its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Additionally, the taxpayer quotes in part the court\u2019s description of its manufacturing, distribution, and sales activities as \u201cvertically integrated functions.\u201d Whether a taxpayer\u2019s activities are considered as two separate businesses for tax purposes, however, is not determined by the formal structure of the taxpayer\u2019s functions or the taxpayer\u2019s relation to its franchiser. Rather, that issue is determined by the manner in which the taxpayer actually conducts its business. <em>See Caffee </em>v. <em>City of Portsmouth, </em>203 Va. 928, 930-31, 128 S.E.2d 421, 422-23 (1962) (retail and wholesale sales in salesroom portion of bakery\u2019s manufacturing plant constitute a separate sales business for local license tax purposes). Thus, we reject the taxpayer\u2019s claim that the terms of the franchise agreement and its own organizational structure determine its tax status.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Nevertheless, the taxpayer maintains that if a taxpayer is a manufacturer under Code \u00a7 58.1-1101(A)(2), it cannot also be classified as conducting a sales business. The taxpayer claims that the <em>Caffee </em>ruling is inapplicable here because the license tax statutes involved in <em>Caffee </em>are unlike the statutes involved in this case. In <em>Caffee, </em>we said the license tax statutes \u201cshow that the legislature has not classified the business of production and disposition of goods by a manufacturer into a single, separate subject of taxation.\u201d 203 Va. at 932, 128 S.E.2d at 424. Yet the taxpayer does not indicate in what way Code \u00a7 58.1-1101(A)(2) has classified the production and sale of goods into a single business.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Instead, the taxpayer interprets <em>BBC Brown Boveri </em>as holding that \u201c[Code] \u00a7 58.1-1101(A)(2) classifies a business that engages in manufacturing and non-manufacturing activities <em>exclusively </em>as a manufacturer, provided that its manufacturing activities are substantial.\u201d Significantly, the taxpayer provides no supporting page citation for this proposition from <em>BBC Brown Boveri. </em>Instead, we find the following statement in that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-4\">Another area of dispute is whether the design and engineering stages of a manufacturing job constitute manufacturing. The record discloses that [the taxpayer\u2019s] design and engineering work was ancillary either to original manufacturing work or to a rebuilding job. Thus, because [the taxpayer\u2019s] design and engineering are integral parts of its manufacturing activity, such work is properly classified as manufacturing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">238 Va. at 70 n.5, 380 S.E.2d at 893 n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Obviously, the <em>BBC Brown Boveri </em>dispute was not resolved by applying the taxpayer\u2019s interpretation, but by considering that the described design and engineering work was a part of the later process of manufacturing. Unlike the situation in <em>BBC Brown Boveri, </em>in this case, the taxpayer\u2019s subsequent sales activities were not a part of its manufacturing process.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The taxpayer argues, however, that the sales activity in the taxed equipment indirectly affects its manufacturing activity because it, like every manufacturer, must sell its manufactured product in order to continue that activity. We effectively rejected this argument by our holding in <em>Cajfee </em>that Caffee\u2019s sales room, which disposed of almost all its manufactured product, was a separate sales business. 203 Va. at 930-31, 128 S.E.2d at 422-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">Thus, we agree with the County that the following rule from <em>Cajfee </em>applies in this case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-9\">\u201cThe business of manufacturing an article is . . . essentially different from that of selling the article after it has been manufactured. And the fact that the article is manufactured for sale cannot have the effect of obliterating the line of demarkation between the two businesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">203 Va. at 930, 128 S.E.2d at 423 (quoting <em>Consumers\u2019 Brewing Co. v. Norfolk, </em>101 Va. 171, 173, 43 S.E. 336, 336 (1903)). Accordingly, we disagree with the taxpayer\u2019s argument that its sales activities can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>not be considered as separate sales business for the purposes of Code \u00a7 58.1-1101(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">Even so, the taxpayer construes Code \u00a7 58.1-1101(A)(2) as \u201cexcluding] <em>all </em>tangible personal property used in a manufacturing business . . . from local taxation, regardless of how <em>indirectly </em>related the property at issue is to the central function of manufacturing or how distant the property is from the manufacturing plant.\u201d (Second emphasis added.) We do not agree with the taxpayer\u2019s argument that this sales equipment thereby became a part of its manufacturing business as indirectly related thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">In effect, the taxpayer asks us to add the bracketed words to the following language of Code \u00a7 58.1-1101(A)(2): \u201c[c]apital which is personal property, tangible in fact, used [directly or indirectly] in manufacturing . . . businesses.\u201d For much the same reason that we refused to add the word \u201cdirectly\u201d to this plain and unambiguous statute when urged to do so by the city in <em>City of Winchester </em>v. <em>American Woodmark Corp., </em>250 Va. 451, 457, 464 S.E.2d 148, 152 (1995), we refuse to add either word here. The word and its expansive scope simply do not appear in the statute, and we cannot change or amend a statute under the guise of construing it. <em>Id.; City of Martinsville </em>v. <em>Tultex Corp., </em>238 Va. 59, 63, 381 S.E.2d 6, 8 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Hence, in deciding whether this sales equipment was \u201cused in a manufacturing business,\u201d we apply the plain meaning of those words as used in the statute. <em>American Woodmark, </em>250 Va. at 457, 464 S.E.2d at 152. Unlike the computers and office equipment in the <em>American Woodmark </em>and <em>Tultex </em>cases, which were used, in whole or in part, in planning, directing or administering the manufacturing function, the evidence in this case indicates that the sales equipment in question was not used in manufacturing but merely in selling the finished product. Thus, we conclude that the evidence supports the court\u2019s holding that this equipment could be considered as sales equipment used in a separate sales business. We need not decide whether the taxpayer was also engaged in a separate wholesale business because the taxpayer has not borne his burden under Code \u00a7 58.1-3984 of showing, which, if any, of the taxed property was used in sales at the wholesale level.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">For these reasons, the judgment will be</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b583-12\"> Code \u00a7 58.1-3984 provides that a taxpayer, aggrieved by a local tax assessment, may apply for relief in the local circuit court. The proceedings are conducted by the court sitting without a jury, and the burden of proof is upon the taxpayer to show that the assessment was invalid or illegal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b584-10\"> It makes no difference whether the taxpayer owns or leases the personal property in question. Its <em>use </em>determines its tax status. <em>City of Martinsville v. Tultex Corp., </em>238 Va. 59, 63, 381 S.E.2d 6, 8 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b585-7\"> At trial, the county argued that the taxpayer was not a manufacturer under Code \u00a7 58.1-1102(A)(2), but it has not assigned cross-error to the court\u2019s ruling on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
