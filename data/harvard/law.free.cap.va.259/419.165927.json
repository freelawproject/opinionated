Cable, Robert L. Waldrop, and Cardwell Ferguson Hannabass (collectively, the plaintiffs) filed a bill of complaint for declaratory judgment against the Charles City County Board of Supervisors (the Board) and Weanack Land, Limited Partnership (Weanack). The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the Board\u2019s decision rezoning 41.27 riverfront acres owned by Weanack (the Weanack property) to an \u201cIndustrial M-2-C\u201d classification was unreasonable, arbitrary, and void. All the plaintiffs owned property located within about 2,000 feet of either the Weanack property or the access road serving the Weanack property.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">The Weanack property is located next to the Shirley Plantation, an historical landmark, and includes a port on the James River used for the docking, loading, and unloading of barges. In 1995, the Board changed the Weanack property\u2019s zoning classification from \u201cA-l Agricultural\u201d to \u201cBusiness Conditional B-l-C.\u201d The purpose of the 1995 rezoning was to permit use of the Weanack property as a port to receive barges delivering containerized municipal waste destined for the Charles City County landfill, which is operated jointly by Charles City County (the County) and a private company. These waste transportation operations on the Weanack property began in 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">A condition of the \u201cB-l-C\u201d rezoning prohibited truck traffic entering or leaving the Weanack property from using Route 5 or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Route 608. A second condition limited truck traffic from the dock facility to Route 106/156 to \u201c[n]o more than 125 truck loads per day.\u201d This truck traffic reached Route 106/156 by using an access road on an easement over property owned by T. Davis Copeland and Pamela P. Copeland (the Copelands). At the time of the proceedings at issue, a lawsuit was pending between the Copelands and Weanack concerning Weanack\u2019s use of the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">In October 1997, Weanack filed an application to rezone the Weanack property from the \u201cBusiness B-l-C\u201d classification to \u201cIndustrial M-2-C.\u201d Weanack also requested that the Board amend the Charles City County zoning ordinance (zoning ordinance) to include in its \u201cIndustrial M-2\u201d classification specified waterfront industrial uses, including \u201cdocks and areas for the receipt, storage and transhipment of waterborne commerce.\u201d In December 1997, the Board voted to amend the zoning ordinance\u2019s \u201cIndustrial M-2\u201d classification as requested, but deferred consideration of the application to rezone Weanack\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Weanack\u2019s rezoning application included 11 detailed proffers. Among these proffers, Weanack stated the hours during which its facility would be operated, and established different time restrictions for trucking, \u201cland-based operations\u201d such as loading and unloading barges, and \u201cmarine-based operations\u201d such as docking barges. Weanack further agreed in the proffers that its trucks would not travel on Routes 5 and 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Weanack\u2019s proffers also addressed the volume of truck traffic that would be permitted for the transportation of waste to the County\u2019s landfill. Weanack agreed to limit the number of truck trips per day entering or exiting Route 106/156 to 150, 250, or 300 truckloads, depending on the improvements made to the access road that Weanack used to reach Route 106/156. In February 1998, the Board granted Weanack\u2019s rezoning application and accepted the above proffers as part of the rezoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">After the Board filed a demurrer to the plaintiffs\u2019 original bill of complaint, the plaintiffs sought to add the Copelands as plaintiffs in the case. The Board and Weanack objected to the plaintiffs\u2019 request. The trial court denied the request on the grounds that \u201cthe Copelands do not qualify as necessary parties to this case, and further that the Copelands should have filed their own case, or filed their requested amendment, within 30 days [of the Board\u2019s decision].\u201d The trial court also sustained the Board\u2019s demurrer to the bill of complaint, but granted the plaintiffs leave to file an amended bill of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>In Count I of their second amended bill of complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that the Board\u2019s decision rezoning the Weanack property violated Code \u00a7 15.2-2297(A)(vii), which requires that proffers made as part of a rezoning application be in conformity with the local governing body\u2019s comprehensive plan. They alleged that two of Weanack\u2019s proffers were not in conformity with the County\u2019s 1991 Comprehensive Plan. First, the plaintiffs alleged that the use of an access road over the Copeland property for truck traffic leaving the Weanack facility created \u201can intensive industrial use area\u201d on the Copelands\u2019 property, contrary to its agricultural designation in the County\u2019s 1991 Comprehensive Plan. Second, they alleged that Weanack\u2019s proffer concerning the facility\u2019s hours of operation also was not in conformity with the 1991 Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">In addition, the plaintiffs alleged that their use of their own properties would be adversely impacted by the trucking noise, litter, dust, odors, and exposure to disease from the garbage unloaded on the Weanack property and transported over the access road on the Copeland property. They also alleged that the Board\u2019s acceptance of Weanack\u2019s proffers as part of the rezoning was \u201cunreasonable and illegal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">In Count II, the plaintiffs alleged that the rezoning violated the County\u2019s zoning ordinance because the rezoning permitted a private road in an area zoned for agricultural use to be part of an industrial use, when \u201cthere is no language authorizing the use of access roads in other zoned areas.\u201d The plaintiffs also alleged that the rezoning imposed \u201cintensive\u201d industrial uses on the Copeland property and converted that property to an industrial use contrary to its agricultural use classification. In Count V, the plaintiff alleged that the Board\u2019s decision granting the rezoning application constituted illegal \u201cspot zoning.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The Board and Weanack filed demurrers to the second amended bill of complaint. They also asked the trial court to strike the plaintiffs\u2019 pleading, arguing that the plaintiffs improperly attempted to assert claims that could only be brought by the Copelands, contrary to the trial court\u2019s earlier ruling precluding such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">The trial court struck Count II and those parts of Counts I and Y \u201csetting forth . . . allegations concerning the Copeland property.\u201d The court also ruled that Count II failed to state a valid claim, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>alternatively held that it constituted an \u201cimpermissible new claim.\u201d The trial court sustained the demurrer to the balance of Counts I and V and dismissed the case with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred in denying their request to add the Copelands as plaintiffs. They assert that if an action challenging a local governing body\u2019s zoning decision has been brought within the 30-day time period following the decision, as required by Code \u00a7 15.2-2285(F), additional plaintiffs may be added after the 30-day period has expired. The plaintiffs contend that their second amended bill of complaint does not allege \u201cimpermissible new claims\u201d concerning the Copelands\u2019 property because these claims were based on the same facts alleged in the original bill of complaint and sought the same relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The plaintiffs also argue that Count I stated a valid cause of action in alleging that the Board improperly accepted certain proffers from Weanack that were contrary to the County\u2019s 1991 Comprehensive Plan. They contend that Count EL stated a cause of action, irrespective whether the Copelands were added as parties, because the plaintiffs alleged that the Board violated the County\u2019s zoning ordinance by accepting proffers that \u201cimpose industrial uses\u201d on property zoned for agricultural use. The plaintiffs also assert that they properly alleged a claim of illegal spot zoning in Count V.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">In response, the Board and Weanack (collectively, Weanack) argue that the trial court properly denied the request to add the Cope-lands as plaintiffs, since the Copelands failed to file suit contesting the Board\u2019s decision within the 30-day period required by Code \u00a7 15.2-2285(F). Weanack asserts that after denying this request, the trial court correctly sustained the demurrer to claims relating to the proffers addressing truck traffic on the access road, since these claims could only be brought by the Copelands. Weanack further contends that the plaintiffs failed to allege any facts to support their allegation in Count I that the proffered conditions were inconsistent with the County\u2019s comprehensive plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Weanack also contends that the plaintiffs failed to state a cause of action in Count II because they alleged no facts from which the court could conclude that the conditional rezoning of the Weanack property \u201cimposed\u201d an industrial use on the Copeland property. Weanack argues that property zoned for agricultural use, which is adjacent to property zoned for industrial use, does not have to be rezoned to an industrial classification before being used to provide access for traffic travelling to and from the industrial site. Finally, Weanack asserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>that Count V is legally insufficient because it does not allege that the rezoning was intended solely to serve the interests of a private party.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Initially, we consider the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the trial court erred in denying their request to add the Copelands as plaintiffs in the case. Code \u00a7 15.2-2285(F) requires that an action contesting a rezoning decision of a local governing body be filed in the circuit court within 30 days of the decision. The rezoning of the Weanack property occurred on February 10, 1998, and the plaintiffs requested that the Copelands be added as parties to the appeal on May 29, 1998. Thus, the plaintiffs\u2019 request to add the Copelands was made after the statutory period had expired for the Copelands to bring an action alleging the claims asserted in the original bill of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">We disagree with the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the trial court\u2019s ruling was contrary to our decision in <em>Friends of Clark Mountain Found., Inc. v. Board of Supervisors, </em>242 Va. 16, 406 S.E.2d 19 (1991). There, the plaintiffs, who were owners of land in the vicinity of a rezoned tract, filed suit against the local governing body seeking a declaratory judgment that the decision rezoning the tract and granting a special use permit was unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious. The plaintiffs failed to join as defendants in the suit the owner of the rezoned tract and a person holding an option to purchase the tract. 242 Va. at 18-19, 406 S.E.2d at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The trial court dismissed the suit on the grounds that the owner of the tract and the option holder were necessary parties and had not been joined as defendants in the suit prior to the expiration of the 30-day appeal period. We reversed the judgment, holding that under former Code \u00a7 15.1-493(G), the only required parties at the time of filing the appeal are the contestant and the local governing body. Therefore, we concluded that the expiration of the 30-day appeal period did not preclude the contestant from seeking the joinder of other necessary parties to the suit. 242 Va. at 21-22, 406 S.E.2d at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Our holding in <em>Clark Mountain </em>was based on the principle that when a contesting action has been initiated in conformance with statutory requirements, the action should not be adjudicated until any remaining necessary parties have intervened or been brought into the proceeding. This approach assures that the legislative body\u2019s decision will be reviewed in a fair, orderly, and prompt manner. <em>Id. </em>Here, however, these concerns were not present because the Copelands were not necessary parties to an adjudication of the counts contained in the original bill of complaint. Thus, we conclude that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>court did not err in denying the plaintiffs\u2019 request to add the Cope-lands as plaintiffs in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">We next consider the trial court\u2019s decision sustaining the defendants\u2019 demurrer to the second amended bill of complaint. The standard of review that we apply is well established. We consider as true all material facts alleged in a bill of complaint, all facts impliedly alleged, and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from such facts. <em>Moore v. Maroney, </em>258 Va. 21, 23, 516 S.E.2d 9, 10 (1999); <em>Concerned Taxpayers of Brunswick County </em>v. <em>County of </em>Brunswick, 249 Va. 320, 323, 455 S.E.2d 712, 713 (1995); <em>Krantz v. Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n, Int'l, </em>245 Va. 202, 204, 427 S.E.2d 326, 327 (1993). However, a demurrer does not admit the correctness of the conclusions of law asserted in a bill of complaint. <em>Moore, </em>258 Va. at 23, 516 S.E.2d at 10; <em>Ward\u2019s Equip., Inc. v. New Holland N. America, </em>254 Va. 379, 382, 493 S.E.2d 516, 518 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The trial court is not permitted on demurrer to evaluate and decide the merits of the allegations set forth in a bill of complaint, but only may determine whether the factual allegations of the bill of complaint are sufficient to state a cause of action. <em>Concerned Taxpayers of Brunswick County, </em>249 Va. at 327-28, 455 S.E.2d at 716; <em>Fun v. Virginia Military Inst., </em>245 Va. 249, 252, 427 S.E.2d 181, 183 (1993). Thus, the trial court errs in sustaining a demurrer if a bill of complaint, considered in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, states a cause of action. <em>W.S. Carnes, Inc. v. Board of Supervisors, </em>252 Va. 377, 384, 478 S.E.2d 295, 300 (1996); <em>see Luckett v. Jennings, </em>246 Va. 303, 307, 435 S.E.2d 400, 402 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">We conclude that the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer to Count I because it stated a cause of action that could be asserted by the plaintiffs independent of the Copelands. Count I challenged the \u201coff-site\u201d proffers regarding truck traffic on the basis of the alleged impact of the proffered conditions on the plaintiffs\u2019 use of their own properties, not on the basis of any property right held by the Copelands. The plaintiffs live within sufficiently close proximity to the property that is the subject of the rezoning to possess a \u201cjusticiable interest\u201d in the litigation of Count I. <em>See Cupp </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>227 Va. 580, 589, 318 S.E.2d 407, 411 (1984); <em>Board of Supervisors v. Fralin &amp; Waldron, Inc., </em>222 Va. 218, 224, 278 S.E.2d 859, 862 (1981). Thus, the absence of the Copelands as parties did not bar consideration of the issue whether the \u201coff-site\u201d proffers failed to conform to the County\u2019s comprehensive plan and rendered the zoning unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>The plaintiffs also alleged that the proffer permitting marine-based operations \u201c24 Hours [per day], 7 days a week\u201d was inconsistent with the County\u2019s comprehensive plan. Weanack argued on demurrer that the County\u2019s 1998 Comprehensive Plan, adopted three months after the Board\u2019s approval of the Weanack rezoning application, designates the Weanack property for industrial use. Weanack\u2019s argument, however, does not resolve the plaintiffs\u2019 claim concerning the hours and days of operation, or their claim regarding the \u201coff-site\u201d proffers, as a matter of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Proffered conditions are permitted as part of a rezoning \u201cfor the protection of the community\u201d in which the property that is the subject of the proposed rezoning is located. Code \u00a7 15.2-2296; <em>Gregory v. Board of Supervisors, </em>257 Va. 530, 536, 514 S.E.2d 350, 353 (1999). Code \u00a7 15.2-2297(A) imposes several requirements that must be met before proffered conditions may be incorporated as part of a rezoning amendment. Included among these requirements are provisions that \u201cthe conditions shall have a reasonable relation to the rezoning,\u201d and that \u201call such conditions shall be in conformity with the [local governing body\u2019s] comprehensive plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The plaintiffs were entitled to present evidence supporting their allegations that the proffered conditions concerning truck traffic were not in conformity with the County\u2019s comprehensive plan and rendered the zoning unreasonable because they permitted heavy truck traffic to proceed near the plaintiff\u2019s property over property designated for agricultural use. The plaintiffs also were entitled to present evidence to support their allegation that the proffered condition concerning the hours of operation of the port facility rendered the zoning unreasonable and was not in conformity with the County\u2019s comprehensive plan that designated the neighboring properties for agricultural use.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">We also conclude that the plaintiffs stated a cause of action in Count I, based on the facts set forth in their pleading, by alleging that the rezoning was \u201cnot consistent with the . . . [comprehensive [p]lan, and was arbitrary and capricious, unreasonable, and incompatible with surrounding land uses.\u201d Although the 1998 Comprehensive Plan designated the Weanack property for industrial use, an issue remained whether this particular rezoning action, because of its proffered conditions, was a reasonable exercise of the Board\u2019s authority. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>This portion of the claim could not be resolved as a matter of law, but could only be determined after consideration of evidence presented by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">We next conclude that the trial court did not err in dismissing Count II of the second amended bill of complaint, which contained two basic allegations. The first was that the proffered conditions regarding truck traffic constitute \u201ca conversion of the privately owned access road to industrial use without proper rezoning.\u201d The trial court did not err in dismissing this portion of Count II because it involves the property rights of the Copelands, who were not parties to this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The second allegation of Count II centered on the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that the County\u2019s zoning ordinance does not allow \u201czoning proffers which impose an industrial use on a private access road which is not located within the industrial zone or district.\u201d The trial court did not err in dismissing this portion of Count II because it fails to state a cause of action. First, the proffered conditions do not impose any \u201cuse\u201d on the access road over the easement on the Copeland property, but place restrictions on the number of truckloads entering or exiting Route 106/156, depending on the condition of the access road.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Second, the relevant conditional zoning statutes and ordinance provisions do not require that \u201coff-site\u201d proffers be confined to properties having the same zoning classification as the property that is the subject of the rezoning. Code \u00a7 15.2-2297 and Charles City County Ordinance \u00a7 13.1-2, which contain the same substantive provisions, permit proffered conditions as part of a rezoning subject to the specific requirements stated in those provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">We next conclude that the trial court did not err in dismissing Count V of the second amended bill of complaint, which alleged that the rezoning action constituted illegal spot zoning. Count V also alleged that as part of the rezoning, Weanack agreed through proffers to send all the waste transported into its facility to the County\u2019s landfill \u201cfor the exclusive revenues of the County.\u201d Finally, Count V alleged that the purpose of the rezoning was \u201cto serve the special financial interests of Weanack and the County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">Illegal spot zoning occurs when the purpose of a zoning ordinance or rezoning amendment is solely to serve the private interests of one or more landowners, rather than to further a locality\u2019s welfare as part of an overall zoning plan that may include a concurrent benefit to private interests. <em>Barrick v. Board of Supervisors, 239 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Va. at 632-33, 391 S.E.2d at 320; <em>Board of Supervisors v. Fralin &amp; Waldron, Inc., </em>222 Va. at 226, 278 S.E.2d at 863-64; <em>Wilhelm </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>208 Va. 398, 403-04, 157 S.E.2d 920, 924 (1967). The trial court properly dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 claim in Count V because it alleged that the purpose of the rezoning was to benefit the interests of the County, as well as the interests of a private landowner.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">For these reasons, we will affirm the portion of the trial court\u2019s judgment dismissing Counts II and V of the second amended bill of complaint. We will reverse the portion of the trial court\u2019s judgment dismissing Count I and remand Count I to the trial court for a trial on the merits consistent with the principles expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b446-8\"> Counts HI, IV, and VI of the second amended bill of complaint are not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b450-6\"> Since the parties agree that the Board adopted the proposed 1998 Comprehensive Plan, we do not consider the differences in the provisions of the 1991 and 1998 Plans because, at a trial on remand, the court may consider the 1998 Comprehensive Plan. <em>See Barrick v.
