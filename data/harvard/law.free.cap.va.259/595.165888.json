He was tried, along with two codefendants, in a bench trial before the Circuit Court of the City of Hampton. The trial court found Paden guilty of the offenses charged and the Court of Appeals denied Paden\u2019s petition for appeal by unpublished order. <em>Paden v. Commonwealth, </em>Record No. 2567-98-1, May 5, 1999. We awarded Paden an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">Paden first objects to the admission into evidence of testimony by Detective George Burton concerning a statement made by Olivier D. Dixon, one of Paden\u2019s codefendants. Detective Burton testified that Dixon told him that Paden \u201cwas the first one to go up stairs\u201d at the movie theater, that Paden, accompanied by Antwan Kingsberry, was \u201cgoing down the hall with the mask on,\u201d that Dixon saw Kingsberry and Paden putting money into a bag, and that before the group left the theater, Paden gave Dixon $100. Paden argues that this testimony was hearsay and thus inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">Paden acknowledges that Detective Burton\u2019s testimony regarding Dixon\u2019s statement would have been admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule if the Commonwealth had established that Dixon was unavailable to testify, that the declaration was against Dixon\u2019s penal interest, and that the statement was reliable. <em>Ellison v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 404, 408, 247 S.E.2d 685, 688 (1978). However, Paden asserts that the Commonwealth failed to establish any of these factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">According' to Paden, the Commonwealth did not establish the first factor, Dixon\u2019s unavailability to testify, because Dixon was present at trial and his attorney stated that Dixon was prepared to testify. The Commonwealth argues that, regardless of the representations made by Dixon\u2019s counsel, Dixon was unavailable to testify because Dixon could not be compelled to give evidence against himself and because the decision whether to testify was personal to Dixon and not his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>The Commonwealth correctly recites the rights of codefendant Dixon. Nevertheless, until Dixon asserted those rights, he remained available to testify. Under these circumstances, the Commonwealth failed to establish that Dixon was unavailable to testify, and the trial court therefore erred in admitting the hearsay testimony of Detective Burton. Id.; <em>see also Atkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 160, 176, 510 S.E.2d 445, 455 (1999) (\u201cNor could the statement have been admitted as being against penal interest, since Atkins, the declarant, was not \u2018unavailable\u2019 to testify at trial, which is a prerequisite to invoke that exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d); <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>249 Va. 270, 279 n.1, 455 S.E.2d 219, 224 n.1 (1995) (\u201cTo be an admissible declaration against penal interest, the statement must also be made by an unavailable declarant.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Paden also asserts that the trial court erred in admitting a letter written by Paden to his brother, codefendant Antwan Kings-berry, while both were in jail. The letter, in pertinent part, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">[Tjhis is the deal. I\u2019m going to need to know what you told your lawyer about the case. Even though I haven\u2019t seen my lawyer yet I know what I\u2019m saying. I going to deny every thing. If my lawyer asks me, why would he involve my name, I\u2019m going to say me &amp; him had an altercation about 8 or 9 months, meaning he stole some money and a pager from me &amp; haven\u2019t liked each other since. As far as you and I, on the day of the robbery, I saw you early that morning and that was it. I was with Kashamere that day cause I was suppose to baby sit for her. Yo, <em>MAKE SURE </em>you tell me everything you told your lawyer ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Paden objected to the admission of this letter asserting it was not an admission or \u201cstatement against self interest.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">This statement can be interpreted as an attempt by Paden to establish an alibi through statements consistent with his codefendant Kingsberry and, thereby, conceal his guilt. Extra-judicial admissions that tend to show guilt, even if not confessions, are admissible as party admissions. <em>Prince </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 610, 613, 324 S.E.2d 660, 662 (1985). Accordingly, the trial court did not err in admitting the letter written by Paden into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">For the error in admitting Dixon\u2019s statements, the order of the Court of Appeals will be reversed and the conviction will be vacated. The case will be remanded to the Court of Appeals with direction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>that it be remanded to the Circuit Court for a new trial if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">\n<em>Vacated, reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
