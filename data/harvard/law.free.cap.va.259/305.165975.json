The central issue is whether the evidence is sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-14\">The facts, considered during a March 1998 hearing, are not disputed. The only testimonial evidence presented was the deposition of a psychiatrist, who had been employed by the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-15\">The child, a male, was bom in Norfolk on September 3, 1991. His mother, residing in Chesapeake, is appellant Linda Grant Rowland. His father, residing in Virginia Beach, is appellee Edward David Shurbutt.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>When the child was conceived, the mother was not married to the father and was separated from her spouse. When the child was bom, the mother and her husband had reconciled and the child was given the surname \u201cRowland,\u201d a name he still carries.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Since birth, the child has been in the physical custody of his mother. Court orders provide, however, that both parents have \u201cjoint legal custody\u201d of the child. The parents have been litigating issues concerning child custody, child support, and visitation most of the child\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">In March 1998, the father filed duplicate petitions in the court below to change his child\u2019s surname to \u201cShurbutt.\u201d The father asserted that he desired to change the name in order \u201cto prevent confusion and difficulty in the transaction of the minor child\u2019s lawful affairs\u201d and that the name change would be in the child\u2019s best interest. The mother objected to the proposed change.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Following the hearing, the trial court concluded that the child\u2019s best interest would be served by granting the father\u2019s petition. In a February 1999 order, from which we awarded the mother this appeal, the court ruled that the child\u2019s name be changed as requested, finding that \u201cgood cause was shown for this action.\u201d The court also ruled, however, that the child\u2019s name remain unchanged pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">On appeal, the mother contends that the trial court erred in ordering the name change because the evidence was insufficient to support the order. The father, while contending the evidence was sufficient to support the order, also argues that this Court is without jurisdiction to consider the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">We shall address the jurisdictional question first. Although not argued orally, the father contends on brief that the Court of Appeals of Virginia, not this Court, has jurisdiction of this appeal. He points out that Code \u00a7 17.1-405(3)(e) provides that appeals of circuit court orders relating to the \u201ccontrol or disposition of a child\u201d must be made to the Court of Appeals. This is such a proceeding, he says, and the appeal should be dismissed. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">Ordinarily, a proceeding under the change-of-name statute, Code \u00a7 8.01-217, is an independent civil action. <em>But see </em>Code \u00a7 20-121.4 (permitting divorce court to restore party\u2019s former name as part of final decree of divorce from bond of matrimony). Although the present matter, brought as a separate proceeding detached from any custody or support litigation, obviously relates to a child, it does not involve the \u201ccontrol or disposition of a child,\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 17.1-405(3)(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>An order in an independent civil action changing a name, including that of a child, is \u201ca final judgment\u201d in a \u201ccivil case,\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 8.01-670(A)(3), which provides for appeal of such an order to this Court. Thus, we properly have taken jurisdiction in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">We shall now turn to the central issue, that is, whether the evidence was sufficient to support the name change.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">As pertinent to this proceeding, Code \u00a7 8.01-217 provides that any person desiring to change his child\u2019s name may apply to the appropriate circuit court, \u201cwhich shall consider such application if it finds that good cause exists therefor under the circumstances alleged.\u201d The statute further provides that when both of the child\u2019s parents are living and when the parent who does not join in the application objects to the proposed change, \u201ca hearing shall be held to determine whether the change of name is in the best interest of the minor.\u201d The statute further provides that unless the court finds that the change of a minor\u2019s name \u201cis not in the best interest of the minor,\u201d the court shall \u201corder a change of name.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">We have interpreted these statutory provisions to mean that the burden is upon the petitioning parent, under the circumstances of this case, to prove by satisfactory evidence that the change is in the child\u2019s best interest. <em>Beyah v. Shelton, </em>231 Va. 432, 434, 344 S.E.2d 909, 911 (1986); <em>Flowers v. Cain, </em>218 Va. 234, 237, 237 S.E.2d 111, 113 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">As we examine the facts, it must be remembered that because the evidence before the trial court on the subject of the child\u2019s best interest was in the form of a deposition, and the court did not see and hear the witness, the court\u2019s finding of fact, while highly persuasive and entitled to great weight, is not binding on us. <em>Johnson v. Insurance Co. of N. Am., </em>232 Va. 340, 345, 350 S.E.2d 616, 619 (1986); <em>Kaplan v. Copeland, </em>183 Va. 589, 593, 32 S.E.2d 678, 679 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">A prolonged recitation of the psychiatrist\u2019s testimony, submitted by the father, is unnecessary. Prior to the March 1998 deposition, the physician had seen the child on three occasions, the father on eight occasions, and the father\u2019s present wife once. He had \u201cnever met\u201d the mother or her husband. Additionally, the doctor had reviewed a \u201cSocial Services report\u201d resulting from a \u201chome study\u201d that mainly dealt with the issues of custody and visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">When asked his opinion upon whether a change of name \u201cwould be in the child\u2019s best interest and what do you base your opinion on,\u201d the psychiatrist stated that he felt two issues were presented. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>First, a child \u201cshould be able to carry the name of both his parents.\u201d The \u201csecond issue,\u201d he said, relates to the father\u2019s role in the child\u2019s development.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The witness noted that the father \u201chas been extensively involved with the child . . . being very much involved in his care and his education and . . . also has been a very good provider. He\u2019s accepted whatever economic responsibilities are there.\u201d Therefore, the doctor opined, \u201cit should be very simple that [the child] should carry the names of the parents that are biologically his parents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The witness was asked whether it would be \u201charmful\u201d to change the child\u2019s name in view of the fact that he had carried the name Rowland for more than six years. The doctor responded that it would not be a \u201cproblem\u201d for the child, but that the \u201cproblem is going to be with the adults trying to accept whatever decision is made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">The witness said the child \u201chas been able to merge very well with both sets of parents,\u201d noting that the child \u201chas no difficulty dealing with\u201d living in the primary custody of his mother and having regular visitation with the father. Noting that the mother and father \u201care very good parents,\u201d the doctor stated that the child is \u201cprobably the best balance[d]\u201d of all the parties involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">According to the witness, the child is a \u201cvery healthy kid\u201d; he is \u201cprogressing normally,\u201d \u201cinteracting appropriately,\u201d and \u201cmaturing\u201d both \u201c[s]choolwise\u201d and \u201csocialwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">Finally, the witness said that he did not \u201ccare\u201d if the child\u2019s surname was \u201chyphenated,\u201d but that the father \u201chas the right\u201d for the child to carry his \u201clast name.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">We hold that the psychiatrist\u2019s testimony, and the record as a whole, fails to establish by satisfactory evidence that the change of name is in the child\u2019s best interest. The psychiatrist\u2019s opinions, which either were nonresponsive to the issue or were contradictory, focused mainly on the father\u2019s \u201crights,\u201d only tangentially addressing the child\u2019s interests. Actually, the testimony supports the view that the child\u2019s best interest will be served if his name remains unchanged. With his present name, he is healthy, happy, developing normally in school and socially, and is the best balanced of all the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">Consequently, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the name change. Thus, the order below will be reversed and the father\u2019s several petitions will be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>JUSTICE KOONTZ,</author>\n<p id=\"A0W\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">I concur with the majority\u2019s holding that this Court, and not the Court of Appeals of Virginia, has jurisdiction over this appeal. However, because I disagree with the majority\u2019s further holding that \u201cthe psychiatrist\u2019s testimony, and the record as a whole,\u201d fails to establish that the change of name in question is in the child\u2019s best interest and, therefore, that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the natural father\u2019s petition to change the surname of his child, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The majority gives little, if any, consideration to the mandate of Code \u00a7 8.01-217 that unless the court finds that the change of a minor\u2019s name \u201cis not in the best interest of the minor,\u201d the court shall \u201corder a change of name.\u201d In the present case, the trial court was presented with a petition by the natural father to change the surname of his male child from Rowland, the stepfather\u2019s surname, to Shurbutt, the father\u2019s surname. The \u201crecord as a whole,\u201d carefully considered by the trial court, reflects that this father is not an \u201cabsentee\u201d parent. As a result of numerous legal proceedings since shortly after the child\u2019s birth, the courts have awarded \u201cphysical\u201d custody of the child to the mother and \u201cjoint legal custody\u201d of the child to both parents. At the father\u2019s request, the child\u2019s birth certificate was amended in 1996 to reflect that Mr. Shurbutt is the child\u2019s natural father. The father visits regularly with the child, provides regular financial support for him, and is active in the child\u2019s school activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Moreover, it is undisputed that the child is aware that Mr. Shurbutt is his father and that Mr. Rowland is his stepfather. Indeed, the child calls Mr. Shurbutt \u201cDad\u201d and Mr. Rowland \u201cPop.\u201d While the majority is critical of the testimony of the psychiatrist, he very clearly testified that the child should have the surname Shurbutt and should have had that name \u201cfrom the day he was bom.\u201d The psychiatrist reasoned that \u201cthe true identity\u201d of the child was important to the child, the change of name would be in the child\u2019s best interest because it would avoid difficulty in school, and \u201cthis is the time in [his] psychosexual development that [he needs] to be clear\u201d concerning his identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Applying the above quoted portion of Code \u00a7 8.01-217, the trial court concluded that the child\u2019s surname should be Shurbutt rather than Rowland. The trial court exercised its discretion to make the child\u2019s surname and his birth certificate reflect the child\u2019s true iden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>tity. I cannot conclude that such was an abuse of judicial discretion under the particular circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">There are, however, additional reasons that prompt my dissent in this case. In <em>Flowers v. Cain, </em>218 Va. 234, 237 S.E.2d 111 (1977), we acknowledged the proposition that a father\u2019s interest in having his child continue to use his surname is relevant to a determination of the child\u2019s best interest. <em>Id. </em>at 236, 237 S.E.2d at 113. While <em>Flowers </em>and subsequently <em>Beyah </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>231 Va. 432, 344 S.E.2d 909 (1986), address a change of name over the objection of a father, they both support the reasonable conclusion that absent \u201csubstantial reasons\u201d to the contrary, it is in the best interest of a child to have the surname of his father rather than the surname of his stepfather. Although we have not expressly stated it, the reason should be obvious. A surname is the family name, it reflects who we are, our true identity, and unless there are substantial reasons to the contrary a child should always be permitted to use his father\u2019s family name rather than the family name of a stepfather. Today the majority holding casts a shadow of doubt over the rationale of these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The circumstances in the present case are merely the reverse of those in <em>Flowers </em>and <em>Beyah. </em>There we prohibited a change of name over the objection of the father; here the father seeks a change of name to accurately reflect the child\u2019s true parentage. In my view, the interest of this father in having his child use his surname is also in the best interest of his child and should be accorded the same consideration as the interests of the fathers in those cases. Granting that consideration in this case, the child\u2019s surname should not remain \u201cRowland\u201d over the father\u2019s objection. In short, the trial court corrected what was wrong from the day the child was bom and made it right.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
