Bolling died later that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">On September 2, 1993, the clerk of the court below appointed Betty Chloe Bolling, the decedent\u2019s widow, as administrator of the intestate\u2019s estate. She duly qualified as the personal representative, giving bond in the penalty of $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">On August 21, 1995, a judge of the trial court (not the judge who ultimately presided over the dispute that is the subject of this appeal) entered the order that is the focus of this controversy. The order, entered under the style \u201cTeddy Wayne Bolling, Petitioner, vs: In re: The Estate of Ted Guy Bolling, Deceased,\u201d provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-12\">\u201cThis action came upon motion of Teddy Wayne Bolling to be appointed co-administrator for the exclusive purpose of bringing a legal action for the benefit of the estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-13\">\u201cBy agreement of the parties, the Court does ORDER that Teddy Wayne Bolling is appointed co-administrator of the estate of Ted Guy Bolling for the <em>exclusive </em>purpose of bringing legal action on behalf of the estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-14\">\u201cIn that this appointment is for an exclusive purpose, it is ORDERED that Betty Chloe Bolling retains the exclusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>authority to administer the estate of Ted Guy Bolling, and that this Order confers no power upon Teddy Wayne Bolling for the administration of the estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">\u201cShould there be any administrator\u2019s fee associated with the prosecution of the anticipated legal action on behalf of the estate, said fee shall be divided equally between the co-administrators.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The order was endorsed \u201cRequested\u201d by an attorney for Teddy Wayne Bolling, the decedent\u2019s son, and \u201cSeen\u201d by an attorney for Betty Chloe Bolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">On August 23, 1995, the present action was filed by appellant \u201cTeddy Wayne Bolling, Co-Administrator of the Estate of Ted Guy Bolling\u201d as plaintiff. The motion for judgment alleged the defendant breached the applicable standard in caring for the decedent and caused his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">Responding, the defendant filed a motion to abate. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-276 (abolishing pleas in abatement but allowing any defense heretofore permitted to be made by such plea, including lack of subject matter jurisdiction, to be made by written motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">The motion assigned two grounds: (1) that plaintiff had \u201cno right or standing to bring this action\u201d because the order appointing the \u201cco-administrator\u201d was \u201ccontrary to Virginia law, null and void\u201d; and (2) that, even if plaintiff was properly appointed as administrator of the estate, \u201cplaintiff has no right or standing to bring this action without the other co-administrator joining in the action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">On March 6, 1996, the same judge who entered the August 21, 1995 order entered an order under the style \u201cBetty Chloe Bolling, Plaintiff, vs. Teddy Wayne Bolling, Defendant.\u201d The order recited that Betty Chloe Bolling requested she be allowed to withdraw as administrator of the estate \u201cin favor of appointing an independent administrator, namely Walter Rivers, as to fulfill the duties as the Administrator of the Estate of Ted Guy Bolling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">The order allowed the withdrawal and appointed Rivers \u201cas the acting Administrator\u201d of the estate. The order was endorsed \u201cI ask for this\u201d by Betty Bolling\u2019s attorney and as \u201cSeen\u201d by the attorney for Teddy Wayne Bolling and by Rivers individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-12\">On July 15, 1998, under the style of the wrongful death action, the plaintiff filed a motion \u201cfor leave to amend the pleadings to add as a party plaintiff Walter Rivers, co-administrator of the estate of Ted Guy Bolling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Following a hearing and argument of counsel on the motion to abate, the trial court granted the motion, abated the action, and dismissed it from the docket. The court did not rule on the motion to amend the pleadings. We awarded the plaintiff this appeal from the December 1998 final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff assigns two errors. He contends the trial court erred (1) by granting the motion to abate and by finding that he lacked standing to bring this action, and (2) by refusing to substitute Rivers as a party plaintiff. We do not reach the second contention because the trial court did not rule on that issue, and the plaintiff has not assigned error to the court\u2019s alleged inaction. Rule 5:17(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Regarding the first contention, we do not agree with the plaintiff that the trial court erred. The case turns upon the validity of the August 21, 1995 order, purportedly appointing the decedent\u2019s son \u201cco-administrator\u201d for a limited purpose to serve with the decedent\u2019s widow, who, according to the order, retained \u201cthe exclusive authority to administer the estate.\u201d This was the state of the record when this action was filed on August 23, 1995, although the widow later withdrew and Rivers was appointed \u201can independent administrator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">In other words, whether Teddy Wayne Bolling, as \u201cco-administrator,\u201d had the authority and standing to prosecute the action on August 23 depends upon whether the order of August 21 was valid. We hold that it was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">An order is void when it has been entered by a court that did not have jurisdiction over the subject matter. <em>Evans v. Smyth-Wythe Airport Comm\u2019n, </em>255 Va. 69, 73, 495 S.E.2d 825, 828 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">A circuit court is a court of general jurisdiction regarding probate and the grant of administration of estates. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 64.1-75, -116, and -118. Such a court has jurisdiction regarding the whole subject matter and, even if it errs in taking jurisdiction in a particular case, the order generally is not void, but only voidable and cannot be questioned in any collateral proceeding. <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Avory, </em>55 Va. (14 Gratt.) 229, 236 (1858).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">The foregoing rule has two exceptions, one of which controls this case. If an intestate already has \u201ca personal representative in being\u201d when the order appointing another administrator is entered, such order is void. <em>Id. </em>This is because \u201c[tjhere must be an office, and that office must be vacant, in order to [have] a valid appointment of a personal representative.\u201d Until the office is vacant, \u201cdiere is in fact no \u2018subject matter,\u2019 to be within the jurisdiction of the court. That subject matter is[] the appointment of a personal representative to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>decedent who has none, and whose personal estate is therefore without an owner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">This ancient and settled rule has been followed consistently in our case law. For example, in <em>Beavers </em>v. <em>Beavers, </em>185 Va. 418, 423, 39 S.E.2d 288, 290 (1946), this Court held that when an administrator had been appointed and qualified, \u201cthe power of the court or clerk is exhausted, and no further appointment can be made until a vacancy occurs in the office in some way recognized by law.\u201d <em>See Rockwell v. Allman, </em>211 Va. 560, 561, 179 S.E.2d 471, 472 (1971) (citing <em>Andrews).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The <em>Andrews </em>rule has not been altered by statute. We have found no statutory authority for the procedure employed in this case with regard to the August 21 order, and the plaintiff has referred us to none. Indeed, the rule is consistent with the provisions of Code \u00a7 64.1-131, which enumerates the circumstances when the court may allow another to qualify on an estate and plainly requires an incumbent administrator to resign before allowing \u201cany other person to qualify as executor or administrator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Consequently, under the <em>Andrews </em>rule, the August 21 order is void because, at the time the order was entered, the decedent already had a properly qualified administrator in Virginia, Betty Chloe Bolling. Certainly, as the plaintiff argues, Virginia law allows joint administration of an estate. But that argument is irrelevant here. To obtain joint administration in this case, Betty Chloe Bolling\u2019s appointment should first have been revoked and then the son and widow could have been appointed as joint administrators. <em>See Lingle </em>v. <em>Cook\u2019s Adm\u2019rs, </em>73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 262, 265, 268 (1879).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Therefore, because the August 21 order is void, the plaintiff lacked standing to bring this wrongful death action for the reason that he was not the personal representative of the decedent\u2019s estate. Code \u00a7 8.01-50(B) (every wrongful death action \u201cshall be brought by and in the name of the personal representative\u201d of the deceased person). This means, of course, that the trial court properly granted the motion to abate, and the order dismissing the action will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Our decision today, however, shall be limited to the present case and shall operate prospectively only; this decision will not affect the validity of any orders entered in the past under circumstances similar to those underlying the order in issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
