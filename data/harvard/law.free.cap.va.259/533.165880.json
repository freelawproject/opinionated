Because the insureds in this case merely failed to perform those duties but did not refuse to do so, we will reverse the circuit court\u2019s judgment in favor of the insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">Robert V. Dye (the father), and his wife, Mary L. Dye (collectively, the parents), were the named insureds of a personal liability umbrella insurance policy (the policy), issued by State Farm Fire and Casualty Company (State Farm). Their son, Robert Glenn Dye (the son), was a resident of their household, and thus was also an insured under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">The son was the driver of a vehicle that allegedly struck and killed Jose Salvadore Antonio on April 1, 1995. Lou Ann Craig, personal representative of Antonio\u2019s estate, filed this declaratory judgment action in the circuit court, seeking a declaration, <em>inter alia, </em>that the son is covered under the policy with regard to that accident.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">State Farm denied coverage to the son because of the insureds\u2019 alleged failure to timely comply with the following policy provision contained in the section titled \u201cYOUR DUTIES TO US\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-12\">These are things you[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] must do for us. We may not provide coverage if you refuse to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-14\">1. notify us of an accident. If something happens that might involve this policy, you must let us know promptly. Send written notice to us or our agent. Include the names and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>addresses of the injured and witnesses. Also include the time, place and account of the accident. [<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">State Farm first received notice of the 1995 accident from the father on April 10 or 11, 1997, more than two years after the accident occurred. In a letter to State Farm, the father stated that the parents \u201cnever had the slightest idea\u201d that the policy would cover the son. The father further advised State Farm that he delivered a letter from an attorney representing Antonio\u2019s estate to State Farm\u2019s agent as soon as the father received the letter. The father got that letter at the same time Antonio\u2019s estate filed the wrongful death action against the son. That is also when the father first learned that the policy might extend coverage to the son with regard to the 1995 accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Soon thereafter, State Farm sent a reservation of rights letter to the parents, stating that \u201cdelay by or on behalf of the insured in giving prompt, written notice . . . concerning the accident\u201d may have violated the conditions of the policy. State Farm had no contact with the son prior to sending that letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">After State Farm answered the declaratory judgment action, Craig filed a motion for partial summary judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> State Farm responded by filing a motion for summary judgment based upon the allegedly untimely notice of the accident. After considering stipulated facts, the parties\u2019 memoranda, and oral argument, the trial court denied Craig\u2019s motion but granted State Farm\u2019s motion. The court concluded that the son \u201cis not covered under State Farm\u2019s Umbrella Policy and there is no coverage applicable to [the son] under the policy in question for failure to provide timely notice . . . .\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">We review the decision of the trial court under well-settled principles. \u201cAn insurance policy is a contract, and, as in the case of any other contract, the words used are given their ordinary and customary meaning when they are susceptible of such construction.\u201d <em>Hill v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>237 Va. 148, 152, 375 S.E.2d 727, 729 (1989). Similarly, \u201c[i]f the language of an insurance policy is unambiguous, we will give the words their ordinary meaning and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>enforce the policy as written.\u201d <em>United Services Auto. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>235 Va. 655, 657, 369 S.E.2d 196, 198 (1988). Finally, \u201c[s]ince the interpretation of a contract is a question of law, we are not bound by the trial court\u2019s conclusions on this issue, and we are permitted the same opportunity as the trial court to consider the contract language.\u201d <em>C.F. Garcia Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Enterprise Ford Tractor, Inc., </em>253 Va. 104, 107, 480 S.E.2d 497, 498-99 (1997) (citing <em>Langman </em>v. <em>Alumni Ass\u2019n of the Univ. of Virginia, </em>247 Va. 491, 498, 442 S.E.2d 669, 674 (1994); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Holyfield, </em>227 Va. 184, 187-88, 313 S.E.2d 396, 398 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">On appeal, State Farm argues that timely notice of an accident is a condition precedent to an insurance company\u2019s obligation to provide coverage, and that an insured must therefore substantially comply with an insurance policy\u2019s notice requirements. Thus, State Farm contends that, in this case, the insureds\u2019 <em>failure </em>to timely perform the duties listed in paragraph 1 warrants State Farm\u2019s denial of coverage to the son. The cases cited by State Farm in support of its position involved insurance policies that contained a common provision mandating that in the event of an accident, \u201cwritten notice . . . shall be given ... to the company or any of its authorized agents as soon as practicable.\u201d <em>State Farm Fire and Cas. Co. v. Scott, 236 </em>Va. 116, 119, 372 S.E.2d 383, 384 (1988); <em>accord Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Safeco Ins. Co. of America, 223 </em>Va. 317, 323, 288 S.E.2d 469, 473 (1982); <em>Lord </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>224 Va. 283, 285-86, 295 S.E.2d 796, 798 (1982); <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>221 Va. 592, 596, 272 S.E.2d 196, 198 (1980).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We held that compliance with such a notice provision is a condition precedent to coverage, with which the insured must substantially comply. <em>Scott, 236 </em>Va. at 120, 372 S.E.2d at 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">However, those cases are not dispositive of the question before us because there is an important difference between the language utilized in the notice provision found in those insurance policies and the terms of the provision at issue in the present case. The instant policy, like those in the cases cited by State Farm, requires the insureds to perform certain duties, such as notifying State Farm of an accident and sending written notice. However, in contrast to the notice provision in those other policies, the policy at issue today spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>cifically states that if the insureds \u201crefuse\u201d to perform the duties contained in paragraph 1, State Farm may not provide coverage. A similar provision incorporating the term \u201crefuse\u201d in conjunction with an insured\u2019s duties to the insurance company does not appear in those other policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Furthermore, we find it significant that, in the provision at issue, State Farm used only the verb \u201crefuse\u201d and did not include the verb \u201cfail.\u201d In other words, the policy does not state that if an insured refuses <em>or fails </em>to perform the required duties, State Farm may deny coverage. State Farm acknowledged that there is no evidence in the record of a \u201crefusal\u201d by the parents or the son to perform the duties required of them. Thus, unless the terms \u201crefuse\u201d and \u201cfail\u201d are synonymous, the insureds\u2019 failure in this case to perform the duties in paragraph 1 would not justify State Farm\u2019s denial of coverage to the son.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">To answer this inquiry, we look to the definitions of these terms. Since the policy does not define the term \u201crefuse,\u201d we give the word its \u201cordinary and accepted meaning.\u201d <em>Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Glick, </em>240 Va. 283, 288, 397 S.E.2d 105, 108 (1990). The verb \u201crefuse\u201d is defined as a \u201cpositive unwillingness to do or comply with\u201d something demanded or expected. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1910 (1993). A \u201crefusal\u201d is \u201c[t]he denial or rejection of something offered or demanded.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1285 (7th ed. 1999). These definitions denote an element of intent, manifested by a volitional act. <em>See Meeks </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>785 S.W.2d 18, 20 (Ark. 1990) (noting that definitions of term \u201c \u2018refuse\u2019 stress the active element of refusal[,] . . . expressing ... a determination not to do a particular thing\u201d); <em>Nebraska </em>v. <em>Medina, </em>419 N.W.2d 864, 867 (Neb. 1988) (\u201c \u2018To refuse[]\u2019 . . . requires that a person understand what is being asked of him and then in some way manifest nonacceptance, nonconsent, or unwillingness.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">By comparison, to \u201cfail\u201d to do some act denotes a deficiency; and a \u201cfailure\u201d is \u201c[a]n omission of an expected action ... or performance[,]\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 613, or the neglect of an assigned or expected action, Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 815. <em>See Laubach </em>v. <em>Franklin Square Hosp., </em>556 A.2d 682, 690 n.11 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1989), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>569 A.2d 693 (1990) (distinguishing \u201c[flailed\u201d from \u201crefused\u201d on basis that \u201crefused\u201d \u201cinvolves an act of the will,\u201d while \u201c[flailed\u201d may be \u201can act of inevitable necessity\u201d) (quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1152-53 (5th ed. 1979)). .</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Based on the distinction between the terms \u201crefuse\u201d and \u201cfail,\u201d we conclude that State Farm\u2019s attempt to equate the insureds\u2019 <em>failure </em>to timely comply with the requirements of paragraph 1 with a <em>refusal </em>to do so does not comport with the ordinary and customary meaning of the term \u201crefuse.\u201d Thus, the insureds\u2019 mere failure to timely perform the duties was not a refusal to do so and, therefore, did not trigger State Farm\u2019s option to deny coverage to the son.7</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">We are also not persuaded by State Farm\u2019s argument that the phrase \u201cif you refuse to:\u201d applies only to the duty immediately listed thereafter, i.e., \u201cnotify us of an accident.\u201d According to State Farm, the other requirements in paragraph 1 are separate duties of the insured that are not modified by that phase. However, the phrase \u201cif you refuse to:\u201d introduces and precedes all the duties listed in paragraph l.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 47a (colon \u201cindicates that what follows it coordinates with some element of what precedes\u201d it); <em>see also </em>H.W. Fowler, A Dictionary of Modern English Usage 589 (Sir Ernest Gowers ed., 2d ed. 1996); Thomas S. Kane, The New Oxford Guide to Writing 144, 282 (1988). Thus, we conclude that the phrase modifies, and applies to, all those duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the policy requires a \u201crefusal\u201d to perform the duties listed in paragraph 1, not merely a negligent delay or failure to do so, before State Farm can deny coverage. For these reasons, we will reverse the judgment of the circuit court, enter partial final judgment for Craig on the basis that the insureds did not \u201crefuse\u201d to perform their duties to State Farm, and remand for such further proceedings as are necessary. <em>See </em>note 5, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b557-15\"> Prior to filing this action, Craig, in her capacity as personal representative of Antonio\u2019s estate, filed a wrongful death action against the son.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b557-16\"> The policy provides that the terms \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d refer to the named insureds, as well as the named insureds\u2019 relatives who are residents of the named insureds\u2019 household.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b558-10\"> In this opinion, we will refer to this provision as \u201cparagraph 1.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b558-11\"> In her motion, Craig stated that she sought a judgment with regard to State Farm\u2019s notice defense. She acknowledged that State Farm has additional defenses and that those would be addressed in a subsequent motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b559-9\"> Similar language also appears in the policies at issue in <em>State Farm Fire and Cas. Co. v. Walton, </em>244 Va. 498, 503, 423 S.E.2d 188, 191 (1992), and <em>Dan River, Inc. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>227 Va. 485, 489, 317 S.E.2d 485, 487 (1984), two other cases upon which State Farm relies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b561-8\"><em> </em>In four of this Court\u2019s prior cases, <em>Angstadt v. Atlantic Mut. Ins. Co., </em>254 Va. 286, 292-93, 492 S.E.2d 118, 121-22 (1997); <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Davies, </em>226 Va, 310, 319, 310 S.E.2d 167, 172 (1983), <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Employers Mut. Liab. Ins.

Arghyris, </em>189 Va. 913, 929-30, 55 S.E.2d 16, 23 (1949), we discussed an insured\u2019s willful failure to cooperate with the insurer. Also, in <em>Porter, </em>we concluded that the insured willfully violated several policy provisions, including the notice and cooperation requirements. 221 Va. at 599, 272 S.E.2d at 200. However, the policies in those cases did not contain any language referring to an insured\u2019s refusal to perform certain duties while the instant policy contains such language. Thus, the Court did not discuss whether a \u201cwillful failure\u201d to perform a particular duty was comparable to a \u201crefusal\u201d to perform that duty. Therefore, none of those cases guide our decision today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b561-15\"> The phrase precedes not only paragraph 1 but also several other enumerated paragraphs that list additional duties of the insureds.
