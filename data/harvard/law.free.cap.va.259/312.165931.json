C. Diamond Corporation and Karlo Milic filed in the clerk\u2019s office of the court below a motion for judgment against appellant Glumina Bank d.d., for breach of contract. The plaintiffs sought recovery of $460,000 plus attorney\u2019s fees and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-13\">The plaintiffs alleged that Diamond is a Virginia corporation engaged in the business of real estate development and that Milic is an alien resident of the Commonwealth but a citizen of Croatia. The plaintiff further alleged that defendant is a bank located in Zagreb, Croatia.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-14\">The plaintiffs also alleged that on two occasions in June 1998, acting through Milic, they contracted with defendant \u201cto transfer, deliver, and supply\u201d to the corporation\u2019s bank account in Manassas a total of $460,000 from cash funds delivered in American dollars to defendant from the sale of real estate. The plaintiffs further alleged that defendant \u201cfailed to transfer, deliver, and supply the funds as promised.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-15\">The plaintiffs also alleged that on \u201cseveral occasions prior to\u201d June 1998, \u201cpursuant to contracts\u201d between the plaintiffs and defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>dant, the defendant \u201chad transferred, delivered, and supplied\u201d to the corporation\u2019s Manassas bank account funds received in Croatia from Milic.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\">Additionally, plaintiffs alleged that when the contracts were entered into on June 19 and 29, 1998, Milic and defendant \u201cclearly and definitely intended\u201d that the corporation be \u201ca direct beneficiary of those contracts,\u201d and that the corporation \u201cwas and is both a direct beneficiary and a third party beneficiary of those contracts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Also, plaintiffs alleged that they had made demand upon defendant \u201cto honor its contractual obligations to supply the funds\u201d to the corporation in Virginia but defendant \u201chas failed to do so and has refused to refund the funds to Milic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Finally, plaintiffs alleged that the trial court could exercise personal jurisdiction over defendant pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-328.1 (A)(2) (\u201ccourt may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person, who acts directly or by an agent, as to a cause of action arising from the person\u2019s . . . [contracting to supply services or things in this Commonwealth . . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The plaintiffs filed with the motion for judgment an affidavit for service of process on the Secretary of the Commonwealth as statutory agent for the nonresident defendant, as authorized by Code \u00a7 8.01-329(B). As required, the affidavit set forth the last known address of the defendant in Croatia.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">In a Certificate of Compliance, the Secretary of the Commonwealth reported to the trial court that service of the notice of motion for judgment was made on her on October 13, 1998, and that the suit papers were forwarded by registered mail to defendant at the Croatian address on November 2, 1998. Service was effective on November 10, 1998, when the Certificate of Compliance was filed in the circuit court. Code \u00a7 8.01-329(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">The defendant failed to file a pleading in response within 21 days after service of process; therefore, it was in default. Rule 3:5; Rule 3:17.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">On December 14, 1998, a paper labeled \u201cPleading on Motion for Judgement\u201d was lodged with the clerk of the trial court. It was signed \u201cGlumina Bank by Attorney . . . Mladen Simundic,\u201d giving a Croatian address. Defendant\u2019s counsel of record on appeal correctly admits that this \u201cresponsive pleading\u201d was not filed by an attorney authorized to practice law in Virginia and, as such, is a \u201cnullity and should be stricken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>On December 22, 1998, another Certificate of Compliance was filed in the trial court by the Secretary of the Commonwealth dated five days earlier. That document included another affidavit executed by plaintiffs\u2019 attorney to support service of process of a \u201cPraecipe\u201d upon the nonresident defendant. The Certificate reported: \u201cOn Dec 17 1998, papers described in the Affidavit were forwarded by Fed Ex mail, return receipt requested, to the party designated to be served with process in the Affidavit.\u201d The praecipe served on defendant through the Secretary of the Commonwealth was a notice and motion filed in the clerk\u2019s office below on December 7, 1998, returnable December 18, 1998, for entry of a default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">The hearing on the motion for default judgment was continued to February 19, 1999. On that day, counsel for the plaintiffs appeared in support of the motion. There was no appearance by or on behalf of the defendant. After a brief hearing, at which only an interpreter testified, the court entered a default judgment against the defendant in the amount of $460,000 plus interest and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Three days later, on February 22, 1999, defendant, through a Virginia attorney, filed a \u201cSpecial Appearance, Motion to Quash Service and Objection to Jurisdiction,\u201d as well as a \u201cNotice and Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment.\u201d Following a March 5, 1999 hearing on the several motions, at which counsel for the plaintiffs and counsel for the defendant appeared, the court denied the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The defendant appeals and contends the trial court erred in entering the default judgment. It argues that the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction over defendant, and that the service of process of the notice of motion for judgment and the praecipe through the Secretary of the Commonwealth was improper because none of the bases for personal jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 8.01-328.1 \u201chave been alleged or proven.\u201d These contentions are meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Of course, any money judgment rendered without personal jurisdiction over the defendant is void. <em>Finkel Outdoor Prods., Inc. v. Bell, </em>205 Va. 927, 931, 140 S.E.2d 695, 698 (1965). But as we already have said, Code \u00a7 8.01-328.1(A)(2), a part of Virginia\u2019s long-arm statute dealing with the exercise of in personam jurisdiction over nonresidents, permits courts of the Commonwealth to \u201cexercise personal jurisdiction over a person, who acts directly or by an agent, as to a cause of action arising from the person\u2019s . . . [contracting to supply services or things in this Commonwealth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">A \u201cperson,\u201d as used in the foregoing statute, includes a \u201ccommercial entity, whether or not a citizen or domiciliary of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Commonwealth and whether or not organized under the laws of this Commonwealth.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-328. Thus, nonresident defendant Glumina Bank qualifies as a \u201cperson\u201d under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\">\u201cThe function of our long-arm statute is to assert jurisdiction over nonresidents who engage in some purposeful activity in Virginia, to the extent permissible under the Due Process Clause of the Constitution of the United States.\u201d <em>Nan Ya Plastics Corp. U.S.A. v. DeSantis, </em>237 Va. 255, 259, 377 S.E.2d 388, 391, <em>cert. denied, </em>492 U.S. 921 (1989). <em>Accord Peninsula Cruise, Inc. v. New River Yacht Sales, Inc., </em>257 Va. 315, 319, 512 S.E.2d 560, 562 (1999). The Due Process Clause, however, protects a person\u2019s liberty interest in not being subject to the binding judgment of a forum unless the person has \u201ccertain minimum contacts\u201d within the territory of the forum so that maintenance of the action does not offend \u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d <em>DeSantis, </em>237 Va. at 259, 377 S.E.2d at 391 (quoting <em>International Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945)). <em>Accord Peninsula Cruise, </em>257 Va. at 319, 512 S.E.2d at 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">To determine whether this nonresident defendant engaged in some purposeful activity in Virginia and whether it had sufficient minimum contacts within the Commonwealth, we must examine the facts. In this case, because the defendant was in default under our rules of procedure, the trial court properly could find the factual allegations of the motion for judgment accurate, as those allegations related to personal jurisdiction. <em>See Landcraft Co. v. Kincaid, </em>220 Va. 865, 874, 263 S.E.2d 419, 425 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Those jurisdictional facts establish that defendant, pursuant to contracts between the plaintiffs and defendant entered into before June 19, 1998, had transferred to the Diamond Corporation\u2019s Manassas bank account funds received in Croatia from Milic. In accord with this prior course of dealing, the defendant entered into two more contracts in June 1998 in which it promised again to transfer to the corporation\u2019s Manassas bank account a total of $460,000 delivered in cash by Milic to defendant. According to the facts, the defendant breached both of the June contracts by failing to honor its obligations to supply the funds to the corporation\u2019s Virginia account or to refund the money to Milic.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Consequently, the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action for breach of contract clearly arises from the defendant\u2019s \u201c[contracting to supply services or things in this Commonwealth,\u201d in the language of the long-arm statute. Manifestly, the nonresident defendant has engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>in purposeful activity in Virginia, and there are sufficient minimum contacts within Virginia so that maintenance of this action here does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. <em>See Elefteriou </em>v. <em>Tanker Archontissa, </em>443 F.2d 185, 188 (4th Cir. 1971) (failure to make payment to seaman under contract made outside United States by ship owner for payment within Virginia provides basis for assertion of personal jurisdiction for owner\u2019s supplying services or things in Virginia within meaning of long-arm statute). <em>Compare Promotions, Ltd. v. Brooklyn Bridge Centennial Comm\u2019n, </em>763 F.2d 173, 175 (4th Cir. 1985) (seeking to enforce its right to sell the Brooklyn Bridge, entrepreneur plaintiff, a Virginia corporation, failed to establish personal jurisdiction over New York defendants in Virginia under portion of long-arm statute at issue here because \u201cany contract between plaintiff and defendants was made and was to be carried out in New York. The long arm of \u00a7 8.01 does not extend to a contract formed and performed outside Virginia\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">The defendant\u2019s second contention that service of the notice of motion for judgment and the praecipe through the Secretary of the Commonwealth was improper because none of the bases for personal jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 8.01-328.1 \u201chave been alleged or proven\u201d is but a rehash of its first contention. Code \u00a7 8.01-329 plainly provides for service of process to be made upon the Secretary of the Commonwealth as statutory agent of a person against whom \u201cthe exercise of personal jurisdiction is authorized\u201d under Code \u00a7 8.01-328.1. This nonresident defendant is such a person, as we have just demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">In sum, there was full compliance by the plaintiffs with each procedural requirement leading to the judgment by default. <em>See Landcraft Co., 220 </em>Va. at 872-73, 263 S.E.2d at 424. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court properly entered the default judgment, and it will be</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
