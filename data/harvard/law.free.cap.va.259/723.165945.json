We also review Bailey\u2019s convictions for the first-degree murder of Katherine Ester Bailey (Katherine), Bailey\u2019s wife, and use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>of a firearm in the commission of capital murder and first-degree murder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Under familiar principles of appellate review, we will review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party prevailing below. <em>Clagett v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 79, 84, 472 S.E.2d 263, 265 (1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 1122 (1997). In his opening brief, Bailey recounts a self-serving narrative of his wife\u2019s infidelity which he contends drove him to commit these crimes. The facts underlying this narrative were developed during the penalty-determination phase of Bailey\u2019s trial as evidence in mitigation against the death penalty. The prurient details of this evidence are not relevant to any issue to be considered in these appeals other than the appropriateness of the imposition of the death penalty. Accordingly, we will limit our present recitation of the facts to those relevant to our consideration of Bailey\u2019s assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Bailey was married to Katherine, his cousin whom he had known most of his life and with whom he had been romantically involved for over a year, on December 25, 1993 in Reno, Nevada. In March 1996, Katherine gave birth to the couple\u2019s son, Nathan. After the birth of their son, the couple became emotionally estranged, although they continued living in the same household.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">In mid-1998, Bailey began relating to his co-workers a fabricated account of his wife having received threatening telephone calls and notes. Bailey subsequently admitted to police that he invented these stories in order to divert suspicion from himself when he murdered his wife. In August 1998, Bailey borrowed a .22-caliber pistol from a friend and purchased ammunition for the pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">On September 10, 1998, Bailey awoke about 4:30 a.m., went to the bedroom where his wife was sleeping, and shot her three times in the head with the borrowed pistol. Bailey then heard Nathan awaking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>in the next bedroom. He went to his son\u2019s bedroom and shot the child twice in the head as the child was climbing out of bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Bailey washed blood off his face and dressed for work. He cut the bathroom window screen with a razor knife and cut the outside telephone line in order to give the appearance that a break-in had occurred. Bailey then left for work, taking the pistol and razor knife with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">When Bailey arrived at work, he told Richard Moravec, his supervisor, that his wife had received another threatening note that read \u201cX-U-T\u201d or \u201cX-U-P\u201d and that he believed this meant \u201cTime\u2019s up.\u201d Bailey repeated this story to Joseph Yount, Moravec\u2019s supervisor. A short time later, Bailey told Moravec that he had received a telephone call from someone claiming that he \u201chad [Bailey\u2019s] wife.\u201d Moravec reported these events to Yount, who instructed Moravec to call the police. Yount then accompanied Bailey to Bailey\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">When Yount and Bailey arrived at Bailey\u2019s home, police had already arrived and an officer emerging from one of the bedrooms stopped the two men in the living room. Yount suggested that they wait outside. Yount later testified that as they waited Bailey \u201cwas stone-faced and cold-looking.\u201d Thomas Killilea, a detective with the Hampton Police Department, informed Bailey that his wife and son were dead. Killilea testified that upon hearing this, Bailey lurched forward and appeared to have tears in his eyes. Bailey then told Killilea about the threatening telephone calls and notes that he claimed his wife had received.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">Killilea asked Bailey to accompany him to the police station and Bailey agreed. Bailey rode in the front of Killilea\u2019s police vehicle; Yount rode in the back seat. Bailey was not under arrest at this time. At the police station, Bailey signed a consent form allowing the police to search his home; he also consented to take a polygraph test. While at the police station, Bailey was offered food, drink, and the opportunity to use the lavatory. He engaged the police officers in casual conversation and was allowed to step outside to smoke cigarettes. During this time, Bailey wrote a statement detailing the fictitious story of the threats made against his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">The polygraph was administered to Bailey at 12:15 p.m. During the polygraph, the examiner detected deception in Bailey\u2019s response to the question, \u201cAre you intentionally withholding the name of the killer ...?\u201d The examiner asked Bailey if he thought it was time to tell the detectives \u201cwhat was really going on.\u201d Bailey looked at the floor and answered, \u201c[Y]eah.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>At 1:42 p.m., Bailey was taken to an interview room where Killilea and Detective Jimmy L. Forbes spoke to him for a little over an hour. Bailey was mostly unresponsive during this interview. Forbes raised the subject of his own religious beliefs. He suggested that Bailey needed to get his \u201cheart right with the Lord and that his soul would not rest until he did.\u201d Bailey asked for a soft drink. When Killilea left the room to get the soft drink, Bailey took a legal pad and pen from the table in the interview room and wrote, \u201cI Mark Bailey do hereby without any coercsion |&gt;/c] admit to the murder of my wife and son.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">When Killilea returned with the soft drink, Forbes showed him the statement Bailey had written. Bailey then said, \u201cYou got what you wanted. I guess I\u2019m not leaving now.\u201d At 3:19 p.m., Bailey was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and the detectives began an interrogation that lasted until 5:45 p.m. During this period Bailey wrote out answers to the detectives\u2019 questions and a videotape of his confession to the murders was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">During his stay at the police station Bailey never asked to leave, nor did he request an attorney. At the conclusion of the interrogation, Bailey remarked to Killilea, \u201cYou probably think I\u2019m an [expletive deleted] for killing my wife and family - - or my wife and son.\u201d The detective explained that if he had thought that he would not have treated Bailey with dignity and respect. Bailey agreed he had been \u201ctreated well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"A7s\">\n<em>A. Pre-trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">On December 7, 1998, the grand jury of the City of Hampton returned an indictment against Bailey charging him with the capital murder of Nathan as part of the same act or transaction as the killing of Katherine, Code \u00a7 18.2-31(7), \u201cand/or\u201d as the killing of a person under the age of fourteen by a person twenty-one years of age or older, Code \u00a7 18.2-31(12). In separate indictments, Bailey was also charged with the first-degree murder of Katherine, Code \u00a7 18.2-32, and with one count of the use of a firearm in each of the two killings, Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">On January 12, 1999, Bailey filed a motion for the appointment of an \u201cexpert investigator.\u201d Bailey contended that he needed the assistance of an investigator to \u201clocate essential witnesses and data, [and] examine and evaluate testimony and documents ... likely to be significant at a capital murder trial.\u201d By order entered that same day, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>the trial court denied the motion, finding there was no \u201csufficient reasonable cause for an investigator to be assigned to the defense in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">On February 9, 1999, Bailey filed a motion to have the Virginia capital murder and death penalty statutes declared unconstitutional. Within a supporting memorandum filed with that motion, Bailey set out various arguments that the manner in which capital murder trials are conducted and death sentences reviewed on appeal violated aspects of the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. Since Bailey challenges the denial of his motion by the trial court in this appeal, we need not recite those arguments here, but will address them in our discussion of Bailey\u2019s assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">On that same day, Bailey filed a motion for discovery and inspection. Within that motion, Bailey made a litany of requests for information from the Commonwealth, which, as his counsel subsequently conceded during argument of the motion, went well beyond any reasonable interpretation of what the Commonwealth could be required to provide a defendant under Rule 3A:11 and the dictates of <em>Brady v. </em>Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). The trial court, acknowledging that the Commonwealth had an \u201copen file\u201d policy, granted the motion only to the extent that criminal discovery is required by Rule 3A:11.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">On March 29, 1999, Bailey filed a motion to suppress the statements he made to the police on September 10, 1998. During oral argument in support of that motion, Bailey contended that any statements made to the police prior to his having been read his <em>Miranda </em>rights were the product of an improper custodial interrogation. He further contended that his confession given thereafter was not voluntary because the detectives through trickery and manipulation had overborne his will. After hearing evidence from the three detectives principally responsible for the interview and interrogation of Bailey, the trial court found that Bailey had not been in custody prior to his initial admission of culpability for the murders and that his subsequent confession was not the result of his will having been overborne by the detectives. The trial court denied the suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">On May 5, 1999, Bailey filed a motion for a bill of particulars requesting, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Commonwealth specify which of the aggravating factors of future dangerousness or vileness it would rely upon in seeking to impose the death penalty and the evidence in support thereof it would present. Following oral argument on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>motion, the trial court denied the motion, finding that the indictment adequately informed Bailey of the nature of the charges brought against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">\n<em>B. Guilt-determination Phase</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">On July 20, 1999, a three-day jury trial commenced in the trial court. Evidence in accord with the facts recited above concerning the events of September 10, 1998 was developed through the testimony of various police officers and Bailey\u2019s co-workers. In addition, the Commonwealth presented forensic evidence through the testimony of Assistant Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Leah L.E. Bush.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">Dr. Bush performed autopsies on the bodies of both victims. She testified that Katherine had sustained three gunshot wounds to the parieto-occipital area of the skull behind the left ear. From the absence of powder stippling on the body, Dr. Bush estimated that the shots had been fired from a distance of three feet or more and that any one of the three wounds would have been lethal. Dr. Bush further testified that Nathan had sustained two close range gunshot wounds to the head and that both shots penetrated the brain and either alone would have been lethal.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">The Commonwealth introduced photographs of the crime scene through the testimony of Patrol Officer Keith Tucker and paramedic Chris Skutans, who were among the first to arrive at the crime scene. Each testified that these photographs depicted what they saw inside the house, the only difference being that the house had been dark when they entered it and the photographs showed the scene illuminated rather than dark. The trial court admitted these photographs in evidence over Bailey\u2019s objection that a proper foundation had not been laid for their admission. Bailey also objected to several of these photographs and to autopsy photographs of both victims on the grounds that they were inflammatory and irrelevant. The trial court overruled this objection, finding that the photographs were relevant to show the nature of the victims\u2019 wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">Bailey did not testify or offer any evidence in his defense in the guilt-determination phase. Rather, Bailey relied on the content of his statement to police, arguing to the jury that it showed he had not planned or intended to kill his son, but that he had done so in a moment of passion after he panicked when he realized that Nathan would be traumatized by finding his mother\u2019s dead body. Similarly, he contended that the killing of Katherine was not premeditated, but the result of his mental anguish and emotional disturbance.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Bailey objected to two instructions proffered by the Commonwealth that permitted the jury to find Bailey guilty of two counts of capital murder based upon the two theories of capital murder stated in the indictment. Bailey contended that the indictment charged only one count of capital murder. The trial court found that the \u201cindictment is subject to two different, separate sections of the statute ... and [it would be] proper to actually have two capital murder charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">The jury found Bailey guilty of two counts of capital murder in the killing of Nathan as charged in the indictment, of first-degree murder in the killing of Katherine, and of both firearm charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">\n<em>C. Penalty-determination Phase</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Prior to the commencement of the penalty-determination phase, the Commonwealth elected not to present evidence of Bailey\u2019s future dangerousness to society. Thus, the Commonwealth relied solely upon the vileness aggravating factor to establish the appropriateness of imposing death sentences for the two capital murder convictions. The Commonwealth presented evidence of vileness based upon the statutory definition that \u201cthe offense ... involved ... depravity of mind or an aggravated battery to the victim.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Dr. Bush again testified for the Commonwealth and reiterated her prior testimony concerning the gunshot wounds sustained by the two victims. She further testified that the manner in which Nathan was killed was consistent with an \u201cexecution-style gunshot wound.\u201d The Commonwealth also presented victim-impact testimony from Katherine\u2019s mother. Prior to resting its case, the Commonwealth asked the trial court to instruct the jury to also consider all the testimony from the guilt-determination phase in considering the sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">Testifying for the defense, Dr. Evan Nelson, a clinical psychologist, described Bailey as suffering from a borderline personality disorder. Dr. Nelson testified that impulsive actions are characteristic of this condition. Dr. Nelson further opined that the killing of Nathan was \u201ca very impulsive act ... an impulsive, stupid, terrible, senseless act ... and that fits with [a diagnosis of a] borderline personality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">As mentioned previously, the balance of Bailey\u2019s evidence during the penalty-determination phase was directed toward establishing that his wife\u2019s infidelity and aberrant lifestyle had emotionally traumatized Bailey and, thus, mitigated his culpability for having committed these crimes. Although the Commonwealth does not dispute the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>essential facts as recounted by Bailey\u2019s witnesses, Bailey\u2019s interpretation that the evidence showed him to be the \u201cvictim\u201d of his wife\u2019s emotional manipulation was by no means established beyond controversion. It was for the jury to determine what weight to accord this evidence in determining Bailey\u2019s sentence. We are cognizant of the record and will consider it in our review of the jury\u2019s sentence even though we do not recount that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">Bailey objected to the Commonwealth\u2019s proposed verdict forms for the capital murder charges, which permitted the jury to impose a death sentence upon finding either that the killing of Nathan was vile because it resulted from an aggravated battery or because the murder resulted from a depravity of mind, or that both of these circumstances were present. Bailey contended that the forms were confusing, but acknowledged that the forms properly instructed the jury that it should impose a life sentence if it found that there was insufficient proof of the vileness aggravating factor under either theory relied upon by the Commonwealth. Bailey further indicated that he did not have alternative forms to proffer. The trial court adopted the Commonwealth\u2019s verdict forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">The jury imposed the death sentence for each of the capital murder charges, a life sentence for the first-degree murder charge, and a total of eight years for the firearm charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">\n<em>D. Post-trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Prior to the sentencing hearing, Bailey filed a motion requesting that the trial court obtain the records of capital murder cases maintained by this Court pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-313. The trial court denied the motion, indicating that it had already reviewed \u201ca large volume\u201d of relevant cases in anticipation of Bailey\u2019s trial and sentencing and that it was therefore not necessary for the trial court to obtain and review additional records from this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">In that same motion, Bailey sought to have the jury\u2019s death penalty verdict set aside on the ground that the sentence was disproportionate to sentences imposed in similar cases. Following the preparation of a pre-sentencing report, the trial court held a sentencing hearing and heard argument from Bailey concerning the appropriateness of imposing the death sentences. Bailey contended that the death sentence was not appropriate because the killing of a child by his parent was an \u201cemotional trigger\u201d which clouded the jury\u2019s judgment, but which did not indicate the requisite depravity of mind. Bailey asserted that the vileness of the crime was thus based solely on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>the question of an aggravated assault, and that the forensic evidence showed that the victims \u201cnever knew what hit them\u201d because the first shots would have been fatal or rendered the victims unconscious. The trial court confirmed the death sentences and the other sentences imposed by the jury. These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">\n<em>A. Moot Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Bailey\u2019s fourth assignment of error challenges the constitutionality of the Virginia death penalty statute on the ground that the Commonwealth may prove the aggravating factor of future dangerousness through evidence of unadjudicated criminal conduct. Because the Commonwealth did not present evidence during the penalty-determination phase concerning Bailey\u2019s future dangerousness to society, this issue is moot and need not be addressed. <em>See Swann </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>247 Va. 222, 228 n.2, 441 S.E.2d 195, 200 n.2, <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 889 (1994); <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 403, 414, 374 S.E.2d 46, 53 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1028 (1989). For the same reason, Bailey\u2019s challenges to the constitutionality of the future dangerousness aggravating factor that are part of his first and third assignments of error are also moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">\n<em>B. Issues Previously Decided</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">In his fourteenth assignment, Bailey asserts that the trial court erred in denying as overbroad that portion of his discovery motion that requested information from the Commonwealth beyond that requisite to meet the requirements of Rule 3A:11. Bailey contends that a capital murder defendant should be afforded more extensive discovery because of \u201cthe unique and irreversible nature of the death penalty.\u201d At the hearing on his motion, Bailey conceded that his motion requested any and all evidence Rule 3A:11 required the Commonwealth to provide him and \u201canything else including the kitchen sink.\u201d Bailey\u2019s motion and argument are virtually identical to those discussed in <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 54, 63, 515 S.E.2d 565, 570-71 (1999). As in that case, the record here reflects that Bailey received all of the discovery to which he was entitled. We find nothing in Bailey\u2019s argument that would warrant an extension of his discovery rights. <em>Id. </em>at 63, 515 S.E.2d at 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">Bailey further contends in his fifteenth assignment of error that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a bill of particulars. There is no merit to this contention. In <em>Strickler v. Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number><em>wealth, </em>241 Va. 482, 404 S.E.2d 227, <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 944 (1991), we held that when the indictment is sufficient to give the accused \u201cnotice of the nature and character of the offense charged so he can make his defense,\u201d a bill of particulars is not required. <em>Id. </em>at 490, 404 S.E.2d at 233; <em>see also Wilder </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 145, 147, 225 S.E.2d 411, 413 (1976). Here, there is no challenge to the sufficiency of the indictment. As in <em>Strickler, </em>those parts of Bailey\u2019s request for a bill of particulars seeking disclosure of the evidence upon which the Commonwealth intended to rely in the guilt and sentencing phases of the trial \u201care sweeping demands for pretrial disclosure of all the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence.\u201d <em>Strickler, </em>241 Va. at 490, 404 S.E.2d at 233. As such, the request for a bill of particulars was nothing more than an effort to obtain the same material Bailey had sought to obtain through his overbroad discovery motion. We find nothing in this record to warrant reconsideration of the well established principles reiterated in <em>Strickler </em>concerning a defendant\u2019s right to a bill of particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">C. <em>Matters Within the Trial Court\u2019s Discretion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Bailey\u2019s tenth, eleventh, and twelfth assignments of error concern rulings committed to the trial court\u2019s discretion. In each instance we find no evidence to support a finding of an abuse of that discretion and, accordingly, we hold that no error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Bailey contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to be provided the services of an \u201cexpert investigator.\u201d We have consistently rejected the contention that defendants, even in capital murder cases, have an indiscriminate entitlement to the assistance of an investigator. <em>See, e.g., George </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 264, 271, 411 S.E.2d 12, 16 (1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>503 U.S. 973 (1992) . Rather, as with any request for the Commonwealth to provide a defendant with expert assistance, the defendant must demonstrate that he has a particularized need, meaning one which is material to the preparation of his defense, for the services of an expert, and that the denial of such services would result in a fundamentally unfair trial. <em>See Husske v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 203, 212, 476 S.E.2d 920, 925 (1996). The determination whether a defendant has adequately demonstrated a particularized need for the assistance of an expert rests within the discretion of the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at 212, 476 S.E.2d at 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">Bailey asserted in his motion that he required an investigator to \u201clocate essential witnesses and data, [and] examine and evaluate testimony and documents ... likely to be significant at a capital murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>trial.\u201d At the hearing on his motion, Bailey merely reiterated his \u201cneed [for] some additional assistance by way of the investigation\u201d being conducted by his counsel. These assertions fall far short of demonstrating a particularized need for the services of an expert. \u201cMere hope or suspicion that favorable evidence is available is not enough to require that such help be provided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 212, 476 S.E.2d at 925. Accordingly, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in denying Bailey\u2019s motion for the services of an expert investigator.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Bailey contends that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence thirteen photographs of the crime scene without proper foundation. He contends that these photographs were not initially proffered by the photographer who produced them and that they did not accurately reflect the crime scene at the time the subscribing witness first observed it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The thirteen photographs at issue were introduced during the testimony of Officer Tucker and Skutans, the paramedic. Each testified that the photographs accurately depicted the murder scene except that the scene was more brightly lit in the photographs than it had been.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">We consistently have held that the admission of photographs into evidence rests within the sound discretion of a trial court, and that the trial court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless the record discloses a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Walton v. Commonwealth, 256 </em>Va. 85, 91-92, 501 S.E.2d 134, 138, <em>cert. denied, 525 </em>U.S. 1046 (1998); <em>Goins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>251 Va. 442, 459, 470 S.E.2d 114, 126, <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 887(1996). Photographs are generally admitted into evidence for two purposes: to illustrate a witness\u2019 testimony, and as an \u201cindependent silent witness\u201d of matters revealed by the photograph. <em>See Ferguson v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 745, 746, 187 S.E.2d 189, 190, <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 861 (1972). \u201c[A] photograph which is verified by the testimony of a witness as fairly representing what that witness has observed is admissible in evidence and ... it need not be proved by the photographer who made it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Here, the testimony of the two witnesses that the photographs fairly represented what they had observed was adequate to establish the authenticity of the representation of the photographs. <em>Clagett, 252 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>Va. at 87, 472 S.E.2d at 268. The mere fact that the lighting was different at the time the photographs were taken is not sufficient to render their admission into evidence by the trial court an abuse of discretion. <em>See id. </em>at 86, 472 S.E.2d at 267 (permitting jury to view videotape of crime scene where bodies of victims had been moved by emergency personnel was not abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">Bailey also asserts that the trial court erred in admitting four photographs of the crime scene and eight autopsy photographs of the victims, on the ground that they were cumulative, gruesome, and unduly inflammatory. Specifically with respect to the photographs of Nathan, Bailey asserts that because he stipulated to \u201cthe manner of the child\u2019s death\u201d as depicted by diagrams in the autopsy report, the crime scene and autopsy photographs \u201cadded nothing to the information the jurors already possessed\u201d and \u201cdid not tend to show motive, intent, method, premeditation, malice, or the degree of atrociousness of the crime.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Admission of graphic photographs rests within the discretion of the trial court so long as they are relevant and accurately portray the scene of the crime or the condition of the victim. <em>See Clozza </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 124, 135, 321 S.E.2d 273, 280 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1230 (1985). Contrary to Bailey\u2019s assertion, his stipulation to \u201cthe manner of the child\u2019s death\u201d did not render the crime scene and autopsy photographs cumulative or irrelevant. The autopsy photographs were relevant to explain the clinical illustrations of Nathan\u2019s wounds in the autopsy report. Moreover, it is self-evident that all these photographs tended to establish the method, maliciousness, and degree of atrociousness of the crime. <em>Walton, </em>256 Va. at 92, 501 S.E.2d at 138; <em>Goins, </em>251 Va. at 459, 470 S.E.2d at 126.

Constitutionality of the Virginia Capital Punishment Statutes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Bailey\u2019s first, second, third, fifth, and sixth assignments of error repeat the challenges to the constitutionality of the Virginia death penalty statute and the statutory scheme under which capital murder trials are conducted and death sentences are reviewed on appeal that the trial court rejected in addressing Bailey\u2019s pre-trial motion. We have thoroughly addressed and rejected in numerous prior capital murder cases the arguments raised in these assignments of error, and we find no reason to modify our previously expressed views on these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>In <em>Breard </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 68, 74, 445 S.E.2d 670, 674-75, <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 971 (1994), we rejected the assertion that capital punishment statutes do not give meaningful guidance to a jury because they do not require the jury to find that aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating ones before fixing the death penalty. In <em>Brear\u00e1 </em>we also rejected the contention that the method of instructing jury on mitigation impermissibly interferes with jury\u2019s consideration of evidence offered in mitigation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">In <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 543, 552, 364 S.E.2d 483, 488, <em>cert. denied, </em>486 U.S. 1017 (1988), we rejected the assertion that the vileness aggravating factor is unconstitutionally vague. Similarly, we have repeatedly rejected the contentions that the death penalty constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment, <em>see, e.g., Joseph v. Commonwealth, </em>249 Va. 78, 82, 452 S.E.2d 862, 865, <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 876 (1995), and that the method of review of a death sentence by trial court and by this Court on appeal are unconstitutional, <em>see, e.g., Walker v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 54, 61, 515 S.E.2d 565, 569 (1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>_U.S._, 120 S.Ct. 955 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">In his seventh assignment of error, Bailey contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that this Court has failed in its statutory duty under Code \u00a7 17.1-313(E) to maintain \u201crecords of all capital felony cases\u201d for use in the proportionality review required by Code \u00a7 17.1-313(C)(2), and that this constitutes a violation of \u201cBailey\u2019s due process and other constitutional rights.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Code \u00a7 17.1-313(A) requires that \u201c[a] sentence of death, upon the judgment thereon becoming final in the circuit court, shall be reviewed on the record by the Supreme Court.\u201d As part of that mandatory review, subsection (C)(2) of the statute directs this Court to determine \u201c[w]hether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\u201d Code \u00a7 17.1-313(E) further provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-8\">The Supreme Court <em>may </em>accumulate the records of all capital felony cases tried <em>within such period of time as the court may determine. </em>The court shall consider <em>such records as are available </em>as a guide in determining whether the sentence imposed in the case under review is excessive.

In addition, these records have been summarized in digest form, and are cross-indexed according to the offense of conviction, the sentence imposed, and whether a jury or the trial court imposed that sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">Moreover, contrary to Bailey\u2019s assertion that the maintenance of \u201ccomplete\u201d records is requisite to the preservation of his right to a proportionality review of his death sentence, nothing in the statute, nor in the case law relied upon by Bailey, prescribes the method by which an appellate court conducts a proportionality review of a death sentence. Rather, so long as the methods employed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>assure that the death sentence is not disproportionate to the penalty generally imposed for comparable crimes, due process will be satisfied and the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Additional challenges to the constitutionality of the capital appellate review process raised within Bailey\u2019s seventh assignment of error have been previously addressed, and we find no reason to modify our previously expressed views. <em>See, e.g., Payne v. Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. 460, 473-74, 357 S.E.2d 500, 508-09, <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 933 (1987) (procedures for appellate review of death penalty cases, including expedited review, provide a meaningful appeal and are constitutional).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">On a related issue, in his twentieth assignment of error, Bailey contends that the trial court erred in refusing his motion that it obtain from this Court and review the records of prior capital murder cases maintained pursuant to Code 17.1-313(E) before determining whether the death sentences were appropriate, or to set them aside for \u201cgood cause shown\u201d pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-264.5.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">As noted above, Code \u00a7 17.1-313(E) requires that \u201c[s]uch records as are accumulated [by this Court] shall be made available to the circuit courts.\u201d We have previously supplied our records to a circuit court upon request. <em>See Bunch </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 423, 448, 304 S.E.2d 271, 285, <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 977 (1983). However, nothing in the statute requires the circuit court to make such a request, the matter being one committed to the trial court\u2019s discretion. Here, the trial court indicated that it had reviewed a large number of cases to permit it to fairly determine whether the death sentences were appropriate. Moreover, nothing in the record constitutes good cause shown to set these sentences aside and for the trial court to have imposed life sentences. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s denial of Bailey\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">In his motion to have the Virginia death penalty statute and the statutory scheme under which capital murder trials are conducted and death sentences are reviewed on appeal declared unconstitutional, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>Bailey contended that the Commonwealth\u2019s system of appointing counsel in capital cases results in a denial of the right to effective assistance of counsel. The trial court rejected this contention without comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">In addition, in his eighth assignment of error, Bailey asserts that \u201cVirginia has no system for appointment of counsel ... [and] expends no public funds on education, assistance, or training of capital defense counsel.\u201d Bailey further asserts that appointed counsel in capital cases are \u201cdisproportionately from small firms with resources inadequate to defend a capital murder charge.\u201d Bailey also contends that the Commonwealth fails to provide meaningful review of ineffective assistance of counsel claims raised in habeas corpus petitions. According to Bailey, \u201c[t]hese factors, individually and collectively, violate Bailey\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Bailey\u2019s assertion that Virginia has no system for the appointment of counsel in capital cases is demonstrably in error. Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-163.7 and 19.2-163.8 provide, in capital cases, for the appointment of counsel who meet qualifications determined by the Public Defender Commission in conjunction with the Virginia State Bar. These statutes provide the criteria to be considered in determining the qualifications for attorneys so appointed, including the requirements that they have \u201ccurrent training in death penalty litigation ... [and a] demonstrated proficiency and commitment to quality representation.\u201d We are of opinion that this statutory scheme for identifying and appointing qualified attorneys to represent indigent defendants in capital murder cases adequately safeguards those defendants\u2019 constitutionally guaranteed right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Bailey cites no authority for the proposition that a state is required, as part of its obligation to afford indigent defendants with appointed counsel in capital cases, to further provide for the education, assistance, or training of such counsel. In any case, there is no merit to Bailey\u2019s contention that Virginia fails to allocate public funds for these purposes. In addition to establishing and funding the Public Defender Commission, the General Assembly, through the appropriation made for the Virginia State Bar, allocates funds for the Virginia Capital Representation Resource Center. <em>See, e.g., 1998-2000 Executive Budget, </em>1999 Amendments, page B-17 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">Moreover, in 1998, the General Assembly authorized a study of \u201cthe quality of capital representation of indigent defendants in Virginia ... [and] the standards for qualification of counsel promulgated pursuant to [Code] \u00a7 19.2-163.8.\u201d House Joint Resolution 190, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>Acts 1998, at p. 2649. Although recommending certain improvements in the manner in which counsel are appointed in capital cases, the authors of the study concluded that \u201c[t]he overall state of the system for representation of indigent capital defendants is good.\u201d Report of the Virginia State Crime Commission, <em>Capital Representation of Indigent Defendants, </em>House Document 60, at 1 (1999). According to a survey conducted as part of the study, the quality of representation by appointed counsel in capital murder trials, as appraised by the trial court judges, met or exceeded the desired level of expertise and performance ninety-eight percent of the time. <em>Id. </em>at 19. This empirical data refutes Bailey\u2019s wholly unsupported assertion that appointed counsel in capital murder cases are generally unqualified to provide effective representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">We further reject Bailey\u2019s contention, also unsupported by reference to any credible data, that appointed counsel in capital murder trials are \u201cdisproportionately from small firms with resources inadequate to defend a capital murder charge.\u201d Pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-163, counsel appointed in capital murder cases may receive a fee in \u201can amount deemed reasonable by the court\u201d and \u201cpayment of such reasonable expenses incurred.\u201d Accordingly, the ability of an appointed attorney to represent a capital murder defendant is not limited to the independent resources available to that attorney from his or her law firm because the trial court will compensate the attorney for any reasonable expenditure of time and expenses. Moreover, we are unwilling to accept Bailey\u2019s unsupported assertion that attorneys in \u201csmall firms\u201d are not in a position to adequately defend a client charged with capital murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Bailey\u2019s contention that Virginia fails to provide meaningful review of ineffective assistance of counsel claims raised in habeas corpus petitions does not state an allegation of a facial or systemic violation of the constitutionally guaranteed right to counsel. Moreover, Bailey has not proffered any evidence in support of this contention. Accordingly, we reject this unsupported contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">For these reasons, we hold that Virginia\u2019s statutory scheme for the conduct of capital murder trials and the review of death sentences does not violate the due process rights and other protections afforded by the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>\n<em>E. Suppression of Bailey\u2019s Statements to Police</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">In his thirteenth assignment of error, Bailey contends that the trial court should have suppressed all statements made by him to the police because his initial confession was made before he received <em>Miranda </em>warnings. He further contends that his detailed confession was the result of police coercion. We disagree with both of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Bailey premises his argument that his initial statements were inadmissible and, thus, taint his subsequent full confession, given after he received <em>Miranda </em>warnings, on the ground that he had not waived his rights against self-incrimination and to the benefit of counsel \u201cduring in-custody questioning.\u201d The difficulty with this argument is that it fails to address the trial court\u2019s finding that prior to Bailey\u2019s making his initial confession he was not in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">In Miranda, the Supreme Court held that, before an individual may be questioned by police, he must be warned of his right to remain silent and his right to an attorney only when that \u201cindividual is taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom by the authorities in any significant way and is subjected to questioning.\u201d <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 478 (1966). The Supreme Court subsequently explained in <em>Oregon v. Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492 (1977), that <em>Miranda </em>warnings are implicated only during a custodial interrogation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-7\">Any interview of one suspected of a crime by a police officer will have coercive aspects to it, simply by virtue of the fact that the police officer is part of a law enforcement system which may ultimately cause the suspect to be charged with a crime. But police officers are not required to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings to everyone whom they question. Nor is the requirement of warnings to be imposed simply because the questioning takes place in the station house, or because the questioned person is one whom the police suspect. <em>Miranda </em>warnings are required only where there has been such a restriction on a person\u2019s freedom as to render him \u201cin custody.\u201d It was that sort of coercive environment to which <em>Miranda </em>by its terms was made applicable, and to which it is limited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">We have also observed that <em>Miranda </em>warnings are not required in every instance when a suspect is interrogated at a police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>station. <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 31, 47, 307 S.E.2d 864, 872 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1109 (1984). We have stated that \u201c[i]t is the custodial nature rather than the location of the interrogation that triggers the necessity for giving <em>Miranda </em>warnings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 47, 307 S.E.2d at 872; <em>accord Burket v. Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 596, 605, 450 S.E.2d 124, 129 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>514 U.S. 1053 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Bailey clearly was not in custody such as is contemplated by <em>Miranda </em>at the time he made his initial confession. The record shows that he voluntarily accompanied police to the police station in an effort to continue the ruse that his wife had received threatening telephone calls and notes. His interaction with police throughout the morning and into the early afternoon was entirely voluntary and Bailey was made aware on more than one occasion that he was free to leave, if he so desired. Accordingly, we find no merit to Bailey\u2019s contention that any statements he made prior to being given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights. Thus, Bailey\u2019s initial confession was admissible and did not taint his subsequent confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Bailey nonetheless contends that the detailed confession, obtained after he had been taken into custody and was given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, was not voluntary. He contends that \u201c[t]he interrogators effectively tricked, coerced and cajoled [him] into making incriminating statements\u201d and, thus, that his \u201cwill was overborne by the interrogators.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">When determining whether a defendant\u2019s will has been overborne, the totality of the circumstances, including the defendant\u2019s experience and background as well as the conduct of the police, must be examined. <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. 313, 324, 356 S.E.2d 157, 163, <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 873 (1987). While the question whether a statement is voluntary is ultimately a legal rather than a factual one, subsidiary factual determinations made by the trial court are entitled to a presumption of correctness. Thus, the trial court\u2019s finding that Bailey\u2019s will was not overborne is a factual finding, entitled on appeal to the same weight as a finding by a jury, and will not be disturbed unless plainly wrong. <em>Witt v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 670, 674-75, 212 S.E.2d 293, 297 (1975). The evidence summarized above is fully sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that Bailey knowingly and voluntarily waived his Fifth Amendment rights when he gave his detailed confession to the police. Thus, the trial court\u2019s denial of Bailey\u2019s suppression motion was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>\n<em>F. Jury Instructions and Sentencing Form</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">In his sixteenth assignment of error, Bailey contends that the trial court erred during the guilt-determination phase in giving separate instructions proffered by the Commonwealth defining capital murder as the killing of more than one person as a part of the same act or transaction, Code \u00a7 18.2-31(7), and capital murder as the killing of a person under the age of fourteen by a person age twenty-one or older, Code \u00a7 18.2-31(12). Bailey contends that the instructions were confusing in that they implied to the jury that \u201cit might convict Bailey of capital murder twice, even though Bailey had only been indicted on a single count of capital murder, which set forth disjunctively the two grounds for the capital murder charge.\u201d The Commonwealth contends that the indictment was worded to permit convictions for two offenses of capital murder. We agree with the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">In <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 216, 509 S.E.2d 293 (1999), the defendant was charged in separate indictments with two offenses of capital murder of one victim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We held that \u201cit is clear, as well as logical, that the General Assembly intended for each statutory offense [in Code \u00a7 18.2-31] to be punished separately \u2018as a Class 1 felony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228, 509 S.E.2d at 301. In this case, two offenses of capital murder were charged in a single indictment. This distinction from <em>Payne </em>does not, however, preclude the conclusion that the indictment charged two capital murder offenses upon which Bailey could be convicted and sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">A single indictment may charge \u201c[t]wo or more offenses ... if the offenses are based on the same act or transaction.\u201d Rule 3A:6. Contrary to Bailey\u2019s assertion, the indictment for the capital murder of Nathan does not charge two offenses of capital murder exclusively in the disjunctive. Rather, the indictment clearly charges that the killing occurred as part of the same act or transaction as the killing of Katherine \u201cand/or\u201d as the killing of a person under the age of fourteen by a person age twenty-one or older. Thus, here, as in <em>Payne, </em>the Commonwealth was entitled to seek a separate conviction and death sentence on each offense of capital murder charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>In his seventeenth assignment of error, Bailey contends that the trial court erred in presenting the jury with verdict forms in the penalty-determination phase that \u201cwere inherently confusing and led to a substantial risk of an unreasoned and hence arbitrary and capricious jury verdict.\u201d Bailey contends that this is so because the verdict forms set out three alternative theories under which the jury might find that the \u201cvileness\u201d predicate would apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The Commonwealth contends that because Bailey proffered no alternative verdict forms, he is deemed to have waived his objection to the forms used by the trial court. <em>Cf. Atkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 160, 178 n.8, 510 S.E.2d 445, 456 n.8 (1999). However, unlike the circumstance in <em>Atkins, </em>where we held that a proffer of alternative verdict forms was sufficient to preserve an objection even though there was no express objection to the improper verdict forms proffered by the Commonwealth, here there is an express objection on the record. When a principle of law is materially vital to the defendant in a criminal case, it is reversible error for the trial court to fail to correct a defective instruction or verdict form when the error is patent or the subject of a proper objection. <em>Id. </em>at 178, 510 S.E.2d at 456; <em>accord Whaley v. Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 353, 355-56, 200 S.E.2d 556, 558 (1973); <em>Bryant v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 390, 392-93, 219 S.E.2d 669, 671-72 (1975). Thus, although the better practice would have been for Bailey to proffer alternative verdict forms, he was not required to do so in order to preserve his objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">We agree with the Commonwealth, however, that the verdict forms in this case were not confusing and did not misstate the law. The verdict forms merely recited the alternative findings the jury might make in reaching its sentencing decision. Thus, unlike the situation in <em>Atkins, </em>the trial court\u2019s instructions on sentencing and the verdict forms were in accord with and correctly reflected the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">\n<em>G. Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">In his ninth assignment of error, Bailey contends that the trial court erred in failing to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence presented during the guilt-determination phase with respect to the capital murder charges arising from the killing of Nathan. He asserts that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient to show that he acted with premeditation in that killing. In the appeal of his related convictions, Bailey further contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for the first-degree murder of Katherine, asserting that the evidence showed that he was \u201cemotionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>distraught\u201d and \u201cacted impulsively and without malice.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">The question of premeditation is a question to be determined by the fact-finder. <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 289, 295, 302 S.E.2d 520, 524, <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 865 (1983). \u201cTo establish premeditation, the intent to kill need only exist for a moment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The evidence showed that Bailey acquired the murder weapon several weeks in advance of the killings and made elaborate efforts over several months to deflect future suspicion from himself. From this evidence alone, there can be no doubt that the murder of Katherine was deliberate and premeditated.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Even accepting Bailey\u2019s contention that initially he had not considered the impact of Katherine\u2019s murder on his son and had not intended to kill him also, the record, including Bailey\u2019s own statement, shows that his decision to kill his son was not a sudden impulsive act, as he contends. Rather, the record shows that he took deliberate action after contemplation, however brief. The evidence in this case is closely on point with that in <em>Stewart v. Commonwealth, </em>245 Va. 222, 427 S.E.2d 394, <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 848 (1993), where the defendant was convicted of killing his estranged wife and their infant son. In <em>Stewart, </em>we said that \u201cevidence that a weapon was placed against a victim\u2019s head when the fatal shot was fired ... is sufficient alone to support a finding that \u2018the shot was fired deliberately and with premeditation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 240, 427 S.E.2d 406 (citation omitted). The record in this case shows that Bailey went to Nathan\u2019s bedroom and shot the child twice in the head at close range. This evidence was sufficient for the jury to determine that the killing of Nathan was a deliberate and premeditated act.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">In his eighteenth assignment of error, Bailey contends that the trial court erred in failing to set aside the death sentences imposed by the jury on the ground that there was insufficient evidence of vileness in the killing of Nathan. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Bailey premises his argument on this issue on his contention that the killing of Nathan was an impulsive act of misguided compassion. We have already rejected this contention, finding that there was sufficient evidence of premeditation even under Bailey\u2019s self-serving characterization of the events. Similarly, we find sufficient evidence in the record to support the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that the kill<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>ing of Nathan was committed in the course of an aggravated battery and with depravity of mind. <em>Cf. Walker, </em>258 Va. at 72, 515 S.E.2d at 575 (multiple gunshot wounds establish aggravated battery); <em>Stewart, </em>245 Va. at 246, 427 S.E.2d at 409 (manner of killing and attempts to disguise crime reflect depravity of mind).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">\n<em>H. Sentence Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">In his nineteenth assignment of error, Bailey contends that the trial court erred in failing to set aside the two death sentences on the ground that they were \u201cexcessive and disproportionate\u201d and \u201cimposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, and other arbitrary factors.\u201d These contentions are reflective of the requirements of Code \u00a7 17.1-313(C)(1) that we determine \u201c[wjhether the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor\u201d and Code \u00a7 17.1-313(C)(2) that we determine \u201c[w]hether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\u201d Accordingly, we will address Bailey\u2019s assignment of error and conduct the review required by statute jointly.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">Bailey contends that the death sentences were excessive and disproportionate because the evidence showed that the capital murder of Nathan did not involve torture or a predicate felony, and that death was instantaneous. He further contends that \u201cit was an impulsive killing with a gun, indistinguishable from literally thousands of gun-related killings across the country where the punishment is a term of imprisonment rather than death.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">Without giving any credence to Bailey\u2019s unsupported assertion that there are \u201cliterally thousands\u201d of similar murders committed in this country, we may nonetheless distinguish this crime on several grounds from the type of impulsive killings to which Bailey alludes. The forensic evidence that Nathan\u2019s wounds resulted from an \u201cexecution-style\u201d shooting rebuts Bailey\u2019s claim that the killing was impulsive. Moreover, the evidence amply supports the conclusion that Bailey planned this killing along with the killing of Katherine and that he took elaborate steps to deflect suspicion from himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">We have examined the records of all capital murder cases reviewed by this Court, including those cases in which a life sentence was imposed. We have given particular attention to those cases in which, as here, the death penalty was based on the \u201cvileness\u201d predicate alone. Based on this review, we conclude that Bailey\u2019s death sentences are not excessive or disproportionate to penalties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>generally imposed by other sentencing bodies in the Commonwealth for comparable crimes. <em>See, e.g., Stewart, </em>245 Va. at 247, 427 S.E.2d at 410; <em>Davidson v. Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 129, 136, 419 S.E.2d 656, 660, <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 959 (1992); <em>Buchanan, </em>238 Va. at 418, 384 S.E.2d at 774.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Bailey makes no particularized argument that the death sentences were imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factors. However, within his argument on disproportionality, Bailey contends that \u201cthe jury\u2019s passions and prejudice had been inflamed by the mere fact that the killing involved a two-year-old boy.\u201d Assuming this statement is intended to address the review required by Code \u00a7 17.1-313(C)(1), it is merely conclusory and we find nothing in the record to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Undeniably, the killing of one\u2019s own child is among the most abhorrent crimes for a jury to contemplate when considering an appropriate sentence, especially when, as here, that crime occurs in conjunction with the equally abhorrent crime of the killing of one\u2019s wife. Nonetheless, the mere fact that a crime is abhorrent does not raise a presumption that the jury will be unable to set aside its natural emotions and fairly consider all the evidence. Our review of this record does not disclose that the jury failed to give fair consideration to all the evidence both in favor and in mitigation of the death sentences, and we find nothing in this record which suggests that the jury, or the trial court in reviewing the verdicts, imposed the death sentences under the influence of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">Having reviewed the capital murder convictions, the death sentences imposed thereon, and the related convictions and sentences for first-degree murder and the firearm charges, we find no reversible error in the record, and perceive no reason to commute the death sentences. For these reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">Record No. 992840 \u2014 <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ald\">Record No. 000151 \u2014 <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b751-9\"> By order entered January 27, 2000, we certified from the Court of Appeals of Virginia to this Court the record of Bailey\u2019s appeal of the noncapital convictions (Record No. 000151). The effect of the certification is to transfer jurisdiction over the noncapital appeal to this Court. Code \u00a7 17.1-409(A). Because the certification occurred after the filing of the opening brief in the capital appeal (Record No. 992840), we permitted Bailey to file a supplemental brief based upon the petition for appeal he had filed in the Court of Appeals. Only the first of Bailey\u2019s assignments of error in the supplemental brief raises an issue not already raised in the capital appeal. The remaining assignments of error in the supplemental brief, numbers 2, 3, and 4, correspond to assignments of error numbers 10, 11, and 12 in the capital appeal. Accordingly, we will address those issues in this opinion with reference to the latter designations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b760-8\"> Detective James A. Dillabough of the Hampton Police Crime Scene Unit subsequently testified and identified the photographs as those he had taken during the investigation of the murders later on the morning of September 10, 1998. Bailey, however, stated that he would not waive his prior objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b763-9\"> Although Bailey offers no supporting authority for the proposition that these records are incomplete, we recognize that a small number of defendants convicted of capital murder and sentenced to life imprisonment waive their right of appeal and, thus, records of those cases are not included in the archive maintained by this Court pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-313(E). However, we are of opinion that such cases almost invariably involve guilty pleas and the Commonwealth\u2019s agreement not to seek the death penalty. Thus, their value for making a proportionality analysis is minimal because the record would contain little or no background upon which to make the proportionality comparison.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b764-8\"> Bailey further contends that the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion constitutes a violation of his constitutional right to a proportionality review. Bailey did not raise this argument below and, thus, we shall not consider it for the first time on appeal. Rule 5:25. Moreover, Bailey confuses the appropriateness review conducted by the trial court pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-264.5 with the proportionality review conducted by this Court pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-313(C)(2). The proportionality review conducted by this Court in all death sentence cases suffices to secure the rights of the defendant in this regard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b769-8\"> In <em>Payne, </em>the Court consolidated two separate capital murder appeals. In both instances, however, there were multiple indictments charging the defendant with two counts of capital murder of one victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b771-9\"> This is the only assignment of error in the noncapital appeal that is not duplicated by an assignment of error raised in the capital appeal. <em>See </em>note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
