The dispositive issue is whether the trial court erred in refusing to strike for cause a prospective juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">In January 1995, appellee Deborah W. Crews was operating an automobile that was stopped on a street in the City of Lynchburg. Her vehicle was struck from the rear and she was injured as a result of the negligence of appellant Timothy L. Cantrell, who was operating a truck owned by his employer, appellant Winn-Dixie Raleigh, Inc. The plaintiff sustained a \u201csoft tissue\u201d injury that was diagnosed as a cervical sprain, for which she brought this action against defendants seeking recovery in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">In an October 1998 trial, the defendants admitted liability and the case was tried on the issue of damages only. A jury found in favor of the plaintiff and fixed her damages at $108,812.87. The trial court overruled the defendants\u2019 motion to set the verdict aside and entered judgment on the verdict. We awarded defendants an appeal limited to consideration of four assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">An issue raised by a portion of one of those assignments of error is dispositive of this appeal. The issue is whether the trial court erred in refusing to strike for cause a prospective juror who, at the time of trial, was a client of the law firm representing the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">There is no dispute in the facts relevant to the issue we decide. The motion for judgment was on stationery of \u201cLaw Office / Overbey, Hawkins &amp; Selz / Rustburg, Virginia.\u201d The pleading was signed by Mr. Hawkins as \u201cOf Counsel\u201d for \u201cOverbey, Hawkins &amp; Selz.\u201d Hawkins appeared at trial as attorney for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">During jury voir dire, after asking whether \u201canybody\u201d knew the plaintiff\u2019s trial attorney, the trial court specified the name of Hawkins\u2019 law firm and identified by name each member of the firm, including \u201cBryan Selz.\u201d The court then asked, \u201cDoes anybody know any of those individuals or been represented by them or this firm or have any contact with them?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">Responding, prospective juror Holly Clingempeel stated that she knew Selz and said, \u201cHe\u2019s representing me.\u201d When the court asked, \u201cHow long ago?\u201d, the juror responded, \u201cIt\u2019s still going on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-12\">Later during voir dire, while being questioned by defendants\u2019 attorney, Clingempeel revealed that her representation by Selz arose from \u201ca car accident\u201d and stated that she sustained \u201c[njeck and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>back\u201d injuries. She said that she had filed a \u201clawsuit\u201d; that the suit \u201cis continuing right now\u201d; and that Selz is representing her \u201cin that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Upon being asked by the court whether the fact that Hawkins or a member of his law firm was \u201ccurrently\u201d representing her would have \u201cany bearing\u201d on her judgment, Clingempeel responded, \u201cNo.\u201d She further stated that she could \u201cassure\u201d the court \u201cunder oath\u201d that she could \u201cignore\u201d her representation by the plaintiff\u2019s law firm \u201cand be totally fair to both sides.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The trial court denied defendants\u2019 motion to strike for cause Clingempeel, as well as two other prospective jurors. In ruling on the motion, the court stated it believed the three jurors \u201ccan ignore any personal sort of contact or relationship or association they have with Mr. Hawkins, his firm, . . . and the like and be fair and that\u2019s the only test.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Elaborating, the trial court stated: \u201cCampbell County is of such a nature that in this community people are going to know each other and have some kind of association and the association as described to me by the three folks to whom you objected to was not such that in and of itself prejudiced them or made an obvious bias or would lend itself to an obvious bias on their behalf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Concluding, the trial court said: \u201cI was impressed with their answers and I believe them to be truthful and I found nothing wrong with them sitting as jurors . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">The plaintiff contends the trial court correctly refused to strike Clingempeel for cause. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">Parties to litigation are entitled to a fair and impartial trial by a jury of persons who \u201cstand indifferent in the cause.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-358. \u201c[T]he right to a fair and impartial trial in a civil case is as fundamental as it is in a criminal case. The civil courts constantly strive to protect this right. It lies at the very basis of organized society and confidence in our judicial system.\u201d <em>Temple </em>v. Moses, 175 Va. 320, 336, 8 S.E.2d 262, 268 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">Upon review, the appellate court gives deference to the trial court\u2019s decision whether to retain or exclude prospective jurors. <em>Vinson v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 459, 467, 522 S.E.2d 170, 176 (1999). And, a trial court\u2019s decision on this issue will be affirmed unless there has been manifest error amounting to an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 467, 522 S.E.2d at 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">Recently, we considered in a condemnation case an issue almost identical to the present one. In <em>City of Virginia Beach v. Giant </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number><em>Square Shopping Center Co., </em>255 Va. 467, 498 S.E.2d 917 (1998), one ground of a condemnor\u2019s objection to the seating of a prospective commissioner was that the commissioner, at the time of trial, was a client of the landowners\u2019 counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">There, we noted that, by statute, the issue of just compensation is to be determined by a commission of \u201cdisinterested freeholders,\u201d and that, regarding the disqualification of commissioners for cause, the eminent domain statutes must be administered in a manner that promotes confidence in the integrity of the judicial process. <em>Id. </em>at 470, 498 S.E.2d at 919.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Thus, we held the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to dismiss the commissioner for cause, stating that \u201cit is extremely unlikely the public would have confidence in the integrity of the process when a commissioner has the identity of interests demonstrated by this prospective commissioner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 471, 498 S.E.2d at 919. We said, \u201cThis is true even though, as the record shows, the commissioner is a \u2018respected member of the community\u2019 and \u2018known to be a man of integrity,\u2019 who may be determined to discharge his duties in a forthright and unbiased manner.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The same reasoning will be applied to this case. There is no meaningful difference regarding the interest factor under these circumstances between the statutory requirements for a trial by jury of persons who \u201cstand indifferent in the cause\u201d and for just compensation to be determined by a commission of \u201cdisinterested freeholders.\u201d Public confidence in the integrity of the process is at stake. It cannot be promoted when a sitting juror is, at the time of trial, a client of the law firm representing one of the parties to the litigation as a result of a similar occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">This is true even though, as the record shows, the juror states that the circumstances of her representation would have no \u201cbearing\u201d on her judgment as a juror and that she could \u201cbe totally fair to both sides.\u201d We have no doubt that Clingempeel was sincere in her beliefs and that she was determined to discharge her duties in a forthright and unbiased manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">And, the fact that the venue is a community where \u201cpeople are going to know each other and have some kind of association,\u201d as the trial judge noted, does not diminish the court\u2019s obligation to assure that a litigant\u2019s case will be heard and decided by a fair and impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Therefore, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to dismiss the juror for cause and that this constitutes reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Because the case will be remanded and the evidence may be different upon a new trial, we shall address only one of the remaining issues presented on appeal. The defendants contend that the trial court erred in limiting their cross-examination of the plaintiff\u2019s treating orthopedic physician, who testified by deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Upon direct examination, the physician, after concluding that the plaintiff sustained a soft tissue injury amounting to a cervical sprain, opined she had a ten percent permanent disability and would require future medical treatment. On cross-examination, defendants elicited from the physician that he had written in his notes that, in his experience, many patients involved in litigation stemming from soft-tissue injuries frequently cease medical treatments \u201cwhen the litigation is resolved.\u201d The physician stated he \u201ccertainly considered that\u201d in his evaluation of the plaintiff\u2019s complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The trial court excluded this portion of the deposition testimony, over defendants\u2019 objection. The court reasoned the physician \u201cwas too equivocal\u201d; \u201c[h]e merely said I certainly considered that\u201d; and, the testimony \u201cwas too speculative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Based on the state of this record, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion and thus erred in refusing to permit the defendants to offer this evidence to discredit the physician\u2019s opinion on permanency and on the plaintiff\u2019s need of future medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Thus, if the state of the record does not change upon a new trial, this equivocal and speculative testimony should not be allowed. <em>But see Mastin </em>v. <em>Theirjung, </em>238 Va. 434, 437-38, 384 S.E.2d 86, 88 (1989) (medical testimony admitted that in people with personalities like the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cthere is a definite potential for motives of secondary gain, arising out of the possibility of recovery of money damages in a lawsuit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">Therefore, the judgment below will be affirmed in part, reversed in part, and the case will be remanded for a new trial, limited to the issue of damages only.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
