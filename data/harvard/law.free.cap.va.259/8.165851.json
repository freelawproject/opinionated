A residential real estate-related transaction means, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[t]he . . . insuring ... of residential real property.\u201d Code \u00a7 36-96.4(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">In an amended motion for judgment filed March 21, 1997, Housing Opportunities Made Equal, Inc. (HOME), a fair housing organization, sought damages from Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company and Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Company (collectively, Nationwide) for discriminatory practices allegedly employed by Nationwide in the provision of homeowners insurance to African-Americans in the Richmond area. A jury awarded HOME a verdict of $500,000 in compensatory damages and $100,000,000 in punitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>damages. The trial court entered judgment on the verdict, and we awarded Nationwide this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">\n<em>The Parties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">HOME is a nonprofit Virginia corporation formed in 1971 with the mission of promoting fair housing in Central Virginia, including the Richmond metropolitan area. In carrying out its mission, HOME\u2019S first priority is counseling, education is second, and advocacy, which includes litigation, is third. HOME counsels clients about their housing needs or problems. HOME trains the housing industry \u201cto make sure [its members] don\u2019t violate the fair housing laws\u201d and also educates \u201chousing consumers about what their rights . . . and . . . responsibilities are.\u201d HOME resorts to litigation if counseling and education \u201care not enough to ensure equal access.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Nationwide writes insurance. It states on brief that it \u201chas long been one of the leading providers of homeowners\u2019 insurance in the Richmond metropolitan area, [insuring] thousands of houses throughout the city and the surrounding suburbs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">\n<em>The Nature of the Controversy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">HOME charged in its amended motion for judgment that \u201cNationwide has, for many years, intentionally pursued a strategy whereby the company avoids providing insurance in African-American neighborhoods\u201d and \u201chas followed an express policy of not targeting urban areas, containing significant minority populations, for the marketing of homeowners policies.\u201d In its grounds of defense, Nationwide denied HOME\u2019S allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">HOME submitted the following evidence concerning the discriminatory practices allegedly employed by Nationwide.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">\n<em>Marketing Activities</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">In the late 1980s, Nationwide was \u201cin a position of stagn\u00e1nt market share growth, and if [it] did not make some significant change, [it] would begin losing [its] market share.\u201d Accordingly, in 1990, Nationwide developed a \u201cMarketing Strategy\u201d for the Richmond area which stated that \u201cafter reviewing household growth, median income, median home value, 13+ years of schooling, and median age,\u201d the nearby counties of Henrico, Hanover, and Chesterfield \u201cwere identified as grow fast areas\u201d and as \u201ctargeted counties.\u201d The City of Richmond was mentioned in the strategy only tangentially; it was not included as a targeted market.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>The strategy identified eleven zip codes in the three counties as representing \u201cthe profile of Nationwide\u2019s select risk market.\u201d However, 23227, a Henrico zip code bordering the northern edge of the City of Richmond, was singled out for this comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-5\">We have no data to support identification of emerging ethnic or minority groups. However, of our targeted counties, only one zip code was discovered to have greater than the statewide average for minority groups \u2014 this was zip code 23227 (Henrico).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Following development of the marketing strategy, Nationwide implemented a marketing tool known as \u201cMicroVision,\u201d which \u201cis produced on a zip code basis [and] characterizes zip codes by particular lifestyle categories. . . . [T]hese lifestyle segments purport to describe various homogeneous populations ... by their race, by the kinds of things they read, ... by their income.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The segments were assigned designations with such names as \u201cLap of Luxury,\u201d \u201cEstablished Wealth,\u201d \u201cMetro Minority Families,\u201d \u201cStruggling Minority Mix,\u201d and \u201cDifficult Times.\u201d The segments were then placed into one of five marketing groups: \u201cAffluent\u201d; \u201cMainstream\u201d; \u201cMature\u201d; \u201cCountry Living\u201d; and \u201cRemaining Diverse.\u201d The first four groups were considered desirable markets. The fifth, \u201cRemaining Diverse,\u201d was considered undesirable. MicroVision placed every predominantly minority neighborhood of the City of Richmond, <em>i.e., </em>those with minority population of 50% or more, in the \u201cRemaining Diverse\u201d group.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">Nationwide\u2019s marketing activities also included the production of a \u201cLocal Area Market Plan\u201d (LAMP), which divided a given geographic area into zip codes and ranked them as \u201cBest in State,\u201d \u201cBest in Market,\u201d \u201cNext Best in Market,\u201d and \u201cRemaining.\u201d The first three zip codes were considered desirable markets. The fourth, \u201cRemaining,\u201d was considered undesirable. Like MicroVision, LAMP placed every predominantly minority neighborhood of the City of Richmond in the \u201cRemaining\u201d group.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">Further, Nationwide performed a \u201cgeographic realignment\u201d to \u201cidentify where [it wanted its] markets to be, and which populations [it wanted] to target.\u201d Among the \u201cnatural geographic boundaries\u201d to be considered in \u201cplanning the ideal geographic market\u201d were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>\u201ccultural or ethnic areas.\u201d In Nationwide memoranda dated March 25, 1996, and April 3, 1996, recommending realignment of marketing districts in Central Virginia, the population of the City of Richmond was not included in any marketing district, although rural jurisdictions with smaller populations were included.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Finally, HOME highlights Nationwide\u2019s treatment of zip code 23227 in Henrico County. This was one of the eleven zip codes identified by Nationwide in its 1990 Marketing Strategy as representing the profile of its select risk market. HOME says that \u201c[ejach of the 11 areas was overwhelmingly white, but. . . 23227 . . . had a minority percentage in excess of the state average,\u201d and Nationwide over the years has consistently ignored \u201cthis one zip code, while devoting extra attention to the other 10.\u201d The differential treatment consisted of excluding 23227 from Nationwide\u2019s targeted zip codes and placing it in the undesirable \u201cRemaining\u201d category in every LAMP and Micro Vision listing.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\n<em>Location of Agents</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">An expert witness called by HOME testified that Nationwide followed \u201ca consistent pattern ... of placing [its] agents in the target markets.\u201d Nationwide encouraged existing agents to move their offices, or to change their focus, from a non-targeted to a targeted area and, if they refused, the company would \u201cultimately [remove their] binding authority if necessary.\u201d Without binding authority, an agent cannot deliver a policy to a customer \u201cuntil it\u2019s gone through the whole underwriting process.\u201d While Nationwide had four agency offices in predominantly minority areas of the City of Richmond in 1990, it had none at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">HOME again highlights Nationwide\u2019s treatment of zip code 23227. In 1990, three of the eleven zip codes targeted in Henrico, Hanover, and Chesterfield Counties, including 23227, had no agents. By the time of trial, however, Nationwide had placed agents in every one of the eleven zip codes except 23227, despite the fact that 23227 had one of the best loss ratios of the eleven zip codes in 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-2\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>\n<em>Hiring and Training Policies</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b37-3\">Nationwide instructed its managers to \u201csearch for the agent candidate and staff within the target market.\u201d One manager testified that of thirty-two agents he supervised in an area including the City of Richmond prior to the time this proceeding was filed, none was African-American. Another manager in the Richmond area testified that he had hired thirteen new agents in the period from 1991 to the time this proceeding was filed, and none was African-American.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">Nationwide required its new agents to undergo extensive instruction, but the course did not include anti-redlining training, <em>i.e., </em>instruction on the necessity to avoid the unlawful exclusion of geographical areas from consideration for homeowners insurance. An early version of LAMP cautioned against redlining, but Nationwide later removed the cautionary language.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">\n<em>Underwriting Standards</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Nationwide\u2019s underwriting standards were described as having \u201ca disproportionate effect on people who live in minority neighborhoods.\u201d Nationwide offered two types of homeowners policies, the \u201cGolden Blanket\u201d policy, providing for replacement of a dwelling and its contents regardless of actual replacement cost, and the \u201cElite II\u201d policy, providing for replacement limited to the face value of the policy. Nationwide called Golden Blanket its \u201cCadillac\u201d policy and Elite II its \u201cweak-sister\u201d policy. Golden Blanket policies were not available for dwellings that were more than 30 years of age or valued at less than $90,000. Elite II policies were available for older dwellings, but if they were more than fifty years old and located in the \u201cinner city,\u201d agents were \u201crequired to carefully inspect each home inside and out before actually writing the application.\u201d It was established that \u201cthe minority population lives . . . predominantly in the areas with older housing much more so than the white population.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">HOME cites evidence from Nationwide\u2019s \u201cown documents [which] showed that its market penetration in Richmond\u2019s minority zip codes was less than 50 percent of its penetration in white zip codes\u201d and that \u201c[t]he penetration for the Golden Blanket policy was more than 20 times higher in white neighborhoods than in minority neighborhoods.\u201d HOME says that \u201cNationwide had so avoided minority neighborhoods in Richmond that one of the company\u2019s managers described those areas as the \u2018hole in the donut.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>\n<em>Pricing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The evidence showed that the company placed the City of Richmond in a separate pricing territory and then established \u201cbase rates for the city . . . higher than the base rates for the surrounding counties.\u201d The rates were \u201cactually somewhat higher than indicated by Nationwide\u2019s own experience in Richmond,\u201d and the \u201cprice would have been less, except [that Nationwide] used ... an unsound practice of using competitor information in Richmond.\u201d Nationwide also charged a higher premium for its \u201cweak-sister\u201d Elite II policy, which was more adaptable to the older housing found in minority areas, than it charged for the Golden Blanket policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">\n<em>Advertising</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Nationwide conducted a minority market study and produced a report that the specific minority groups studied, which included African-Americans, \u201cseparately and together, are large enough to be important market segments.\u201d The report also stated that \u201cthe African-American market would be the easiest and most efficient (as a result of [Nationwide\u2019s] geographic concentration) for which to formulate new programs.\u201d The report cautioned that African-Americans cannot be reached by advertising in mass-market publications like <em>Time </em>and <em>Newsweek </em>but that \u201cto reach specific segments efficiently within the Black population, advertising must include black-interest publications (e.g <em>Black Enterprise, Ebony).\u201d </em>The report\u2019s conclusion was that \u201ca specific marketing strategy to target these groups individually does not seem warranted for Nationwide\u2019s property/casualty operations,\u201d and Nationwide continued to advertise in \u201cprimarily the weeklies, Time or Newsweek, Sports Illustrated, Southern Living, People Magazine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">\n<em>Testers</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">HOME employed trained testers to contact Nationwide agents for \u201cinsurance quotes\u201d on test homes over a period extending from June or July of 1995 to October of 1996. HOME chose three pairs of test homes. Each pair was matched for similar features and age, but one home of the pair was located in a minority neighborhood and the other in a white neighborhood. When completed, the testing showed that quotes had been denied in nine out of fifteen tests for homes in the minority neighborhoods and only four out of sixteen tests in the white neighborhoods.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>The agents gave various reasons for their denial of quotes in the minority neighborhoods, including that Nationwide did not insure homes more than fifty years old or valued at less than $60,000 and that the company required thirty-days notice prior to closing to write insurance. One agent admitted on the witness stand that an employee of his office had told an untruth when she informed an African-American tester that the office did not insure homes more than fifty years old. Shortly before, the office had given a quote to a white homeowner on a house of similar age.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Nationwide\u2019s appeal presents a number of questions, including whether HOME has standing to maintain its action for damages against Nationwide. \u201cStanding to maintain an action is a preliminary jurisdictional issue having no relation to the substantive merits of an action,\u201d <em>Andrews v. American Health &amp; Life Insurance Co., </em>236 Va. 221, 226, 372 S.E.2d 399, 402 (1988), and, accordingly, is a matter for determination by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Nationwide raised the standing issue in a motion for summary judgment that was filed, heard, and denied pretrial. HOME contends, however, that Nationwide later conceded the standing issue by failing to object to an instruction granted by the trial court that permitted the jury to consider damage to HOME\u2019S \u201cmission, purpose, and efforts to promote equal access to housing.\u201d We disagree with HOME.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">We recently confronted a similar situation in <em>Wright v. Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Co., </em>245 Va. 160, 427 S.E.2d 724 (1993). There, the railway company failed to object to an instruction which permitted the jury to decide whether the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. During argument on the railway company\u2019s motion to set aside an adverse verdict, the plaintiff argued that by failing to object to the instruction, the railway company had \u201cwaived its right to rely on the proposition that [the plaintiff] was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166, 427 S.E.2d at 727. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>court ruled that no waiver had occurred and that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">We affirmed. We said there was no waiver because the railway company had consistently maintained the position throughout the trial that no jury issue was presented on the question of the plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence. This, we stated, gave the trial court the opportunity to rule intelligently on the issue, which is the main purpose of our contemporaneous objection rule, Rule 5:25. 245 Va. at 168, 427 S.E.2d at 728. <em>See also Chawla v. BurgerBusters, Inc., </em>255 Va. 616, 622, 499 S.E.2d 829, 832 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Here, Nationwide continued throughout the proceedings to ' insist that HOME lacked standing to maintain its action against Nationwide. Nationwide took this position in its pretrial motion for summary judgment, in its motion to strike at the close of HOME\u2019S evidence, in its motion to strike at the conclusion of all the evidence, and in its motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This clearly afforded the trial court ample opportunity to rule on the issue of HOME\u2019S standing. Indeed, at the very end of the case, after Nationwide\u2019s counsel told the trial court he was concerned \u201cthat all [his] objections are preserved for the record,\u201d the judge remarked: \u201cI say that you have preserved every argument that you have made from the time that the case was filed until now.\u201d We hold that Nationwide did not waive or concede the standing issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">This brings us to the merits of Nationwide\u2019s contention that HOME lacked standing to maintain its action for damages because it \u201cfailed to establish below that it was in any way \u2018aggrieved\u201d by Nationwide\u2019s alleged discrimination against \u2018African-American neighborhoods\u2019 in the City of Richmond.\u201d An \u201caggrieved person\u201d is defined in the Virginia Fair Housing Law as one who \u201cclaims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice\u201d or \u201cbelieves that such person will be injured by a discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur.\u201d Code \u00a736-96.1:1. \u201cPerson\u201d is defined to include, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cfair housing organizations.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>And \u201c[a]n <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>aggrieved person may commence a civil action in an appropriate United States district court or state court ... to obtain appropriate relief with respect to such discriminatory housing practice . . . .\u201d Code \u00a7 36-96.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">HOME argues that \u201c[tjhere can be no question that [it] is a fair housing organization and that it has claimed Nationwide\u2019s discriminatory housing practices have injured it.\u201d \u201cThus,\u201d HOME concludes, \u201cunder the plain language of the statute, HOME has standing.\u201d In other words, it is HOME\u2019S position that the statute imposes a less restrictive standard for standing than might otherwise be required, with the result that HOME establishes its standing merely by stating the terms of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">When HOME made this argument in the trial court, the trial judge remarked, \u201cYou can\u2019t just say it, there really has ... to be some \u2014,\u201d at which point HOME\u2019S counsel said, \u201cThere has to be some meat to it, yes, Your Honor. And HOME has showed that there is meat to it in this case. And that\u2019s shown under the common law of Virginia and we\u2019ve presented to the court [the] common law of Virginia with respect to standing.\u201d HOME\u2019S counsel also said \u201cthe federal law, which is persuasive authority, . . . likewise shows that HOME has standing in this case,\u201d and counsel named <em>Havens Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>455 U.S. 363 (1982), as the persuasive authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Thus, in the trial court, HOME asserted three bases for its claim to standing, <em>i.e., </em>the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Havens, </em>the Virginia Fair Housing Law, and the common law of Virginia. HOME asserts the same three bases on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\"><em>Havens Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Coleman</em></p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">HOME says that <em>Havens </em>\u201cestablishes [its] standing.\u201d In <em>Havens, </em>HOME and others brought a class action under the federal Fair Housing Act against Havens Realty Corp. for declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief for Havens\u2019 alleged \u201cracial steering\u201d in its operation of two apartment complexes in Henrico County. HOME alleged that Havens\u2019 discriminatory practices had injured HOME by frustrating its mission and causing a drain on its resources. On Havens\u2019 pretrial motion, the district court dismissed the action, holding that the plaintiffs lacked standing. The United States Court of Appeals for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Fourth Circuit reversed, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari. 451 U.S. 905 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">In its opinion, the Supreme Court stated that \u201cthe sole requirement for standing to sue under [the federal Fair Housing Act] is the [federal Constitution\u2019s] Art. HI minima of injury in fact: that the plaintiff allege that as a result of the defendant\u2019s actions he has suffered \u2018a distinct and palpable injury.\u2019 \u201d 455 U.S. at 372. The Court held that HOME\u2019S allegations of injury concerning the frustration of its mission and a drain on its resources were sufficient to withstand Havens\u2019 motion to dismiss. <em>Id. </em>at 379. The Court observed in a footnote that \u201cHOME will have to demonstrate at trial that it has indeed suffered impairment in its role of facilitating open housing before it will be entitled to judicial relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>n.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\"><em>Havens </em>involved interpretation of the federal Fair Housing Act in a context presenting a question of non-constitutional federal law. Accordingly, the decision is not binding on this Court in this case involving a state statute and a pure question of state law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> While the Virginia statute contains a provision (Code \u00a7 36-96.23) that \u201c[n]othing in [the Virginia Fair Housing Law] shall abridge the federal Fair Housing Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3601 et seq.),\u201d nothing in the Virginia statute requires that it be interpreted according to federal law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">\n<em>The Virginia Fair Housing Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">It is true, of course, as HOME maintains, that the statute permits an action to be brought by an \u201caggrieved person,\u201d defined as one who claims to have been or believes he will be injured. But the statute does not fix a standard for determining whether standing exists. Undeniably, HOME is a \u201cperson\u201d under the statute, but whether it is an \u201caggrieved person\u201d turns on whether it has been or will be injured. Hence, the key word is \u201cinjured\u201d; however, it is undefined. We resort, therefore, to the common law of Virginia for the appropriate standard for determining standing, a standard that was already in place in 1991 when the Virginia Fair Housing Law was amended to include the definition of an \u201caggrieved person\u201d and to add fair housing organizations to the definition of \u201cperson.\u201d 1991 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Va. Acts ch. 557. And nothing in the 1991 amendment indicates an intention on the part of the General Assembly to lower that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-3\">\n<em>The Virginia Common Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">Admittedly, the Virginia common law standard is more restrictive than its federal counterpart. In <em>Nicholas v. Lawrence, </em>161 Va. 589, 171 S.E. 673 (1933), we said that for a person to have standing to invoke the jurisdiction of a court, \u201che must show that he has an <em>immediate, pecuniary and substantial interest </em>in the litigation, and not a remote or indirect interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 593, 171 S.E. at 674 (emphasis added). In <em>Cupp v. Board of Supervisors, </em>227 Va. 580, 318 S.E.2d 407 (1984), we said that the \u201cconcept of standing concerns itself with the characteristics of the person or entity who files suit\u201d and that \u201c[t]he essence of the standing inquiry is whether [such person or entity has] \u2018a <em>personal stake in the outcome of the contro</em>versy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 589, 318 S.E.2d at 411 (quoting <em>Duke Power Co. </em>v. <em>Carolina Envtl. Study Group, </em>438 U.S. 59, 72 (1978) (emphasis added in <em>Cupp)). </em>And in <em>Virginia Beach Beautification Commission v. Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>231 Va. 415, 344 S.E.2d 899 (1986), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-5\">In order for a petitioner to be \u201caggrieved,\u201d it must affirmatively appear that such person has some <em>direct </em>interest in the subject matter of the proceeding that he seeks to attack. . . . [I]t is not sufficient that the sole interest of the petitioner is to advance some perceived public right or to redress some anticipated public injury .... The word \u201caggrieved\u201d in a statute contemplates a substantial grievance and means a denial of some <em>personal </em>or property right ... or imposition of a burden or obligation upon the petitioner different from that suffered by the public generally.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 419-20, 344 S.E.2d at 902-03 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">HOME says it has standing to maintain its action against Nationwide because it \u201ccan identify economic and non-economic injuries resulting from Nationwide\u2019s discriminatory activities.\u201d According to HOME, its injuries consist of the frustration of its mission, the diversion of its resources, and the discrimination practiced against its \u201ctester/agents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>\n<em>Frustration of Mission</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">HOME\u2019S claim based upon the frustration of its mission fails the Virginia test for standing. HOME itself has not suffered any denial of homeowners insurance and cannot claim injury based upon such a denial. It relies instead upon the purported injury to others resulting from Nationwide\u2019s discriminatory practices. And, in the trial court, HOME included in its claim of purported injury to others resulting from Nationwide\u2019s practices \u201cthe harm caused to the city of Richmond, individuals, neighborhoods, the tax base.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Hence, HOME\u2019S interest in the litigation and its purported injury are not \u201cimmediate, pecuniary and substantial\u201d but \u201cremote or indirect.\u201d <em>Nicholas, </em>161 Va. at 593, 171 S.E. at 674. HOME\u2019S purported injury is not \u201cdifferent from that suffered by the public generally.\u201d <em>Virginia Beach Beautification Commission, </em>231 Va. at 420, 344 S.E.2d at 903. And HOME\u2019S interest in this litigation is reduced to an effort \u201cto advance some perceived public right or to redress some anticipated public injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 419, 344 S.E.2d at 902.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Furthermore, Virginia is not a class-action state, and \u201c[a]n individual or entity does not acquire standing to sue in a representative capacity by asserting the rights of another, unless authorized by statute to do so.\u201d <em>W. S. Carnes, Inc. v. Board of Supervisors, 252 </em>Va. 377, 383, 478 S.E.2d 295, 300 (1996). The Virginia Fair Housing Law does not bestow such representative authority. To say, therefore, that HOME has standing in this case would, in effect, convert the proceeding into a class action and permit HOME to sue in a representative capacity for discriminatory housing practices directed against someone else who may not himself have the required standing to sue.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">\n<em>Diversion of Resources</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">HOME\u2019S claim to standing based upon the diversion of its resources involves some $56,000 that HOME spent investigating and testing Nationwide for its alleged discriminatory practices. This sum consists in part of $6,000 to $7,000 of HOME\u2019S own funds, representing the cost of staff time spent in preparation for this litigation. The balance, paid from federal grants totaling approximately $1.2 million, represents the pro rata share attributable to Nationwide of the cost of HOME\u2019S investigation of approximately thirty insurance companies, including Nationwide, writing homeowners coverage in Richmond. Also involved in HOME\u2019S diversion of resources claim to standing is the value of a federal grant for education that HOME lost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>when it chose instead an enforcement grant in order to continue with its investigation of the insurance industry. Finally, HOME says that it had to divert resources from other testing and education programs to identify Nationwide\u2019s discriminatory practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">It is elementary that one who seeks damages as redress for wrongful action must not only prove the wrongful action but also a causal connection between the wrongful action and the injury complained of. <em>Phillips v. Southeast 4-H Educ. Ctr., </em>257 Va. 209, 215, 510 S.E.2d 458, 461 (1999). Even <em>Havens </em>requires that an injury be \u201c \u2018fairly traceable\u2019 \u201d to a discriminatory practice to satisfy the requirement of injury in fact. 455 U.S. at 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">There can be no causal connection between action, even though wrongful, and injury that is self-inflicted. HOME\u2019S executive director testified below that \u201c[p]rior to HOME undertaking ... the systemic industry homeowners insurance investigation\u201d when HOME\u2019S first federal grant \u201ccame through\u201d on January 1, 1995, HOME had \u201creceived no complaints about Nationwide in the Richmond area.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> HOME\u2019S decisions to undertake the investigation, to spend part of the grant funds on the investigation, to devote staff time to preparation for this litigation, to choose an enforcement grant rather than an educational grant, and to divert resources from other testing and education programs were all made voluntarily, independent of anything Nationwide did or failed to do with respect to minority neighborhoods in the City of Richmond.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">What was said in <em>Fair Employment Council v. BMC Marketing Corp., </em>28 F.3d 1268 (D.C. Cir. 1994), is pertinent here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-8\">The diversion of resources to testing might well harm the Council\u2019s other programs, for money spent on testing is money that is not spent on other things. But this particular harm is self-inflicted; it results not from any actions taken by BMC, but rather from the Council\u2019s own budgetary choices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 1276.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">And this from <em>Association for Retarded Citizens </em>v. <em>Dallas County, </em>19 F.3d 241 (5th Cir. 1994), a fair housing case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>The mere fact that an organization redirects some of its resources to litigation and legal counseling in response to actions or inactions of another party is insufficient to impart standing upon the organization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Also pertinent is this statement from another fair housing case, <em>Project Sentinel v. Evergreen Ridge Apartments, </em>40 F. Supp.2d 1136 (N.D. Cal. 1999):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-6\">Plaintiff cannot manufacture standing by first claiming a general interest in lawful conduct and then alleging that the costs incurred in identifying and litigating instances of unlawful conduct constitute injury in fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1139.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">\n<em>Discrimination against \u201cTester/Agents\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">HOME\u2019S claim to standing based upon the discrimination practiced against its \u201ctester/agents\u201d rests on even shakier grounds. HOME theorizes that \u201cwhen the testers encountered discrimination by Nationwide, that was an affront to the testers, who were HOME\u2019S agents, and an insult to HOME\u2019S fair housing work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">But the testers suffered no recognizable injury. They had no <em>bona fide </em>interest in purchasing insurance from Nationwide; indeed, HOME stipulated that \u201cnone of the testers were authorized to purchase insurance.\u201d The testers did not even ask for quotes on their own homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">Furthermore, a tester did not know who his or her partner was or what race the partner belonged to, did not know what home the partner was testing, whether the partner received quotes from Nationwide, or what the results of the partner\u2019s tests were. In short, the testers never directly encountered the effects of Nationwide\u2019s allegedly discriminatory practices and, hence, had no standing themselves to maintain an action for those practices. And it follows that the testers could not derivatively have bestowed standing upon HOME.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-12\">That the testers have suffered no recognizable injury is exemplified by a holding of the trial court that is not at issue in this appeal. Originally, in addition to HOME, several individual owners of test homes in African-American neighborhoods in the City of Richmond were named as plaintiffs. However, they were dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>from the case on Nationwide\u2019s motion because, as the trial judge explained, they had not \u201csuffered any damages that the law can recognize.\u201d Yet, HOME insisted that \u201c[t]he individual plaintiffs in this case stand on the same footing, essentially, as testers.\u201d Nationwide says that \u201c[t]he testers, who were merely <em>pretending to be </em>homeowners, cannot possibly have greater rights under the law,\u201d and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-3\">As one court put the matter in a fair housing case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-4\">[Testers] are investigators; they suffer no harm other than that which they invite in order to make a case against the persons investigated; there is no suggestion in this case that they were paid less to be testers than the opportunity costs of their time. The idea that their legal rights have been invaded seems an arch-formalism.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-5\"><em>Village of Bellwood </em>v. <em>Dwivedi, </em>895 F.2d 1521, 1526 (7th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">With due respect for HOME\u2019S worthy mission of providing equal housing opportunities in the metropolitan Richmond area, we conclude nonetheless that HOME lacks standing to maintain its action against Nationwide. The trial court erred, therefore, in denying Nationwide\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court, set aside the jury\u2019s verdict, and enter final judgment here in favor of Nationwide.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b35-10\"> Nationwide\u2019s director of retail sales testified that \u201can effort [was made] to withdraw any racial references . . . completely\u201d before the MicroVision materials were distributed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b36-8\"><em> </em>HOME states on brief that two former Nationwide agents \u201ctestified without contradiction that Nationwide consistently denied insurance to insurable homes in minority neighborhoods.\u201d However, what one of the former agents actually said was that Nationwide \u201cnever told us nothing in writing, but they implied it,\u201d and the other former agent said that \u201cthey didn\u2019t tell you . . . not to write in those sections, but the way the rules were written up, it seems like we could not do it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b39-8\"> In a section of its brief entitled \u201cNationwide\u2019s Recognition of its Discrimination in Richmond,\u201d HOME cites the report of a 1996 Urban Market Study conducted by Nationwide.

The General Assembly amended the Virginia Fair Housing Law in 1991 to permit housing organizations such as HOME to pursue housing discrimination claims in the courts. HOME proved with overwhelming evidence that Nationwide engaged in intentional acts of racial discrimination against black citizens who reside in the City of Richmond. Yet, the majority concludes that housing organizations, such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>HOME, cannot use the courts to vindicate the rights of citizens who have been subjected to housing discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Plaintiffs, Housing Opportunities Made Equal, Inc., (HOME), Donna Sully, Wanda Canada, and Shelton Jones, filed their amended motion for judgment against defendants, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Company, Jim Bocrie, Bond-King &amp; Associates, Butler &amp; Hailey Insurance Agency, Cannon-Fincher Insurance Agency, Daniel J.

It is also a fair housing organization formed in 1971 to make equal opportunity in housing a reality in central Virginia, which includes the City of Richmond. HOME was founded by a group of people, including members of the real estate industry, who were concerned about racially-segregated housing patterns and unfair housing discrimination in Richmond. Constance Chamberlin, HOME\u2019S executive director, stated that \u201cHOME seeks to ensure equal access to housing for all persons through counseling, education, and advocacy.\u201d She testified that HOME provides counseling to individuals and families to assist them with their housing needs. HOME also provides education and training to members of the housing industry so that they are aware of the fair housing laws. HOME has programs to educate housing consumers about their rights and responsibilities. HOME is also an advocacy organization, but it considers litigation \u201c[a] last resort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">In 1994, HOME received a federal grant from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development to examine racial discrimination practices by insurance companies that issue homeowners\u2019 insurance. HOME\u2019S investigation included 30 insurance companies and insurance agencies. HOME also conducted a survey and received responses which indicated to HOME that black homeowners in predominantly black neighborhoods in the City of Richmond were charged more for homeowners\u2019 insurance than white homeowners in white neighborhoods in the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">In the course of its investigation, HOME decided to conduct tests of insurance companies. HOME conducted 90 \u201cpairs of tests\u201d and 15 of those tests included Nationwide agents. Chamberlin described the tests as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\">\u201cInsurance testing is a little bit different from rental testing, for instance. ... In insurance testing, what you\u2019re doing, you\u2019re not matching people. You\u2019re matching houses. What we did was to try to find matched pairs of houses, houses that were similar in age and construction and maintenance. The primary difference between the houses is that one house would be in [a black] neighborhood and one house would be in a white neighborhood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-8\">\u201cTesters were assigned to those houses. A tester who was going to make a call, a white tester would be assigned to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>white house in a white neighborhood to call about, and a black tester would be assigned to a black house in a black neighborhood to call about. Each would make calls to the same agency to see whether they could get homeownersf] insurance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">In response to the question, \u201cWhy do you need to use testing to investigate discrimination?\u201d, Chamberlin replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-5\">\u201cWell . . . discrimination doesn\u2019t happen with somebody saying \u2018I\u2019m not going to do this because.\u2019 People are too smart, if they are going to discriminate, to do it that way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">\u201cTesting is frequently the only way that you can develop the evidence that will let you know what is really going on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">\u201cTesting can ... be a very clear indication of whether [racial] discrimination is occurring.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">HOME employed a test coordinator to supervise the testing. All testers were trained \u201cto be objective and careful observers.\u201d Chamberlin described the persons who conducted the tests as \u201csome of [HOME\u2019s] most experienced testers. They were people who were trained and willing to do this.\u201d The testers were people with various professions and included \u201cbankers and salespeople and directors of organizations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">Fifteen tests were conducted on Nationwide. Matthew Hines, HOME\u2019S test coordinator for the Nationwide tests, testified that he decided to test houses in Ginter Park, described as a white neighborhood in Richmond, and Highland Park and Barton Heights, described as black neighborhoods in Richmond.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">Wanda Canada, a tester, testified that she called Daniel J. Size-more, a Nationwide agent, on July 5, 1995. She told him that she desired to purchase a house in the Barton Heights neighborhood and that the closing date was July 24, 1995. She informed him that she desired to obtain a quote for homeowners\u2019 insurance. He refused to provide her with a quote for the insurance. He stated: \u201cFor homes over 50 years, we require a preinspection by one of our inspectors. We like to have a 30-day lead time to get an inspector out there, to check the plumbing, the roof; make sure that everything is okay.\u201d However, the same Nationwide agent, Daniel J. Sizemore, treated a white tester differently. Elizabeth Poe testified that on May 16, 1996, she contacted Sizemore. She informed him that she desired homeowners\u2019 insurance for a house located on East Seminary Avenue, which was described as a white neighborhood. She stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>\u201cI called him up and we spoke about the address. I told him the address of the neighborhood, and then he asked me a number of questions about the house, the age of [the] house, the construction and all of those things. And then at the . . . end he suggested that we needed to insure it for more than its value to have guaranteed replacement cost. I said: Would you insure it for the price, the purchase price? He said at that point he would need to \u2014 I need more information on the square footage. I agreed to call him back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-3\">\u201cHe gave me a verbal quote over the phone. I called him back the next day with the square footage for the basement and each floor, and then he gave me a slightly different quote when he mailed me the written quote, which he mailed very promptly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">Canada also performed a test with Nationwide\u2019s agent, A1 Taylor. She called Taylor on July 20, 1995, and told him that she intended to purchase a house in the Barton Heights neighborhood and that the house was 70 years old. Taylor refused to provide her with a quote for the requested insurance. Rather, he responded, \u201cI don\u2019t have a market for it. . . . [I]t\u2019s 70 years old, and that\u2019s too bad, and the only thing I could do is call [another insurance company].\u201d Sandra K. Green, a white tester, conducted a test with A1 Taylor on July 10, 1995. She called him and told him that she was \u201cbuying a house and . . . needed quotes for homeowners[\u2019] insurance.\u201d In response to questions that he asked, she told him that the house she desired to insure was in Ginter Park and that the house was over 70 years old. He told her that he could provide her with homeowners\u2019 insurance and quoted her a premium of $344. Subsequently, he forwarded a written quote to her in the mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Regina Leftwich, a black tester, performed a test on Nationwide agent, John R. Stech, Jr. She placed a telephone call to Stech\u2019s office and Linda Estes answered the telephone. Leftwich told Estes that she desired to obtain homeowners\u2019 insurance for a house on Edge wood Avenue, which is located in the Barton Heights neighborhood. Estes asked her for the zip code of the property, and Leftwich gave it to her. Leftwich also informed Estes that the house was over 70 years old. She told Estes that the closing date was October 31. Estes initially told Leftwich that Leftwich could obtain insurance at a rate of $306 per year. Leftwich asked Estes to mail a written quote to her, and Estes promised to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Later, Estes called Leftwich over the telephone and stated, \u201cI saw the house, I can\u2019t insure it, sorry,\u201d and hung up the phone. Subsequently, Leftwich placed a telephone call to Estes and asked why \u201cNationwide was unable to write homeowners[\u2019] insurance . . . and was there an issue of which [she] should be aware. [Estes] said this particular Nationwide office did not write homeowners[\u2019] [insurance] for houses greater than 50 years of age.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">At trial, Stech testified that he was aware that Linda Estes had spoken to Leftwich and that his office had sent a written quote for insurance to her. He also confirmed that he called Ms. Estes and told her that \u201c[w]e cannot now give you a quote on this property\u201d and that no reason was given for the failure to provide a quote. Stech gave the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-5\">\u201cQ: Ms. Estes told [Leftwich] that your office did not insure homes over 50 years old; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">\u201cA: That\u2019s was Ms. Estes said, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">\u201cQ: When Ms. Estes told Ms. Leftwich that your office does not insure homes over 50 years old, that was untrue, wasn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">\u201cA: Yes, it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-9\">\u201cQ: Because you understood that Nationwide did insure homes over 50 years, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-10\">\u201cA: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-11\">\u201cQ: In fact, you, just within the few days prior or around the situation with Ms. Leftwich, you had issued quotes or processed insurance applications for homes that were over 50 years of age; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-12\">\u201cA: That\u2019s correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-13\">Stech also testified that he had mailed a written quote for homeowners\u2019 insurance to a white female for a home over 50 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-14\">HOME\u2019S testing of Nationwide revealed that Nationwide refused to issue homeowners\u2019 insurance quotes for nine of the 15 tests for houses in black neighborhoods, which totaled a 60% rejection rate. However, Nationwide only refused to provide quotes for four of the 16 homes in white neighborhoods, a 25% rejection rate. Each pair of homes was matched, however, for similar features and age.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-15\">Nationwide agents gave the following reasons for their decisions to refuse to offer homeowners\u2019 insurance to homeowners in predomi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>nantly black neighborhoods: Nationwide did not insure homes over 50 years old; Nationwide needed 30 days notice before closing in order to write insurance; or Nationwide did not insure homes with market values less than $60,000. However, in each corresponding test, the white tester who received a quote had represented to the Nationwide insurance agent that the \u201cquoted\u201d house had a similar age, closing date, and market value as a house in a black neighborhood for which Nationwide refused to provide an insurance quote. In every test in which both homes received quotes, the quotes for insurance premiums given to the black testers were higher than the quotes given to the white testers.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">Patrick Irvine, a Nationwide employee, had been the agency manager in central Virginia for over 28 years. He testified that a Nationwide agent can provide a homeowner with a quote even if a house is over 50 years old and an inspection has not been performed. The quote would simply be subject to a favorable inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Joseph Lowe, III, a former Nationwide insurance agent, testified that Nationwide used race as a factor to distinguish between the issuance of homeowners\u2019 insurance policies to homeowners in black neighborhoods and homeowners in white neighborhoods. He gave the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">\u201cQ: Let me ask you: Do you remember, even generally, specific homes that you tried to insure in [black] neighborhoods that may have been comparable to homes in other neighborhoods?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">\u201cA: I can\u2019t remember specific homes, but I can remember neighborhoods. In other words, some neighborhoods, primarily over in the Church Hill section [of Richmond], over in the east end, I would write a particular house, and Nationwide would not accept that house. And I, for certain reasons, I\u2019ve seen houses of the same caliber written in white neighbor[hoods] that Nationwide did accept. And I even had cases where I\u2019d go into a house in a neighborhood, wrote that house, wrote that particular house . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-8\">\u201cI\u2019ve gone into certain neighborhoods and written houses that Nationwide rejected that particular house because of the house next door to it; in other words, saying that the house next door to it is too \u2014 it\u2019s too close, or too old, or something of that nature. When that same house that Nationwide rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>was written in a . . . white neighborhood, I have gotten that same similar house through. Put it that way.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">William H. Lee, Sr., another former Nationwide insurance agent, testified that Nationwide treated homeowners in black neighborhoods differently than it treated homeowners in white neighborhoods. He said that Nationwide implicitly directed its insurance agents that Nationwide did not wish to insure properties in certain black neighborhoods in Richmond. He also testified that Nationwide applied its insurance underwriting standards more stringently to houses in black neighborhoods:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">\u201cQ: And how did Nationwide\u2019s treatment, based on your observation and your experience, how did Nationwide\u2019s treatment of homes in [black] areas compare with Nationwide\u2019s treatment of homes in [white] areas?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">\u201cA. Much stricter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">\u201cQ: Much more strict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">\u201cA: That\u2019s right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">Nationwide used the racial composition of neighborhoods as a factor in its marketing strategies. After a 1990 market study, Nationwide used a racial profile report known as Micro Vision. The developers of Micro Vision identified every zip code in the United States and placed each zip code into one of 50 categories, evaluated primarily by racial identity. Nationwide used these designations that contained racially-offensive stereotypical names. For example, black communities with certain zip codes in Richmond were referred to as \u201cdifficult times.\u201d Members of this community were described as \u201cworking hard to survive, they have little time for recreation, but they do watch situation comedies and read TV Guide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">Nationwide divided Richmond zip codes into market groups and applied racial profiles to each zip code area. Four of the market groups were designated \u201caffluent,\u201d \u201cmainstream,\u201d \u201cmature,\u201d and \u201ccountry living,\u201d and were considered by Nationwide as favorable marketing groups. Neighborhoods comprised of white homeowners were placed in these favorable marketing classifications. Nationwide classified every black neighborhood in Richmond as unfavorable and placed the neighborhoods in an undesirable marketing category labeled \u201cremaining diverse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">Nationwide also used a marketing tool referred to as its Local Area Marketing Plan to help define Nationwide\u2019s insurance market. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>This marketing plan also placed every zip code into one of four categories: best in state, best in market, next best in market, and remaining. Every zip code area that had a predominantly black population in Richmond was placed in the \u201cremaining\u201d category.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">John Robert Hunter, Jr., who served as the chief actuary of the Federal Insurance Administration Agency, and who was subsequently the administrator of the Federal Insurance Agency in the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development under two United States presidents, qualified as an expert witness on the subjects of regulation of insurance companies, issuance of homeowners\u2019 insurance policies, \u201credlining,\u201d insurance actuaries, and insurance surplus requirements. He testified that from an actuarial vantage, the racial composition of a neighborhood has no correlation to insurance risks. He testified that Nationwide\u2019s marketing data is not related to actuarial data or experience in the community, but that Nationwide\u2019s marketing plan and its Micro Vision material contain racial identifiers. Hunter opined, without objection, that Nationwide\u2019s marketing policies and strategies indicate that Nationwide tried to avoid issuing insurance policies to black homeowners in black neighborhoods in Richmond.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Rick Becker, Nationwide\u2019s market manager for the Commonwealth of Virginia, testified that Nationwide\u2019s homeowners\u2019 insurance products that are sold in black neighborhoods are more expensive and less comprehensive than other Nationwide products which afford more protection to non-black homeowners. Dr. Scott Harrington, Nationwide\u2019s own expert witness, gave the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">\u201cQ: A company\u2019s target market, in which you discuss target marketing, should not focus on racial characteristics of neighborhoods, should it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">\u201cA: That would be illegal and unfair, in my opinion. It\u2019s illegal and, according to my opinion, it would be very unfair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">\u201cQ: Just because a neighborhood is a minority neighborhood does not mean, for example, it\u2019s a bad risk or likely to have losses, for example, or excess losses, would it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-9\">\u201cA: You\u2019re correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">Chamberlin, HOME\u2019S executive director, testified that HOME was forced to divert resources from other agency programs in order to conduct its investigation of Nationwide\u2019s racially-discriminatory practices. Additionally, HOME expended $6,000 to $7,000 worth of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>staff time to conduct the investigation. HOME also was required to provide approximately $150,000 of its resources to implement a HUD-sponsored grant which it had obtained to investigate race or discriminatory practices in the provision of homeowners\u2019 insurance. HOME also had to divert resources from other programs to conduct its investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">in.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Code \u00a7 36.96.1(B), which is part of the Virginia Fair Housing Law, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">\u201cIt is the policy of the Commonwealth of Virginia to provide for fair housing throughout the Commonwealth, to all its citizens, regardless of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, elderliness, familial status, or handicap, and to that end to prohibit discriminatory practices with respect to residential housing by any person or group of persons, in order that the peace, health, safety, prosperity, and general welfare of all the inhabitants of the Commonwealth may be protected and insured.

Responding, HOME contends that it is an aggrieved person within the meaning of the Virginia Fair Housing Law and that Code \u00a736-96.1:1 specifically contemplates that fair housing organizations, such as HOME, would be permitted to seek redress in the courts for conduct which is proscribed by the Virginia Fair Housing Law. I agree with HOME.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>In <em>Virginia Beach Beautification Commission, </em>this Court considered whether a beautification commission had standing at common law to challenge a board of zoning appeals\u2019 decision to grant a height and setback variance for the construction of a hotel. The commission was a non-stock Virginia corporation with a membership of over 400 persons and organizations, and its stated goal was \u201c \u2018to help make and keep Virginia Beach one of the most beautiful cities in the state.\u2019 \u201d <em>Virginia Beach Beautification Commission, </em>231 Va. at 418, 344 S.E.2d at 902.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">This Court observed that the commission was a person within the meaning of Code \u00a7 15.1-497 which provides that any \u201cperson\u201d who is \u201caggrieved\u201d by any decision of a board of appeals, \u201cor any taxpayer,\u201d may present to the appropriate circuit court a petition for certiorari to review the decision. <em>Id. </em>This Court held, however, that the commission was not a person \u201caggrieved\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 15.1-497. Applying common law principles, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">\u201cThe term \u2018aggrieved\u2019 has a settled meaning in Virginia when it becomes necessary to determine who is a proper party to seek court relief from an adverse decision. In order for a petitioner to be \u2018aggrieved,\u2019 it must affirmatively appear that such person had some direct interest in the subject matter of the proceeding that he seeks to attack. <em>Nicholas </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>161 Va. 589, 592, 171 S.E. 673, 674 (1933). The petitioner \u2018must show that he has an immediate, pecuniary and substantial interest in the litigation, and not a remote or indirect interest.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 593, 171 S.E. at 674.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">231 Va. at 419, 344 S.E.2d at 902.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Our holding in <em>Virginia Beach Beautification Commission, </em>however, is simply not pertinent here. Code \u00a7 15.1-497<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>, unlike Code \u00a7 36-96.1:1 of the Virginia Fair Housing Law, does not contain a definition of the term \u201caggrieved person.\u201d The statutory definition of \u201caggrieved person\u201d contained in Code \u00a7 36-96.1:1 is significantly different and less stringent than the word \u201caggrieved\u201d that is discussed in <em>Virginia Beach Beautification Commission. </em>For example, the statutory definition of \u201caggrieved person\u201d contained in Code \u00a7 36-96.1:1 refers to any person who <em>claims </em>to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice or <em>believes </em>that such person will be injured by a discriminatory housing practice that is <em>about </em>to occur. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>This standard is significantly different from our common law definition of \u201caggrieved\u201d because at common law, a plaintiff is required to show more; a plaintiff is required to demonstrate that he has an immediate, pecuniary, and substantial interest in the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">Under common law standing principles, a housing organization would not have standing to vindicate a violation of the Virginia Fair Housing Law because the common law required that the housing organization possess an immediate, pecuniary, and substantial interest in the litigation. Yet, the General Assembly amended the Fair Housing Law in 1991 to include a housing organization as \u201ca person\u201d within the meaning of that law.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Under the majority\u2019s holding, a fair housing organization such as HOME would never have standing to pursue a cause of action or administrative remedies under the Virginia Fair Housing Law because a housing organization could <em>never </em>incur an injury. Code \u00a7 36-96.1:1 defines an \u201caggrieved person\u201d as any person who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice or believes that such person will be injured by a discriminatory practice that is about to occur. This Code provision also defines \u201cperson,\u201d among other things, as a fair housing organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Code \u00a7 36-96.4(A) prohibits an insurance company, such as Nationwide, from engaging in acts of racial discrimination in housing-related transactions. HOME, which is a fair housing organization and also a Virginia corporation, does not have a racial identity. Because HOME has no racial identity, under the majority\u2019s holding, HOME could never be injured within the meaning of the Virginia Fair Housing Law. Significantly, and most disturbing, the majority is unable to explain how a housing organization could ever have standing to pursue a claim under the Virginia Fair Housing Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">The effect of the majority\u2019s construction of the word \u201cinjured\u201d is to render meaningless the General Assembly\u2019s 1991 amendment of the Virginia Fair Housing Law to include housing organizations within the definition of \u201cperson.\u201d This Court has held that the General Assembly does not perform meaningless, useless, or vain acts when enacting legislation. This Court stated in <em>Natrella </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>231 Va. 451, 461, 345 S.E.2d 295, 301 (1986) (quoting <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Conwell, </em>227 Va. 176, 181, 314 S.E.2d 61, 64 (1984)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">\u201c \u2018The rules of statutory interpretation argue against reading any legislative enactment in a manner that will make a portion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>of it useless, repetitious, or absurd. On the contrary, it is well established that every act of the legislature should be read so as to give reasonable effect to every word and to promote the ability of the enactment to remedy the mischief at which it is directed.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-4\"><em>Accord Sims Wholesale Co. </em>v. <em>Brown-Forman Corp., </em>251 Va. 398, 405, 468 S.E.2d 905, 909 (1996); <em>RCC, Inc. </em>v. <em>Roanoke &amp; Botetourt Tel. Co., </em>223 Va. 342, 347, 288 S.E.2d 478, 481 (1982); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>190 Va. 280, 293, 56 S.E.2d 537, 543 (1949). By ignoring this basic principle of jurisprudence, the majority has effectively repealed those portions of the Virginia Fair Housing Law which relate to fair housing organizations such as HOME.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Furthermore, the majority\u2019s resort to the common law for a definition of \u201cinjury\u201d is in direct conflict with Code \u00a7 36-96.1:1 of the Virginia Fair Housing Law. This statute permits a litigant to pursue a cause of action under the Virginia Fair Housing Law if the litigant <em>believes </em>that such litigant <em>\u201cwill be injured </em>by a discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added). This statutory standard is less restrictive than the common law and, therefore, the common law cannot be used to provide a definition for the term \u201cinjured\u201d because the Virginia Fair Housing Law expressly expands the scope of persons who can incur a legally cognizable injury. Thus, I would hold that in the very narrow context of the Virginia Fair Housing Law, the General Assembly, through its statutory definition of \u201caggrieved person,\u201d and its inclusion of fair housing organizations within the definition of \u201cperson,\u201d intended to relax the standing requirements so that fair housing organizations could use the courts to seek redress for certain types of discriminatory acts proscribed by the Virginia Fair Housing Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">I also observe that Nationwide agreed in the circuit court that HOME would have standing under the Virginia Fair Housing Law under certain circumstances. The following dialogue appears in the record between the circuit court and HOME\u2019S counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">\u201cThe Court: My question again is, and maybe you didn\u2019t answer, maybe you missed it, but give me a situation in which HOME would have standing [under the Virginia Fair Housing Law] under your argument?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-8\">\u201c[Counsel for Nationwide]: The way they would have standing is if they went on and did an investigation on a broad, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>general basis. And as a result of that, they, something was suspicious to them and then diverted resources.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-3\">\u201cThe Court: They would have diverted resources from where? What resources are you talking about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-4\">\u201c[Counsel for Nationwide]: If they did something that did harm to one of their other functions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Even under the theory that Nationwide advanced in the circuit court, HOME would have standing because as the evidence of record demonstrates, HOME undertook a broad investigation of 30 insurance companies and insurance agencies, and the results of that investigation indicated that Nationwide committed acts of racial discrimination in violation of the Virginia Fair Housing Law. Additionally, HOME did indeed divert resources from other programs so that it could document Nationwide\u2019s invidious acts of racial discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">I would not permit Nationwide to assert a position in the circuit court in direct response to a question raised by that court and then seek to assert a different position on appeal. \u201c \u2018[P]arties litigant may not [take] inconsistent positions at different stages of . . . proceedings in court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lotz Realty Co., </em>237 Va. 1, 7, 376 S.E.2d 54, 57 (1989) (quoting <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>140 Va. 522, 536, 125 S.E. 437, 441 (1924)).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">I reiterate that I would not abandon, or retreat from, in any fashion, the common law standing principles which this Court discussed in <em>Virginia Beach Beautification Commission. </em>I would merely hold that when the General Assembly enacts a statute which prescribes a standard for standing which is less stringent than our common law standard, this Court must adhere to the statutorily-prescribed standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">I recognize that HOME must still claim an injury or show that it was injured by a discriminatory housing practice that was about to occur. HOME presented evidence that it was injured within the meaning of Code \u00a7 36-96.1:1 because it expended thousands of dollars in resources to establish Nationwide\u2019s practices of racial discrimination against black homeowners. I also observe that the United States Supreme Court held in <em>Havens Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>455 U.S. 363, 379 (1982), that HOME had standing under the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3601, <em>et seq. </em>(1994), to pursue a claim for racial discrimination against an owner of an apartment complex because HOME had alleged that the apartment owner\u2019s acts of racial discrimination frustrated HOME\u2019S mission of promoting equal access to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>housing and forced HOME to devote resources to identify and counteract such practice. The Supreme Court held that HOME\u2019S allegations that it had to devote significant resources to identify and counteract the apartment owner\u2019s acts of racial discrimination constituted a discrete and demonstrable injury to HOME. <em>Id. See also Ragin </em>v. <em>Harry Macklowe Real Estate Co., 6 </em>F.3d 898, 905 (2nd Cir. 1993); <em>Hooker </em>v. <em>Weathers, </em>990 F.2d 913, 915 (6th Cir. 1993); <em>Village of Bellwood </em>v. <em>Dwivedi, </em>895 F.2d 1521, 1525-26 (7th Cir. 1990). In this case, HOME was required to devote additional financial resources to counteract Nationwide\u2019s racially-discriminatory conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">The fact that HOME was not aware of Nationwide\u2019s racially-discriminatory housing practices before HOME initiated its investigation has no legal relevance to the issue whether HOME has standing to pursue its cause of action. Rather, the appropriate inquiry is whether HOME was required to devote significant resources in its quest to successfully identify and counteract Nationwide\u2019s racially-discriminatory housing practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Nationwide argues that the trial court erred \u201cby allowing HOME to establish liability based on conduct that is not \u2018discrimination\u2019 under the Virginia Fair Housing Law.\u201d Continuing, Nationwide says that the \u201c[Virginia Fair Housing Law] prohibits \u2018discrimination] against any person in making available\u2019 a \u2018residential real estate-related transaction\u2019 or in the \u2018terms or conditions of such a transaction\u2019 \u201d and that \u201c[t]he trial court erred by allowing HOME to establish liability based on an alleged failure affirmatively to target [black] neighborhoods.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">Nationwide\u2019s argument is meritless. HOME presented compelling evidence that Nationwide had intentionally engaged in acts of racial discrimination in selling homeowners\u2019 insurance in the City of Richmond. HOME\u2019S evidence demonstrated that Nationwide applied more stringent requirements to black homeowners who sought to acquire homeowners\u2019 insurance. The evidence also revealed that Nationwide applied one set of criteria when deciding to issue homeowners\u2019 insurance to white property owners in predominantly white communities, but yet applied a different set of criteria to black property owners who lived in predominantly black neighborhoods. Nationwide\u2019s agents admitted in court that they lied to HOME\u2019S black testers when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>those testers called to receive quotes for homeowners\u2019 insurance from Nationwide\u2019s agents. Nationwide also used race in its marketing plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-3\">HOME did not seek to require that Nationwide undertake \u201caffirmative race-based marketing or advertising\u201d as Nationwide claims. Rather, HOME demonstrated, with powerful and persuasive evidence, that Nationwide used race as a factor in its decisions whether to grant homeowners\u2019 insurance to black homeowners who live in black neighborhoods in Richmond.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Nationwide contends that the circuit court \u201cerred by allowing HOME to establish liability under the Fair Housing Law on the theory that Nationwide lobbied the United States Congress regarding the scope of the federal Fair Housing Act.\u201d Nationwide says that its lobbying activities were not relevant to the alleged violation of the Virginia Fair Housing Law and that its free speech is protected by the Virginia and federal constitutions. Continuing, Nationwide states that although it \u201cmoved before trial to exclude any reference to such lobbying ... the [circuit] court denied the motion . . . HOME took full advantage of that ruling, emphasizing in its opening statement that Nationwide, \u2018after it became aware that it was ignoring minority neighborhoods . . . spent significant amounts of time trying to convince Congress . . . that it was not subject to the anti-discrimination laws that Congress had passed, instead trying to fix the problem.\u2019 \u201d Nationwide\u2019s contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">My review of the record indicates that Nationwide made this inquiry relevant when Nationwide, during its cross-examination of HOME\u2019S executive director, Chamberlin, challenged whether HOME had any specific complaints or evidence that Nationwide had denied insurance to black homeowners on the basis of race when HOME sought federal funds to finance its examination of racially-disparate practices in the homeowners\u2019 insurance industry in central Virginia. During HOME\u2019S redirect examination of Chamberlin, the following dialogue occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">\u201cQ: Finally, Ms. Chamberlin, a number of questions were asked you about whether you had specific complaints about Nationwide agents prior to applying for and receiving the [federal] grant or filing this lawsuit. Do you remember those questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>\u201cA: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\">\u201cQ: What else \u2014 and you answered those questions. What else did HOME know or had HOME heard about Nationwide prior to filing for the [federal] grant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-6\">\u201cA: Well, we knew that they had . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-7\">\u201c[Counsel for Nationwide]: I would ask that the witness be required to establish a foundation as to how they knew what they knew.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-8\">\u201cThe Court: Overruled. And I will see what the answer is, but same admonition. This goes only to Ms. Chamberlin\u2019s thought processes and the reasons HOME did what they did, not for the truth of anything that I think she\u2019s getting ready to tell you. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-9\">\u201c[Counsel for HOME]: Ms. Chamberlin, what did HOME know, or what had HOME heard concerning Nationwide prior to the filing of this lawsuit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-10\">\u201cA: We knew that the National Fair Housing Alliance had done testing of Nationwide in about 10 cities across the country, and that they had filed a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development. We knew that there had been a complaint against Nationwide filed in Toledo, alleging differential treatment and underwriting standards which had a disparate impact on African Americans. We knew that Nationwide, in about 1996, had attempted to eliminate the funding for fair housing investigations of homeowners[\u2019] insurance from HUD.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">As the above dialogue indicates, the circuit court permitted Chamberlin to testify about the reasons HOME decided to examine Nationwide\u2019s homeowners\u2019 insurance marketing practices. This line of inquiry was appropriate because Nationwide\u2019s own attorney raised this subject on direct examination. The trial court did not admit the testimony for \u201cthe truth of anything,\u201d but limited the testimony as evidence of HOME\u2019S executive director\u2019s thought processes. The circuit court\u2019s ruling in no way impaired any federal or state constitutional rights that Nationwide may have to lobby national or state legislative bodies. Indeed, Nationwide \u201copened the door\u201d to the very inquiry of which it now complains.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Nationwide argues that the compensatory damage award of $500,000 is improper. Nationwide says that the award consists of two distinct components, $56,000 for HOME\u2019S investigation and prelitigation expenses and $444,000 for unspecified frustration of mission. Continuing, Nationwide argues that HOME did not sustain an injury and that there is no evidentiary foundation for the award of compensatory damages. I disagree with Nationwide\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">This Court has held that damages must be proved with reasonable, but not absolute, certainty. <em>Oden </em>v. <em>Salch, </em>237 Va. 525, 535, 379 S.E.2d 346, 352 (1989); <em>Gwaltney </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>196 Va. 505, 507-08, 84 S.E.2d 501, 502 (1954). The jury\u2019s award of compensatory damages must be based upon the evidence and not left to speculation. However, a litigant is not required to prove damages with absolute certainty and is only required to place before the jury \u201c \u2018all the facts and circumstances of the case having any tendency to show damages, or their probable amount, so as to enable [the jury] to make the most intelligible and probable estimate which the nature of the case will admit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Oden, </em>237 Va. at 536, 379 S.E.2d at 352 (quoting <em>Southern Railway Co. </em>v. <em>McMenamin, </em>113 Va. 121, 129, 73 S.E. 980, 982 (1912)); <em>accord National Energy Corp. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Quinn, </em>223 Va. 83, 90, 286 S.E.2d 181, 185 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">I would hold that HOME presented the jury with evidence that is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s award of compensatory damages. HOME presented evidence from which the jury could infer that HOME suffered damages within the meaning of the Virginia Fair Housing statute as a result of Nationwide\u2019s invidious acts of racial discrimination. HOME\u2019S executive director testified that HOME expended $150,000 of \u201cin-kind\u201d resources associated with its efforts to document Nationwide\u2019s racially-discriminatory practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Moreover, the jury was instructed with a general verdict, as required by our precedent. Therefore, Nationwide\u2019s suggestion of the method by which the jury arrived at its verdict is mere speculation and cannot be used as a basis to disturb the verdict that has been confirmed by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">Nationwide argues that the jury\u2019s award of $100,000,000 in punitive damages is legally improper. First, Nationwide argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>HOME failed to establish that it is entitled to any award of punitive damages. Continuing, Nationwide asserts that the award of $100,000,000 in punitive damages is grossly excessive and disproportionate. Responding, HOME asserts that it proved Nationwide had engaged in intentional and willful racial discrimination and that the jury\u2019s award of punitive damages is not excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Nationwide\u2019s assertion that HOME failed to establish that it is entitled to any award of punitive damages is meritless. Code \u00a7 36-96.18(C) of the Virginia Fair Housing Law, states in relevant part: \u201cIn a civil action under [this statute], if the court or jury finds that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur, the court or jury may award to the plaintiff, as the prevailing party, compensatory and punitive damages, without limitation otherwise imposed by state law, and the court may award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">This Court has repeatedly held that \u201can award of punitive damages is not favored generally because punitive damages are in the nature of a penalty and should be awarded only in cases involving the most egregious conduct.\u201d <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Westvaco Corp., </em>244 Va. 139, 150, 419 S.E.2d 661, 668 (1992); <em>Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>243 Va. 128, 144, 413 S.E.2d 630, 639 (1992); <em>Philip Morris, Inc. </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>235 Va. 380, 407, 368 S.E.2d 268, 283 (1988); <em>see Simbeck, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dodd Sisk Whitlock Corp., </em>257 Va. 53, 58, 508 S.E.2d 601, 604 (1999). A plaintiff who seeks an award of punitive damages against a defendant must present evidence that the defendant\u2019s acts were \u201c \u2018so willful or wanton as to evince a conscious disregard of the rights of others, as well as malicious conduct ....\u2019\u201d <em>Bowers, </em>244 Va. at 150, 419 S.E.2d at 668 (quoting <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>236 Va. 269, 273, 374 S.E.2d 1, 3 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">This Court has stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">\u201c \u2018[i]n order that one may be guilty of wilful or wanton conduct, it must be shown that he was conscious of his conduct, and conscious, from his knowledge of existing conditions, that injury would likely or probably result from his conduct, and that with reckless indifference to consequences he consciously and intentionally did some wrongful act or omitted some known duty which produced the injurious result.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-8\"><em>Infant C. </em>v. <em>Boy Scouts of America, Inc., </em>239 Va. 572, 581, 391 S.E.2d 322, 327 (1990) (quoting <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>162 Va. 654, 660, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>174 S.E. 837, 839 (1934)); <em>Bowers, </em>244 Va. at 150, 419 S.E.2d at 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-3\">I would hold that in view of the evidence contained in Part II.B. of this dissent, HOME presented sufficient evidence which would support \u25a0 an award of punitive damages. Simply stated, HOME presented evidence which would permit a jury to find that Nationwide, through the use of its marketing strategies and practices, engaged in willful acts of racial discrimination which evinced a conscious disregard of the rights of black property owners who resided in black neighborhoods in the City of Richmond. I need not repeat the facts which support this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">I now consider whether the jury\u2019s award of $100,000,000 in punitive damages is excessive. The issue whether a jury\u2019s award of punitive damages is excessive is a legal question. <em>Bassett Furniture Industries </em>v. <em>McReynolds, </em>216 Va. 897, 913, 224 S.E.2d 323, 333 (1976). Additionally, this Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">\u201c \u2018[I]t is an ancient and accepted doctrine of the common law, that judges have the power and are clearly charged with the duty of setting aside verdicts where the damages are either so excessive or so small as to shock the conscience and to create the impression that the jury has been influenced by passion or prejudice, or has in some way misconceived or misinterpreted the facts or the law which should guide them to a just conclusion.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 912 n.*, 224 S.E.2d at 333 n.*.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">We have also stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-9\">\u201cOrdinarily, a damage award fixed by a jury after a properly conducted trial and approved by the trial judge is held to be inviolate against disturbance by the appellate court. There is no rigid standard for measuring punitive damages; the amount of such an award is largely a matter within the discretion of the fact finder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-10\"><em>Hamilton Development Co. </em>v. <em>Broad Rock Club, </em>248 Va. 40, 45-46, 445 S.E.2d 140, 144 (1994) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">In <em>Philip Morris, Inc., </em>235 Va. at 414, 368 S.E.2d at 287, this Court adopted the standard of appellate review for punitive damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>that it previously adopted for compensatory damages in <em>Modaber </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>232 Va. 60, 348 S.E.2d 233 (1986). In <em>Modaber, </em>this Court held that an appellate court must declare a verdict excessive and rule that the circuit court had abused its discretion in refusing to set the verdict aside</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">\u201cwhenever the size of the award shocks the conscience of the Court and creates the impression that the jury was biased in favor of the plaintiff or prejudiced against the defendant or has misconceived or misunderstood the facts or the law, or if the award is so out of proportion to the plaintiff\u2019s [damages] as to suggest that it is not the product of a fair and impartial decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">232 Va. at 69, 348 S.E.2d at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Applying the standard, I would hold that the jury\u2019s award of punitive damages in the amount of $100,000,000 is so excessive as to shock the conscience of this Court. I fully recognize that racial discrimination is odious and that no citizen, irrespective of his or her race, should be required to suffer the humiliation and indignities associated with such discrimination. I also recognize that HOME presented evidence which would support the jury\u2019s finding that Nationwide committed intentional and pervasive acts of racial discrimination. However, the jury\u2019s award of punitive damages against Nationwide is 200 times the amount of the jury\u2019s award of $500,000 in compensatory damages. Even though the jury\u2019s punitive damage award of $100,000,000 represents a small amount of Nationwide\u2019s policyholder surplus of $9.1 billion, the magnitude of the award nonetheless remains shocking to the conscience of this Court. Therefore, I would hold that the circuit court erred in failing to set aside the jury\u2019s award of punitive damages and order a new trial on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">I have reviewed Nationwide\u2019s remaining arguments, and they are without merit. For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm that portion of the circuit court\u2019s judgment which approved the jury\u2019s award of $500,000 in compensatory damages to HOME. I would reverse that portion of the judgment which confirmed the jury\u2019s award of punitive damages, and I would remand this case to the circuit court for a new trial on the amount of punitive damages that should be assessed against Nationwide.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b58-8\"> Code \u00a7 15.1-497 has been recodified and is currently Code \u00a7 15.2-2314.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
