App. 306, 504 S.E.2d 394 (1998)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As in that case, the question is whether the trial court, here the Circuit Court of Loudoun County (the circuit court), lacked jurisdiction to try David Allen Moore, a juvenile, as an adult on indictments charging him with two counts of murder and the use of a firearm in the commission of those murders. Specifically, the question is whether the failure of the Loudoun County Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court (the juvenile court) to give notice of the initiation of juvenile court proceedings against Moore, required by the then applicable provisions of Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-263 and 16.1-264, to his biological father rendered the subsequent transfer of jurisdiction by the juvenile court to the circuit court ineffectual and, thus, the convictions of Moore void.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">The pertinent facts are not in dispute. Moore was bom on May 13, 1977. In December 1994, four petitions were filed in the juvenile court charging that Moore committed the above noted criminal offenses in January 1994. On each petition in the space provided on the pre-printed form for the name and address of the juvenile\u2019s mother, \u201cLillie Ruth Moore \u2014 Arlington County Jail\u201d was listed. A similar space regarding the juvenile\u2019s father was left blank. The juvenile court judge made no certification on the record that the identity of Moore\u2019s father was not reasonably ascertainable and no affidavit to that effect was made by Moore\u2019s mother. However, in a social history report later filed in the juvenile court by a probation coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>selor of that court, Moore\u2019s father was identified as \u201cVernon Butts\u201d and his location was identified as \u201cTampa, Florida (exact address unknown).\u201d Moore\u2019s mother was never married to Butts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moore and his mother were summoned to appear in the juvenile court regarding the allegations in the petitions. Moore\u2019s father was not summoned and did not voluntarily appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">Throughout the juvenile court proceedings Moore was held in custody and was represented by two court-appointed attorneys. According to court records, Moore\u2019s mother did not appear at any of the hearings in the juvenile court. Ultimately, following a transfer hearing at which Moore and his attorneys were present, the juvenile court by order entered on June 14, 1995, found probable cause that Moore had committed the criminal offenses charged in the petitions and certified Moore to stand trial as an adult in the circuit court for those offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Moore was indicted for those offenses on July 28, 1995, found guilty of each by a jury on February 6, 1997, and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two life sentences and eight years on December 19, 1997. Throughout the proceedings, both in the juvenile court and the circuit court, Moore raised no objection to the failure of the juvenile court to give notice of the initiation of the juvenile court proceedings to his father as required by the then applicable provisions of Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-263 and 16.1-264.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">On appeal to the Court of Appeals, Moore challenged his convictions on other grounds, but did not raise the issue of the failure to give notice to his father. The Court of Appeals affirmed Moore\u2019s convictions in an unpublished opinion. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>Record No. 0063-98-4 (February 23, 1999). We awarded Moore this appeal limited to the issue of the effect upon Moore\u2019s convictions of the failure to give notice to his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">We begin our analysis in this appeal by noting the significant similarities and distinctions between the facts and circumstances involved in Moore\u2019s case and those in Baker\u2019s case. In both cases the criminal acts were committed and the proceedings against the juveniles in the appropriate juvenile courts occurred when Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-263 and 16.1-264 required notice of the initiation of juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>court proceedings to the \u201cparents\u201d of the juvenile. In neither case were there certifications on the record by the juvenile court judge that the identity of one of the juvenile\u2019s parents was not reasonably ascertainable as provided in the exception to required parental notice under Code \u00a7 16.1-263(E). In both cases the juveniles\u2019 biological fathers were not given notice of the initiation of the juvenile court proceedings, or the subsequent transfer hearings, and they did not voluntarily appear at any of the hearings conducted in the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Under these circumstances, the Court of Appeals held in <em>Baker I </em>that the then applicable provisions of Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-263 and 16.1-264 required notice of the initiation of juvenile court proceedings to both parents.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, the Court of Appeals held that \u201c[bjecause the notice of the initiation of juvenile proceedings was not properly served on [Baker\u2019s biological father], the transfer of jurisdiction [to the circuit court] was ineffectual and the subsequent convictions [of the juvenile in the circuit court] are void.\u201d <em>Baker I, </em>28 Va. App. at 315, 504 S.E.2d at 399. In reaching this judgment, the Court of Appeals held that the provisions of these statutes are \u201cmandatory\u201d and \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 310, 504 S.E.2d at 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Thereafter, for the reasons stated in the opinion of the Court of Appeals, we affirmed that Court\u2019s judgment voiding Baker\u2019s convictions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Baker II, </em>258 Va. at 2, 516 S.E.2d at 220. It is then readily apparent that in the absence of any significant distinction between the two cases, our decision in <em>Baker II </em>would control in Moore\u2019s case without further analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">However, there are significant distinctions between the facts and circumstances in <em>Baker II </em>and those in Moore\u2019s case. In <em>Baker I, </em>the Court of Appeals noted that \u201c[pjrior to the indictment, Baker filed a motion to dismiss the charges or remand the case to juvenile court and alleged that the juvenile court lacked jurisdiction to transfer the case to the circuit court because the juvenile court failed to comply with the notice requirements of Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-263 and 16.1-264.\u201d 28 Va. App. at 309, 504 S.E.2d at 396. Thus, Baker preserved the issue of this defect in the juvenile court proceedings and was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>subject to the waiver of objection to the \u201cjurisdiction\u201d of the circuit court provided for in Code \u00a7 16.1-269.6(E), a statute we will address subsequently in this opinion. In contrast, as noted above, Moore raised no such objection to the defect in the juvenile court proceedings either in the juvenile court, the circuit court, or the Court of Appeals. Accordingly, it is in this context that the scope of our decision in <em>Baker II </em>must be viewed. More specifically, we must now decide, applying the applicable versions of the pertinent statutes, whether the failure to give the statutory notice of the initiation of juvenile court proceedings to a juvenile\u2019s parent is a defect in the proceedings such that it is not subject to waiver by the juvenile either in the juvenile court or the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">We continue our analysis by emphasizing the necessary distinction to be drawn here between the power of a court to adjudicate a specified class of cases, commonly known as \u201csubject matter jurisdiction,\u201d and the authority of a court to exercise that power in a particular case. Subject matter jurisdiction is granted by constitution or statute. <em>Humphreys v. Commonwealth, </em>186 Va. 765, 772, 43 S.E.2d 890, 894 (1947). It cannot be waived and any judgment rendered without it is void <em>ab initio. </em>Moreover, lack of subject matter jurisdiction \u201cmay be raised at any time, in any manner, before any court, or by the court itself.\u201d <em>Id., </em>43 S.E.2d at 893. In contrast, \u201c[a] court\u2019s authority to exercise its subject matter jurisdiction over a case may be restricted by a failure to comply with statutory requirements that are mandatory in nature and, thus, are prerequisite to a court\u2019s lawful exercise of that jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Dennis Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>259 Va. 405, 409, 527 S.E.2d 415, 417 (2000) (decided today) (holding that the failure to give statutorily required notice of initiation of juvenile court proceeding to juvenile\u2019s parent is a defect in those proceedings cured by Code \u00a7 16.1-269.1(E)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The statute that provides subject matter jurisdiction to the juvenile and domestic relations district courts is Code \u00a7 16.1-241, which gives these courts \u201cexclusive original jurisdiction\u201d over \u201call cases, matters and proceedings involving\u201d a juvenile who is alleged to be delinquent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The jurisdiction of these courts is invoked and the proceedings therein commenced by the filing of a petition. Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>\u00a7 16.1-260(A). After the petition is filed, Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-263 and 16.1-264 mandate parental notice of the initiation of the proceedings by the issuance of a summons. The subsequent transfer of such a case by the juvenile court to the circuit court is provided for under Code \u00a7 16.1-269.1. Former Code \u00a7 16.1-269, applied by the juvenile court in Moore\u2019s case, also provided for this transfer to the circuit court. While there are considerable distinctions between the statutes, when viewed in the limited context that they both provide the statutory means by which a circuit court acquires the authority to exercise its subject matter jurisdiction over a class of offenses committed by a juvenile that would otherwise fall within the exclusive original subject matter jurisdiction of the juvenile court, we need not address all those distinctions here. The significant and pertinent distinction, however, is the applicability of Code \u00a7 16.1-269.1(E), another statute we also will subsequently address in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">There is no question that when the statutory requirements related to the juvenile court proceedings are followed, a circuit court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction over the class of offenses committed by a juvenile that are at issue here is invoked. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 17.1-513 and 19.2-239. It is the unique statutory framework whereby a juvenile court and in turn a circuit court acquire the authority to exercise their subject matter jurisdiction that is at issue here and was at issue in a number of our prior cases. In this regard, we have held that the statutory requirement of parental notice of the initiation of proceedings in the juvenile court, under various former versions of what is now Code \u00a7 16.1-263, are mandatory in nature and limit a court\u2019s rightful exercise of its subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See, e.g., Gregory v. Peyton, </em>208 Va. 157, 159-60, 156 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1967); <em>Peyton v. French, </em>207 Va. 73, 80, 147 S.E.2d 739, 743 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">In <em>French, </em>where the juvenile court failed to give parental notice of the initiation of the proceedings in that court, we stated that \u201cthe failure of the juvenile court to comply with the applicable statutes rendered <em>the circuit court proceedings </em>void.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 80, 147 S.E.2d at 743 (emphasis added). Moreover, and pertinent to the present appeal, in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 425, 192 S.E.2d 775 (1972), we recognized that there had been various amendments to the notice requirements concerning juvenile court proceedings, but we stressed that \u201cthe requirement that the parents of an infant defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>charged with a crime have notification of the time and place of his trial and an opportunity to be present has remained constant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 428, 192 S.E.2d at 777. In contrast to these cases, we have distinguished specific statutory requirements and held that certain defects in the juvenile court proceedings were merely procedural and, thus, were subject to cure or waiver. <em>See, e.g., Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 666, 670, 222 S.E.2d 517, 520 (1976) (failure to provide written notice to parents cured by actual presence of juvenile\u2019s parents at transfer hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Guided by these principles, we turn to the specific circumstances in Moore\u2019s case. The notice provisions contained in the applicable version of Code \u00a7 16.1-263 require that \u201c[ajfter a petition has been filed, the court shall direct the issuance of summonses ... to the parents . . . .\u201d This requirement, although no longer containing earlier language prohibiting the hearing to proceed without the notice, is otherwise virtually identical to that considered by this Court from the time we decided <em>French </em>to the time we decided <em>Baker II. </em>Based on this Court\u2019s unswerving adherence to the nature of this notice requirement to parents, this requirement as applied to Moore\u2019s case was \u201cmandatory.\u201d Thus, because it failed to comply with this mandatory requirement, the juvenile court lacked authority to exercise its subject matter jurisdiction over the offenses charged against Moore.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It then remains only to be determined whether Code \u00a7 16.1-269.6(E) is applicable in the present case and operates to waive or cure this defect in the juvenile court proceedings such that the circuit court had the necessary authority to exercise its subject matter jurisdiction to try Moore as an adult for the offenses set forth in the indictments because Moore raised no objection to the jurisdiction of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Code \u00a7 16.1-269.6(E) became effective on My 1, 1994. As previously noted the offenses for which Moore was charged occurred in January 1994 and the petitions charging him with these offenses were filed in the juvenile court in December 1994. He was subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>quently indicted in the circuit court for these offenses on July 28, 1995, and arraigned in December 1996. Accordingly, we will assume, without deciding, that Code \u00a7 16.1-269.6(E) is applicable to Moore\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Code \u00a7 16.1-269.6(E) provides that: \u201cAny objection to the jurisdiction of the circuit court <em>pursuant to this article </em>shall be waived if not made before arraignment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The plain language of this section clearly manifests legislative intent that any defect <em>in the transfer proceedings </em>conducted in the juvenile court as provided in Article 7 is waived such that the circuit court acquires the authority to exercise its subject matter jurisdiction over the offenses charged against the juvenile unless die juvenile raises an objection based on a defect in the juvenile court transfer hearing prior to arraignment in the circuit court. Beyond question, the legislature has the authority to provide for a waiver of a defect in the transfer proceeding in this manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s reliance on Code \u00a7 16.1-269.6(E) in Moore\u2019s case, however, is misplaced. By its express terms this statute does not purport to cure or waive defects in the initiation of the juvenile court proceedings. Code \u00a7 16.1-269.1(E), enacted subsequent to this statute, addresses those defects. Code \u00a7 16.1-269.6(E), by contrast, does not address the requirements of Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-263 and 16.1-264, but only addresses the waiver of a defect in the transfer hearing conducted in the juvenile court. <em>Cf. Burfoot v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va. App. 38, 51, 473 S.E.2d 724, 731 (1996). Thus, Code \u00a7 16.1-269.6(E) does not operate to cure or waive the initial defect in the juvenile court proceedings where, as here, the juvenile court fails to give the parental notice of the initiation of juvenile court proceedings as statutorily mandated.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">In short, the juvenile court in Moore\u2019s case never acquired the authority to exercise its jurisdiction to conduct the transfer hearing that resulted in the transfer of Moore\u2019s case to the circuit court. Accordingly, the circuit court never acquired the authority to exercise its jurisdiction to try Moore for the criminal offenses charged in the indictments, and Moore\u2019s convictions in the circuit court are void. This result is consistent with our holdings in <em>French </em>and <em>Baker II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">For these reasons, we will reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case with directions that the case be remanded to the trial court for a new trial if the Commonwealth be so advised. Since Moore has now reached his majority and cannot be retried as a juvenile, if the Commonwealth elects to retry him, Moore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>should be tried on new indictments. <em>French, </em>207 Va. at 80, 147 S.E.2d at 743-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b456-12\"> Within this opinion, we will refer to the decision of the Court of Appeals as <em>\u201cBaker I\u201d </em>and our <em>per curiam </em>affirmance of that decision as <em>\u201cBaker II.\u201d</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b457-8\"> The social history report also recited that Moore\u2019s mother \u201cdated\u201d Moore\u2019s father for three months and that she terminated the relationship because he denied that he was the father of her expected child after she became pregnant. The record also reflects that on May 10, 1996, Moore\u2019s counsel made an oral motion in the circuit court that Moore be permitted to attend the funeral of his father, \u201cVernon Butts,\u201d scheduled for the next day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b458-7\"> At the time Baker was transferred to the circuit court in 1996, Code \u00a7 16.1-269.1 was the applicable transfer statute.

Acquisition of this jurisdiction involves one continuous process and results from the interplay of many statutes not codified within Article 7, including the Article 5 notice provisions of former Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-263 and -264. In other words, a circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction is acquired not only by the transfer proceeding mentioned in Article 7 but also by the initiation requirements mentioned in Article 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-12\">Therefore, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b463-13\">JUSTICE KINSER,</author>\n<p id=\"A6ce\">with whom JUSTICE LACY joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-14\">Because I believe that David Allen Moore has defaulted the alleged error under Rules 5:17(c) and 5:25, I would affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-15\">Before discussing my reasons for this conclusion, it is important to note, as does the majority, that the instant case comes to us in an entirely different procedural posture than did the case of <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 1, 516 S.E.2d 219 (1999) (per curiam). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Although Moore alleges the same error as the one addressed in <em>Baker, </em>namely the failure to give notice of the initiation of juvenile proceedings to the juvenile\u2019s father in accordance with former Code \u00a7 16.1-263 (1994)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and present Code \u00a7 16.1-264 (1994),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moore failed to raise an objection with regard to the issue either before the juvenile and domestic relations district court (juvenile court) or the circuit court. To the contrary, the juvenile court judge stated in her notes, which are part of the record in this appeal, that neither party presented any question regarding the sufficiency of the notice required under former Code \u00a7 16.1-263 and present Code \u00a7 16.1-264. The juvenile court then found that notice as prescribed in those statutes had been given. Likewise, Moore did not assign error to this alleged defect in his petition for appeal to the Court of Appeals. Instead, he raised the question whether the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to try him as an adult because the juvenile court did not comply with the notice provisions of former Code \u00a7 16.1-263 and present Code \u00a7 16.1-264 for the first time before this Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">In contrast to Moore, the defendant in <em>Baker </em>preserved his objection to the error by filing a motion to dismiss before he was indicted. Baker also timely raised the issue on appeal. Thus, we did not have to determine in <em>Baker </em>whether the error was one that deprived the juvenile court of its subject matter jurisdiction and thus could be raised at any time.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Consequently, this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Baker </em>is not dispositive of the present question whether Moore has defaulted the alleged error.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">In analyzing this question, I begin with a series of this Court\u2019s decisions in which we permitted defendants, in the context of habeas corpus proceedings, to collaterally attack their prior convictions because certain mandatory procedures were not followed in their juvenile court proceedings. In <em>Peyton </em>v. <em>French, </em>207 Va. 73, 147 S.E.2d 739 (1966), the juvenile court \u201ccertified\u201d felony charges against the juvenile to the circuit court so the juvenile could be tried as an adult, but the juvenile court did so without notice to the juve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>nile or his parents, without the presence of even one of his parents, without the appointment of a guardian ad litem for the juvenile, and without a hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 75, 147 S.E.2d at 740. At that time, former Code \u00a7 16.1-172 (1960) provided that \u201c[i]n no case shall the hearing proceed until the parent or parents of the child, if residing within the State, . . . have been notified of such.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If none of the persons required to be notified of the hearing were present in court at the time of the hearing, former Code \u00a7 16.1-173 (1960) required the juvenile court to appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the interests of the juvenile. That appointment had to occur before the hearing could proceed, and the guardian ad litem had to be present at the hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 76, 147 S.E.2d at 741. This Court said the complete failure to comply with the statutory requirements was a violation of due process and concluded that compliance with those provisions was necessary \u201cbefore criminal jurisdiction in a proper court of record comes into being.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79, 147 S.E.2d at 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">In <em>Gregory v. Peyton, </em>208 Va. 157, 156 S.E.2d 624 (1967), we again confronted the failure to appoint a guardian ad litem for the juvenile when neither of his parents was present at the hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 158, 156 S.E.2d 624. There, we reaffirmed our holding in <em>French </em>that the failure \u201cto comply with the applicable provisions of the [jjuvenile . . . [l]aw rendered the subsequent proceeding in the criminal court void.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 159-60, 156 S.E.2d at 625. This Court addressed the same issue in <em>Gogley v. Peyton, </em>208 Va. 679, 160 S.E.2d 746 (1968), where we applied our decision in <em>French </em>retrospectively so as to void the juvenile\u2019s convictions. 208 Va. at 680, 160 S.E.2d at 747. Again, in <em>Pruitt </em>v. <em>Peyton, </em>209 Va. 532, 165 S.E.2d 288 (1969), we held that the failure to appoint a guardian ad litem for a juvenile after neither of his parents appeared at his juvenile court hearing was \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d and consequently rendered the juvenile\u2019s convictions void. <em>Id. </em>at 535, 165 S.E.2d at 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">While the errors in the above cases were raised by the respective defendants in petitions for writs of habeas corpus, in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 425, 192 S.E.2d 775 (1972), which was a direct appeal of the defendant\u2019s conviction as a recidivist, we also permitted Jones to collaterally attack his underlying juvenile conviction. We did so because the official records of the juvenile court were silent as to whether either of Jones\u2019 parents had been notified of his juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>court proceeding, whether either was present at the hearing, and whether a guardian ad litem had been appointed to represent him at the juvenile court proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 427, 192 S.E.2d at <em>777. </em>Again relying on our decision in <em>French, </em>we held that the failure to give notice to Jones\u2019 parents and to appoint a guardian ad litem in the absence of a parent deprived the trial court of jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 428, 192 S.E.2d at <em>777.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">However, this Court has not always held that the failure to comply with mandatory provisions regarding juvenile proceedings deprived the juvenile court of its jurisdiction. For example, in <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 666, 222 S.E.2d 517 (1976), we decided that a mandatory requirement that \u201c[njotice in writing of the time, place and purpose of [a transfer] hearing\u201d be provided \u201cto the child and his parents ... or attorney\u201d was not jurisdictional. <em>Id. </em>at 667, 222 S.E.2d at 518. In that case, the juvenile, his father, and his attorney all received oral notice of the hearing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 668, 222 S.E.2d at 519. We concluded that the juvenile court\u2019s failure to comply with the requirement of written notice was \u201ca mere procedural defect,\u201d which could not be challenged as error if not timely raised. <em>Id. </em>at 669-70, 222 S.E.2d at 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">More recently, this Court decided <em>Jackson v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 625, 499 S.E.2d 538 (1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1067 (1999). There, in the context of determining whether certain transfer proceedings were conducted appropriately, we held that statutory language providing that \u201c[t]he circuit court <em>shall, </em>within a reasonable time after receipt of the case from the juvenile court (i) examine all . . . papers, reports and orders . . .,\u201d established a \u201cjurisdictional\u201d requirement that such a transfer review take place, but merely a \u201cprocedural\u201d rule for the time of review. <em>Id. </em>at 642-43, 499 S.E.2d at 549. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Upon reviewing the decisions in <em>French </em>and its progeny, it becomes evident that this Court addressed \u201cjurisdictional\u201d defects in those cases. However, we never clearly specified that we were considering subject matter jurisdictional defects. Nevertheless, the question of the juvenile court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction was implicated because we allowed the defendants in <em>French, Gregory, Gogley, Pruitt, </em>and <em>Jones </em>to collaterally attack their juvenile convictions. In those decisions, this Court recognized that the statutes at issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>imposed mandatory requirements regarding juvenile proceedings and that those requirements were coupled with limiting language that prohibited the court from going forward with a hearing until the requirements were fulfilled. Therefore, the Court held that compliance with those mandatory requirements was a prerequisite for the juvenile court\u2019s exercise of its subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">I believe that there were two provisions in effect when the juvenile proceedings at issue in <em>French </em>and its progeny were conducted that rendered the defects in those cases \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d The first one was the requirement that <em>\u201c[i]n no case shall the hearing proceed </em>until the parent or parents of the child . . . have been notified . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Former Code \u00a7 16.1-172 (I960).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Emphasis added). The second provision was former Code \u00a7 16.1-173 (1960), requiring that when no person required to be notified under former Code \u00a7 16.1-172 (1960) was present in court for the hearing, the <em>\u201ccourt shall, before proceeding with the hearing, </em>appoint a . . . guardian ad litem to represent the interests of the child.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Emphasis added).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">In 1973, after this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>French </em>and its progeny, and before the commission of the crimes at issue in <em>Turner, </em>the General Assembly enacted former Code \u00a7 16.1-176.2 (1973), now Code \u00a7 16.1-270 (1999). That section allows a juvenile, prior to a transfer hearing and with the consent of counsel, to waive the jurisdiction of the juvenile court and have the case transferred to the appropriate circuit court. That waiver provision played a role in this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Turner, </em>where we held that the requirement of \u201cwritten\u201d notice was merely procedural. 216 Va. at 669, 222 S.E.2d at 520. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>deciding whether Moore can now challenge his convictions because of the alleged failure to summons his father after the petition was filed against Moore, I also find that waiver provision significant because it allows a juvenile, with the consent of his attorney, to forego virtually all the safeguards afforded to the juvenile before a case is transferred to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Even more compelling is the fact that in 1977, the General Assembly repealed and reorganized the Code provisions pertaining to juveniles, and in doing so, deleted the requirement that \u201c[i]n no case shall the hearing proceed\u201d unless the juvenile\u2019s parent or parents are notified. Former Code \u00a7 16.1-172 (I960).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Similarly, in 1968, the General Assembly amended former Code \u00a7 16.1-173 (1960), removing the requirement that the \u201ccourt shall, before proceeding with the hearing,\u201d appoint a guardian ad litem when no person required to be summonsed is present at the hearing.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, the statutory provisions at issue in the present case no longer contained limiting language, such as that found in former Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-172 and -173 (1960), that specifically prohibited the juvenile court from proceeding in the absence of notice to both parents. <em>Cf. Jamborsky v. Baskins, </em>247 Va. 506, 511 n.*, 442 S.E.2d 636, 639 n.* (1994) (giving example of limiting prohibitory language). Instead, former Code \u00a7 16.1-263 and present Code \u00a7 16.1-264 merely required that a summons be issued to the juvenile\u2019s parents after the filing of a petition against the juvenile. Furthermore, a juvenile like Moore can waive the jurisdiction of the juvenile court and virtually all its attendant safeguards.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">I believe that the majority incorrectly equates statutory provisions that are \u201cmandatory\u201d with those that are prerequisites to a juvenile court\u2019s exercise of its subject matter jurisdiction. See, e.g., the majority\u2019s quotation in the present case from <em>Dennis Moore </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>259 Va. 405, 527 S.E.2d 415 (2000) (this day decided). As already noted, the error in <em>Turner </em>was \u201ca mere procedural defect,\u201d 216 Va. at 669, 222 S.E.2d at 520, although the notice requirement at issue there used the mandatory term \u201cshall.\u201d Former Code \u00a7 16.1-176(a)(3) (1974). The mandatory nature of a requirement, standing alone, does not always make that requirement jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>The majority concludes that the notice provision at issue in this case is mandatory, and in its view, therefore jurisdictional, because of \u201cthis Court\u2019s unswerving adherence to the nature of\u201d the parental notice requirement with regard to juvenile proceedings. However, in doing so, the majority ignores the statutory changes, discussed above, deleting the language that prohibited the juvenile court from proceeding with a hearing until certain requirements were fulfilled. Furthermore, this Court has not, in the context of a collateral attack on a juvenile conviction, addressed the parental notice requirement at issue today since the 1977 amendments, much less \u201cunswerving[ly] adhere[d]\u201d to a conclusion that the present requirement is jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">Since the juvenile court is a creature of statute, the General Assembly can modify any prerequisites for the juvenile court\u2019s exercise of its subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Burke v. </em>Commonwealth, 29 Va. App. 183, 188, 510 S.E.2d 743, 746 (1999) (holding that when subject matter jurisdiction is statutorily created, General Assembly can alter rules governing judicial exercise of that jurisdiction). Thus, I conclude that what was deemed a \u201cjurisdictional\u201d defect in the <em>French </em>case and its progeny is no longer such because of the intervening changes in the language of the relevant statutory provisions.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, Moore cannot now raise the failure to summons his father as a basis for voiding his convictions. <em>See Humphreys </em>v. Commonwealth, 186 Va. 765, 772, 43 S.E.2d 890, 894 (1947) (court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived); <em>Morrison v. Bestler, </em>239 Va. 166, 169, 387 S.E.2d 753, 755 (1990) (only type of jurisdiction which cannot be waived is subject matter jurisdiction). Accordingly, under Rules 5:17(c) and 5:25, Moore has defaulted his objection to the alleged error.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">For these reasons, I respectfully dissent and would affirm Moore\u2019s convictions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-7\"> This section was amended by the General Assembly in <em>1999 </em>to require the summons of only one of a juvenile\u2019s parents, while the former section required notice to both parents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b464-8\"> Code \u00a7 16.1-264 remains the same as it was in 1994.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b464-9\"> Moore has not asked that his failure to object to the lack of notice be considered under the \u201cends of justice\u201d exception to the requirements of Rule 5:25.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b464-10\"> A court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is the only type of jurisdiction that cannot be waived. <em>Morrison v.
