Because we conclude that the employee suffered an \u201cinjury by accident arising out of and in the course of . . . employment,\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-101, we will affirm the circuit court\u2019s judgment sustaining the employer\u2019s special plea in bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Virginia Electric and Power Company (Virginia Power) arranged for an independent instructor to teach an aerobics class at its Richmond office for the benefit of its employees. Participation in the class by Virginia Power\u2019s employees was voluntary. Virginia Power advertised the class on its bulletin boards and in its newsletter. It did not charge for the use of its facility, but participating employees were required to pay a fee to the instructor for the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">The plaintiff, Laura Lee Combs, was an employee of Virginia Power. During her lunch hour on May 24, 1994, Combs participated in the aerobics class and, while doing so, developed a severe headache. The aerobics instructor assisted Combs in lying down and then called Virginia Power\u2019s Employee Health Services (EHS), as she had been instructed to do by the EHS coordinator of health programs. The EHS receptionist answered the call and informed Sharon Robinson, EHS coordinator of administrative support, that someone in the aerobics class had a headache and needed some medication. Shortly thereafter, Robinson went to the aerobics room to determine what was happening with regard to Combs. When Combs\u2019 head pain did not subside, she was taken to the EHS \u201cquiet room\u201d to rest. The \u201cquiet room\u201d is used by employees who become ill at work, or by recuperating employees who have returned to work after an accident or illness and need to rest during the workday. When an employee is using the room, an EHS staff member is required to be in the office, and the employee is to be checked at regular intervals.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">After she went to the \u201cquiet room,\u201d Combs was not examined by any medical or emergency personnel, nor was her condition regularly monitored by anyone. Approximately two hours after Combs entered the \u201cquiet room,\u201d Robinson checked on Combs and discovered that Combs had vomited on herself and was in a coma-like state. Robinson then called security. Combs was eventually transported by ambulance to the Medical College of Virginia where she was diagnosed with intracranial bleeding, a right giant middle cerebral aneurysm, and an intraparenchymal hemorrhage. She subsequently underwent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>two neurological operations. After release from the hospital, she entered a rehabilitation center where she received therapy for her partial paralysis and cognitive brain damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">On April 30, 1996, Combs filed a motion for judgment against Virginia Power and four of its employees, alleging that the defendants owed her a duty to \u201chave in place proper procedures, and to properly train . . . personnel, so that employees using EHS could do so without harm to themselves and detriment to their well-being.\u201d Combs further asserted that the defendants breached these duties and were negligent by, <em>inter alia, </em>failing to properly train non-medical personnel working in EHS; failing to implement procedures to provide appropriate medical care to Virginia Power employees who seek treatment at EHS, especially when licensed healthcare professionals are unavailable; and failing to provide proper medical care and treatment when Combs suffered a medical emergency, thereby leaving her unattended for approximately two hours before calling security and a rescue squad. Finally, Combs alleged that the defendants\u2019 negligence proximately caused her injury and damages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">In response, the defendants filed grounds of defense and a \u201cSpecial Plea of Workers\u2019 Compensation Bar.\u201d In the special plea, they asserted that the exclusivity provision of the Act, Code \u00a7 65.2-307, barred Combs\u2019 claim and therefore deprived the circuit court of subject matter jurisdiction over her claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, the defendants asked the court to dismiss Combs\u2019 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">After reviewing the parties\u2019 memoranda, the circuit court sustained the special plea and dismissed Combs\u2019 action with prejudice. In a letter opinion, the court concluded that the aggravation and acceleration of Combs\u2019 pre-existing aneurysm was \u201can injury by accident arising out of and in the course of her employment with\u201d Virginia Power, and that her action was therefore barred by the exclusivity provision of the Act. We awarded Combs this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">\u201cAn injury is subject to the exclusivity provision of the Act if it is the result of an accident and arises out of and in the course of the employment.\u201d <em>Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Hazelwood, </em>249 Va. 369, 372, 457 S.E.2d 56, 58 (1995). Thus, the critical inquiry in this appeal is whether Combs\u2019 injury was (1) an injury by accident, (2) arising out of, (3) and in the course of, her employment. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-101; <em>Briley </em>v. <em>Farm Fresh, Inc., </em>240 Va. 194, 197, 396 S.E.2d 835, 836 (1990). If any one of these elements is missing, then Combs\u2019 claim is not covered by the Act, <em>Snead </em>v. <em>Harbaugh, </em>241 Va. 524, 526, 404 S.E.2d 53, 54 (1991), and she can proceed with her personal injury claim in the circuit court. Thus, we will address each of these criteria <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">I. INJURY BY ACCIDENT</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">This Court recently addressed the requirements of an \u201cinjury by accident\u201d in <em>Southern Express v. Green, </em>257 Va. 181, 509 S.E.2d 836 (1999). There, we held that an \u201cinjury by accident\u201d occurs when the injury appears \u201csuddenly at a particular time and place[,] and upon a particular occasion[;]\u201d when it is \u201ccaused by an identifiable incident [,]or sudden precipitating event[;]\u201d and when the injury results \u201cin an obvious mechanical or structural change in the human body.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 187, 509 S.E.2d at 839. The circuit court found all these factors present with regard to Combs\u2019 injury, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">At the outset, it must be emphasized that Combs\u2019 injury is not the aneurysm itself. Instead, her injury is the aggravation, exacerbation, and/or acceleration of the aneurysm. That injury resulted from the alleged negligent emergency medical care, or lack thereof, that she received from Virginia Power and its EHS employees after she suffered a severe headache during the aerobics class. Thus, Combs\u2019 argument that there is no evidence with regard to when the aneurysm initially started leaking or when she experienced the first onset of symptoms is irrelevant to the question whether she sustained an \u201cinjury by accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">The record in this case, in particular Combs\u2019 motion for judgment, demonstrates that she suffered an \u201cinjury by accident\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-101. The particular time, place, and occasion of her injury was at the EHS \u201cquiet room\u201d in Virginia Power\u2019s Richmond office, during the two to three hours that elapsed from when she first developed the headache and was taken to the \u201cquiet room\u201d until she was transported to the hospital. The identifiable or precipi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>tating event was the alleged negligent emergency medical treatment that she received during this span of time. Finally, Combs\u2019 paralysis and cognitive brain damage represent the mechanical or structural changes in her body that resulted from her injury. Thus, all the requirements of an \u201cinjury by accident\u201d are present in this case. <em>See Winn v. Geo. A. Hormel &amp; Co., </em>560 N.W.2d 143, 149 (Neb. 1997)(holding that negligent medical treatment at employer\u2019s first-aid medical facility may constitute \u201caccident\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">H. ARISING OUT OF EMPLOYMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The phrase \u201carising out of\u201d pertains to the origin or cause of an injury. <em>County of Chesterfield </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>237 Va. 180, 183, 376 S.E.2d 73, 74 (1989); <em>Bradshaw v. Aronovitch, </em>170 Va. 329, 335, 196 S.E. 684, 686 (1938). In determining whether an injury arises out of employment, we have repeatedly quoted with approval the test enunciated in <em>In re Employers\u2019 Liab. Assur. Corp., Ltd., </em>102 N.E. 697 (Mass. 1913). An injury</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">arises \u201cout of\u201d the employment, when there is apparent to the rational mind upon consideration of all the circumstances, a causal connection between the conditions under which the work is required to be performed and the resulting injury. Under this test, if the injury can be seen to have followed as a natural incident of the work and to have been contemplated by a reasonable person familiar with the whole situation as a result of the exposure occasioned by the nature of the employment, then it arises \u201cout of\u201d the employment. But it excludes an injury which cannot fairly be traced to the employment as a contributing proximate cause and which comes from a hazard to which the workmen would have been equally exposed apart from the employment. The causative danger must be peculiar to the work and not common to the neighborhood. It must be incidental to the character of the business and not independent of the relation of master and servant. It need not have been foreseen or expected, but after the event it must appear to have had its origin in a risk connected with the employment, and to have flowed from that source as a rational consequence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 697; <em>accord Lucas </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>212 Va. 561, 563, 186 S.E.2d 63, 64 (1972); <em>Conner v. Bragg, </em>203 Va. 204, 208-09, 123 S.E.2d 393, 396-97 (1962); <em>Bradshaw, </em>170 Va. at 335, 196 S.E. at 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>In Virginia, we apply an \u201cactual risk test,\u201d meaning that the employment must expose the employee to the particular danger causing the injury, notwithstanding the public\u2019s exposure generally to similar risks. <em>Lucas, </em>212 Va. at 563, 186 S.E.2d at 64. Thus, if diere is a causal connection between Combs\u2019 injury and the conditions of her employment, then her injury arose out of her employment. <em>See United Parcel Serv. of Am. v. Fetterman, </em>230 Va. 257, 258, 336 S.E.2d 892, 893 (1985) (\u201cAn accident arises out of the employment when there is a causal connection between the claimant\u2019s injury and the conditions under which the employer requires the work to be performed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Combs argues that EHS was not actually a clinic for the treatment of employee health problems and that, therefore, it was not a condition of her employment. Thus, she contends that her injury did not \u201carise out of\u201d her employment. Assuming that Combs is correct about the purpose of EHS, the fact remains that on the day in question, the risk of employment was the alleged negligent emergency medical treatment by EHS personnel, which aggravated her preexisting aneurysm. Combs was exposed to this risk or condition of employment solely because she was a Virginia Power employee. The public generally would not have been exposed to the same risk because only Virginia Power employees could utilize EHS. In fact, Combs alleged in her motion for judgment that Virginia Power and its employees owed certain duties to her \u201cso that employees using EHS could do so without harm to themselves and detriment to their well-being,\u201d and that the defendants violated those duties, thereby causing injury to her. She further asserted that the employee defendants were acting within the scope of their employment when they allegedly injured her.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Combs, nevertheless, argues that her situation is like that of the employee in <em>Taylor v. Mobil Corp., </em>248 Va. 101, 444 S.E.2d 705 (1994), because she did not involuntarily, or out of \u201cdefault[j\u201d as the circuit court found, seek medical treatment at EHS. In <em>Taylor, </em>an employee visited a doctor at his employer\u2019s clinic for treatment of a heart condition. The employee ultimately suffered a fatal heart attack at home although the doctor had advised him that he was not suffering from heart disease. <em>Id. </em>at 103-04, 444 S.E.2d at 706-07. This Court concluded that the employee\u2019s risk of exposure to negligent treatment by the doctor was not an actual risk of employment because the employee voluntarily opted to use the doctor at the employer\u2019s clinic. He was not required to do so by his employer, nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>was he treated by that doctor because he became ill at work. <em>Id. </em>at 107, 444 S.E.2d at 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">In contrast, Combs suffered her severe headache while participating in the aerobics class at Virginia Power\u2019s office. While taking part in that class was not required by Virginia Power, EHS personnel treated Combs because of her status as a Virginia Power employee. In fact, the aerobics instructor called EHS when Combs became ill because Virginia Power\u2019s EHS coordinator had directed the instructor to do so. Thus, the risk that led to Combs\u2019 injury was part of her work environment. <em>See Briley, </em>240 Va. at 198, 396 S.E.2d at 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Additionally, the fact that her injury was the aggravation of a pre-existing condition does not alter the result that her injury arose out of her employment. <em>See Ohio Valley Const. Co. v. Jackson, </em>230 Va. 56, 58, 334 S.E.2d 554, 555 (1985) (\u201cWhen an injury sustained in an industrial accident accelerates or aggravates a pre-existing condition, death or disability resulting therefrom is compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d). Combs\u2019 pre-existing aneurysm united with an actual risk of her employment to produce her injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Iff. IN THE COURSE OF EMPLOYMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">\u201cThe phrase arising \u2018in the course of\u2019 [employment] refers to the time, place, and circumstances under which the accident occurred.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>237 Va. at 183, 376 S.E.2d at 74. \u201cAn accident occurs \u2018in the course of the employment\u2019 when it takes place within the period of the employment, at a place where the employee may reasonably be, and while he is reasonably fulfilling duties of his employment or engaged in doing something incidental thereto.\u201d <em>Bradshaw, </em>170 Va. at 335, 196 S.E. at 686; <em>accord Lucas, </em>212 Va. at 563, 186 S.E.2d at 64; <em>Conner, </em>203 Va. at 208, 123 S.E.2d at 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Combs argues she was not performing any duty of her employment at the moment when she initially needed emergency medical treatment. As she correctly notes, the pre-existing aneurysm was not caused by her employment, and she was participating in an aerobics class during her lunch hour when she first experienced the headache. Thus, she contends that \u201cthe reason she ended up at EHS was not in any way connected with her employment[,]\u201d and, therefore, that her injury did not occur during the course of her employment. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">Combs\u2019 position on this issue overlooks several salient facts. First, Combs is not seeking redress for the onset of the symp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>toms associated with the aneurysm but for the aggravation of that pre-existing condition. The aggravation of the aneurysm occurred after EHS personnel responded to the call for assistance from the aerobics instructor, during Combs\u2019 period of employment, and at a place where she could reasonably be if she became ill at work, i.e., the \u201cquiet room.\u201d The only reason that EHS responded to that call was because Combs was a Virginia Power employee. Thus, Combs \u201cwas injured at a place where she was reasonably expected to be while engaged in an activity reasonably incidental to her employment\u201d by Virginia Power. <em>Briley, </em>240 Va. at 198, 396 S.E.2d at 837. Her injury therefore occurred \u201cin the course of\u201d her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">For these reasons, we conclude that Combs\u2019 injury was an \u201cinjury by accident arising out of and in the course of [her] employment\u201d with Virginia Power, Code \u00a7 65.2-101, and is therefore compensable under the Act. Her action in the circuit court is thus barred by Code \u00a7 65.2-307. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b529-8\"> Combs also filed a claim with the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission on May 23, 1996.
