At the date of the will and at the time of the death of Dr. Blackwell, his grand-daughter, the leg\u00e1tee, was the. wife of Mr. Willing Francis. The trust for her separate use was effectual and operative from the time of the testator\u2019s death, until at least, the death of Mr. Francis. Whether a trust for the separate use of a married woman continues if she becomes discovert, and revives on a second marriage, is an interesting question, which does not appear to have been decided in this country. In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Starr, </em>(3 <em>Wharton Rep. </em>62,) it was held, that a restraint upon alienation, inconsistent with the general character of the estate, ceased on the death of the husband. Judge Rogers, who delivered the judgment of the Court, declined expressing any opinion on the question, whether the restrictions of a separate estate revived on a second marriage. In England the question has been substantially decided. <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>(6 <em>Simons, </em>121; S. C. 9 <em>Eng. Ch. Rep. </em>199.) <em>Benson </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>(6 <em>Simons, 126; S. </em>C. 9 <em>Eng. Ch. Rep. </em>201.) <em>Hayes on Conveyancing, </em>83, <em>note. Atherley on Settlements, </em>333. <em>2d Thomas Co. Litt. </em>689, <em>note. </em>1 <em>Roper on Husband and Wife, </em>201. The object of this suit is to procure this fund for the trustee of the wife, to whom it is specially bequeathed, without liability to the creditors of the husband, who never has been in any way connected with it. [Gibson, C. <em>J. </em>\u2014 Siter\u2019s <em>case, </em>(4 <em>Rawle, </em>468,) seems to show that .the assignment was not such a reduction into possession as to make the wife\u2019s property liable to her husband\u2019s creditors.]</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b127-11\">. Mr. <em>James S. Smith, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-12\">The defendants in this case are merely stakeholders,, having no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>interest whatever in the decision of the question; they desire that decision to justify them as executors. Dr. Blackwell was assignee of Willing Francis, under an assignment for the benefit of creditors. Pie knew, therefore, that the husband of the legatee was insolvent. The present husband is also insolvent. The question, whether a trust ceases on the discoverture of a woman and revives on a second marriage, appears to remain unsettled yet, even in England. The recent decisions in England appear not to have been satisfactory to the profession there. <em>Hayes on Conveyancing, 83, note. </em>2 <em>Kent\u2019s Com. </em>(last ed.) 165, <em>note. </em>The doctrine in this st\u00e1te respecting separate estates of married women differs essentially from that of England. <em>Lancaster </em>v. <em>Dolan, </em>(1 <em>Rawle, </em>247.) This was a continuing trust. Considerable sums of money were to be' collected from the sale of lands, which yet remain unsold. The trust arises when moneys are received, and it is for the sole and separate use of his grand-daughter without reference to her husband.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b128-7\">Gibson, J. C.</author>\n<p id=\"AHR\">\u2014 The point in contest was virtually decided in <em>Massey </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>(2 <em>Mylne &amp; Keene, </em>174,) when it was settled that a restriction attempted by a gift to the separate use of an unmarried woman, is an impracticable one; and that it has no force to prevent her from giving the property to a husband by the act of marriage, or disposing of it in the interim. The principle has its root in <em>Brandon </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>(18 <em>Ves. </em>492,) where it was held, that though property may be so limited as to cease or go over on the happening of a contingency; yet that while it remains in the donee, it is so far subject to the legal incidents of ownership as to be unsusceptible of a restriction which would exempt it from liability to his creditors. Perhaps it is not easy to discern the policy of a rule which disables a benefactor from making a determinate provision for his beneficiary, which cannot be squandered or reft from him; yet the law seems to be thus settled, not only by the cases cited, but by <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>(4 <em>Simons, </em>141,) and <em>Woodmeston </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>(2 <em>Russ. &amp; Mylne, </em>197,) in which the principle was applied to an unmarried woman. An apparent exception to it, is a gift to the separate use of a woman in contemplation of her marriage with a particular person; which, by force of the agreement implied by his assent, constitutes a future separate use during the particular coverture, but which is in reality no exception at all. <em>Brandon </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>was the case of a gift to a male; but its principle was soon found to be equally as operative in the case of a female; and the English chancellors gave it as much scope as they could, even in cases of an admitted separate use, by allowing to a wife the dominion of a <em>feme sole </em>wherever her power over the gift was not restrained by the terms of the trust, \u2014 a principle we rejected in <em>Lancaster </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number><em>Dolan, </em>and with what reason, is seen .in their restless and feverish course in respect to it. . In that class of cases, however, there is, as I have said, an admitted separate use in the first instance ; and the question has regard to a limitation of power which the donor is unquestionably competent to impose. In this, it is whether he is competent to engraft on an absolute gift, not by way of cesser or donation over, a present disability to transfer the dominion over it by marriage, \u2014 in other words, whether he can annex a repugnant qualification to a gift, which is to be enjoyed, at least for a period, in full property; and to sustain the affirmative of it, would in effect impose, by anticipation, one of the disabilities' of coverture on an unmarried woman, and, according to the British principle, free her from it the moment she married; which would turn the law upside down. Admitting the soundness of the. principle that there cannot be a restraint which is repugnant to the gift, it is impossible to doubt the correctness of the decision in' <em>Massey </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>which is in accordance with it. Now the difference betwixt that case and the present, is that here the feme was married at the time of the gift, and there she was not.'; but the effect of it is only, that she had in our case an unquestionable separate use during the first coverture. This separate use and the coverture, however, expired together, as we determined in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Starr </em>; and she became the owner without regard to the previous qualification. That being so, the limitation of a further use, would be as repugnant to the nature .of the gift as if she had not been married; and that the previous qualification was not revived'by the second marriage, is a dorollary of all the cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Judgment for the plaintiffs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
