At the time of the levy the horse was in possession of James Massey, and had been so for some weeks, but Massey informed the constable at once that the horse belonged to Hollman. The horse was afterwards sold under the execution, notice being given at the sale that it belonged to Hollman. Much evidence was then given for the purpose of showing that the horse had been purchased by Massey in a <em>trade </em>with one Rimes about two weeks before the levy: that the consideration given for said horse was a mare, the property of Hollman, which he had authorised Massey to <em>trade </em>for the horse in question: that after the bargain the horse continued in possession of Massey up to the time of the levy; Holman having agreed that Massey should continue to keep the horse for his use; and that Massey always recognised the right of property of the horse in Hollman. Among other testimony offered for this purpose, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel offered to prove by Samuel Hollman, that before the levy the plaintiff threatened to take the horse away from James <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Massey, unless he used him better. To this the defendant\u2019s counsel objected, and took exceptions to the opinion of the Court overruling his objection. Whereupon Samuel Hollman testified as follows:\u2014 \u25a0\u201c It was considerably before the <em>levy; </em>it was in the road between the blacksmith\u2019s shop and our house. Frederic (namely Frederick ' Hollman) and-1 were coming down the road, and Massey was going up. He observed that the horse looked thin. He (Frederick) told him \u25a0 (Massey) that if he did not take better care of the horse, he would take him home. He allowed that he had been fox-hunting him too hard.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-6\">A verdict was found for the plaintiff, and a writ of error taken by the defendant, who assigned for error the admissipn of the testimony of Samuel Hollman.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b46-7\">Mr. <em>W. L. Hirst </em>for the plaintiff in error.,</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b46-8\">Mr. <em>Dillingham, </em>for the defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Al\">having cited <em>Babb </em>v. <em>Clemson, </em>(10 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle, </em>427,) was stopped by the Court.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b46-9\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AU8\">\u2014 The defendant founded his justification on the possession of Massey, the debtor, as evidence of property. In this respect there can be no difference between the possession of a chattel and the possession of land, which has always been open to explanation by declarations of the party connected with an act of apparent ownership. At a period considerably anterior to the levy, the -plaintiff, for a supposed abuse of what he claimed to be his property, had declared to Massey, then on the horse\u2019s back, that he intended to deprive him of the possessionand Massey did not resist his right to do so. It is too clear for argument that this was a circumstance to go the jury.-</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
