In assumpsit the plaintiff declared for .lumber and other' materials furnished at the reguest of the!defendant, for a certain building (describing it 0 and averred in the usual terms the defendant\u2019s promise to pay. No claim had been filed. It appeared on the trial that the materials had been furnished more than six months before, but within ttvo years from the commencement of the action. The materials were charged in the plaintiff\u2019s books to the original owners of the lot, not to the defendant directly. There \u25a0was some evidence to show that the defendant appeared as owner, and gave orders for the lumber; The judge who tried the cause charged the jury, that it was not necessary to support the action that a claim should have been filed within the six months. <em>Held, </em>that though this was a mistake of the law, yet as the judge also charged upon a point made by the defendant, that it was a question of fact for the jury who was the'original debtor, and that the action ought to be brought against, the original debtor, there was no cause for reversing the judgment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-8\">2.

Several letters from the defendant to the plaintiffs, containing orders for lumber for the buildings, were also put in and proved. The book of original entries was then offered again by the plaintiffs, and admitted by the' Court, when an exception was taken on .the part of the defendant. It was admitted that the title to the lot of ground on which the factory was built, was conveyed to Henry J. Linn by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>indenture dated the 13th day of June, 1833, and executed by T. Cadwalader, H. Nixon and H. J. Williams.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-6\">The defendant produced a witness who proved that lumber was furnished by the firm of Love &amp; Pickering, for the six small three story houses in the rear of Linn\u2019s factory.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-7\">The defendant\u2019s counsel requested the judge to charge the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-8\">\u201c 1. That a lien must be filed before a personal action against any contractor can be maintained, so as to charge the building.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-9\">2. That the description in the narr. must correspond with the description of the property, upon the credit of which the lumber was furnished.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-10\">3. That the entries charging a factory, are not proof of lumber furnished to a factory and six stone houses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-11\">4. That the evidence of the books, showing the credit not to have been given to William Linn, he is not the <em>debtor, </em>and the action under the act of assembly <em>must </em>be against the original debtor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-12\">5. That the factory is not so described in the plaintiffs\u2019 books so as to charge any building.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-13\">6. That no lien can be created unless the charge is specifically against the building, and so entered at the time upon the books of the material man.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-14\">7. No action having been commenced within six months, a claim must be shown to have been filed to support the present action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-15\">8. No joint lien is valid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-16\">The learned judge charged the jury in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-17\">\u201c 1. That it is not necessary to have filed any lien to support a personal action against a contractor, \u201c so as to charge the building.\u201d The building is chargeable in this form of action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-18\">2. This point is right, \u201c The description in the narr. must correspond with the description of the property, upon the credit of which the lumber was furnished.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-19\">3. If the houses were so connected with the factory as to be parts of it, then entries charging the factory are \u201cproof of lumber furnished to\u201d the factory and the six small houses parts of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-20\">4. This action must be brought against the \u201c original debtor.\u201d It is a question of fact, whether Linn was the. original debtor. <em>The </em>entries in the book do not prevent the plaintiff from showing the truth. They may have been made in this form for the mere purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>of charging the building. It is for the jury to say whether Linn was not the original debtor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-6\">5. It is a question of fact, whether the lumber was delivered upon the credit of the houses. It is a question of fact whether the plaintiff intended by the word \u201c factory\u201d \u201c to charge any building\u201d and what buildings. The'word \u2018factory\u2019 is sufficiently descriptive, and the jury may find what property the plaintiff intended to charge by the use of the word \u2018 factory,\u2019 and what buildings constitute the factory.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-7\">6. The charge must be made specifically as stated in this point: the question is, if it has been so made, did the plaintiff by this entry mean to charge, not only the factory itself, but the houses in question <em>1 </em>There maybe a lien where there was no entry whatever made in a book at the time: the contract creates and constitutes the lien, the books are but evidence of the contract, and the question is whether he plaintiffs have proved by their books, a charge against the property in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-8\">7. This action may be supported, though no claim has been filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-9\">8. The question of joint lien does not arise in the case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-10\">The jury found for the plaintiffs on the first and second counts of the declaration; and the defendant took a writ of error, and filed the following specifications.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-11\">\u201c 1. The Court erred in admitting in evidence\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-12\">1. Entries in books of the defendants in error, which did not charge the plaintiff in error with the materials for the price of which this action was brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-13\">2. Entries which described no property whatever, to charge as a lien the property of H. J. Linn, an entire stranger to these proceedings, and whose name is not mentioned in the entries aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-14\">3. Entries describing property entirely different from that described and referred to in the narr.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-15\">2. The Court erred in charging the jury\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-16\">1. That it was not necessary to have filed any lien to support this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-17\">2. That it was a question of fact for them to decide, whether W. Linn was the original debtor, \u2014 the books showing the credit to have been given to other persons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-18\">3. That the jury might find that the credits were given to William Linn, although the books showed the contrary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-19\">4. That although there was no evidence to alter or contradict the entries in the defendants in error\u2019s books, the jury were to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>determine whether the lumber was originally furnished upon the credit of the buildings, or of the plaintiff in error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-6\">5. That if the houses were so connected with the factory as to be parts of it, these entries are proof of lumber furnished to the factory and six small houses, and the whole are subject to the lien created by the judgment in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-7\">6. That the word \u201c Factory,\u201d was sufficient to include six stone houses, (in addition to the cotton factory) though situated at a distance of upwards of 80 feet from the mill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-8\">7.

Naglee against William Linn, in which the plaintiffs declared in <em>indebitatus assumpsit, </em>for lumber and materials found and provided for the defendant <em>by the </em>plaintiffs, alleging in the first and second counts, that they were to be applied in and about, and were furnished on the credit of a factory and other buildings erected by the defendant, on a lot described. The fact appeared to be, that the defendant was not the owner of the lot or building, but was merely the contractor engaged by the owner to put up the buildings; and the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant had ordered the materials and used them for that purpose. No claim had been filed by the plaintiffs within the six months allowed by the act of assembly in relation to the liens of mechanics and others, but the suit was brought within the period of two years from the time of delivering the materials. Two questions seem to have been discussed in the Court below; and the answers of the Court in relation to them have been assigned as errors here. First, whether the plaintiffs could in this suit charge the buildings themselves;\u2014 secondly, whether the defendant was liable as debtor: and on both these points the Court below answered in favour of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-15\">It was settled by this Court in the case of <em>Klingler </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>(3 <em>Wharton\u2019s Rep. </em>332,) that according to the true construction of the act of 28th of March, 1808, and the prior acts, in no case whatever, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>(except where there is a judicial sale of the premises within the two years,) can the plaintiff have recourse to the buildings themselves for work done or materials found, by a <em>scire facias, </em>or by-a personal action against the contractor, not being the owner, unless the plaintiff has filed his claim within six nnonths from the time when the work was done or the materials foutnd. This is an indispensable prerequisite in every such case. It follows- therefore, that as.the . plaintiffs in the present case had not filed their claim within the six months, that part of the inquiry pursued in the Court below which related to the liability of the buildings for the present debt, was irrelevant to the case : and though the Court below erred in their answers to the questions propounded by the defendant on this head, yet according to the se'ttled law, an error in the trial of a part of the issue, which is altogeth\u00e9r immaterial, and which therefore can prejudice no one, will not be used as an instrument of reversal, when there is another and material averment in the declaration, which is sufficient to determine the merits of the cause. <em>Edgar </em>v. <em>Boies, </em>(11 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>451.) That other averment in the declaration was, that the articles had been furnished by the plaintiffs at the defendant\u2019s request, and that he promised to pay for them. On this point it is not denied, that the. Court charged correctly, namely, that this action must be brought against the original debtor, and that it was a question of fact whether the defendant was the, original debtor. We therefore think, the judgment ought not to be reversed for this mistake, more especially as it appears to have been wholly introduced into the cause by the plaintiff in error himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">A bill of exceptions was taken to the admission in evidence of the plaintiffs\u2019 book of original entries, in which the charges were made to William Linn, for factory, on account of Williams &amp; Nixon\u2014 to Williams &amp; Nixon, got by Linn \u2014 -Williams &amp; Nixon, got by W. Linn \u2014 Williams &amp; Nixon, got by Linn for factory \u2014 Williams &amp; Nixon.. It was not, however, till strong evidence had been given by the plaintiffs, tending to show that the defendant had ordered the lumber in question, that these books were admitted by the Court. When they were offered in the first instance, they were rejected,, as they showed no charge against the defendant. But after other evidence was given, tending to substantiate such a charge, then we think the books were admissible to show the amount and price of the articles alleged to be the same, which had been already proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
