He was a blind horse, valued by some of the witnesses at thirty or thirty-five dollars. At the time the train approached the turnpike, the plaintiff was crossing the rail-road with his wagon, and the engine struck it a little in front of the hub of the hind wheel. There was no dispute about the wagon having been struck by the locomotive, though the witnesses differed in opinion as to the practicability of seeing the wagon on the turnpike from the cars as it approached; some thought it might be seen by the person on the engine; others thought not until the train came within a short distance of the turnpike. There was a ridge or bank between the rail-road and turnpike which intercepted the view from one to the other. It was admitted that the engineer was in the employment of the company, that the cars and locomotive belonged to them, and were under the care and management of the engineer, on the day and at the time the accident occurred. There was some difference of opinion among the witnesses as to the speed of the engine when it struck the wagon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-6\">The witnesses on the part of the defendants deposed, that when the train arrived at Robinson\u2019s bridge, about two hundred yards from the crossing, the bell of the engine was rung, as was usual, to give persons travelling on the turnpike notice that the train was approaching the crossing. The steam was shut off the engine on account of the road being down grade. When the engine approached within about fifty yards of the turnpike, the wagon was seen going fast up to the crossing, and a witness stated that he was whipping his horses to get over ahead of the engine. The moment the engineer saw the wagon, he directed the breaks to be applied, reversed the engine, and let off the steam. The breaks were instantly applied to the cars and the tender. The engineer stated that he did every thing that could be done to avoid coming in collision with the wagon, that it was impossible for him to see it before he directed the breaks to be applied; and that persons on the turnpike can see a much greater distance on the rail-road when approaching it, than those on the rail-road can see on the turnpike. The speed of the engine at the time did not exceed eight or ten miles an hour. The collision was unavoidable. Such was the testimony of the conductor of the cars, engineer, firemen, and a witness who happened accidentally to be on the road at the time. The bell was rung agreeably to the instructions of the company, which directed that it should be rung at one hundred yards from the crossing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Upon this evidence the defendant\u2019s counsel requested the Court to charge the jury \u2014 \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-6\"><em>\u201c </em>1.

A corporation may by their servants, agents, or engineers, (and indeed in no other way,) commit a trespass, and an action of trespass will lie against them for forcible injuries against the lands, goods or person of another; and the evidence in this case, if accredited by the jury, is sufficient to sustain the action of trespass, <em>vi et armis.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-11\"><em>. </em>2d. and 3d. The action being properly for a trespass, <em>vi et armis, </em>the defendants are liable for damages arising from the immediate act of violence, whether it be the breaking of a wagon, injury to the horse, injury to the lading, or injury to the person of the plaintiff; and -this, whether the injury were committed wilfully or accidentally. It is the duty of the defendants so to use their own rights or property, as not to injure others ; and unless the plaintiff wantonly placed or continued himself or his property, in the way of destruction, he is entitled to damages, to be assessed by the jury, for the injury done to it, whether it be wilfully, carelessly or accidentally.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-12\">The jury found for the plaintiff; and the defendants having removed the record to this Court, filed the following specification of errors:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-13\"><em>\u201c </em>1.

The' evidence proved that the injury was entirely accidental, on the part of the conductor and engineer, and that every proper precaution was taken.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-7\">1. It is well settled that trespass will not lie against a' master for an injury done by his servant, unless where he is present and gives express directions. <em>Morley </em>v. <em>Gainsford (2 Hen. Blackst. </em>44.) <em>Day </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>(5 <em>Term Rep. </em>648.) <em>Savignac </em>v. <em>Roome, </em>(6 <em>Term Rep. 125.)

It was a good defence to show that the injury was the result of an unavoidable accident, happening in the course of a lawful business. The evidence was, that the company had caused notices to be placed on each side of the road cautioning travellers to look out for the engine, and had given direction to their engineer to ring their bell on approaching the cross road, which was proved to have been done in this case. The direction of the learned judge on this point was not sustained by the authorities. <em>Beckwith </em>v. <em>Shoreditch, </em>(4 <em>Burr. </em>2092.) <em>Bussy </em>v. <em>Donaldson, </em>(4 <em>Dall. </em>206.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b146-10\">Mr. <em>Tilghman, contra.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-11\">The question below was not one of wilfulness on the part of the engineer, but of gross carelessness. The plaintiff did not charge the directors with having ordered their servants to do the particular injury. If a corporation give general orders to do a certain thing in a particular way, and an injury happens immediately from it, trespass will lie against the corporation, as well as against any other master. Although the injury be accidental, yet if it be immediate, trespass lies. It is certainly not necessary to cite any authority to show that trespass <em>vi et armis </em>will lie against a corporation. [Curia. \u2014 Certainly not; but what you have to show is, that there is a difference between corporations and other masters in respect to liability for the acts of their servants.] The leading case on the subject of liability in trespass is <em>Soane </em>v. <em>Bray (3 East, </em>593,) where the action was held to lie. So in <em>Percival </em>v. <em>Hickey, (18 </em>Johns. 257.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b147-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Mr. <em>Edwards, </em>who was to reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AP\">was stopped by the Court.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b147-7\">Rogers, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ajq\">\u2014 If an injury be done by the act of the party at the time, or he be the immediate cause of the injury, though it happen accidentally, or by misfortune, he is answerable in trespass. . The distinction in this <em>form </em>of suit, has not turned either on the lawfulness of the act, from whence the injury happened, or on the design of the party doing it, to commit the injury; but on the difference between injuries direct and immediate, or mediate and consequential: in the one instance the remedy is by case; in the other, by trespass. <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Shephard, </em>(2 <em>Hen. Blackst. </em>895.) <em>Reynolds v</em>. <em>Clarke, </em>(2 <em>Lord Ray. </em>1402.) <em>Leame </em>v. <em>Bray, </em>(3 <em>East, </em>598.) Where the injury is done by the master himself, trespass will lie, whether the injury be accidental or wilful: and the law is the same when suit is brought against the servant himself, for an act done by him. A master is not liable, either in trespass or in case,' for the wilful act of his servant, .as by driving his master\u2019s carriage against another without his direction or assent. But he is liable to answer for any damage arising to another, from the negligence or unskilfulness of his servant acting in his employ. But in what form of action is he liable ? And the authorities are uniform, that case, and not .trespass, is the proper remedy. When a servant is in point of law a trespasser, the master is not chargeable as such; though liable to make compensation for the damage consequential from his employing an unskilful or negligent servant. The employment of the servant, it is true, is the act of the master, but from that no immediate prejudice arises to those who may suffer from his subsequent acts. It is accordingly held, that case, and not trespass, was the proper remedy, for an injury done to the plaintiff \u2019s chaise, by the servant of the defendant so negligently driving his carriage that it struck against the plaintiff\u2019s chaise, and broke it. The Court said, in <em>Morley </em>v. <em>Gainsford, (2 H. Bl. </em>442,) that it was difficult to put a case where the master could be considered as a trespasser, for an act of his servant, which was not done at his command. But in the case at bar, it is not pretended that the act was done at the command of the corporation, nor is there the slightest evidence from which their assent can be implied. If, therefore, the defendants, under the circumstances of the case, are hable, it is very clear that it i\u00e1 not in this form of suit, but in action on the case, for the unski'lfulness or negligence of the - engineer, who, at the time the injury was done, was acting as the servant of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
