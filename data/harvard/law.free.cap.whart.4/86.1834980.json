The plaintiff has declared upon a certain lease from the defendant to him, of a messuage and lot of ground on Front-street, in the District of Southwark. The particular covenant which, it is alleged, the defendant has broken, is, that the plaintiff should peaceably and quietly have, hold, use, occupy and possess the demised premises, with the appurtenances, during the term of five years, commencing, &amp;c. without the lawful suit, trouble, eviction, molestation or interruption, of the said defendant, his heirs, or assigns, or of any other person or .persons whatsoever. The breach assigned is, an eviction, during the term, by the Corporation of Southwark, by due process of law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-12\">The proof of the eviction appeared in the records of the Court of Quarter Sessions of the County of Philadelphia, in regard to the opening of Washington-street, from the river Delaware to Fourth-st. under an act of assembly, passed the 25th of March, 1831; the assessment and payment of damages to the defendant; the premises mentioned in the lease, having been entirely taken and used fordhe purposes of said street; the notice from the solicitor of the district of Southwark, requiring the plaintiff to quit the premises&gt;\u2019without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>delay,- and the plaintiff\u2019s immediate removal in consequence of these proceedings, and of this formal notice and requisition ,* the leasehaving nearly four years to run.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-6\">There is a-broad principle of law at the very foundation of this case: if determined in favour of the defendant, it puts an end to this suit. ' It-is denied by the defendant\u2019s counsel that the covenant comprehends such an eviction as this. I was strongly inclined to reserve this question, and submit to the jury the assessment of any damage which the plaintiff might have sustained. In that case I should probably have deemed myself bound to. say, that in point of law the inquiry-was limited to the value of the unexpired term of the lease; inasmuch as neither the <em>money </em>paid by the plaintiff to \u00e1' former tenant for the good will of the tavern stand, nor the expenses of the ten-pin alley, could be recognised, upon any legal principle, as embraced by such a covenant as this. But, upon reflection, I.hav\u00e9 formed so decided an opinion upon the important question of the cause, that I deem it my duty to state it unreservedly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-7\">In entering into the covenant, the parties to it had in view only existing rights. Though the act of assembly had already been passed, yet it was uncertain whether the commissioners of the District of Southwark would exercise the authority conferred upon them, in reference to the widening of Washington-street, or if they exercised it, whether they would do so within the term of the lease, or, if within the said term, whether the enlarged street would embrace this property, or property on the other side of the- old street. To hold this covenant to apply, would.be to say, it-would apply, if not to- a naked possibility, at least, to a doubtful and uncertain contingency. Upon this subject I adopt the views of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, as delivered by Chief Justice Parsons, in the case of <em>\u00c9llis </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>(6 <em>Mass. Rep. 250.)</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-8\">Again, the lessor here did not covenant against any paramount right of the commonwealth. This prerogative, whether.grown out of a reservation in the original grant of title to land, or founded upon the general principles of sovereignty, could not have b\u00e9en contemplated by the parties.. The doctrine of the books by which a general covenant in- a lease for quiet enjoyment, extends only to entries and interruptions by those who have lawful' title, has never been regarded as comprehensive enough to reach the case of an easement acquired by the public, after the execution of the lease, though acquired under their general paramount and controlling prerogative.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-9\">Further than this: \u2014 Look to the reason, why such a covenant does not, according to all the authorities, extend to wrong doers. It is that the tenant has his remedy by action, for all tortious entries and disturbances. Now the act of assembly under which the street was widened, expressly provides for the assessment and payment of damages accruing to the owners of property in the opening of the street. The interest in an unexpired term of a lease, and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>improvements lawfully erected and put up during the term, is property, such as the act of assembly clearly contemplates, and in regard to which any damages actually accrued, would have been assessed and paid. The tenant had the right to go before the jury appointed upon this subject, and we must presume they would have acted according to law; at any rate, the Court of Quarter Sessions would have protected him. As this remedy was open to him, he has no action upon the covenant now in question. As to a suggestion that the defendant may have applied for, and received, in the sum awarded to him as owner of the premises, the estimated value of the property of the present plaintiff, in addition to his own proper damages, it is enough to remark, that the plaintiff, upon proof of the case, is not without a legal remedy; but the present action being upon the covenant for quiet enjoyment, does not embrace such a claim.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-6\">The jury having found a verdict for the defendant in conformity with the charge, the plaintiff took a wtit of error, and assigned the following errors. \u25a0 -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-7\">\u201c 1.

By the act of 25th March, 1831, Washington street had been authorised to be widened, and provision was made to compensate all \u201c owners of property,\u201d for damages that might thereby accrue to them, by proceedings before a jury in the usual manner. There existed, therefore, at the time of the lease, a liability in the property to be taken for a street; but as the additional quantity requisite for that purpose, might be taken from the other side of the street, or from both sides, it was uncertain whether any part of the ground, would be taken, or if any part, how much. It must be deemed to be an existing liability, but contingent. The question is, whether a covenant for quiet enjoyment against eviction by the defendant or his assigns or any other person, is broken by the occupation of the. property by the county for the purpose of a. street, when the law has provided that on so doing, compensation shall be made to the owner of property thus taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The covenant for quiet enjoyment is designed to indemnify the vendee for a lawful eviction by reason' of defect of title in the vendor, arid any disturbance thereupon. It is one of the covenants for title which have been introduced in later times in lieu of the ancient warranty. <em>Platt. Cov. </em>304,312. This covenant is employed in conveyances in fee-simple as well as of lesser estates, and is founded on the principle of justice, that the vendor having received the value should re-imburse to the vendee that value if the latter should lose the premises by reason of a defect of title in the vendor. But if the vendee lose the' premises, not because of defect of title in the vendor, but on the very ground that the vendee has a good title from the vendor, which the state, by virtue of its sovereign power, authorises to be taken from him, stipulating to pay him for it, on what principle can he have recourse to the vendor on such a covenant <em>\u00cd </em>If the covenant is broken, the vendor is liable upon it, though he may neither have received nor been entitled to receive any thing: for the vendee\u2019s remedy in that case does not depend on the vendor\u2019s having received any compensation; it arises by the mere fact of the eviction and loss of the property. The case then would present the aspect of a vendee, who, on eviction, is entitled to be paid the value of his loss by the party evicting him, and at the same time may recover from the vendor for breach of covenant. This cannot be: the covenant never was designed for such an event, and is not applicable to it. It resembles the case of eviction of the vendee by a third person who is a tort-feasor. He may have his action against such tort-feasor ; and therefore it has been decided that the vendor is not liable on this covenant. The same reason applies when the vendee is ousted by the sovereign power of the state under its right of\u2019 eminent domain, or under reservations in the first settlement of the country, exercised according to the constitutional injunction of compensating every man whose property is taken for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>the public use. The remedy of the vendee is to look to the legislative provisions made for his indemnity, and not to the covenant for quiet enjoyment, which was introduced into conveyances for purposes entirely different. It is not material to allege that the plaintiff received by the award of the jury more than his proportion of the damage which accrued. That does not go to establish the breach of the covenant, which is the only matter in issue in this suit. If the plaintiff was entitled to a portion of the whole assessment of damages, he ought to have obtained it, either from the jury of assessment, or from the Court of Quarter Sessions, on objecting to the report of the jury, and having a new assessment, or by an apportionment by the Court. There cannot be a doubt, but a tenant-is an <em>\u201c </em>owner of property\u201d within the act, and entitled to comp&amp;nsation for any damage he may have sustained, as well as the reversioner, or other legal claimants and incumbrancers. But it is his duty, like that of all other claimants, to attend to his rights in due season, and to bring them before the legitimate tribunal which is to decide upon them. The Court of Quarter Sessions exercises constantly a supervisory power over the proceedings of juries who assess damages for lands taken for streets and roads, and corrects their errors and omissions, if duly applied to by the parties interested. In this suit, however, the only question is, whether the covenant of the defendant is broken; and that turns on the character of the covenant in its legal interpretation, and what constitutes a breach. On principle as well as authority, we think there was no error in the decision of the Court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
