A bill was filed, setting forth, that the partners owned separate real estate, which was not mentioned in the assignment, and an injunction was granted to restrain the assignees from proceeding under the assignment. It appeared by the answer thut*the only separate real estate of either partner, which had not been mentioned in the assignment, was a house and lot of ground encumbered beyond their full value. The Court, on motion, dissolved the injunction.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-11\">This cause came before the Court on a motion to dissolve an injunction, which had been granted on the filing of a bill by James Fassit, Theodore L. Fassit and Alfred Fassit, co -partners in trade, as James Fassit &amp; Co., against Isaac Phillips, Joseph L. Moss, Joseph Mora Moss and David Samuel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-12\">The bill set forth that the complainants had been in the habit of transacting business with Isaac Phillips and Joseph L. Moss, who traded in the City of Philadelphia under the firm of R. &amp; I. Phillips ; that the said R. &amp; I. Phillips, in consequence of their mutual dealings and business transactions became indebted unto the complainants in a large sum' of money, for which they obtained judgment by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>confession against the said R. &amp; I. Phillips for nineteen thousand five hundred and ninety-two dollars and ninety-seven cents, being the amount then actually due, in the District Court for the City and County of Philadelphia to September Term, 1837, No. 1318, which judgment now stands unreversed and in full force, and that the said R. &amp; I. Phillips have never satisfied the said judgment or any part thereof; that the said R. &amp; I. Phillips by deed, dated the twenty-second day of March, eighteen hundred and thirty-seven, (a copy of which was annexed to the bill,) transferred and assigned unto Joseph Mora Moss and David Samuel certain of their property, real and personal, in trust, after the payment of certain preferences, for the benefit of all the creditors of the said R. &amp; I.

Phillips, by a certain other deed, dated the twenty-second day of June, eighteen hundred and thirty-seven, (a copy of which was also annexed,) transferred and assigned unto Joseph Mora Moss and David Samuel, certain of their property, real and personal, in trust, after the payment of certain preferences, for the benefit of such of their creditors as should on or before certain periods of time therein limited, execute unto the said R. &amp; I. Phillips a full, valid, and general release of all their claims and demands. The bill further charged that the said first mentioned deed of assignment, dated March the twenty-second, eighteen hundred and thirty-seven, was fraudulent and void; that it assigned the partnership property and effects of the said R. &amp; I. Phillips, for-the payment of the several and personal liabilities of the said Isaac Phillips and Joseph L. Moss, in preference to the partnership debts of the said R. &amp; I. Phillips; the said R. &amp; I.

Phillips; that Joseph L. Moss, one of the partners of the said firm, did at the time of the assignment stand seised? and was the owner of certain real estate, described and mentioned in a schedule annexed to the bill, which was not transferred by it. That Isaac Phillips, another partner of the said firm, was at the time of the assignment the owner, and had an interest in certain real estate (mentioned and described in another schedule annexed,) not conveyed by it, and that the last mentioned deed of assignment made no mention of sundry pieces of property, (a schedule of which was also annexed,) in which the said R. &amp; I. Phillips had an interest at the time they were executing the said deed; that the said Joseph Mora Moss and David Samuel, assignees of the said R. &amp; I. Phillips, had taken charge of large quantities of property under the assignment of the 22d March, 1837, had reduced the same into their possession, were proceeding to satisfy the preferences, and intended to hold the residue under the assignment of the 22d June, 1837, and shortly to distribute the same to the releasing creditors of R. &amp; I. Phillips; that the said Joseph Mora Moss and David Samuel, assignees of the said R. &amp; I. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Phillips, had taken charge of large quantities of property, had reduced the same into their possession, and intended shortly to distribute unto the releasing creditors, such proceeds as they may have realized as agents under the assignments; that the complainants had refused to execute the stipulated release, or to assent to the assignments; that the said Isaac Phillips, Joseph L.

That-partners, or any other persons, although they be insolvent, may, in the absence of any bankrupt law, or restraining statute, convey a portion of their joint or separate property, or of both, upon such trusts as are contained in the deed of March 22d, 1837, which they insisted was executed under the direction of eminent counsel in New York, where the assigned property was; that in point of <em>fact, </em>it was all <em>joint, </em>and the debts to be paid, all <em>joint </em>debts; that it contained no such provision as the bill alleged, assigning \u201c the partnership effects for the payment of separate debts;\u201d theyalso stated the receipt of property under this deed, but asserted that it was all distributed under the trusts of the deed prior to December 1st, 1838; so that the trust was closed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-9\">2. As to the deed of 22d June, 1S37, they denied that it was fraudulent. They admitted that Joseph L. Moss had the legal estate of the house in Walnut street in him ; but they averred that it was of no value whatever when the assignment was drawn, the liens upon it being of an amount greatly beyond its value; that it was not inserted, because the counsel who drew it advised them, that it was useless to insert it because it was of no value, and that if inserted, they might have refused to receive it; that it was sold, under execution, six months before the filing of the complainants\u2019 bill, for 150 dollars, being less than the amount of the first and second incumbrances.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-10\">3.

They admitted the taking possession of the property passing under the deed of June 22d, 1837; stated the settlement of their accounts as assignees, and the injunction by Lizardi and others restraining their distribution of the fund, and their own bill in this Court against the complainants and others, for a distribution of it, and asking the advice of the Court, because it was a trust fund.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-7\">5. They admitted that the complainants had not released R. &amp; I. Phillips.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-8\">6. They denied the'jurisdiction of the Court over the case, as <em>not </em>within the equity powers of the Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b408-9\">Mr. <em>Ingraham, </em>(with whom was Mr. <em>II. M. Phillips,) </em>for the assignees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-10\">1. The only article of property which is admitted not to have passed under the assignment of June 22d, is the house and lot in Walnut street; which did not produce the amount of the incumbrances upon it. The case of <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Jenks, </em>(5 <em>Rawle, </em>221,) decided, that where there was substantial separate property, the omission of it invalidated the assignment. There the chief justice says, that one partner had separate property to the value of several hundred dollars, and the other to the value of several thousand. That case therefore does not touch this. <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Levan, </em>(1 <em>Miles, </em>358.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-11\">2. Whether the allegations of the bill are true or false, the complainants are not entitled to relief by this method of proceeding. If the assignment is good, they have no claim since they have not executed the release ; if bad, they do not require the aid of the equity powers of this Court, to obtain redress. There is no equity stated in the bill to call for the interference of the Court. If the Court see that no decree can be made at the final hearing, they will dissolve the injunction. <em>Story\u2019s Equity Pleading, </em>260, 289. 2 <em>Madd. Chan. </em>158. <em>Wilkin </em>v. <em>Wilkin, </em>(1 <em>Johns. Chan. Rep. </em>117.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-12\">3. The power to grant injunctions in such a case as this, is not expressly given by the act of 16th June, 1836, and cannot be inferred from any of its provisions. The intention was to give a limited equity jurisdiction ; and this Court will not extend it by construction.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b408-13\">Mr. <em>Meredith, for the </em>complainants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-14\">1. The answer does not state what the liens on the Walnut-street property were, either in character or amount. The presumption is that it was sold clear of incumbrances; and then you have property worth $8000 sold for $ 150. How does this case differ from <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Jenks ? </em>The principle of that case is, that every omission <em>of </em>\"property vitiates. There is no difference in the result in conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>quence of a creditor having a judgment. It is said, that the bill does not pray relief, &amp;c. We are not here upon demurrer or at a hearing upon bill and answer. The answer in fact admits all that is necessary for the complainants\u2019 case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-6\"><em>2. </em>The jurisdiction of the Court is manifest. The 5th clause of the 13th section of the act of 1836, give's this Court the power and jurisdiction of a Court of Chancery, so far as relates to \u201cthe prevention and restraint of the commission or continuance of acts contrary to law, and prejudicial to the interests of the community, or the rights of individuals.\u201d The word <em>1 </em>injunction,\u2019 is not used here, but the intention is manifest to give this Court all the powers possessed and usually exercised by the Courts of Equity in England, to restrain by injunction; and there is no doubt of the power of those Courts to interfere in a case like the present. Besides, the second clause gives this Court equity powers in respect to trust moneys and property, which would be sufficient, independently of the express grant in the 5th clause.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b409-7\">Mr. <em>Randall, </em>for the releasing creditors, argued in support of the motion <em>to </em>dissolve the injunction.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b409-8\">Per Curiam. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"AhVT\">The charge of actual fraud is repelled by the answer; and an implication of legal fraud cannot be.raised from the admitted fact, that the house was left out of the assignment. In <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Jenhs, </em>a substantial benefit was reserved ; but here there was nothing of the sort. The legal title, incumbered as it is sworn to be, beyond the fee simple value, is a <em>caput mortuum, </em>which though it might have swelled the apparent amount of the schedule, could have held out but a deceptive promise to the creditors. It would therefore be useless, and perhaps mischievous, to suspend the execution of the trust till the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"A2a\">Injunction dissolved.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
