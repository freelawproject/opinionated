The usual corporate powers and authorities were conferred upon the company. The 6th section of the act was in the following words :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-11\">\u201c Section 6. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That the president and managers shall have full power and authority to appoint all officers necessary to supply vacancies, occasioned by death, resignation or otherwise, and also to appoint one or more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>superintendents of the works to be undertaken by them, and to hire and employ all such engineers, artists, workmen and labourers, to enter into all and singular the land and lands lying between the rivers Delaware and Schuylkill in the county of Philadelphia, south of the said city, and to lay out and survey such routes or tracks as may be most practicable for effecting a navigable canal between the said rivers Delaware and Schuylkill by means of locks and all other needful devices, doing nevertheless as little damage as possible to the grounds and other enclosures in and over which they shall pass; and if in the opinion of the President and Managers of the said Delaware and Schuylkill Canal Company the introduction of any different mode or device or any improvement hitherto adopted or such as may hereafter be invented in the system of internal navigation, will be beneficial, it shall be lawful for them to make use of and employ the same from time to time; and as w'ell for such purposes as for the necessary prosecution of the same, the said president and managers and their engineers, workmen and labourers, to enter into and upon all and singular the land and lands intended or supposed to be the proper route for canal and lock navigation, and shall have the power to buy so much land along the track or route of the canal and adjoining thereto, and tenements, waters, water-courses and all other real hereditaments as shall be necessary for the proper construction of said canal and other works necessary thereto; and on the application to the District Court for the City and County of Philadelphia of any person, or persons, or of the executors, admintrators or other legal representatives of any person or persons who shall be injured by or receive damage from the works of said company, or by reason of the making of said canal, it shall be the duty of the said court at the election of the party making such application, to appoint five judicious freeholders of any neighbouring county, or award a <em>venire </em>directed to the sheriff of any adjoining county to summon a jury of disinterested men from said adjoining county, whose duty it shall be to view the premises, to ascertain and report to the said court what damages, if any, have been sustained by such person or persons or those whom they represent, by reason of the said canal or other works; which report being confirmed by the court, judgment shall be entered thereon and execution, on motion, shall bb issued in case of non-payment of the money awarded, with reasonable costs to be assessed by the court; and it shall be the duty of the freeholders or jury, as the case may be, in valuing any lands, tenements or hereditaments, or making an assessment of damages for all other injuries or damages sustained, to take into consideration the advantage derived to the owner or owners of the premises from the said canal or navigation passing through the same: <em>Provided, </em>that in order to procure the location and construction of the canal in this act authorised, in such manner in all respects as shall be best calculated to promote and secure the public interests and the exten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>sion of the great system of internal improvement, the company hereby incorporated shall not commence the construction of the canal until the location, dimensions and plan thereof shall have been approved of by the board of Pennsylvania canal commissioners; and the said board are hereby authorised, if at any time they shall deem it necessary, to employ one or more able and skilful engineers to assist them therein.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-6\">The 16th section was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-7\">\u201c Section 16.

The bill then charged that the defendants had not power to make the canal until they should have bought so much land as should be necessary, and wei\u2019e not authorised to commence the canal until the location, dimensions and plan should have been approved by the canal commissioners, which the complainants had never procured to be done. The bill also charged that the company are not, and will not, when the canal shall be constructed, be able to pay the damages which the' complainants will sustain, &amp;c. The bill then prayed a subpoena and an injunction to restrain the defendants, their officers, agents, &amp;c. from proceeding to lay out or make the said canal through the land of the complainants, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-10\">Application having been made for an injunction, the Court directed notice to be given to the defendants to appear on the next motion-day. Accordingly on this day, Mr. <em>F. W. Rubbell, </em>(with whom was Mr. <em>T.

To enjoin till further order as a matter of course at the filing of the bill, would put the public, and every corporation like the present, at the mercy of every proprietor, according to the dictates of his interest or caprice, and enable him, by the process of the Court, to make what terms he pleased. There is no peculiar hardship here. Ample means of compensation are provided, by the sixth section of the act of incorporation, for those in any wise injured by the work; and though it was declared in the sixteenth section, that the damages should be paid or secured before entry made, that section has been repealed: and in this, there was nothing repugnant to the constitution at the time. It is sufficient to say, that it does not at present appear that the complainants\u2019 constitutional rights have been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">Motion refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
