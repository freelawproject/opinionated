It was also, we think, his obvious and pervading intention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>to keep the estate together in the hands of the trustees,, and with the surplus of income to create an accumulating fund for the benefit of the children, and the survivor, at the age of 21 years,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-6\">We think that these intentions are sufficiently manifest in the will, but if any doubt could be entertained in respect to that, the codicil which gives the whole over to strangers on the death of all the children under 25, without issue, indicates so clearly his views as to render the absolute vesting of any part during the minority of the children, impracticable, consistently with these paramount intentions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-7\">Then if such was his design, is there any rule or principle of law, which forces upon us a construction of the will, which would defeat this intention by vesting absolutely the shares of the children, who may die under twenty-five years, in the survivors, so as to make them transmissible to their personal representatives <em>l</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-8\">It appears from the authorities that where <em>distinct </em>legacies are given with survivorship, the clause relating to survivorship, unless extended by particular words \u2014 attaches only to the original shares, and does not affect the accruing share's, which therefore become, vested in the individuals, who are the survivors for the.time being. Where, however, the disposition is of an <em>aggregate </em>fund, wffiich the testator meant should so remain until a certain time fixed for division, the rule is otherwise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-9\">We submit that it will appear from an examination of the will and codicil, that the intention of the testator in this case, was to keep the fund together for the benefit of the survivors. It is true, that there are passages which seem to imply the contrary, and there is considerable obscurity in other passages ; but taking into view the bequest to the trustees of the whole residue, the directions as to the accumulating fund, the provisions for the management of the trust, and the dispositions of the codicil, we think that there is least difficulty in this view, and less probability of running counter to the design\"of the testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-10\">The direction to \u201c pay or assign\u201d the share or portion of the deceased child, or the securities thereof, to the survivors or survivor, which has been much relied upon in the argument for the widow, it appears to us must be read in connection with the provisions for the continuance of the trust, and in harmony with the great and overruling intent, which was to keep the estate in the hands of the trustees, until the arrival of the children respectively at the age of 21 years, and to continue the trust beyond that for certain purposes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-11\">To- suppose that the trust was to cease as to the share of one or ipore dying, would imply that the testator intended to leave one-sixth, of as the case might be, one half of his whole estate, liable to be thi\u2019own into the hands of infants, without any control over its disposition, or, perhaps, to be held by their mother, in her right of guardian, whose authority he has expressly limited to the guardianship of their <em>persons, </em>and that only during her state of widowhood; while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>in the event\u2019 of all living, he has carefully provided against this result, by creating a trust. In other words, if we suppose that the personal* estate amounted at his death to ninety thousand dollars, then in order to sustain the argument of his intention to break up the fund on the death of a child, and to exclude survivorship of the accrued share, we must suppose that on the death of one child,, he intended that thirty thousand dollars should be taken from the hands of the trustees, and be entirely at the disposal of the surviving children <em>; </em>and <em>on </em>the death of a second child, that an additional sum of thirty-thousand dollars should be discharged from the trust, and in all the sum of sixty thousand dollars out of the ninety thousand dollars should be Jet loose from all trusts, and vest absolutely, in the surviving infant; so that if she lived and married, it would pass to her husband, without any of the guards respecting her separate use, which he has carefully provided; and if she died, it would go.to her mother, or her mother\u2019s family.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-6\">We cannot, looking at the general scope of the will, and the earnestness and caution with' which the trust is guarded, suppose that such was his intention. We'are inevitably led to the conclusion, that the' trust remains as to the accruing or surviving shares, as well as to the original shares. And, such being the intent, and the <em>object </em>being to <em>keep the fund together, it follows that the </em>whole survived to the surviving child, and that no part is distributable to the administrator of the deceased daughter. In this view, we think that, we are sustained by the authorities; especialty by the cases of <em>Worledge </em>v. <em>Churchill, </em>(3 <em>Bro. Ch. Cas. </em>465,) and <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Lea, (Turner's Ch. Rep. </em>413.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-7\">We have, of course, nothing to do with the reasonableness of the will, or the hardship of the situation in' which the widow is placed, by the loss of pecuniary means being the consequence of <em>the </em>loss of her children; our business being merely to carry out the intentions of the testator, according to the best of our judgment; but it appears to us that in the event of the death of <em>all </em>the children, without issue,, before arriving at the age of 25 years, she will'by necessary implication from the words of the codicil, be entitled to the interest of the fund during her life or widowhood. A strong case in support of this view will be found in <em>Bird </em>v. <em>Hunsdon, </em>(2 <em>Swanston, </em>342.) We are not called upon, however, to decide this point, and now advert to it, merely on account of its connexion with the general intent of the testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-8\">With the views which we have expressed relative to the true construction'of the will in this case, we report that the whole of the balance in the hands of the executors', is to be retained by them as trustees for Mary Masden, the surviving child of the testator, subject to the limitations contained in the codicil to the said will.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-9\">Exceptions were filed to this report on behalf \u2022 of the executors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>and also on behalf of Mrs. Masden, the widow; and after argument the following decree was made by the Orphans\u2019 Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-6\">\u201c This cause came on to be heard on the 15th day of November, a. d. 1837, before the honourable Edward King and his associates, in the presence of counsel, on the part of the executors of -the said B. Masden, deceased, and on the part of Hannah Masden, widow of said Benjamin, and of the guardian ad, litem of Mary Masden, the only surviving child of said Benjamin Masden.

The several clauses in the will were examined and commented on, to show the intention of the testator, 1st, In respect <em>to </em>a provision <em>for </em>his wife, and 2nd, In regard to his children. It was contended also, that the intention was to keep the property together as an aggregate fund. If such were the intention, <em>the </em>question is, whether there is any rule of law which interferes with it <em>1 </em>No such rule has yet been recognised in this state, nor in any other state except North Carolina. <em>M'Cay </em>v. <em>Henderson, (3 Murphy, </em>21.) The rule as it prevails in England has often been regretted and censured. 2 <em>Roper on Legacies, </em>276. 288. <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>(3 <em>Atk. </em>78.) <em>Exparte West, </em>(1 <em>Bro.

The words \u201cpay and assign,\u201d in the clause of the will relating to the death of the. children, are used in four other places in the will, and in all of them it is indispensable that the legal estate should pass out of the trustees. The will is technically drawn from begin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>ning to end. The passages in question can\u2019t be made to harmonize with the supposed general intent, without reforming \u25a0 the whole will. The rule is, that where we find an express direction in technical language, it must be a very plain case of general intention to overrule it. <em>Jeremy\u2019s Equity, </em>53. It was evidently the intention of the testator, that she should continue to reside in his house; yet this would be impossible, upon the $500 a year, which the argument on the other side would reduce her to. The trust could not have lasted as to grandchildren, yet this is part of the same clause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-6\"><em>2. </em>The general rule is admitted to prevail in England; but this is supposed to be intended as an aggregate fund, which is said to form an exception, though the distinction between this and separate funds is not very clear. The cases certainly do not countenance the idea, that the provisions of this will would create an aggregate fund. <em>Rudge </em>v. <em>Barker, (Cas. Temp. Talbot, </em>124.) <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Micklethwaite, </em>(1 <em>P. Wms. </em>274.) <em>Crowden </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>(2 <em>Russell, </em>217; S. C. 3 <em>Eng. Chan. Cas. </em>369.) In the last case there was a trust and an aggregate fund, yet the accruing- shares were held not to survive. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>(1 <em>Tamlyn, </em>85 ; S. C. 5 <em>Eng. Chan. Rep. </em>297.) The act of assembly of this state prevents any joint-tenancy existing. This act applies to all species of estates, whether equitable or legal. This will constituted a tenancy in common then; and this seems to be admitted in the opposite argument. The words used in this will are technical words, well understood by the penman. <em>Woodward </em>v. <em>Glassford, </em>(2 <em>Vernon, </em>388.) <em>Fearne on Rem. </em>555-6. Mr. <em>Butler\u2019s note. </em>It is evident that from the outset of the will, the testator meant that the respective shares should be separated. The executors would have been bound to open separate accounts. The testator meant that they should have equal shares of the residue. Suppose one of the daughters married at eighteen, while the others remained single to twenty-five; the first would receive two thousand dollars, as an outfit, and interest on thirteen thousand dollars until twenty-one. The words are \u201c to be paid in just proportions,\u201d meaning that the shares should be equalized. So the word \u201c respective\u201d is used.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-7\">3d. The words <em>\u201c </em>previously disposed of,\u201d in the codicil apply to the provisions in favour of the children; and the codicil gave to the legatees in England, only that portion of the estate which might be undisposed of on the death or marriage of the wife, and on the death of the children without issue.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b439-8\">Mr. <em>Meredith </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-9\">1. If these legacies vested at the death of the testator, then the clause of survivorship is not good, being dependent on an indefinite failure of issue. Here is an absolute legacy to children, merely postponing the time of payment, which the authorities show, does not prevent their vesting. <em>Roper on Legacies, </em>376. There is no case where the fund is given as one legacy, payable at different times, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>which the Court has said that the legacy did not vest. The first part of the clause gives the children an estate tail in personalty which is equivalent to a fee simple. <em>Walter </em>v. <em>Drew, (Comyn\u2019s Rep. </em>373.) <em>Beauclerc </em>v. <em>Dormer, </em>(2 <em>Atk. </em>208.) <em>Tothill </em>v. <em>Pitt, </em>(1 <em>Madd. Ch. Rep. </em>488.) The words \u201c in default of such child or children, or issue of such,\u201d mean an indefinite failure of issue. <em>Wilmot </em>v. <em>Wilmot, </em>(8 <em>Ves. </em>10.) If these words give an estate tail, the word \u201c such,\u201d does not make any alteration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-6\">2. Supposing the clause to be free from the objection, that the limitation over is too remote, it is clear from the authorities, that the accruing share went to the personal representatives of Ann. In <em>Wilmot </em>v. <em>Wilmot, </em>the words'were the same as here. It is not very clear what is meant by an aggregate fund. If the legacy vested, there is certainly nothing like an aggregate fund. Joint-tenancy is out of the question in this state. <em>Mackell </em>v. <em>Winter, </em>(3 <em>Ves. Jr. </em>536,) turned upon the vesting of the legacy. So did <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Lea. </em>Suppose Ann had survived Benjamin for a longer space, would not the trustees have been bound to assign her portion of his share to her1? The precedents of wills expressly recommend that provision should be made for accruing shares. The intention of the testator was, to give his wife a sufficient income, which the opposite construction would prevent. It is settled, that when one executory devise has vested, all others following it are void. <em>Fearne, </em>513, section 8.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b440-7\">Mr. <em>Scott </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ads\">[having been told by the Court, that he need not speak to the point of the bequest over being too remote,] contended, that the whole of the. interest of Benjamin, as well as the whole of that of Ann, must vest eventually in Mary, if she lives, and that this conclusion results from the language of the clause itself, as well as from the general provisions of the will. 1st, The bequest 'over, upon the death of a child, without issue, is to persons who cannot be ascertained until the time when the deceased child would have reached twenty-five, if it had lived; in other words, the bequest over cannot vest in any person till that time. The word <em>then </em>refers to the time at which the dying child would have reached twenty-five. It is clear that he did not contemplate so early a death. If the word refers to the death of the child, it might have cut out a posthumous child. Nor is it likely that a man, who so carefully postponed the enjoyment of the fund by his own children, up to their age of twenty-five, would have adopted a different rule as to the children of a child. 2d. The original bequests did not vest, and cannot vest until a period of time which can never occur to Benjamin or Ann, because they have died at too early an age, and which may or may not occur to Mary. I agree, that where the legacy is given to a specific person, but to be paid at a future day, and there is nothing more in the will to explain the intention, such legacy shall be regarded as vested. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Here, however, there are other provisions, which show the intention to have been otherwise. The codicil is, of itself, sufficient to prevent the operation of this rule. The words of the particular clause, look the same way. It was admitted in the opposite argument, that the legacy was to go over on certain events. Then how could the principal be paid or assigned to any child, before the time fixed in the will <em>1 </em>3rd. There is upon the general frame of the will, as well as in the words of the clause, a bequest over to each survivor, not merely-of the share of the last decedent, but, of accrued shares. ' Nothing is given to the wife, but the income of the house. Her sons were to be put out apprentices, and were to have only five thousand dollars a piece at twenty-one, to commence business with. The daughters were to receive two thousand dollars each, on their marriage, &amp;c., and a provision was made for the appointment of trustees for the married daughters. The construction contended for on the I other side, would defeat the intention in all these instances. Suppose there had been six children instead of three, there would be no fund at all left for the operation of the codicil. <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>(1 <em>Watts, </em>370.) <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Snyder, (5 Rawle, </em>140.) The supposed rule of the English Courts, can be nothing more than a rule for the discovery of the intention of the testator, which is very obvious here; and after all, the exceptions are as numerous as the cases within the rule. The cases of <em>Worledge </em>v. Churchill, and <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Lea, </em>are in point, and have not been answered.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AXe\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b441-8\">Sergeant, J. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"A9g\">Jt has long been an established rule, that provisions disposing of the shares of devisees and legatees, dying before a given period, do not <em>proprio vigore </em>exend to shares accruing under that disposition. As where a man gives a sum to be divided amongst four persons, tenants in common, and declares that if one (or rather if any) of them die before twenty-one or marriage, it shall survive to the others. If one dies and three are living, the share of that one so dying, will survive to the other three: but if a second dies, nothing will survive to the remainder, but the second\u2019s original share; for the accruing share is as a new legacy, and there is no further survivorship. Per Lord Hardwicke in <em>Pain </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>(3 <em>Atk. </em>80.) See also <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Micklewaite, </em>(2 <em>Ch. Rep. </em>171; S. C. 1 <em>P. W. </em>274.) <em>Rudge </em>v. <em>Barker, (Cas. Temp. Talb. </em>124.) <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Ballard, </em>before Lord King, cited 3 <em>Atk. </em>78. So in <em>Exparte West, </em>(1 <em>Bro. C. C. </em>575,) where a testator bequeathed to A. B. and C. the three sons of S. \u00a31000 each, the interest to be added to the principal yearly, until they should respectively attain the age of twenty-one years: and in case any of them should die before that age, then to the survivors; A. died under twenty-one, and then B.; and the question which was raised upon petition was, whether that part of the share of B. which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>accrued to him on the death of A. went over to C. on the death of B. Lord Thurlow thought it did not survive again, but, hesitating to decide it upon petition, a bill was filed, and the cause came to a hearing before Sir Lloyd Kenyon, M. R. who decided against the survivorship of the accruing share. 2 <em>Pow. Dev. 724.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">According to these established principles, the direction to <em>the </em>executors in the proviso of Benj. Masden\u2019s will, in case any or either of his children should die without having received his or her portion and without arriving at the age of twenty-five years, and not leaving issue living at the time of his or her decease, (which seems to be the true construction of the clause,) then to pay or assign the same, or the securities thereof, to the survivor or survivors of any children who might be then living, and the issue of such as might be dead, did not carry over to the last surviving child, Mary, or the executors in trust for her, the moiety which had accrued to Ann, by reason of the previous decease of Benjamin Masden, without issue; but that moiety of Benjamin\u2019s share having become vested in Ann, as her absolute estate, by the death of Benjamin, passed on her decease, to her personal representative, and not in trust for Mary the survivor.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Although this is the clear construction of the proviso in this will, yet if there be other clauses in the will and codicil controlling the proviso, and rendering another construction necessary, in order to reconcile the whole instrument and to effectuate the manifest intention of the testator, we should be bound to give effect to them, however strong the language might be in the proviso alone. But on examining the whole structure of this will, and comparing its different provisions, I am unable to find any such intention manifested.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Mere conjecture is not sufficient: there must be a plain and apparent intention, capable of being collected from the will and codicil.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">The suggestion is, that there is an intention shown in the will and codicil, to keep the estate together as an aggregate fund, until the children respectively should arrive at the age of twenty-one and twenty-five years, and that if any died before the age of twenty-five, without leaving issue, their portion not paid over, was to be kept together by <em>the </em>executors in trust for <em>the </em>survivors or survivor; and in the event of the death of all of them, before that event, and the death or marriage of the widow, the whole was to go over to the residuary legatees.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">There can be no doubt, that if such a provision were apparent on the face of the will and codicil, the testator had full power to make it, and it would be binding on the Court to carry it into effect without regard to the consequences which would result to the widow or descendants of the testator. But I can perceive no such intention plainly expressed or capable of being drawn from the instruments. In the first place, this construction cannot be reconciled with the proviso in every event that might have happened. For by it, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>death of any one or more of his children before twenty-five, leaving children, is contemplated, and provision is made for these children, (and even for the issue of these children, which it is manifestly impossible there should be before that time,) and it directs the share of the child so dying, to be paid or assigned over to his or her children, &amp;c. But if we suppose Ann to have lived to the age of eighteen, and then to have married and had children, and died at twenty-one leaving a child.or children, which might well have happened, then it seems to me, according to the argument, that all was meanjt to be kept as an aggregate fund, these children must be destitute of support from their grandfather\u2019s estate, and must so continue till it should be ascertained whether the other child or children would survive to the age of twenty-five, which if Benjamin should live to that time, would be about fourteen years. The same thing might have occurred as to Mary, for the five hundred dollars per annum to the testator\u2019s children was to stop on their death. These considerations render it probable that he intended his grandchildren should take their parents\u2019 share,'as a vested estate, immediately on the death ,of such parent, which is in correspondence with the express and positive language of the proviso; and the direction over to the survivors, in case of the death of the children without issue, is in the same language, and to take effect at the same time as is directed .in relation to the issue of the children in case there were such issue; and I do not perceive how they can receive different constructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The codicil, however, is mainly relied on. It provides, that in case all his children died, before arriving at twenty-five years of age, without leaving issue surviving, then, and in such case, from and immediately after the decease or intermarriage of his wife, he bequeaths over the sum of thirty thousand dollars, in trust for the overseers of the poor of the parish of Crowl, inLincolnshire, England, and all the rest, residue and remainder of his estate, whatsoever, in the event abovementioned, <em>which may not have been previously disposed of, </em>to Thomas Harrison, &amp;c. Had he given over <em>the said trust money, </em>in case all his children died before twenty-five without issue then living, it might resemble the case cited of <em>Worledge </em>v. <em>Churchill, </em>(2 <em>Bro. Ch. Cas. </em>465,) and there might perhaps be some reason for saying, as Mr. J. Buller did in that case, that it was the testator\u2019s intention to keep the whole as an aggregate fund till that event occurred, and that in the meanwhile no accruing share should vest in any of the children or their issue. It may be observed however, that merely \u00e1 gift over, in case <em>all </em>the legatees die without leaving issue, does not necessarily indicate that a limitation to survivors in case of the death of <em>any </em>without leaving issue, is intended to carry the accruing shares; <em>Vanderguht </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>(2 <em>Ves. Jr. </em>534); though such a clause divests the accruing as well as the original shares of all, on the happening of the prescribed event. 2 <em>Pow. Dev. </em>727. But here the testator only gives over thirty thousand dollars, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>then <em>what may not have been previously disposed of, </em>under the will, leaving the question open, how it was to be disposed of under the will, and giving over only what was left. So in <em>Pain </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>(3 <em>Atk. </em>80,) the meaning of the testator was, that the bequest should' go among such persons as should be living at the decease of his father and mother; but here it is such as should be living at the death of a child without issue, and not, as has been argued, when the children should attain twenty-five or any other future point of time, for which it was to wait before it could vest. In <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Lea, </em>(1 <em>Turn. &amp; Russ. Chan. Rep. </em>413,) the bequest was, \u201c in case of the death of any or either of the children unmarried and without issue, then he gave and bequeathed the part or shares of him, her, or those so dying without issue, unto the survivors or survivor of them, equally share and share alike, <em>and to be paid to them respectively at the same time along with their original shares,\u201d </em>and the original shares were bequeathed in the first part of the will, \u201c on their, his or her respectively attaining the age of twenty.-five years.\u201d This was held by the Chancellor to be annexed to the substance of the bequest, and that they were contingent, and nothing vested in any till twenty-five, but in the mean time the whole to be kept as an aggregate fund. But in the case before us, the bequest to the survivors in the proviso, is not to wait until they attain twenty-five, but presently on the decease of any before attaining twenty-five, and becomes then vested.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">As to the argument, that if the accruing shares do not go over, there will not be sufficient left to answer the thirty thousand dollars bequeathed by the codicil, this is founded on conjectural estimates, which may or may not be correct. In some events there would be ample, even without the accumulating fund, which has been left subject to the directions of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
