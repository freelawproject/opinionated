It was admitted that Francis Bradley had been absent for sixteen years and upwards. It is therefore presumed that he is dead. The law presumes a man to be dead after seven years absence, or seven years from the time that he was last heard of. In this case it is for the advantage of the plaintiff) that Francis Bradley should be considered to have died at the end of sixteen years, and for the advantage of the defendant that he should be considered as dead at the end of seven years. We give you the law that the death is to be presumed at seven years after his absence, and after the last time he was heard of.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-13\">The jury found accordingly; and exception having been taken to the charge, the cause was removed to this Court, and error assigned to the charge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-14\">The case was argued at December term, 1837, but in consequence of the pendency of the case of <em>Burr </em>v. <em>Sim, </em>in which a similar question was to be argued, a decision was not given.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b173-15\">Mr. <em>Chew, </em>for the plaintiff\" in error, contended\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-16\">1.
