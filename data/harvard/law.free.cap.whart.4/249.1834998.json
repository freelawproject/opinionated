Morris, in whose favour it was drawn, that an agreement was made between the said Martin Rice and himself, to this effect, that if he the said Martin, did, within two weeks from its date, pay him, the said Anthony, the sum of one hundred and ten dollars for the said note, that it should be given up to the said Martin, and cancelled. That said Anthony was moved to make said agreement, from the fact, that said note, or rather the original note, was a mere accommodation note, for which the said Martin had never received any value. ' That the said Martin, according to his said agreement, did tender, at the time appointed, the said sum as agreed on, to the said Anthony, who refused the same: that the said Martin is now willing to pay the said sum of money as thus, \u2014 twenty dollars book account, owing him by the said Anthony, and the balance in cash. That the said Anthony held the said note when it became due; that deponent for this reason claims to have this defence to the claim of the said plaintiff: but is willing, nevertheless, to make good his said agreement.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-11\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel obtained a rule to show cause why judgment should not be entered for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, which, after argument, was made absolute; and judgment was entered accordingly, on the 7th of October, 1837.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-12\">The defendant then removed the record by writ of error, and filed the following specification.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-13\">\u201c The Court erred in entering judgment for the plaintiff, after the defendant had sworn to a substantial defence.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b250-14\">Mr. <em>Jack </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkE\">cited <em>Chitty on Bills, </em>p. 81, ed. 1836. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Barkley, (Douglas, </em>684.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b250-15\">Mr. <em>Price, </em>for the defendant in error was stopped.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b250-16\">'The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b250-17\">.Kennedy, J. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"Agq\">The promise set forth in the affidavit of defence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>filed by the defendant in the Court below, does not appear to have been made by the plaintiff upon a consideration sufficient in law to support it; and, therefore, though made, cannot be considered binding. It is what the law terms a <em>nudum factum. </em>For aught that appears in the affidavit, the amount of the note upon which the suit is founded, was justly due and owing to the plaintiff below, by the defendant: notwithstanding, it may be as the latter has sworn, that he derived no benefit from it.. But his friend did, to whom he lent his name and his credit, that he might obtain the amount of it in money from the plaintiff; so that the plaintiff having been induced by the defendant below, upon his faith and credit, to part with his money, the latter is as much bound in conscience, equity, and law, to repay the former, as if he had received the money from the plaintiff himself, It is not alleged that the plaintiff did not advance the full amount of the note to the person for whose accommodation the defendant below originally put his name on the paper. In the absence of such obligation, it is but fair to presume, that the plaintiff below was money out of pocket, when the defendant gave the note in question, to the amount of it, through the interference of the latter for his friend, who therefore in justice had no right to claim any deduction; and having given his note for nothing more than what he was equitably as well as legally bound to pay the plaintiff, the mere promise of the latter to release him upon his paying a less sum, then or before the day mentioned in the note for its payment, cannot be pleaded in discharge of the note; it is but an accord, at most, which, without satisfaction cannot avail. \u2014 The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
