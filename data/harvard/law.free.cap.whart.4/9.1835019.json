The 6th section of that act declared that the managers should, \u201c at their discretion, receive into the said House of Refuge, such children who. shall be taken up or committed as vagrants, or upon any criminal charge, or duly convicted of criminal offences,\"as may be in the judgment of the Court of Oyer and Terminer, or of the Court of Quarter Sessions of the peace of the county, or of the Mayor\u2019s Court of the city of Philadelphia, or of any alderman or justice of the peace, or of the managers of the Alms-house and house of employment, be deemed-proper objects.\u201d By a supplement to the act passed on the 10th day of April 1835, it was declared, that in lieu of the provisions of the act of 1826, it should be lawful for the managers of the House of Refuge \u201cat their discretion, to receive-into their care and guardianship, infants, males under the age of twenty-one years,andfemalesunder the age of eighteen years, committed to their custody in either of the following modes, viz.

Second: infants committed by the- authority aforesaid, where complaint and due proof have been made that such infant is a proper subject for the guardianship of the managers of the House of Refuge, in consequence of vagrancy, or of incorrigible or vicious conduct, and that from the moral depravity or otherwise of the parent or next friend in whose custody such infant may be, such parent or next friend is: incapable or unwilling to exercise the proper care and discipline over such incorrigible or vicious infant.

Where reformation, and not punishment, is the end, it may indeed be used as a prison for juvenile convicts who would else be committed to a common gaol; and in respect to these, the constitutigM^ ality of the act which incorporated it, stands clear of controi^^^^H It is only in respect of the application of its discipline to suljj^^^V admitted on the order of a courts a magistrate, or the ma-nagcn^Mp the Alms-house, that a doubt is entertained. The object of the charity is reformation, by training its inmates to industry; by imbuing their minds with principles of morality and religion; by-furnishing them with means to earn a living; and, above all, by separating them from the corrupting influence of- improper associates. To this end, may not the natural parents, when unequal to the task of education, or unworthy of it, be superseded by the <em>parens patrice, </em>or common guardian of the community ? It is to be remembered that the public has a paramount, interest in the virtue and knowledge of its members, and that, of strict right, the business of education belongs to it That parents are ordinarily entrusted with it, is because it can seldom be put into better hands.; but where they are incompetent or corrupt, what is there to prevent . the public from withdrawing their faculties, held, as they obviously are, at its sufferance ? The right of parental control is a natural, but not an unalienable one. It is not excepted by the declaration of rights out of the subjects of ordinary legislation; and it consequently remains subject to the ordinary legislative power, which, if wantonly or inconveniently used, would soon be constitutionally restricted, but the competency of which, as the government is constituted, cannot be doubted. As to abridgment of indefeasible rights by confinement of the person, it is no more than what is borne, to a greater or less extent, in every school; and we know of no natural right to exemption from restraints which conduce to an infant\u2019s welfare. Nor is there a doubt of the propriety of their application in the particular instance. The infant has been snatched from a course which must have -ended in confirmed depravity; and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>not only is the restraint of her person lawful, but it would be an act of extreme cruelty to release her from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b12-6\">Remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
