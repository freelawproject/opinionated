G. Freeman, a notary public, dated the twenty-fourth of April, 1832, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-10\">\u201c Be it known that on the day of the date hereof, I, Henry G. Freeman, Notary Public for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, residing in the city of Philadelphia, by lawful authority duly commissioned and sworn, at the request of Messrs. Yates &amp; M\u2018Intyre, presented the original note, whereof a true copy is above written, at the place of business of Messrs Gillingham, Mitchell and Co., the makers of the same, and demanding payment, I received for answer from a man whom I saw there in attendance, that the said note could not be paid at present, wherefore I notified the endorser of the nonpayment thereof,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-11\">The defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the admission of the said protest, for the purposes for which it was offered, insisting that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>was not evidence for either, and ought not to be read to the jury; but the learned judge admitted it and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-6\">The jury found for the plaintiff, and the record having been removed to this Court, the following error was assigned:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-7\">\u201c That the Court below admitted the protest set forth in the bill of exceptions, to be read to the jury, as evidence of the demand at maturity of payment of the note upon which the action was brought \u2022from the drawers, of its nonpayment by them when so demanded, and of notice thereof to the endorser, though'no facts are set forth in said protest constituting such demand and notice.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b487-8\">\u25a0 Mr. <em>Ingraham, </em>for the plaintiff .in error. !</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-9\">What amounts to notice in point of fact, is not a difficult matter to understand, when there is any fact to judge by; and here it becomes of more importance, that the evidence or testimony upon which the refusal of the drawer to pay at maturity, was made known 'to the endorser, should be explicit, when it is <em>exparte </em>entirely.' Now here in the first place, there is almost an impossibility to get at the facts as to the presentment and demand of payment. First, It was a day to\u00f3 late to charge the endorser. How does It appear, except by the decision of the notary, that where he presented the note, was the \u201c place of business of M. G. &amp; Co.\u201d What place was it? Their counting-house or kitchen ? it does not appear. Where was it ? in Philadelphia, New York, Boston or Baltimore ? From whom did he demand payment \u2014 from the drawers? he does not say. At what hour of the day did he go ? The assertion covers any hour. <em>Goldsmith </em>v. <em>Bland, (Chitty on Bills, </em>219, <em>n. </em>9.) He says he received for answer, from a man \u201c whom he saw there in' attendance,\u201d (i. e. waiting there,) \u201c wherefore,\u201d (i. e. for which reason,) he \u201c notified,\u201d (i. e. made known) the endorser of the non-payment thereof.\u201d Now that he did so, appears by noffact stated by him. The act of assembly make\u00e1 the notary\u2019s protest evidence-of the facts set forth in it, but he states the result \u2014 thelegal result \u2014 of the facts he should have stated, and he is not the judge of that. He should set forth what he did, or his assertion is not evidence. How did he give notice to the endorser; did he write him a note? Did he-go and t\u00e9ll him? Did he do it at all ? Who can say how, from any fact, that he did it at all ? So that there was nothing 'to leave to the jury. <em>Stewart </em>v. Allison, (6 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>324,) should make us more careful. \u2022 In M\u2018Gee v. <em>The Northumberland Bank, </em>(5 <em>Watts, </em>32,) all the facts are stated. '</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b487-10\">Mr. G. <em>M. Wharton, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-11\">The act of 1815, makes the official acts of notaries evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>The notary\u2019s certificate is only <em>prima facie </em>evidence. The defendant might have called him or contradicted him. It was a question altogether for the jury, and so it is decided in <em>M\u2018Gee </em>v. <em>The Northumberland Bank. </em>No evidence at all was given on the part <em>of the </em>defendant.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b488-7\">Sergeant, J. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"AqU\">The objections which have been made to this protest, go rather to its contents than its admissibility. The act of assembly of the 2nd of January, 1815, declares, that all protests of notaries public, if certified according to law, under their hands and seals of office, may be read in evidence of the facts therein certified: provided that any party may be permitted to contradict the certificate by other evidence. There were certainly facts stated in this <em>protest; </em>and whether these facts were insufficient, or defectively stated, were questions to arise after the instrument should be read to the jury. They were not sufficient in the first instance to prevent its admissibility under the act of assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
