The General Assembly of the Presbyterian church is not a <em>quasi </em>corporation. A <em>quasi </em>corporation has capacity to sue and be sued, as an artificial person, which the General Assembly has not. It is also established by law, which the General Assembly is not. Neither does the General Assembly bear the same relation* to the corporation of the Trustees of the General Assembly, &amp;c. as 'the shareholders do to a bank or joint-stock company; for the latter are an integrant part of the body. The General Assembly is a segregated association, which, though it is the re-productive organ of corporate succession, is not itself a member ofi-the body.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b531-7\">2. The General Assembly having no corporate quality in itself, it is not a subject of the Court\u2019s corrective jurisdiction, or of the Court\u2019s scrutiny, further than to ascertain how far its organic structure may bear on the question of its personal identity or individuality.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b531-8\">3. The acts of the General Assembly of 1837, exscinding the synods of Utica, Genessee, Geneva and the Western Reserve, were nothing more than ordinances of dissolution.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b531-9\">4. The plan of union of 1801, between the Congregational and Presbyterian churches, was a mere, temporary expedient, and therefore acquired the force of a law without the ratification of the presbyteries. It could be constitutionally repealed by an ordinary act of legislation; and those synods which had their root in it could not be expected to survive it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b531-10\">5. A permanent amalgamation of Congregational and Presbyterian churches, would compromise a principle at the very root of Presbyterian government, which requires that the officers of the church be set apart by special ordination for the work.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b531-11\">6. The General Assembly is a homogeneous body, uniting in itself, without separation of parts, the legislative, executive, and judicial functions of the government.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b531-12\">7. The four synods could not have been proceeded against judicially, for they had committed no offence. The plan of union, according to its true construction, admitted mixed churches, partly Congregational and partly Presbyterian, into the Presbyterian system, and authorized them to send unordained lay delegates to the presbyteries. Had the synods been judicially prosecuted for this relaxation, they could have pleaded the plan of union as a defence.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b531-13\">8. These acts of excision did not exclude the Presbyterian parts of the four synods from the church; provision being made for them, by allowing them to attach themselves to the nearest presbytery.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b531-14\">9. It is immaterial to inquire into the fact whether the four synods had actually been . constituted on the plan of Unipn. If the General Assembly proceeded in good faith, the validity of its enactment cannot depend on the justness of its conclusion. This Court has no power to re-judge its judgments.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b532-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>10. As the synods in question were constitutionally dissolved, the presbyteries of which they had been composed, were, at least for the purpose of representation, dissolved along with them; for no presbytery can be in connexion with the General Assembly, unless it be at the same time subordinate to a synod. The commissioners from the exscinded synods, were not, therefore, entitled to seats in the General Assembly.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AO\">11. But even if they were entitled io seats, the refusal of an appeal from the decision of the moderator, would be no ground for the degradation of that officer at the call of a minority; nor could it impose on the majority an obligation to vote on a question put unofficially, and out of the usual course.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b532-8\">12. When a question is put by the established organ, silence is acquiescence with the majority, because each member is supposed to have assented befoi e-hand to the process pre-established to ascertain the general will; but this\u2019 rule of implied assent is inapplicable to a measure which is essentially revolutionary, and based on no\u2019 pre-established process of ascertainment whatever.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b532-9\">13. To affect silent members with an implication of assent, the ground bf the motion, and the nature of the question must be so explicitly put before them, as to prevent misconception or mistake.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b532-10\">,14. The moderator ofthe preceding year, presiding under the provision of the constitution during the organization of the succeeding year, is a mere mechanical instrument of organization, and not at all subject to the control of the General Assembly.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b532-11\">15. If he were corporeally present, hut refused to perform his functions, he might be deemed constructively absent, insomuch that the commissioners might proceed to the choice of a substitute; but not if he had entered on the performance of his task.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b532-12\">16. A motion to put top\u00f3n the roll the names of the commissioners from the four synods, made before the body was sitting, under the presidency of its own moderator, was premature. Such questions ai'e proper for the decision of the body when it is fully constituted and prepared for organization.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b532-13\">17. The title of the commissioners from the exscinded synods, could be determined only by the action ofUlre house, which could not b? had before its organization was complete. In the mean time the moderator was bound, as the executive instrument of the preceding assembly, to put its ordinances in execution ; for to the actual assembly, and not to the moderator ofthe preceding one, it belonged to repeal it.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-14\">This was a quo warranto issued by this Court under \u2019 the act of the 14th of June, 1836.

But since the passage of that resolution by the assembly, the synod believe that no such practice has obtained in any of our presbyteries.

It was not proved or asserted that a majority of the commissioners (even counting the commissioners from the four synods as voting,) voted either on Mr. Cleaveland\u2019s, or the subsequent motions; but the new school party relied upon the following by-law of the General Assembly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-6\">\u201c 3.

These appellations we may adopt for the sake of designating the respective parties, the existence' of which will have an important bearing on some of the questions involved in this important cause. It gives a key,to conduct, which it would be otherwise difficult to explain.

They, therefore resolved that their brethren-of the General Association of Connecticut be, and they hereby are, respectfully -requested to <em>consent </em>that the,said plan shall be, from and after the next meeting of that association, declared to be .annulled.

It had not then occurred to the assembly that the plan of union was unconstitutional. The resolutions are predicated on the belief that the agreement or compact was constitutional. They request that the association of Connecticut would <em>consent </em>to rescind it, . It does not seem to have been thought that this could be done without their consent. And moreover, the resolution expressly saves the rights of existing churches which had been formed on that plan. \u2019 -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"227\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-12\">I must be permitted to regret, for the sake of peace and harmony, that this business- was not suffered to rest on the basis of resolutions which breathe the spirit of peace and good feeling.

Because those important standing rules, as they call them, were not submitted to the presbyteries; and secondly, because the General Association- of .Connecticut, was invested with no power to legislate in such cases, and especially to enact laws to regulate churches not within their limits. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"230\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-7\">The Court is not satisfied with the force of these reasons, and do not think the agreement, qr plan of union, comes- within the words pr spirit of that clause in the constitution which provides, that before ifny overture or regulations shall be proposed by the General Assembly to be established as constitutional rules shall be obligatory on the churches, it shall be necessary to transmit them to all the presbyteries, and to receive the returns of at least a majority of them approving thereof. Nor is it in the opinion of the Court, in conflict with.the.'constitutiori before its amendment in 1821, which provides that no..alteration shall be made in the constitution, unless two-thirds of the presbyteries under the care of the General Assembly propose alterations or amendments, and such alterations or amendments are agreed to by the assembly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"231\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-8\">It was a regulation made by competent parties, and not intended by either .as a constitutional rule; nor was it obligatory on any of the Presbyterian churches within their conriexion. Those who were competent to make it, were competent to dissolve it, without the assent-ofthe presbyteries, as such, which could not be done, were it a constitutional rule, within the meaning of the constitution. Whether one party may dissolve it-without the consent of the other,\u2019 it might be unnecessary to decide. My opinion is that they. can. The plan of union is intended to prevent alienation, and to promote union and Harmony iri the new settlements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"232\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-9\">It is not a union of the Presbyterian <em>church </em>with a Congregational church or churches, but it purports to be,, and is a plan of union between individual- members of the Presbyterian and Congregational church\u00e9s, in that portion of the country which was then denominated the new settlements. &gt; It is advisory and recommendatory in its character; has nothing obligatory about it. A Congregational church, as- such; is not by force of the agreement incorporated with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>th\u00e9 Presbyterian church. It has no necessary connexion with it; for it is only when the congregation consists partly of those who hold the Congregational form of discipline, and partly of those who hold the Presbyterian form, and there-is an appeal to the presbytery, (as there may be in certain cases,) that the standing committee of the Congregational church, consisting partly of Presbyterians and partly of Congregationalists, may, or shall attend the presbytery, and may have the same right to sit and act in the presbytery as a ruling elder. And whatever may have been occasionally the instances to the contrary, this I conceive to be the obvious construction of the regulation. That part of the agreement was intended as a safeguard or protection of the rights of all the parties to be affected by it, without any design to confer upon the standing committee all the rights of a ruling elder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"233\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-6\">I view it as a matter of discipline, and not of doctrine, the effect of which is to exempt those members of the different communions, who adopted it from the censures of the church to which they belong, and particularly the clerical portion of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"234\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-7\">The Court is also of the opinion, that after an acquiescence of nearly forty years, and particularly after the adoption by the presbyteries of the amended constitution of 1821, the plan of union is not now open to objection. The plan has been recognised by the presbyteries at various times, and different manners, under the old and amended constitution. It has, been acted on by them and the General Assembly in repeated instances, and is equally as obligatory as if it had received the express sanction of the presbyteries in all the forms known to the constitution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"235\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-8\">That acquiescence gives right, is a principle which we must admit. The constitutionality of the purchase and admission of Louisiana as a member of the, union, was doubted by some of the wisest heads and purest hearts in,the country, but he would be a very bold man, indeed, who would now deny that state, and Mississippi, Arkansas and Missouri, to be members of the confederation. In the memorable struggle for the admission of Missouri into the union, this objection was never taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"236\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-9\">' Nor am I satisfied with the second reason, ihat the General Association of Connecticut was invested'with'no power.to legislate in such cases, and especially to enact laws to regulate churches hot within their limits.' Although the General Assembly had the right to annul the plan of union, without the assent of the General Association of Connecticut, yet I must be permitted , to say, that after having acted on the plan, and reaped all the advantages of it, it is rather discourteous, to say the least of it, to attempt to abrogate it without the consent of the other party. Although the association may be an \u00e1dvisory body, yet it does not appear that any difficulty has been started by them, or by the churches under their control. All parties acquiesced in it for thirty-six years, and it would be too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>late for either now to object to its validity. . Nor is there any thing in the idea, that they have no' power to regulate churches not within their limits. . This is a matter of consent; and there is nothing to prevent churches in one state, from submitting . themselves to the ecclesiastical government of churches located in another state. The Presbyterian church has furnished us with repeated examples of this kind.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"237\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-6\">So far from believing the plan of union to be unconstitutional, I concur fully with one of the counsel, that confined within its legitimate, limits, it is an agreement or- regularon, which the General Assembly not only had power to make, but 'jhat it is one w\u2019hich is well calculated to promote the best interests of religion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"238\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-7\">If, as is stated, the standing committee of Congregational churches have claimed and exercised the same rights as ruling elders in presbyteries, and in the Genera] Assembly itself, it is an abuse which may be corrected by the proper tribunals; but surely that is no argument, or one of but little weight, to show that the plan of union is unconstitutional aud void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"239\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-8\">Although, in the opinion, of the Court, the assembly have the right to repeal the Plan of Union without the consent of the General Association of Connecticut, yet it was unjust to repeal it, without saving the rights of existing ministers and churches.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"240\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-9\">But whether the Plan of Union be constitutional or not, is only material so far as it is made the basis of some subsequent resolutions, to which your attention will now be directed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"241\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-10\">At the same session, and after failure of an attempt at compromise, the character of which has been the subject of much comment, the General Assembly resolved, that by the abrogation of the Plan of Union of 1801, the synod of the Western Reserve is, and is hereby declared to be, no longer a part of the Presbyterian Church.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"242\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-11\">\u201c Resolved, That in consequence of the abrogation by this General Assembly of the Plan of Union of 1801, between it and the General Association of Connecticut, as utterly unconstitutional, and therefore null and void from the beginning, the synods of Utica, Geneva, and Genessee, which were formed and attached to this body, under and in execution of said \u2018 Plan of Union,\u2019 be, and- are hereby declared to be, out of the connexion of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, and that they are not, in form or in fact, an integral portion of said church.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"243\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-12\">These resolutions refer only in name to the four synods, and if we were called on for the construction alone, it might be well doubted whether they were intended, or could be made to include, the presbyteries within their limits, the constituents or electoral bodies of the General Assembly itself. L should be inclined, for the purpose of protecting their rights from a resolution so penal in its character, to say that they were not included, neither in the spirit nor the words of the resolution. \u2022 But this construction we are prevented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number><em>from giving by their </em>declarative resolution.

In the fourth resolution it is declared, that any presbytery' within the four synods, being strictly Presbyterian in doctrine and, order, who may desire to be united with, them, are hereby directed to make application, with a full statement of their case, to the next General Assembly, which will take proper order thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"244\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-6\">There is no mistaking the character of these resolutions. It is an immediate dissolution of all connexion between the four synods and all their constituent parts, and the General Assembly. They are destructive of the rights of electors of the General Assembly. The connexion might be renewed, it is true, by each of the presbyteries making application to the next General Assembly, but they are at liberty to accept or refuse them, provided they, the General-Assembly, deem them strictly Presbyterian in doctrine and order. As they had the right to admit them, they had the right, also, to refuse them, unless in their opinion, they were strictly presbyterian in doctrine and order. ' ' ..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"245\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-7\">By these resolutions, the commissioners, who had acted with-the General Assembly up <em>to </em>that time, were deprived of <em>their seats. At </em>the same time, four synods, with twenty-eight presbyteries; were cut off from all connexion with the Presbyterian church. The General Assembly resolved, that because the plan of 1801 was unconstitutional, those synods and their constituents parts are no longer integral parts of the Presbyterian church.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"246\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-8\">You will observe, that I have already said the Plan of Union is constitutional. That reason therefore fails. They have resolved that it is not only unconstitutional, but that it is null and void, from the beginning. Instead of a, prospective, they have given their resolutions a retrospective effect, the injustice of which is most manifest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"247\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-9\">But admitting that the Plan of Union is. unconstitutional, null and void, from the beginning, I cannot perceive,, what justification that furnishes for the exscinding resolutions. The infusion of Congregationalists with the presbyteries, or the General Assembly itself, does not invalidate the acts of the General Assembly. They had a right notwithstanding the charter which recognises elders and ministers as composing the Presbyterian church, to perform the functions committed to them by the constitution. And among them to establish and divide synods to create presbyteries, as in her judgment the exigencies of the church might demand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"248\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-10\">Accordingly we find that the four synods, and all the presbyteries attached to them, have been formed since the year 1801. The assembly creates the synods, and the synods the presbyteries. Sometimes'the assembly creates the presbyteries \u2014 a cours\u00e9 pursued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>with some of the presbyteries, which have been exscinded. They have been established since, but this is no evidence that the four exscinded synods were formed and .attached to the General Assembly under, and in execution of, the Irian of Union. The compact, as has been before observed, was intended for a different purpose, and imposed on the Presbyterian church no obligation to admit churches formed on the plan as members. It was a voluntary act, and not the necessary result.of the agreement ; nor does it appear- that the presbyteries were formed and incorporated with the church on any other terms or conditions than other presbyterians, who were in regular course taken into the presbyterian connexion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"249\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-6\">But, gentlemen, when resolutions of so unusual a character, so condemnatory, and so destructive of the rights of electors, the constituents of the assembly itself, are passed, we have a right to require that the substantial forms of justice be observed. But so far from this, the General Assembly, in the plenitude of its power, has undertaken to exclude from all their rights and privileges twenty-eight presbyteries, who are its constituents, without notice, and without even the form of trial. By the resolutions, the commissioners, who had acted as members of the General Assembly for two weeks, were at once deprived of their seats. Four synods, twenty-eight presbyteries, five hundred and nine \u25a0 ministers, five hundred and - ninety-nine churches, and sixty-thousand communicants, were at once disfranchised and deprived of their privileges in this church.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"250\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-7\">This proceeding is not only contrary to the eternal principles of justice, the principles of the common law, but it is at variance with the constitution of the church.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"251\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-8\">This proceeding is not in the nature of a legislative, but it is a judicial proceeding to all intents and purposes. It is idle to deny that the presbyteries within the infected districts, as they are called, were treated as enemies and offenders, against the rules, regulations, and doctrines of the church. If there is any thing that a man values, it is his religious rights.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"252\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-9\">And of this opinion were the General Assembly themselves; for, only a few days before, they came to the following resolutions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"253\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-10\">\u201c Resolved, 1. That the proper steps be now taken to cite to the bar of the next assembly such inferior judicatories as are charged by common fame with irregularities.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"254\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-11\">\u201c 2. That a special committee be now appointed to ascertain what inferior judicatories are thus charged by common fame, prepare charges and specifications against them, and to digest a suitable plan of procedure in the matter; and that said committee be requested to report as soon as practicable.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"255\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-12\">Nothing further appears to have been done in this matter in the General Assembly, for, after failure of the. attempt at compromise, they appear to haye discovered a much more expeditious, if not a more agreeable method of effecting -their object.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"256\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>I ha,ve said that exscinding the presbyteries without notice, and without trial, was not only contrary to the common law, but it was contrary to the constitution of the church. And it is only necessary to open the book of discipline to see how very careful-the fathers of the church have been to secure to the accused a full, fair and impartial trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"257\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-6\">Notice is given to the parti\u00e9s concerned, at least ten days before the meeting of the judicatory. The accused are informed of the names of all the witnesses to be' adduced against him. When the charges are exhibited, the time, places and circumstances <em>are </em>stated, if by possibility they can be ascertained; - citations arp issued, signed by the,moderator or clerk, by order and in the name of the judicatory. \u25a0 \u2019 .\u2022_ '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"258\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-7\">Judicatories are enjoined to ascertain, before proceeding to trial, that their citations have been duly served. And, to secure a fair and impartial trial, the witnesses are to be examined in the presence ;of the accused, who is permitted to ask any question tending to his own exculpation. The judgment, when rendered, is regularly entered on the records of the judicatory.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"259\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-8\">' If these proceedings before judgment, are requisite in the case of the meanest member of the church, (the omission of which, by any of the inferior judicatories, would call down on <em>the offenders the </em>severest censure of' the General Assembly,) it is .inconceivable that similar precautions ar\u00e9 not necessary to protect the rights of presbytezies, which consist of <em>many </em>individuals, , from the injustice, violence, and party spirit of the General Assembly itself. Constitutions -az'e intezzded' to protect the weak, the minority, from the injustice of the majority. ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"260\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-9\">The majority' for the most part, were able to protect themselves. It is the minority that need protection, and for this purpose it is necessary to encircle them with at least all the <em>forms </em>of justice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"261\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-10\">This, as has been before observed, is a judicial act; and if a regular trial had been had, and judgment rendered, the sentence would have been conclusive. We should not have attempted to examine -the justice of the proceeding; but inasmuch as there have been no citations, and no trial, I instruct yo\u00fa, that the resolution of the General Assembly exscinding the four synods of Utica, Geneva, Genessee, and the Western Reserve, are <em>unconstitutional, null </em>and <em>void.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"262\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-11\">The judgments of all Courts, whether ecclesiastical or civil, whether of inferior or superior judicatories, are absolutely void, when rendered without citations, and without trial, and without the opportunity of a hearing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"263\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-12\">\u2019 But admitting this to be in the nature of a legislative proceeding, still it is void; for I deny the right of any legislature to deprive an \u00e9lector of his right to vote, either with or without trial. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"264\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-13\">This\u2019is a power which can only be exercised by a judicial tribunal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>who act under the sanction, of an oath, who examine witnesses on oath, and who conform to all the rules of evidence established .by the sages of the law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"265\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-6\">If the legislature of Pennsylvania should dare, by resolution or otherwise, to deprive one of you, gentlemen, of your right as an elector, it would be the duty of the Court to declare such an act mill and void. I am unable to distinguish the difference between the two cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"266\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-7\">Whether the General Assembly are the proper tribunal, in the first instance, for the trial of offences, or whether the presbyteries are amenable to their judicatories, in this or any other.mode, it is unnecessary to decide, as the Court are clearly of the opinion, that if they have the right, it must be exercised with the same rules and regulations which are \u00bfpplicable to the inferior judicatories.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"267\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-8\">Personal process in each case may be tedious* agitating and troublesome in the highest degree ; b.ut it is obviously not impossible. Nor does it strike me as impossible to devise- a plan under the constitution to correct heresy and schism, without resort to personal process in such case. But if it were so, this is an excuse but it is no justification of th\u00e9 exscinding resolutions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"268\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-9\">Offenders, according to the rules of the church, may be brought before a- judicatory by common fame. But I perceive no power given to convict on common fame. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"269\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-10\">You will remark, gentlemen, that the presbyteries, by the constitution of the church, are the electors of the General .Assembly. Their right of representation has been taken away without trial, without the examination (as far as we know) of a single witness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"270\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-11\">Whether these presbyteries have Congregational churches in their connexion, is not now material. It is possible that had a trial been had, that point, which is deemed so important, may have been disproved. At any rate, it would seem a singular reason for dissolving a whole presbytery, that one church was contaminated with false and heretical doctrines, or doctrine not strictly Presbyterian ; that a whole presbytery should be rejected, because a single church was governed without the benefit of ruling elders. It would be a reason, perhaps a good one, for cutting off that church from the Presbyterian connexion, but none for casting out the whole presbytery. And this gentlemen, would be particularly \u00bf severe on the members and congregations,\u2019 when the fact was known at the time the presbytery vkas created such connexion did exist.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"271\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-12\">If, however, after having condemned this (as it is called) unna-\u2019 tural connexion, the presbyteries should obstinately continue to adhere to it, then they would justly expose themselves to the severest. censures of the church. But whether there is anyniode known to the constitution, by. which the presbytery can be deprived of the right of representation on the floor of the General Assembly, is a point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>which'is not necessary to the case, and which I shail not undertake to decide. ' \u2018 \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"272\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-6\">I have been' requested by' the respondents\u2019 counsel to instruct you, that the introduction of lay delegates from Congregational establishments- into the judicatories of the \u25a0 Presbyterian church, was a violation of the fundamental principle \u2018of Presbyterianism, and a contradiction of the act of the legislature of Pennsylvania, incorporating the trustees of the church. But any act permitting such introduction would therefore have been void, although submitted to the presbyteries. As an abstract question on this point I give an affirmative answer, although, gentlemen, I am unable to. see the bearing it has on the matter at issue in this cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"273\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-7\">You have already seen that the Court is of-the opinion that the exscinding resolutions are unconstitutional, null and void; yet this ' did not of itself dissolve the General Assembly. The assembly was dissolved at the termination of its sessions. You will perceive in the course of the remarks which I shall have to make to you, that the acts of this assembly will have an important influence on the proceedings of the assembly of 1838. \u25a0 , \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"274\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-8\">The General Assembly of the' Presbyterian church is entitled to decide upon the right claimed by any one to a seat in that body, but unlike legislative bodies, their decision is the subject of revision. Ecclesiastical judicatories are subject to the control of the law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"275\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-9\">I also instruct you, that a mandamus would not reach the case, for before the remedy could be applied, the General Assembly would be dissolved, and it would be impossible to foresee whether the next assembly would persist' in their illegal and Unconstitutional course of conduct. You will recollect'that the commissioners are elected a short time before the meeting of the General Assembly, and that that body, which sits but a few weeks for the transaction of business is dissolved, and a new General Assembly is called, at the termination of the sessions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"276\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-10\">Having thus disposed of the proceedings of <em>the' </em>General Assembly of 1837, we will now proceed to the acts of 1838. It will perhaps conduce to a proper understanding of the somewhat extraordinary proceedings which then took\u2019 place, to advert to the practice of the General Assembly in times of less excitement and interest than existed on that occasion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"277\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-11\">After- the business of the assembly. is finished, the General Assembly is dissolved, and another General Assembly is directed to be chosen in the same manner, to meet at a time and place designated by the assembly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"278\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-12\">The moderator,, or. in case of his absence, another- member appointed for the purpose, opens the next meeting with a sermon; he is directed to hold the chair until a new moderator be chosen. As this is for the purpose of organization, it is not necessary that he be a member, nor. is it necessary that the clerks should b.\u00e9 members, who are requested to attend for the same purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"279\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>By the practice of the assembly, in pursuance .of a regulation for that purpose, the stated and permanent clerks are a standing committee on commissions. To them are submitted the commissions of members ; they decide on them in the first place, and if unexceptionable in form or substance, they are enrolled as members of the house; if exceptionable, they report them as such in a separate list. The moderator, after divine service, opens the session with prayer. He takes his seat as moderator, and proceeds to organize the house. The first business in order is the report of the clerks, .who are the committee on commissions, who made a report, stating on the roll those who are members, and designating either in the roll, or in a separate list, those whose commissions have been examined and found defective either in form or in substance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"280\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-6\">The next business in order is to appoint a committee on elections from the list of members who have been enrolled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"281\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-7\">To that committee are referred the commissions of such persons as may claim seats, whose commissions have been examined and rejected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"282\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-8\">It is usual to appoint the committee on elections on the morning of the first day of the session, and they, unless in case of difficulty, report to the house in the afternoon, and the house decides upon the propriety of the report. It would seem also to be the practice, that, when a commissioner has omitted to hand in his commission to the clerks, before the meeting of the .assembly, he may do so in the assembly, and the committee of commissions may add his name to the roll of members.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"283\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-9\">' After the house is organized, they proceed to the choice of a moderator, and stated and permanent clerks, to preside over their deliberations, and to keep their records during their session.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"284\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-10\">You will observe that I am speaking of the rules of practice in the sessions of 1837 and 1839.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"285\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-11\">As the church increased in numbers, and I may add without giving offence, after the spirit of contention increased also in the same or a greater ratio, the simplicity of the ancient .practice gradually changed. The changes have been stated with great clearness by one of our venerable fathers, but as we have, to do'with existing rather than ancient, rules, it is not necessary for me to notice them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"286\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-12\">The jury will recollect that the Court has decided that the exscinding resolutions of the General Assembly of 1837, were unconstitu- \u25a0 tional null and void,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"287\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-13\">It results from this opinion, that the commissioners from the presbyteries within the bounds of these synods, had the same right to seats in the General Assembly as the members from other presbyteries within the jurisdiction of the assembly, liable to be dealt with by them in the same manner as commissioners from other presbyteries.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"288\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>It was tinder these circumst\u00e1nces, they presented themselves with commissions in .proper form, to Mr. Krebs and Dr. M'Dowell, the clerks of the former assembly. , They not .only rejected their commissions, but refused to put their names on the roll at all.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"289\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-6\">I shall not now stop to inquire whether\u2019 these gentlemen were or were not,.pledged to the course they thought proper to pursue, nor into the question whether they were the judges of the constitutionality of an act of the former assembly,-as I am clearly of the opinion, and so I instruct you, that they grossly erred in refusing to place their naipes on the list of rejected applicants. They were the committee on commissions to' whom such questions are in the first place r\u00e9ferred. It, was their duty to decide on the propriety of. the application, and to refer the decision to the further action of the house, by adding their names to the roll of members whose commissions had been examined and rejected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"290\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-7\">, They cannot consider commissions, in other respects regular, as alien and outlawed, merely because they proceeded from presbyteries that had been unconstitutionally put out of the pale of the church without citation and without trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"291\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-8\">It is therefore, the opinion of the Court, that in this there was a palpable violation of the rights of the proscribed commissioners. And this, gentlemen, was the second <em>error </em>committed, and which led to the scene of disorder which ensued; \u2019 so little ' creditable to a Christian assembly,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"292\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-9\">After the moderator, Dr. Elliott, had taken the chair, Dr. Patton addressed the chair, and stated that he had certain resolutions to offer. The moderator decided that he was out of- order, that the first business was the report of the clerks, who, you will recollect, were-the committee on commissions. ' .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"293\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-10\">Dr. Patton stated that his motion or resolution ha\u00e1 reference to the formation of the roll; that it was his intention to make his motion, and have the question taken without debate. The moderator said the clerks were proceeding with their report. Dr. Patton reminded the moderator that he had the floor before the clerks. The moderator still decided that he was out of order, whereupon Dr. Patton respectfully appealed from the decision of the chair, The moderator decided that the appeal was out of order, and stated as a'reason for the decision, that there was no house .to whieh the appeal could be taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"294\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-11\">\u2022 The Court is of the opinion that\u2019 the decision of the moderator was correct, for the reason given by him. It is a rule of the assembly that- no persons shall be permitted to vote unless they are enrolled, and Until the report of the committee on commissions, it cannot be judicially known who are members of the house, and as such, privileged to take part in the organization. If, however, there was a majority for it, arising from the absence of the moderator, or the refusal of the clerks to report the roll, there would be no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>difficulty in organizing the - assembly. The decision of the moderator was correct, if the reason assigned was the true reason.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"295\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-6\">After this disposition of Dr. Patton\u2019s motion, the clerks made a report, omitting, improperly, as has been before stated, the names of the commissioners from the exscinded presbyteries, and the moderator announced to those who had riot presented their commissions, that now was the time to present them, and have themselves enrplled. Some of the witnesses say that the moderator announced that, if there were any names' <em>emitted, </em>this was the time tp present their commissions. The one side say that this was a distinct intimation from the moderator himself, that now was the time to present the commissions of the comfnissioners' from the exscinded presbyteries. The other say it included those only who had <em>not </em>presented their commissions to the clerks. ' That the only course to be pursued as to those who had pres\u00e9nted their commissions, and had their claim to' be' enrolled refused, was to have- their case referred to the committee' on-elections, on whose report only would it come properly before the assembly. .' \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"296\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-7\">However the fact may be, and this of course you will decide, at this time Dr. Mason, a member whose seat was uncontested,-and who had been reported by the clerks' to the house as a member, moved that the names of the, commissioners from the exscinded synods should be added to the roll. ' He had the commissions in his hand, and at the time of the motion, stated that they were the commissions of commissioners, which had been rejected by the clerks. The moderator inquired from what presbyteries those commissioners came. Dr. Mason replied, they came from the synods of Utica, Geneva, Genessee, and the Western Reserve. The moderator declared Dr. Mason <em>out of ord.'er, </em>or said that he was out of order at that time. The witnesses differ as to the precise expression, but whatever may have been the reason assigned, they all concur that the moderator declared Dr. Mason out of order. Dr. Mason said, that with great respect to'the chair, he must appeal from the decision. The appeal was1 seconded. The moderator refused to put the appeal, declaring the <em>appeal </em>to; be out of order:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"297\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-8\">In this stage of the caus\u00e9 it is unnecessary-to decide whether the original motion was or was not out. of. order. I shall put this part of the case on the refusal of the moderator to put the question on the appeal. The question is not whether an appeal may not be out of order, but it is whether this appeal was out of order. If the moderator had put the question _on the appeal; it is possible the house, would have decided that the original motion was' out of order. They might' have thought that the matter was properly referable to the committee of elections; that it was a privileged question; or the assembly might by possibility have taken a different view of the question. And whatever they might have thought and decided, would have been conclusive. . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"298\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>But by refusing to . put the question, the' moderator took all power to himself over this question. No reason was given by the moderator. It rested simply upon <em>his will. </em>In the opinion of the Court, it was a dereliction of duty \u2014 a usurpation of authority, which called for the censure of the house. He could not then allege, as he had done on a former occasion, that .there was no house to which the appeal could be taken. At that time, you will recollect, that the clerks had made their report, and it-was then ascertained what members had a right to vote.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"299\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-6\">Had the question on the appeal been allowed, it could then have been-ascertained whether a motion had been made for the appointment of the committee on elections. As it is, it is doubtful whether the motion was m\u00e1de before or after the motion made by Dr. Mason.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"300\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-7\">And here, let me remark, that, I look upon the refusal of the clerks to put the names of the. commisi'oners on the roll, and this refusal of the .moderator to put the question on the appeal to the house as most unfortunate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"301\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-8\">If the excitement did not <em>then </em>commence, yet it, with the uproar and confusion which ensued, from this time' greatly increased. After the refusal of the moderator to allow an appeal, the Rev. Miles Squier arose and said, that <em>he </em>had presented his commission to the clerks, which they had refused to receive. \u25a0 The moderator asked from what presbytery <em>he </em>came. Pie said from the presbytery of Geneva. The moderator asked if it was within the bounds of the synod of Geneva. He said it was. The moderator then replied, <em>toe do not know you. </em>The precise meaning and import of these words has been the subject of comment. It will be for you t\u00f3 give them such weight as you think them entitled to, in another part of this cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"302\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-9\">And here, let me remark, that the witness had not a right, (whatever injustice he may have suffered,) either to -speak or vote on any question before the house.

The motion being seconded, the question was put,by Mr. Cleaveland, and was carried, as the witnesses for the relators say, by a large majority, and by this they mean that a large majority of voices' voted in the affirmative. The question was reversed, and, as the same witnesses say, there were some voices coming from the south-west corner of the church, who voted in the negative. This is denied by the respondents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"316\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-15\">Dr. Beman, wno was sitting in a pew the locality of which has been described to you, stept into the aisle, and called the house to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>order. A motion was then made that' Dr. Mason and Mr. Gilbert be appointed clerks.

There, was no negative votes on this nomination ; several of the witnesses say he was unanimously elected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"318\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-7\">Dr, Beman then announced the election of Dr. Fisher, as moderator, and said he should govern himself by the rules which might be hereafter adopted. ...</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"319\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-8\">' Dr. Fisher stepped into the aisle, moved towards the north end of the church, and called for business; and Dr. Mason and Mr. Gilbert were chosen clerks, no others being put in nomination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"320\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-9\">'Dr. Beman stated that some difficulties had been made by the trustees about the occupation of the church in which they were then sitting. To avoid difficulty, a motion was made to .adjourn to meet forthwith at the lecture room at the First Presbyterian church. The question was taken on the motion, and was decided in the affirmative, there being no votes in the negative. The result of the vote ' was announced' by Dr. Fisher, who then stated if there were any \u25a0commissioners who h.ad not presented their commissions, they might then and there attend for .that purpose. The members of the house then repaired to the lecture-room of the First Presbyterian church, proceeded with their business, and on the 24th of May, 18.38, elected the relators trustees, in the place and stead of the respondents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"321\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-10\">.This is the relators\u2019 case, and here I will direct your attention to some of the points which have been raised by the respondents\u2019 counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"322\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-11\">The respondents contend that Mr. Cleaveland had no right to put the question. They object, also, to the time and manner of putting the question. Under one or other of these points, I will endeavour to include the question which hasb\u00e9en raised, and which has been argued with such force and with such a variety of illustrations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"323\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-12\">Had Mr. Cleaveland a right to put this question <em>1 </em>It must be conceded, that unless he was authorized to take the sense of the house, the members Were not bound to vote against it. In ordinary cases, it is, usual for a member who moves a question, to put it in writing, and deliver it to the speaker, .who, when it has'been Seconded, proposes it to the house, and the house are then said to be in possession of the question. But this, the relators say, is not an <em>ordinary </em>question, but one of a peculiar nature. They allege, that the moderator has shown gross partiality and injustice in the chair; that he was engaged in a plan or scheme to carry out, the unconstitutional and void act of 1837,' which deprived certain commissioners of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>seats; that this authorized the house to displace him, and to elect another to discharge the duties which he failed or was unwilling to perform. If this were so, of which you are the judges, Mr. Cleave-land had a right to take the sense of the house on the propriety of the moderator\u2019s conduct. It would be worse than useless to require him to put the question on his own deposition, for this the house were authorized to believe he would refuse to perform, as he had failed in the performance of his duty before. The law compels no person to do a vain or nugatory thing. The law maxim is, \u201c <em>Lex neminem cogit a'd vana, sen impossibilia.\u201d </em>Nor, gentlemen, was it necessary that it should be taken by clerks, if they, as well as the moderator, were engaged in the same plan, to deprive members of seats, to which they were justly and constitutionally entitled. It is the opinion of the Court, that a member, although not an officer, is entitled to put a question to the house under such circumstances.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"324\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-6\">The motion which Mr. Cleavel'and made, after explaining his object, was either that Dr. Beman be moderator, or that Dr. Beman be called to the chair. It is of no consequence in which form the motion was made. They are substantially the same.. The motion amounted to this: that Dr. Elliott, who occupied the chair, should be deposed, and that Dr. Beman should be elected chairman and moderator in his stead. It was a pertinent question, easily understood, and not calculated to mislead the dullest member of the assembly. It was in proper form, and in proper time, for, gentlemen, it was not necessary to precede it by a motion that the house should now proceed to the choice of a moderator. . All these requisites are substantially comprised in the motion which was made. There was nothing in the question, or in the manner of putting, which was disorderly, or which might have led to. disorder. Mr. Cleaveland put the question to the house, which under certain circumstances, of which I have already said you are the judges, he had a right to do. In the course of his remarks, he turned himself partly round from the moderator, but this, so far as any point of law is involved, is of no sort of consequence. It is also contended by the respondents, that- the claim of members to seats, according to the standing order of the house, was referable .to the committee on elections, and further that the house cannot enter into business until the organization is complete. The latter point the Court answers in the negative. There is no doubt the house may elect a moderator, although the seats of some of the members are contested. In general, they would prefer to await the report of the committee on elections; but this would be a matter of discretion. The right to seats would be as well, if not better decided, after the house was organized by the election of a moderator, as when it was in its inchoate or incipient state. Such am objection would not vitiate the organization, whatever cause there might be on the part of those who had been deprived of seats, to complain of the precipitation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>the assembly in proceeding to business, particularly if done with a view of preventing them from partaking in the business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"325\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-6\">In deciding on the first point, and others which have been raised by the respondents, it is necessary to advert to the nature of the questions themselves. . \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"326\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-7\">- Dr. Mason moved that the names of certain members who had been unconstitutionally and unjustly deprived of seats in'the assembly, should be added to the roll. The motion of Mr. Cleaveland, and the subsequent resolutions or motions, were the consequences of the decision of the moderator, that Dr. Mason\u2019s motion was out of order, and the refusal of the moderator to allow an appeal to the house. The right of members was unjustly invaded, and from this moment it became a question of privilege, which over-rides all other questions whatever. A question of privilege is always in order, to which privileged. questions, such as the appointment of-a committee of elections, must give way. The cry, therefore, of \u201c order,\u201d from the moderator, or from any member whatever, under such circumstances, would be disorderly. Two inconsistent rights cannot exist at the sam\u00e9 time; and it is obvious that if a member, or the moderator may put a stop to a proceeding which involves in it the conduct of the moderator himself, in the discharge of his high functions, and a question of privilege, by the cry of-order, it would be an easy and effectual mode of destroying the rights of members in any deliberative assembly. It is usual, when it is intended to prevent a member from proceeding with a motion, to rise to order, and a requisition is then made by the moderator that the member take his seat. It is the opinion of the Court, that Dr. Mason had the right to make his motion before the appointment of the committee on elections. Indeed, I know of no other mode of getting this question before the committee pn elections, except by bringing - it before the house, who ' might either decide it for themselves,' of, if they thought proper, refer it to .that committee, in whose report it would again come before the house.. On this point, I wish you distinctly to understand, that it is the opinion of the Court, and that I so instruct you, that if you believe that the conduct of the moderator and the clerks was the result of a preconcerted plan with a portion of the members, to carry out the unconstitutional and void act of 1837, which deprived the members from certain presbyteries of seats in the assembly, then, in this particular, the requisitions of the law have been substantially complied with.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"327\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-9\">That the fact that Mr, Cleaveland put the question instead of the . moderator, the cries' of order when this was in progress, the omission of some of the formula usually observed when there is no contest \u25a0 and no excitement, such as standing in the aisle, instead of taking the chair occupied by the moderator, not using the usual insignia of office, putting the question in an unusual place, and the short time consumed in the organization of the house, and three or more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>members standing at the same time, will not vitiate the organization, if you should be of the opinion that this became necessary from the illegal and improper conduct of the adverse p\u00e1rty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"328\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-6\">It is a singular point, gentlemen, that this part of the respondents\u2019 case rests upon standing rules which were not then in existence. You will recollect, that each assembly'adopted its own rules; indeed, both the relators and respondents have appealed to these rules. I will remark, that the roll of members reported by Mr. Krebs and Mr. M\u2018Dowell, was the rell of the house. As such, it was virtually in the possession of the clerks afterwards chosen, provided they were regularly and duly elected. It is the opinion of \u25a0 the Court, that the existence of a house competent to perform all the functions of a General Assembly, does not depend on the observance or non-observance of the standing order of the house. You, however, must take this Opinion with the qualification, that you believe that the house had been substantially organized for the transaction of business; that you should believe that the deviation from the accustomed course was the necessary result of &gt; a preconcerted plan unconstitutionally to exclude the members from'the exscinded presbyteries from their seats in the assembly. \u25a0 And here, gentlemen, let me request your particular attention to' the point in issue. The relators say that they are trustees regularly appointed by the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church. In other words, they affirm that the house which assembled in the 'lecture room of the First Presbyterian Church was the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church. This is an affirmative proposition, which the relators are bound to support.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"329\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-7\">The question is not which is the General Assembly, but whether they are the General Assembly, and as such had a right to elect the relators trustees. This allegation the relators^must- sustain to your satisfaction, otherwise your verdict must be in*favour of the respondents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"330\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-8\">. The respondents strenuously deny that the portion of brethren who assembled in the First Presbyterian church, are the General Assembly. On this point, both parties, the relators and respondents, have put themselves upon the country \u2014 and you, gentlemen, are that country.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"331\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-9\">- Let me now briefly call your attention to the relators\u2019 case. The moderator, Dr. Elliott, proceeded to organize the house. The clerks, Mr. Krebs and Dr. M\u2018Dowell, reported to the house the roll of members, omitting those who were not entitled to seats'. Dr. Patton offered a resolution on the formation of the roll. This motion was declared by the moderator to be out of order, also his appeal was declared to be out of order. Dr. Mason then moved that the names of the members from the presbyteries within the exscinded synods should be added to the roll. ' This motion was declared by the rnoderator to be- out of order. An appeal from that decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>was demanded, which was also declared to be out of order. On motion of Mr. Cleaveland, the former moderator was deposed for sufficient cause, and Dr. Beman was elected moderator, and Mr. Gilbert and Dr. Mason were elected clerks. After organization, Dr;- Fisher was elected moderator, and Mr. Gilbert and Dr. Mason elected clerks for the assembly. The assembly being thus organized by the appointment of officers, adjourned to meet forthwith at the lectur'e room of the First Presbyterian church, and accordingly met in pursuance of the adjournment, and on the 24th of May, 1838, in due form, elected the relators trustees. This, .gentlemen, is a summary of the plaintiffs\u2019 case; and if the facts are \u00e1s stated, your verdict should be rendered in favour of the relators.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"332\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-6\">The respondents deny that the portion of brethren who \u00e1ssembled in the First Presbyterian church are the General Assembly,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"333\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-7\">Their objections, in addition to the points which have been already stated, is, that ther\u00e9 .was not a full and free expression of the opinion of the house. \u25a0 \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"334\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-8\">They allege that \u25a0 the various \u2019 motions for the \u25a0 appointment of moderator and clerks, and for the adjournment, were not carried by a majority of the house. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"335\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-9\">It is hardly necessary to observe that spectators had. no right to vote, nor had members not enrolled by the clerks, although entitled to seats,.a right to vote. But notwithstanding this, it is the \u2018opinion of the Court, that if, after 'deducting those who voted and were not entitled to vote, there was a clear majority in favour of the several motions, this irregularity, or, if you please, something worse, would not vitiate .the organization. The presumption is, that none but qualified\"persons voted; but there is proof that some.vote.d who were not enrolled,,yet this of itself will not destroy the respondents\u2019 right' of action. You, gentlemen, will, in the first place, inquire whether there was a majority of affirmative voices of members entitled to vote. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"336\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-10\">If there was not, there is an end of the question, and your verdict must be in favour of the respondents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"337\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-11\">But if there was a majority, you will further inquire-whether the question on the several motions was reversed. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"338\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-12\">If they were not reversed, your verdict must be in favour of the respondents; for.in that case it is very clear the members had\" no opportunity of showing their dissent to several motions or propositions which wei\u2019e submitted to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"339\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-13\">These, gentlemen, are questions of fact for your decision. I will content myself with referring to the evidence and arguments of the counsel, and at the same time observing to you that it is your duty to reconcile the testimony of your.case, and with one other observation, that affirmative testimony is more to be relied on than negative testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"340\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-14\">And here, gentlemen, I wish you distinctly to understand, that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>is the majority of those who were entitled to vote, and who actually voted, that is to be counted on the various questions which were submitted to the house. I wish you also, to-understand that it is the majority of members that had been enrolled .that must determine this question. When 'there is a quorum of members present, the moderator can only notice those -who actually vote, and not those who do not choose to exercise their privilege of voting, \u2018\u2018f Whenever,\u201d says Lord Mansfield, \u201c electors are present and don\u2019t vote at all, they virtually acquiesce in the decision of those who do.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"341\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-6\">And with this principle agrees one of the rules of .the General Assembly itself, which must be familiar to every member:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"342\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-7\">\u201c Members (30th rule) ought not, without weighty reasons, to decline voting, as this practice might leave the \u00a1decision of very ihteresting questions to a small proportion of the judicatory. Silent members; unless excused from voting, must be cohsidei\u2019ed as acquiescing with the majority.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"343\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-8\">This is not only the doctrine of the common law, of the written - law, as you have seen, but it is the doctrine of common sense, for without the benefit of this rule, it would be almost impossible, certainly very inconvenient, to transact business in a large deliberative assembly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"344\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-9\">Of this rule, gentlemen, we have had very lately, a most memor rabie .instance. The fundamental principl\u00e9s \u00f3f your government have been altered; a new constitution has been established by a plurality of votes; forty thousand'electors, who deposited their votes for one or the other of-the candidates for governor, did not cast them at all on that most interesting and important of all questions. But notwithstanding this, the amended constitution has been. proclaimed by your executive, and recognised by your legislature, and by the people, as the supreme law'of the land. This, gentlemen, has been stigmatised as a technical rule of law, a fiction and intendment in law.' It is sufficient for us, gentlemen, that it is a rule of law. We must not be wiser than the law; for if we attempt this, we endanger every thing we hold dear \u2014 our life, our liberty, our property..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"345\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-10\">Nor, gentlemen; can we know any thing of any fancied equity as contradistinguished from the law. . The. law is the \u2019\u2022 equity of the case, and it must be so considered under the most awful responsibility, by this Court, and this jury. In my opinion, \u00e1 Court and jury can never be better employed than when th\u00e9y are vindicating the safe and salutary principles of the common law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"346\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-11\">But the respondents further object that the design of the new school brethren was not to organize a General Assembly according to the forms prescribed by the. constitution, but that .they intended and it was so understood by them, to effect an ex-parte organization, with a view to a peaceable separation of the church. If this was the intention, and was so understood at the time, the house which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>assembled in the First Presbyterian church, cannot be recognized as the General Assembly, competent to appoint trustees under the charter. Having chosen voluntarily to leave the church, they can no longer be permitted to participate in its advantages and privileges. If a member, or a number of individuals, choose to abandon their church, they must at the same time be content to relinquish all its benefits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"347\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-6\">But this is a question of fact, which you must decide. In this part of the case, the burthen of proof is thrown upon the respondents. They must satisfy you that such was the intention of the new school party in organizing the house and adjourning to the First Presbyterian church. But granting that the motion .of Mr. Cleaveland was in order, that Drs. Beman and Fisher, and the clerks, had a majority of votes, that the intention wras to organize the General Assembly, and,that they did not intend an ex-parte,organization, the respondents say that such, was the precipitation and haste of these proceedings, their extraordinary and novel character, the noise, tumult and confusion, that they and the other members of the house had no opportunity of hearing and voting, if they had wished to do so, and that therefore this is an attempt at organization, which is null and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"348\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-7\">It is very certain that if individual members of a deliberative assembly, by trick or artifice, by surprise, noise,. tumult, and confusion, carry such' a' question as this, it ought not, it cannot be. regarded. The members must have an opportunity to debate, to vote, if they desire it, and for this reason it is that the negative question must be put, and \u25a0 that the \u25a0 several questions must be reversed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"349\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-8\">It will be for you to say whether the members had this opportunity. To this part of the case I request your particular attention.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"350\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-9\">If you believe that the several motions were made and reversed, that they were carried by a majority of affirmative voices, whatever may be your opinion of the relative strength of the two parties in the assembly, your verdict must be for the relators. I hold it to be a most clear proposition, that silent members acquiesce in the decision of the majority. It is of no sort of consequence for what reason they were silent; whether from a previous.determination or otherwise. The effect is the same, provided they had an opportunity of hearing and voting' on the question. It is1 not necessary that all should hear or vote.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"351\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-10\">\u25a0 If persons who are members of an assembly, by surprise, by noise or violence, carry such a question \u2014 such a vote cannot be considered as the deliberate sense of the assembly; but when members are aware of the nature of the proceedings and choose to treat them with conterfipt, or to interrupt the business themselves, by stamping, noise, talking, cries of order, or shame 1 shame! or requesting silence with a view to interruption, orattendingto other business, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>they ought tobe attending to this, they cannot be permitted afterwards to allege that they had no opportunity to vote. They cannot take advantage of their own wrong or their own folly. In such a case, their silence, or if you choose, noise, shall be viewed as,an acquiescence in the vote of the majority. But when members are prevented from hearing and understanding the question by the noise and confusion, or by the indecent haste with which the business is conducted, the organization is not such as can give it any legal validity. It is of no consequence whether .the members are prevented from voting understandingly on the question by the persons engaged in conducting the business, or by the spectators. ' But when it comes from the members of the other party, they shall not be permitted to object, when they themselves are,the causes, of the difficulty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"352\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-6\">If the facts be so, they (the members'of the old school) did not hear, because they would not vote. They caused the disorder, and let them reap the bitter fruits of their injustice. The Court, .and you gentlemen of the jury, have nothing to do with consequences, with fancied majorities and -minorities, but with majorities legally ascertained. We are placed at this bar under an awful responsibility to do justice without regard to the numerical strength of the contending parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"353\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-7\">If you, gentlemen, believe that the questions were not reversed, that they were not carried, that the members of the assembly had not an opportunity of hearing and voting upon them, your verdict should be in favour of the respondents. But if, on the other hand, you believe they intended to organize the assembly; that the questions were severally put; that the noise, tumult and confusion'which prevailed in the assembly, were the result of a preconcerted plan, or combination, or conspiracy between the clerks, the moderator, and the m\u00e9mbers of the old school party, to sustain the unconstitu- \u25a0 tional and void resolutions of 1837, which deprived members of seats to which they were justly entitled, your verdict should be in favour of the relators.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"354\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-8\">And here I do not wish to be understood as having expressed, or even intimated an opinion as to the facts of the case.

The plan has been recognized by the presbyteries at various times, and in different manners, under their old and amended. constitution*.

In charging the jury in regard to the fourth resolution, which provides the method by which churches, ministers and presbyteries within the disowned synods, who are strictly Presbyterian in doctrine and order, may continue their connexion with the General Assembly, and the Presbyterian church, inasmuch as he represents, that it only provides for the presbyteries, and omits the provisions in favour of churches and ministers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"381\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-11\">24.

In charging the jury that to effect the objects proposed by the disowning resolution of 1837, it was necessary that citations should have issued, to the presbyteries within the bounds of these synods; and that all the other judicial process prescribed in the book of discipline, should have been resorted to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"385\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-8\">28. In charging the jury that the disowning of these synods was depriving electors of their right to vote; and in declaring that it was not distinguishable from an attempt by the legislature of Pennsylvania, by resolution, or otherwise, to deprive one of the jurors of his right as an elector. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"386\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-10\">29. In charging the jury, that \u201c The presbyteries, by the constitution of the church, are the electors of the General Assembly; their right has been taken away without trial, and, so far as we know, without the examination of a single witness.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"387\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-11\">30. In charging the jury, that it is now immaterial whether the presbyteries in the disowned synods have Congregational churches in their connexion, or not; and that it was possible, if a trial had been had, th\u00e1t fact might have been disproved; \u201c at 'any rate, it would be a singular reason for ejecting a whole presbytery, because a single church was governed without the benefit of ruling elders.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"388\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-12\">31. In charging the jury, that .although he was of opinion that the introduction of lay delegates from. Congregational establishments, into the judicatories of the Presbyterian Church, was a violation of the fundamental principles of Presbyterianism, and in contradiction to the act of the legislature of Pennsylvania incorporating the trustees of the church; and that any .act permitting such introduction, would be void, although submitted to -the presbyteries; yet he was unable to see the bearing of this proposition on the matter in issue in this cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"389\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-13\">32. In charging the jury, that although the General Assembly is' entitled to decide on the right claimed by any one to a seat in that body; yet that, unlike legislative bodies, their decision is the subject of revision; and that ecclesiastical judicatories are subject to the control of the law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"390\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-14\">33. In charging the jury, that a mandamus would'not reach this case; for, before the remedy could be applied, the General Assembly would be dissolved, and it would be impossible to foresee whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>the next assembly would persist in their illegal and unconstitutional course of conduct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"391\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-6\">34.

In charging the jury, \u201c That the committee of commissions grossly erred in refusing to put the names \u00f3f the commissioners from the four synods, on .the list of rejected applications. It was their duty to decide on the propriety of the application, and to refer the decision to the further action of the house* by adding their names to the roll of members whose commissions had been examined and rejected.\u201d \u201c It is, therefore, the opinion of the Court, that in this there was a palpable violation of th\u00e9 rights of the proscribed commissioners.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"393\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-8\">36.

In charging the jury, \u201c that Dr. Elliott\u2019s declining to put Dr. Mason\u2019s appeal, was a dereliction of duty \u2014 a. usurpation of authority, which call\u00e9d for the censure of the house; that he could not then allege, that there was no house to which the appeal could be taken.

In charging the jury, \u201c that the house was not restricted in their choice of a moderator, to a moderator of a former year who may be- present; that rule applies only to ordinary cases, when the moderator of the last year is not in attendance, or is unable, from some physical reason, to discharge the duties of the office. It does not apply in the peculiar and extraordinary circumstances of this case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"399\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>42.

It w.as in a-proper form and in a proper time: for, gentlemen, it was not necessary, to precede it by a motion, that the house should, now proceed in the choice of a moderator. All things requisite are substantially comprised in the motion which was made.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"400\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-6\">43. In charging the jury, <em>\u201c </em>that the refusal of the moderator to put the appeal was a breach of privilege, in which not only Dr. Mason but the whole house was interested-; they might have proceeded against him for a breach of privilege, or they might depose him on the ground of partiality and injustice.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"401\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-7\">44. In charging the jury, \u201c there was nothing in the question- or in the manner of putting it which was disorderly, or which ought to have led .to disorder.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"402\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-8\">45. In charging the jury, that the motion of Mr. Cle\u00e1veland, and the subsequent resolutions or. motions, were the consequence of the decision of the moderator, that -Dr. Mason\u2019s motion was out of order, and refusal of the moderator to allow an appeal to the house. The right of members was unjustly invaded, and' from this moment it became a question of privilege, which over-rides all questions whatever. A question of privilege is always in order, to which privilege, questions such' as the appointment of a committee of elections, might give tvay, The cry, therefore of \u2018 order\u2019 from the moderator or from any member whatever, under such circumstances would be.disorderly.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"403\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-9\">In charging the jury, that \u201c Dr. Mason had the right to make his motion before the appointment of the committee of elections. Indeed, I know of no other mode of getting this question before the committee of elections, except by bringing it before' the house, who might either decide it themselves, or if they thought proper, refer it to that committee, on whose report it would again come before the house.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"404\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-10\">47. In charging the jury, \u201c that, the fact that Mr. Cleaveland put the question, instead of the moderator; the cries of \u2018 order\u2019 when this was in progress, the omission of some of the formalities usually observed when there is no contest, and no excitement; such as standing in the aisle, instead of taking the chair occupied by the moderator; not using the usual insignia of. office, &amp;c.; putting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>question from an unusual place; and the short space of time which was consumed in the organization of the house; and three or more members standing at the same time; would not vitiate the organization, if you should be of opinion, that this beeame necessary, from the illegal and improper conduct of the adverse party.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"405\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-6\">48. In charging the jury,\u201c that this.part of the respondent\u2019s case, rests upon standing rules that were not then in existence. You will recollect that each-assembly adopts its own rules.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"406\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-7\">49. In charging the jury, \u201c that the roll of members reported by Mr. Krebs, and Dr. M'Dowell, was the roll of the house. As such, it was virtually in the possession of the clerks .afterwards chosen, provided they were regularly and duly elected.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"407\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-8\">50. In charging the jury, \u201c that the existence of a house competent to perform all the functions of the General Assembly, does not depend on the observance or non-observance, of the standing orders of the house. You must take this opinion with qualifications,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"408\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-9\">51.

In charging the jury that the proceedings. of the General Assembly, of 1837, had a'bearing or operation on the General Assembly\" of 1838, or that a design, by any portion of. the members of the Assembly of 1838, to carry into effect the acts of the assembly of 1837, could have any effect upon the organization of 1838, or confer rights upon any person- whatever to violate or set aside rules of order. . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"410\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-12\">53.

His honor, the judge, erred in not putting the .position-of the defendants, in regard to the design of the \u201c new school party,\u201d fully to'the jury. The defend\u00e1nts contended,. among other things, that the \u201c new school party,\u201d designed to form an organization, in despite of and against the will of the majority, however expressed; and that Mr. Cleaveland\u2019s motion was not addressed to them, and had they voted .negatively on the same, their votes would not have been regarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"414\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-16\">57.

The judge erred in omitting to give due effect (in the proceedings of 1838,) to the fact that the members did not understand, and could not hear the propositions, which are said to have been submitted to them; and in pronouncing the call to order by individuals of the \u2018 old school party\u2019 itself, out of order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"419\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-10\">4. The evidence was clear positive and unquestionable, that no opportunity was given to the\" members who attended in 1838, to debate the propositions that are said to have been introduced; yet the judge withdrew the attention of the jury from the true point, which was, that there being no opportunity for debate whether the proceedings were thereby vitiated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"420\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-11\">5. The judge omitted to charge,,, that in a scene of tumult and disorder, suchas was admitted on all sides to exist, there was necessarily a suspension of effectual measures, and that any thing which ocurred at such a juncture was without operation or effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"421\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-12\">6. The judge charged, that if the organization of the \u2018 new school porty\u2019 was intended to be exparte, with a view to a separation, the General Assembly so organized, could not be recognized, &amp;c.; yet he refused to permit evidence to be given by the defendants of the circumstances that attended that organization, and of the intention of the \u2018new school\u2019 party, as manifested by their preliminary acts and declarations. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"422\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-14\">7. The judge erred in declaring, that if the members had an opportunity of hearing and voting, the majority of those entitled to vote, and who actually voted, is to be counted; and that it is of no sort of consequence, for what reason the silent members are silent. Whereas, the silence m\u00e1y have proceeded from an inability to know what were the measures proposed, and that inability produced by the precipitaixcy and disorder of the \u2018 new school\u2019 party ; and the omission to vot\u00e9 might have proceeded from the calls to \u2018 ox-der\u2019 on the part of a presiding officer yet occupying the chaii\u2019.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"423\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-15\">8. The burthen of proof rented on the party objecting to the resolutions of 1837, to show the invalidity of these resolutions; every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>fair presumption being in their favour; yet no proof whatever was given, of the facts alleged in the protest of the \u2018 new school\u2019 party, as sufficient to impair the resolutions.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"424\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b592-6\">Mr. <em>F.

Because it materially modified the constitution of the Presbyterian church, by introducing unordained lay delegates into the' presbyteries. Because it deprived Presbyterians of the right of-appeal from the decisions of. the presbyteries. Because it gave individuals who were not Presbyterians, a <em>status </em>in the Presbyterian .church. These modifications were not submitted to the presbyteries, who alone can change the constitution in its alterable parts. But these alterations were inadmissible, even with the sanction of the presbyteries, as the provisions are part of the tenets of the church, and deepied ofapostolical origin. Besides, the act of the legislature of Pennsylvania incorporated a <em>Presbyterian </em>church ; it will, therefore, admit of no changes which destroy the Presbyterial character of the church.</p>\n<p data-order=\"426\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-8\">2d.

The acts called the exscinding acts, were merely acts of dissolution. The General Assembly having the power to create synods and presbyteries, have likewise power to dissolve or destroy them,- by an implication as', cogent as that which attaches the power of removal to the power of appointing. The. power to create synods is express'; that of creating presbyteries is evidenced by long exercise. ' If these acts were within the scope of any of the powers of the General Assembly, this Court cannot inquire into the propriety, of its exercise. This principle extends <em>to the'' </em>legislation, and the judicial acts of all associations, while they confine themselves to the exercise .of the powers given by their compact. This principle applies with the greater intensity to ecclesiastical, associations which are protected from interference by the 3d section of the bill of rights. (MS. Case of the Rev. <em>Francis Hindman, </em>Supreme Court of Delaware, 1812.) <em>Black and Whitesmith\u2019s Society </em>v. <em>Vandyke, </em>(2 <em>Wharton, </em>p. 309.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"428\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-10\">4th. Those exscinding acts were just, proper and expedient. The synods in question were composed in a great measure of. congregational churches, i. e. churches not governed by ruling elders, as we offered to prove, and our testimony being rejected, have a right to assume and take for granted. The faith and constitution of the church required that they should be eradicated. It could not be done by judicial process, because Congregationalism had been sanctioned by the General Assembly itself in the plan of union. It was therefore no offence which could be the subject of judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>action. Neither synods nor presbyteries, which are mere incorporeal existencies, could be made the subject of judicial action or punishment. The only mode by which the Congregationalism in these synods, so intimately blended with presbyterianism, could be expurged, was by dissolving the .synods, and receiving the several' portions into some other, synod. This was amply provided for by the resolutions in question. \u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"429\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-6\">5th. The proceedings of the' new school party in 1838, were a mere disorder or secession, even if we should concede the exscinding acts to bo illegal, for it is manifest that it was only intended as a minority organization; and the calling it an organization of the whole, is an after-thought, a mere quibble upon that rule of order which counts silence as an affirmative vote.</p>\n<p data-order=\"430\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-7\">6th. Mr. Cleaveland\u2019s motion was not justified by any outrage of the rights of the minority, by the moderator and clerks. The clerks, acting as a committee of commissions, exercised a legitimate power in deciding against the commissions from the exscinded synods. Mr. Patton\u2019s motion was properly rejected, the roll not having been reported; and therefore there were,- constitutionally, no members whom the moderator could recognize. Dr. Mason\u2019s motion and appeal were properly rejected, because the roll was not then completed and who were entitled to vot\u00e9 ascertained, and the moderator was calling the commissioners who had not had an opportunity of presenting themselves for enrolment, to come forward for that'purpose. The motion was beside irregular, because the first business to be transacted by the house, according to the standing rules of 1826, was the appointment of a committee of elections.</p>\n<p data-order=\"431\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-8\">7th. The proceeding of Mr. Cleaveland, was, in every respect, disorderly. It was out of time; the first, business being the appointment of a committee of elections. His motion w'as not addressed to the moderator. It was not pat to the house' by the moderator. It proposed the election of a provisional moderator, while Dr.' Elliott remained in the chair unremoved. 'Our adversaries attempt to justify these irregularities by assuming that the refusal of Dr. Mason\u2019s appeal was a breach of privilege, and that questions of privilege over-ride all rules of order, and that Mr. Cleaveland\u2019s motion was a punitory proceeding to redress the wrong.' Unhappily for this argument, besides its other infirmities, Mr. Cleaveland\u2019s motion did not profess to relate to Dr. Mason\u2019s motion, but claimed to be the commencement of a new organization.</p>\n<p data-order=\"432\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-9\">8th. Mr. Cleaveland\u2019s motion was fundamentally wrong on other grounds. Dr. Elliott being the moderator of the preceding session, and the constitutional organ to preside until a new, permanent moderator was elected, held his office independently of the inorganic body over which he presided. But even if capable of removal, the constitution and bv-laws pointed out the last preceding moderator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>present as his s.uccesor. It is in proof that three moderators were present, who had held the office more recently than Dr. Beman.</p>\n<p data-order=\"433\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-6\">9th. Our adversaries attempt to justify the putting of the question by Mr. Cleaveland, because it touched the removal of the moderator, and it would be incongruous for him to put the question himself. In case of the in'capacity of the moderator, all parliamentary practice, and the practice of this.very body, designate the clerk as the proper individual to put the question; <em>Minutes of General Assembly of </em>1835. 2 <em>Hatsell, </em>113. 6 <em>Gray, </em>406, 448. 2 <em>Eatsell, </em>211, 212. <em>Sutherland, </em>71, 72. <em>Jefferson, </em>104.</p>\n<p data-order=\"434\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-7\">10th. Although confessedly but a minority voted on Mr. Clea veland\u2019s motion, yet our adversaries make it a majority by <em>counting the </em>dissentients as silent votes. In order successfully to invoke this principle, .they must show that the question was put'at the proper time and by the proper person; also that it was perfectly intelligible, and pronounced. so loudly, as -to be heard, and so .deliberately as to be \u2022understood. Mr. Cleaveland\u2019s motion was the contrary of all this, \u2014 it' was low, it was rapid ; above all, it was .deceptive in its terms, if it were meant lor what ibis now asserted to be. In its terms it proposed a new- organization; the party had previously in the ircaucus, resolved oh a new minority' organization, and no commissioner present at the organization, could have dreamed'of any other conclusion. Had the majority not been deceived, they could have voted down the' motion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"435\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-8\">1-lth. The .propriety and necessity of these exscinding acts, is particularly apparent from the abuses which have been practised under the pretence of the plan of union. In the synod of the Western Reserve, as was admitted on the floor of the General Assembly, out of the one hundred and' thirty-nine churches composing that synod, there are one hundred and nine which are Congregational, and yet in the statistical reports made to the General Assembly, from the presbyteries composing that synod, they are all, illusively, represented to be Presbyterian churches. So, also,' in the reports from the presbyteries in, the other synods, in question, churches proved to be congregational, are represented to be Presbyterian. This abuse, though emanating from the plan of union, cannot be justified upon that plan; nor these illusory reports upon the common principles of morals.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"436\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b594-9\">.- Mr. <em>Meredith </em>and Mr. <em>Randall, </em>(with -whom was Mr. <em>Wood, </em>of New York,) for the relators, showed cause against the rule., \u25a0 They <em>-argued </em>\u2014 <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"437\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-10\">1. That the plan of union between the General Association of Connecticut, and the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States . of America, was constitutional. It had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>existed previous to the Revolution, had been suspended during the war, and again, at the invitation of the General Assembly, proposed immediately on the passage of the law incorporating that body. Similar arrangements had been proposed or entered into by the General Assembly with the Associations of Vermont, Massachusetts, New I-Iampshire, the Dutch Reformed Church, and the. Associate Reformed Church.</p>\n<p data-order=\"438\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-6\">2. That the objection that the plan'of union should be sent down to the presbyteries for. approval, was of no avail. The provision in the constitution which requires amendments to be sent down to the presbyteries, relates to general regulations and not to the admission of an individual or a body of individuals into the .church. That the practice of the General Assembly had been uniform on this subject in all instances. Resolutions admitting delegates from corresponding bodies to sit and vote, had been adopted and repealed without sending them down to the presbyteries. The regulations admitting ordained ministers and eiders from other protestant-churches, without reordinationj had been adopted in the same manner, although the General Assembly had for a series of years theretofore refused such admission. That a considerable portion of. the present church now held their seats by the same tenure under the union with the Associate Reformed'Church, including the moderator of 1836, (Dr. Phillips), and the gentleman who officiated as chairman of the committees appointed on this subject by the General Assembly of 1837, (Dr. Judkin.) That Dr. Green had declared that the legality of the union with the . Associate Reformed Church, had never been denied. That at all events an acquiescence of thirty-six years removed all such objections; that the amended constitution of 1821, had incorporated all these materials as a part of the church; that every presbytery in the church had recognised the plan of union, and that subsequent ratification amounted to previous assent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"439\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-7\">3. That the plan, in itself, was not onlyjudicious, but constitutional, and has been found most useful. 1st, It recommended a presbyteria\u00f1 minister, when an opportunity presented itself, to preach to a Congregational church,, or a congregation partly Congregational and partly Presbyterian. And 2nd, In case of difficulty between the minister and his congregation, it authorised several modes of arbitrament to be adopted by the parties, for an amicable settlement of their disputes, one of which, in an appeal to the presbytery, permitted a member of the standing committee of a mixed church to sit and vote as an ordained elder.</p>\n<p data-order=\"440\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-8\">4. That the character of this plan had been totally misunderstood. It related to the \u201c frontier settlements\u201d generally, and not the western part of New York, and the Western Reserve of Ohio. That so far from its authorising the admission of any Presbyterian minister into the church, it could not operate .upon nor affect him till <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>he had become previously, by ordination, a regular Presbyterian minister in good standing. That it had been proved, and was not denied, that the whole five hundred and seventeen ministers were regularly ordained ministers,, exclusive from and independent of the plan of union. That if the plan had been found inconvenient, or was believed to. be unconstitutional, the proper mode was to repeal it; and then, if any presb'yterian minister should violate the rules of the General Assembly, by continuing pastor of a Congregational or mixed church, he would become obnoxious to censure, and excommunication from the church, according to its forms of judicature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"441\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b596-6\">5. That as it now stood, the-General Assembly had in-1801, (enjoined\u2019 and -\u2018 recommended\u2019 Presbyterian ministers 'to preach to Congregational and mixed churches, and in 1837, without notice,' had excluded ministers for obeying the injunctions and recommendations of the General Assembly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"442\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b596-7\">6. That the exscinding resolutions were contrary to all law, human and - divine, and were utterly unconstitutional and void. It excluded five hundred and nine ministers, the elders of five hundred and ninety-nine churches, and sixty thousand communicanis, without accusation, notice or trial. It was founded on no principle; the present synod of Albany had been left untouched, while its offspring, the three synods of Geneva, Genessee and Utica, had been cut off The synod of the 'VYestern Reserve had been first created out of the Pittsburg synod,' arid the synod of Michigan has been subsequently created out of the synod of the Western Reserve, and while the intermediate synod Of' the Western Reserve' had been cut off, the synods of Pittsburg and Michigan have remained untouched. It was a local desecration of the ground; expulsion from the church depended on the domicil of the member in. 1837, and had Dr. Green at that time lived in the western part, of the state of New York, of in the Western Reserve of Ohio, he would have been\u2019excluded among the rest. It excluded all indiscriminately, whether they have ever been connected with the plan of union or not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"443\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b596-8\">7. That in the year 1799, before the adoption of the constitution, the presbytery of New York included twenty-one churches, of which eleven are among the number of exscinded churches, and although some of these churches were in existence before any individual who voted for these exscinding resolutions was a member of the church, and these churches had continued to exist without interruption, and have been recognized by the General Assembly, as such, without any regard to the plan of union. That the General Assembly of 1837, have admitted that whole presbyteries and churches within the proscribed and infected districts, were regular and in good standing; and provided also a mode for their re-admission into the church. That the alleged exclusion for a day, a month, 'a year, or for life, were equally a -violation of the right of the' exscinded indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>viduals or bodies. That this mode of re-ingress into the church was illusory, as the exscinded individuals could obtain re-admission only by examination in the same manner as if they had never been connected with the church. That'the opening counsel had not denied the right of the Court to inquire into'the form of proceedingsmf the General Assembly, .and that the case cited by the concluding counsel of Mr. Hinciman was conclusive in favour .of the power of the Cdurt; as the Supreme Court of Delaware there refused the mandamus, because the relator had confined his application for restitution to the presbytery, as an ecclesiastical body^ and not to the presbytery as an incorporated body,- and' the Court there said that they wmuld have entertained, jurisdiction, if the application had been for restoration to the incorporated presbytery. That the case referred to in Mr. \u2019Hindman\u2019s case, of <em>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Richards and others, </em>decided, in 1790, by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, on a mandamus to return Mr. Marshall as minister to the Scots\u2019 Presbyterian church in Spruce street, 'was conclusive and unanswerable in favour of the right. 'That if this power were, not conceded, there would be no remedy for a-relief from- ecclesiastical tyranny and injustice, no matter how u,njust and irregular it might be.</p>\n<p data-order=\"444\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-6\">8. That the act of the clerks in excluding the commissioners from the roll, and refusing to report them to the assembly, and. the subsequent conduct of the. moderator in refusing to put the motions, made to rectify the misbehaviour-of the clerks, were overt-acts of a conspiracy to carry out the unconstitutional acts of 18.37; and that the refusal of the moderator to put the appeal of Dr. Mason to the assembly, wras a breach of privilege which authorized any member of the assembly to move for his dismission from office.</p>\n<p data-order=\"445\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-7\">9. - That Mr. Cleaveland\u2019s motion was substantially a proceeding to remove Dr. Elliott from office for this breach of privilege.

That Mr. Cleaveland\u2019s motion was perfectly intelligible, and sufficiently loud to be heard by all.

That according to parliamentary rules, when the-commissions of the commissioners to the General Assembly of 1838,. were committed to the committee of commissions, they could only be restored to the assembly for the assembly\u2019s action, by the'.report-of that committee. That therefore the conduct of the-clerks composing the committee of commissions, in refusing to report-the commissions from the four synods on either of their lists, was a gross violation of duty. ' \u2018 '</p>\n<p data-order=\"448\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-12\">12.

J. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"Aoh\">To extricate the question from the multifarious mass of irrelevant matter in which it is enclosed, we must, in the first place, ascertain the specific character of the General Assembly, and the relation it bears to the corporation which is the immediate subject of our cognizance. ' This assembly has been called a <em>quasi </em>corporation; of which it- has no feature.' A <em>quasi </em>corporation has capacity to sue and be sued as an artificial person; which the assembly has not. It is also established bylaw; which the assembly is not.. Neither is the assembly a particular order or rank in the corporation, though the latter was created for its convenience; such, for instance, as the shareholders of a bank or joint stock company, who are an integrant part of the body. It is. a segregated association, which, though it is the reproductive organ of corporate succession, is not itself 'a member of the body; and in that respect it is anomalous. Having no corporate quality in itself, it is not a subject of our corrective jurisdiction, or of our scrutiny, further than to ascertain how far its organic structure may bear on the question of its personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>identity or individuality. By the charter of the corporation, of which this is the handmaid and nurse, it has a limited capacity to create vacancies in it, and an unlimited power over the form and manner of choice in filling them. It would be sufficient for the civil tribunals, therefore, that the. assembled commissioners had constituted an actual body: and that it had made its appointment in its own way, without regard to its fairness in respect to its numbers: with this limitation, however, that it had the assent of the constitutional majority, of which the official.act of authentication would be, at. least, <em>prima facie </em>evidence. It would be immaterial to the' legality of the choice that the majority had expelled the. minority, provided a majority of the whole body concurred in the choice. This may be safely predicated of an undivided assembly, and it would be an unerring test in the case of a division, could a quorum not be constituted of less than such a majority; but unfortunately, a quorum of the General Assembly may be constituted of a very small minority, so that two, or even more distinct parts may have all the external organs of.legitimate existence. Hence, where, as in this instance, the members have formed themselves into separate bodies, numerically sufficient for corporate capacity and organic action,.it becomes necessary to ascertain how far either of them was formed in obedience to the conventional law of the association, which, for that purpose only, is to be treated as a rule of civil obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The division, which for purposes of designation, it is convenient to call the old school party, was .certainly organized in obedience to the established order: and, to legitim\u00e1te the separate organization of its rival, in contravention, as it certainly was, of every thing like precedent, would require the presentation of \u00e1 very urgent emergency. At the stated time and place for the opening of the session, the parties assembled, without any ostensible division; and, when the organization of the whole had proceeded to a certain point, by the instrumentality of the moderator of the preceding session, who, for that purpose, was the constitutional organ, a provisional moderator was suddenly chosen, by a minority of those\u00bb who could be entitled to vote, including the exscinded commissioners. The question on the motion to elect, was put, not by the chair, but by the mover himself; after which the seceding party elected a permanent moderator, and immediately withdrew, leaving the other party to finish its process of organization, by the choice of its . moderator for the session. ' '</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">.In justification of this apparent irregularity, it is urged that the constitutional moderator had refused an appeal to the commissioners . in attendance from his decision, which had excluded from the roll the names of certain commissioners who had been unconstitutionally severed, as it is alleged, from the Presbyterian connexion by a vote of the preceding session. It is conceded- by the argument, that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>the synods \\vith the' dependent Presbyteries by which those commissioners were sent, had been constitutionally'dissolved, the motion was one which .the moderator was not bound to put, or the commissioners to notice; and whatever implication . of assent to the decision which ensued, might otherwise be deduced from the silence of those who refused to speak out,, about which it will be necessary to say something in the sequel, there was no room for any such implication in the particular instance. It would follow also, that there was no' pretence for- the deposal of the moderator, if indeed such a thing could be legitimated by any circumstances, for refusing an appeal from his exclusi\u00f3n of those who had not colour of title, and, consequently, that what else might be reform, would be revolution. And this leads to. an inquiry into the constitutionality of the act of excision.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The sentence of excision as it has'been called, was nothing else than an ordinance of dissolution. It bore that the synod in question,having been formed and attached to the'body of the Presbyterian church, under, and in execution of, the plan of union, \u201c be, and are hereby declared to be, out of the 'ecclesiastical connexion of the Presbyterian church, in the United States of America; and that they are not in form or i\u00f1 fact, an integral portion of said church.\u201d Now it will not be said that if the dissolved'synods had no other basis than the plan of' union, they did not necessarily fall along with it, and it is not pretended that the Assembly was incompetent to repeal the union prospectively, but it is contended that the - repeal could not imp\u00e1ir rights of membership which had grown up under it. .On the other hand, it is contended that'the plan of uni\u00f3n was unconstitutional \u00e1nd void from' the beginning, because it was not submitted to the presbyteries for- their sanction; and that no right of membership could spring from it. But viewed, not as a constitutional regulation, which implies permanency of duration, but- as a temporary - expedient, it acquired the force of a law without the ratification of those bodies. It was evidently not intended to be permanent, and it consequently was constitutionally enacted and constitutionally repeajed. by an ordinary act of legislation; and those synods which had their root in it, could not be expected to survive it. There never was a design to attempt an amalgamation of ecclesiastical principles which are as immiscible as water and oil; much less to effect a commixture of them only at particular geographical points. Such an attempt would have compromised a principle at the very root of Presbyterian government, which requires that the officers of the church be set apart by special ordination for the work. Now, the character of the plan is palpable, not only in its title .and provisions, but in the minute of its introduction into the assembly.. We find in the proceedings of 1801, page 256, that a committee was raised \u201c to consider and \u2019digest a\u2019 plan of government for the churches in the <em>new settlements', </em>agreeably to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>proposal of the General Association of Connecticutand that the plan adopted in conformity to its report, is called \u201c a Plan of Union for the New Settlements.\u201d The avowed object-of it was to prevent alienation \u2014 in other .words, the affiliation of Presbyterians in other churches, by suffering -those who were yet too few and too poor for the maintenance of a minister,\u2019temporarily to call to their assistance the members of a sect who differed from them in principles, not of faith, but of ecclesiastical government. To that end, Presbyterian ministers were suffei\u2019ed to preach to Congregational -churches, while ' Presbyterian churches were suffered to settle Congregational ministers ; and mixed congregations were allowed to settle- a Presbyterian or a Congregational minister at their election, but under a plan of government and discipline adapted to the circumstances. Surely this was not intended to outlast the inability of the respective sects to pro-wide separately for themselves, or to perpetuate the innovations on Presbyterial government;which it was calculated to produce.\u2019 It was obviously a missionary arrangement from the first; and they who built up presbyteries and synods on the basis of it, had no reason to expect that their structures would survive it, or that Congregationalists might, by force of it, gain a foothold in the Presbyterian church despite of Presbyterial discipline. They embraced it with all its defeasible properties -plainly put before them; and the power which constituted -it might fairly repeal it, and dissolve the bodies that had grown out of it, whenever the good of the church should seem to require it.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Could the synods, however, b'e dissolved by a legislative act? -I know not how they could have been legitimately dissolved by any other. The assembly is a homogeneous body, uniting in itself, .without separation of parts, the legislative, executive -and judicial functions of the government; and its acts are referable to the one or the other of them, according to the capacity in which it sat -when they were performed. Now had the exscinded synods been cut off by a judicial sentence without hearing or notice,, the act would have been contrary to the cardinal principles of -natural justice, and consequently void. But though it-was at first resolved to proceed judicially, the measure was abandoned; probably because it came to be'perc\u00e9iyed that the synods had committed no offence.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">A glance at the plan of union is enough to convince .us that the disorder had come,in-with the sanction of the assembly itself. The first article directed <em>missionaries </em>(the -word is significant) to the new settlements to promote a good understanding betwixt the kindred sects. The second and third permitted a Presbyterian congregation to settle a Congregational minister, or a Presbyterian minister to be settled by a Congregational church; but these provided for no recognition of the people in charge as a part of the Presbyterian body \u2014 at least they gave them no representation in its government. But the fourth allowed a mixed congregation to settle a minister of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>either denomination; and .it committed the government of it to a standing .committee, but with a right to appeal to the body of male communicants, if the appellant were \u00e1 Congregationalist, or to the presbytery, if he were a Presbyterian. Now it is evident the assembly designed that every such congregation should belong to a presbytery as an integrant, part of it; for if its minister were a Congregationalist; in no way connected with the Presbyterian church, it would be impossible to refer the , appellate jurisdiction to any presbytery in particular. This alone would show that it was designed to place such a congregation in ecclesiastical connexion with the \u25a0 presbytery of the district; but it is not all. It w\u00e1s expressly provided in conclusion, that if the \u201c said standing committee of any church' shall depute one of themselves to attend the presbytery, he may have the same right to.sit and act in the presbytery as a ruling elder of the Presbyterian church.\u201d For what purpose, if the congregation were not in Presbyterial fellowship <em>1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">It is said that this <em>jus representationis </em>was predicated of the appeal precedently mentioned; and that the exercise of it was to be restrained to-the -trial of it. The words, however, were predicated without restriction; and an implied limitation of their meaning, would impute to the assembly the injustice of allowing a party to sit in his own cause, by introducing into the composition of the appellate court, a part of the subordinate one. That such an implication would be inconsistent with the temper displayed by the assembly on other occasions, is proved by the order which it took as early as 1791, in the case of an appeal from .the sentence of the Synod of Philadelphia, whose members it prevented from voting on the question, (Assembly\u2019s Digest p. 332;) as well' as by its general provision, that members of a judicatory may hot vote in the superior judicatory on a question of approving or disapproving their records. (Id. page 333.)</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">The principle has since become a rule of the constitution, as appears by the Book of Discipline, Chap. VII. Sect. 3, paragraph 12. As the representatives of those anomalous congregations, therefore, could not sit in judgment on tlieir own controversies, it is pretty clear, that it was intended they should be represented generally, else they would not' be represented at all in the councils of the church, by'those who might not be Presbyterians; and that to effect it,, the principle of Presbyterial ordination was to be relaxed, as regards both the ministry and eldership; and it is equally clear that had the synods been cited to answer for the consequent relaxation as an offence, they might have triumphantly appeared at the bar of the assembly with the plan of union in their hand. That body, however, resorted to the only constitutional remedy in its power: it fell back, .soto speak, on its legislative jurisdiction, in the exercise of which, the synods were competently represented and heard by their commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Now the apparent injustice of the measure arises from the contemplation of it as a judicial sentence pronounced against parties who were neither cited nor heard; which it evidently was not. Even-as a legislative act, it may have been, a hard one, though certainly constitutional, and strictly just. It was impossible to eradicate the disorder by any thing less than a dissolution of those bodies, with whose existence its roots were so intertwined as to be inseparable from it, leaving their elements to 'form new and less heterogeneous combinations. Though deprived of Presbyterial organization, the Presbyterian parts, were, not excluded from the church, provision being made for them, by allowing them <em>to </em>attach themselves to the nearest presbytery.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">It is said there is not sufficient evidence to establish the fact, that the exscinded synods .had actually been constituted on the plan of union, in order to have given the .assembly even legislative jurisdiction. The testimony of the Rey. Mr. Squier, however, shows that in some of the three which were within the state of New York, congregations were sometimes constituted without elders; \u25a0 and the synod of the Western Reserve, when charged -with delinquency on that head, instead of denying the fact, promptly pointed to the plan of.union for its justification. But what matt\u00e9rs it whether the fact were actually what the assembly supposed it would be ? If, that body proceeded in good faith, the validity of its enactment cannot depend on, the justness, of its conclusion. We have, as already remarked, no authority to re-judge. its judgments on their merits; and this principle was asserted with conclusive force by the presiding judge who tried the cause! Upon an objection made to an inquiry into the composition of the presbytery of Medina, it was ruled that'\u201c with the reasons for' the proceedings of 1837, (the act of excision,) we have nothing to do. We are to determine only what was done: the reasons of those who did it \u00e1re .immaterial. If the acts complained of were within the jurisdiction of the assembly, their decision must be final, though they decided wrong.\u201d This was predicated of judicial jurisdiction, but the principle is necessarily as applicable to jurisdiction for purposes of legislation. I cite the passage, however, to show that after a successful resistance to the introduction of evidence of the fact, it lies not with the relators to allege the want of it. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">If then the synods in question were constitutionally dissolved, the presbyteries of which they had been composed, were, at least, for purposes of representation, dissolved along with them ; for no presbytery. can be in connexion with the General Assembly, unless.it be at the same time subordinate to a synod,, also in connexion with it; because an appeal from its judgment can reach the tribunal of the last resort only through that channel. It is immaterial that the presbyteries are the electors; a synod is a part of the machinery which is indispensable to the existence of every branch of the church. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>It .appears, therefore, that the. commissioners from the exscinded synods, were not entitled to seats in the assembly, and that their names were properly excluded from the roll. \u2022 .</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The inquiry might be rested here; for if there were no colour of right in them there was no colour of, right in the adversary proceedings which were founded on their exclusion. But even if their title were clear, the refusal of an appeal from the decision of the moderator would be no.ground for the degradation of the officer at the call of a minority; nor could it impose on the majority an obligation to vote on the question put unofficially, and out of the usual course, To all ques- . tionsputbythe established organ, it is thedutyof every member to respond, or be counted with the greater number, because he is supposed to have assented beforehand to the process pre-established to ascertain the general will; but the rule of implied assent is certainly inapplicable \u00edo a meas\u00far\u00e9 which, when justifiable even by extreme necessity, is essentially revolutionary; and based on no pre-established process of ascertainment whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">To apply it to an extreme case of inorganic action, as was done here, might work the degradation of any presiding officer in our legislative halls, by the motion and actual vote of'a single member, sustained by the constructive votes of all the rest; and though such an enterprise may never be attempted, it shows the danger of resorting to a. conventional rule, when the body is to be resolved into its original elements; and its rules and conventions, to be superseded by the very motion. For this reason, the.choice of a moderator to supplant the officer in the chair, even if he were, removable at the pleasure of the commissioners, would seem to have been unconstitutional. '</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">But he was not removable by them, because he' had not derived his office from them, nor was he answerable to them for the use of his power. He was not <em>their </em>moderator. He was the mechanical instrument of their organization; and till that was ascomplished, they were subject to his rule \u2014 not he to theirs. They were chosen by the authority of his mandate; and with the power of self organization, only in the event of his absence at the opening of the session. Corporeally present but refusing to perform his function, he might be deemed constructively absent, for constitutional purposes, insomuch that the commissioners might proceed to the choice of a substitute without him ; but not if he had entered on the performance of his task; and the reason is that the decision of such questions as were prematurely pressed here, is proper for the decision of the body when prepared for organic action, which it cannot be before it is fully constituted and under the presidency of its own moderator, the moderator of the preceding session being <em>functus officio. </em>There can be no occasion for its action sooner; for though the commissioners are necessarily called upon to vote for their moderator, their action is not organic but individual. Doctor Mason\u2019s motion and appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>though the clerks had reported the roll, were premature; for though it is declared in the twelfth chapter of the Form of Government, that no commissioner shall deliberate or vote before his name shall have been enrolled, it follows not that the capacity, consummated by enrollment was expected to be exercised during any part of the process of organization, but the choice of a moderator; and moreover, the provision may have been intended for the case of a commissioner appearing for the first time, when the house was constituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Many instances may doubtless be found among the minutes, of motions entertained previously; for our public, bodies, whether legislative or judicial, secular or ecclesiastical, are too prone to forget the golden precept, \u2014 \u201c Let all things be done decently and in order.\u201d But these are merely instances of irregularity which have passed, <em>sub silentio, </em>and which cannot change a rule of positive enactment. It seems then that an appeal from the decision of the moderator did not lie; and that he incurred no penalty by the disallowance of it. The title of the exscinded commissioners, could be determined only by the action of the house, which could not be had before its organization was complete; and in the meantime he was bound, as the executive instrument of the preceding assembly, to put its ordinance into execution : for to the actual assembly, and not to the moderator of the preceding one, it belonged to repeal it.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">It would be decisive, however, that the motion, as it was proposed, purported not to be in fact a question of degradation for the disallowance of an appeal, but one of new and independent organization. It was, ostensibly as well as actually, a measure of transcendental power, whose purpose was to treat the ordinance of the preceding assembly as a nullity, and its moderator as a nonentity. It had been prepared for the event avowedly before, the meeting. The witnesses concur that it was propounded as a measure of original organization transcending the customary order; and not as a recourse to the <em>ultima ratio </em>for a specific violation of it. The ground of the motion, as it was opened by the mover, was not the disallowance of an appeal, which alone could afford a pretext of forfeiture, but the fact of exclusion. To affect silent members with an implication of assent, however, the ground of the motion and nature of the question must be so explicitly put before them as to prevent misconception or mistake; and the remarks that heralded the question in this instance, pointed at, not a removal of the presiding incumbent, but a separate organization, to be accomplished with the least practicable interruption of the business in hand: and if they indicated any thing else, they were deceptive. The measure was proposed not as that of the body, but as the measure of a party; and the cause assigned for not having proposed it elsewhere, was that individuals of the party had been-instructed by counsel that the purpose of it could not be legally accomplished in any other place. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>No witness speaks of a motion to degrade; and the rapidity of the process by which the choice of a substitute, not, a successor, was effected, left no space for reflection or debate. Now, before the passive commissioners could be affected by acquiescence implied from their silence, it ought to have appeared that they were apprised of what was going on; but it appears that even an attentive ear witness was. unable to understand what was done. The whole scene was one of unprecedented haste, insomuch that it is still a matter of doubt how the questions were put.\u2019 Now, though these facts were fairly put to the jury, it is impossible not to see, that the verdict is, in this respect, manifestly against the current of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Other corroborative views have been suggested; but it is difficult to compress a decision of the leading points in this case into the old fashioned limits of a judicial opinion.' The preceding observations, however, are deemed enough to show the grounds on which we hold that the assembly which met in the First Presbyterian Church was not the legitimate successor of the assembly of 1837; and that the defendants are not guilty of the usurpation with which they are charged. The rule for a new trial must be made absolute.</p>\n<author id=\"b606-5\">Rogers, J. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"AkVq\">After the patient and impartial investigation, by me, of this cause at Nisi Prius, and in bank, I have nothing at this time to add, except that my opinion remains unchanged on all the points ruled at the trial. This explanation is deemed requisite in .justice to myself, and because it has become necessary (in - a case in some respects without precedent, .and presenting some- extraordinary features) to,prevent misapprehension and misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Rule absolute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
