The Court of Quarter Sessions confirmed the report; whereupon a certiorari was taken out and the following exceptions filed in this Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-8\">\u201c 1. Because the report was defective, in that it does not state particularly who of the jurors were present, as required by law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-9\">2. Because the report is defective, in that it does not state whether the street t\u00f3 be opened be necessary for a public or private road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-10\">3. Because the report of the jurors does not state whether the jurors were severally sworn or affirmed.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b515-11\">Mr. <em>MTlvctine </em>for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-V\">cited the case of the road from <em>App\u2019s Tavern, </em>&amp;c., (17 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>389.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b515-12\">Mr. <em>Cadwalader, contra, </em>was stopped.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b515-13\">Per, Curiam. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"A7U\">These exceptions are too nice to prevail. The statute required the reviewers to report the names of those who were present \u2014 and they have done so \u2014 but not .the names of those who wrere absent \u2014 and the statute does not require it. They say that the viewers appointed and named in the order had reviewed the ground; and this would seem to include the six; but the report is signed by only five. If it were important to know the missing man, he could be readily ascertained by comparing the signatures with the names in the order. But it was unimportant to designate him, as there was a sufficient number without him. But the statute required them to specify whether the street was necessary as a public or a private one; and they have not directly done it. But they have done it indirectly by expressly re-establishing the first report, in which it was laid out as a public street, which would be sufficient in all conscience, even if such a thing were known to the law as a private street. The last exception, is sharper still. The statute required them to report that they were sworn <em>or </em>affirmed, and they have reported that they were sworn <em>and- </em>affirmed. To say nothing of the precedents for reading <em>and </em>as <em>or, </em>and <em>or </em>as <em>and, </em>as the case may require, suppose these reviewers to have been both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>sworn and affirmed, as they may have been, and that they have reported the fact accurately and truly; surely to have been doubly qualified would not vitiate their report. The statute intended to give an appeal to the <em>conscience; </em>but the form of it was left to the taste of the parties to be qualified. It is enough that such an appeal was made; and to specify the form and quality of it, was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Proceedings affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
