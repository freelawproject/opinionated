Tompkins\u2019 initial contention is that this circuit should revise its standard of review of a district court\u2019s ultimate determination that consent to search was voluntary \u2014 changing from clear error to <em>de novo </em>\u2014 basing his argument on a recent Supreme Court opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finding Tompkins\u2019 position on the appropriate standard of review fallacious, and perceiving no reversible error in the district court\u2019s findings and holding, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-22\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b174-23\">Tompkins was convicted following a bench trial for possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine and sentenced to a sixty-month term of imprisonment, a four-year term of supervised release, and a $3,000 fine. Prior to trial, Tompkins filed a motion to suppress evidence seized during a search of the motel room that he was occupying when arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-24\">Tompkins argued for suppression on the ground that his consent to the search \u2014 conducted without a warrant \u2014 was not volun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>tarily given; rather, insists Tompkins, his consent was obtained through the arresting officer\u2019s threat to secure the motel room and procure a search warrant. The officer\u2019s threat, says Tompkins, gave him the impression that a search was inevitable, thereby causing him to believe that he had no choice but to consent. So induced, asserts Tompkins, his consent was coerced, and the motel-room evidence was obtained by means of an unlawful search. As a result, concludes Tompkins, the district court erred reversibly in denying his motion to suppress and admitting the evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">The evidence introduced at the suppression hearing revealed the following facts surrounding Tompkins\u2019 arrest. An anonymous informant, through a \u201cCrimestoppers\u201d hotline, informed law enforcement authorities that Tompkins had checked into a La Quinta Motel room and that he had a large quantity of methamphetamine with him at the time. According to the informant, Tompkins had transported the methamphetamine from California to Texas for distribution. The informant also indicated that Tompkins was accompanied by a woman, Kimberly Rendon, who might have been wanted by Bell County authorities. And the informant provided physical descriptions of both Tompkins and Rendon.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Acting on that information, Officer Michael Brown of the Killeen Police Department contacted the La Quinta desk clerk to confirm that Tompkins was registered at the motel. At first the clerk was unable to confirm Tompkins\u2019 registration, but a subsequent check revealed that Tompkins \u2014 originally thought to have been registered to room 234 \u2014 had been given room 236. The La Quinta night manager called Officer Brown at 3:30 a.m., shortly after Tompkins and those accompanying him returned to the motel. Brown went to the motel and kept Tompkins\u2019 room under surveillance until its lights were dimmed, then departed. He returned to the motel prior to check-out time the next morning and resumed his surveillance.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Officer Brown saw three women \u2014 one of whom matched the description of Rendon\u2014 leave the room, enter a vehicle, and drive away. While Brown followed the vehicle he had a check run on Rendon. He then stopped the ear after observing the driver commit a traffic violation and called for backup. Rendon was a passenger in the vehicle. Brown told the occupants why he had stopped their car, and also related the information that he had received regarding the methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">The driver consented to a search of the vehicle, and a drug dog alerted to a cosmetic case that Officer Brown had seen one of the passengers carrying out of Tompkins\u2019 motel room. The officer found a baggie containing methamphetamine residue in the cosmetic ease. One of the women then told Officer Brown that there was methamphetamine in Tompkins\u2019 room. Rendon was arrested on an outstanding warrant, but the other women were released. Fearing that the released women might contact Tompkins, Officer Brown quickly returned to the motel with another officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">When he arrived, Officer Brown knocked on Tompkins\u2019 door and identified himself as a police officer. Tompkins presented his identification on request but refused to allow the officers to enter the room. Brown told Tompkins about the anonymous tip and Ren-don\u2019s arrest. When Tompkins heard this he was \u201cvisibly shaken.\u201d Brown again asked Tompkins for consent to a search of his motel room, informing Tompkins that he could refuse. Tompkins was also told by Brown that the officers would obtain a search warrant for the room if consent were withheld and that Tompkins would be denied access to the room while the warrant was being obtained. Tompkins then agreed to the search and signed a consent form. A distribution quantity of methamphetamine was recovered from the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">A. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">With regard to a ruling on a motion to suppress, we review \u201cthe district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its ultimate conclusion as to the constitutionality of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>the law enforcement action <em>de </em>novo.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the law of this circuit, the voluntariness of a detainee\u2019s consent to a warrantless search is a finding of fact to be reviewed for clear error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Despite this long-standing Fifth Circuit standard, Tompkins maintains that, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent <em>Ornelas </em>decision,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we should re-examine our standard of review of the question whether consent to search is given voluntarily and change to a standard that incorporates <em>de novo </em>review. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">In <em>Ornelas, </em>the Supreme Court held that a district court\u2019s determination of <em>reasonable suspicion </em>and <em>probable cause </em>when evaluating the constitutionality of investigative stops and searches under the Fourth Amendment is subject to a two-tier standard of appellate review: The ultimate conclusion on reasonable suspicion or probable cause \u2014 a mixed question of law and fact \u2014 is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>whereas the events leading up to the search or seizure \u2014 the historical facts \u2014 are reviewed for clear error, giving \u201cdue weight to inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-20\">Tompkins notes that the determination whether consent to a warrantless search was voluntary involves applying legal principles to historical facts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, urges Tompkins, voluntariness of consent should be subject to the same two-tier standard of review that <em>Ornelas' </em>established for reasonable suspicion and probable cause \u2014 insisting that voluntariness of consent too is a mixed question of law and fact under the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-21\">We decline Tompkins\u2019 invitation to employ <em>Ornelas\u2019 </em>two-tier standard when we review a district court\u2019s determination whether consent to search was given voluntarily. The Supreme Court reiterated its deferential standard of review for Fourth Amendment voluntariness determinations in <em>Ohio v. </em>Robinette,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a <em>post-Ornelas </em>decision. The <em>Robinette </em>Court noted that voluntariness of consent to search is a question of fact;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> as such, it does not trigger the <em>de novo </em>review mandated by the Supreme Court in <em>Ornelas </em>for mixed questions of law and fact.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Supreme Court\u2019s refusal to depart from its established precedent,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> coupled with the virtually monolithic position of the circuits in affording deferential review to voluntariness inquiries raised by consensual searches,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> persuades us that Tompkins\u2019 reliance on <em>Ornelas </em>to mandate a change in our clear error standard of review is misplaced.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">B. Applicable Law</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">A search conducted pursuant to consent is one of the well-settled exceptions to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In relying upon the consensual search exception, the government must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that consent was freely and voluntarily given.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Voluntariness is determined from the totality of the circumstances surrounding the search;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> relevant factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-6\">(1) the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s custodial status; (2) the presence of coer-eive police procedures; (3) the extent and level of the defendant\u2019s cooperation with the police; (4) the defendant\u2019s awareness of his right to refuse to consent; (5) the defendant\u2019s education and intelligence; and (6) the defendant\u2019s belief that no incriminating evidence will be found.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Alc\">Although all six factors are relevant, \u201cno single factor is dispositive or controlling of the voluntariness issue.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-26\">Tompkins argues that his consent was coerced in light of the investigating officer\u2019s failure, when informing Tompkins of the consequences of his refusal to consent, to distinguish between procuring a search warrant and attempting to procure a search warrant. Tompkins\u2019 point is that because he was told by Officer Brown that a warrant would be obtained \u2014 not that a warrant would be sought or applied for \u2014 -Tompkins was given the impression that a search of the motel room was inevitable. This impression, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>insists, rendered his consent no more than an acquiescence to that which he was led by Brown to believe was a law enforcement claim of lawful authority.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">In support of his argument, Tompkins invites our attention to dicta in <em>United States v. </em>Boukater<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> suggesting that consent might not be voluntary if the investigating officer \u201ceither said or implied that defendant might as well consent because a warrant could be quickly obtained if he refused.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Tompkins also relies on <em>United States v. White,</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in which we held that the district court\u2019s volun-tariness finding was not clearly erroneous when the investigating agent, in requesting the defendant\u2019s consent to search, explained that he could not automatically get a warrant but would have to show probable cause to a magistrate.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">We agree with the district court\u2019s observation that Officer Brown\u2019s statement to Tompkins concerning the possibility of a search warrant is but one factor to be considered among the totality of the circumstances in evaluating the voluntariness of Tompkins\u2019 consent.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We also agree with the court\u2019s reasoning that the distinction between a suspect\u2019s being told by an officer that he \u201cwould obtain\u201d a warrant rather than that he \u201cwould apply for\u201d a warrant, is largely semantic and that, under the circumstances of this case, the distinction weighs only slightly in favor of a coercion finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">Considering all the relevant factors, Officer Brown\u2019s choice of words is not sufficiently significant to convince us that the district court\u2019s voluntariness determination was clearly erroneous:<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Tompkins was not taken into custody and thus was apparently free to leave; other coercive police procedures were absent, i.e., Tompkins was not handcuffed until the search revealed the presence of methamphetamine, no threats or violence were used, and there was no overt display of authority; when Tompkins initially refused to allow the officers to enter his room, he was told that he did not have to consent to a search; Tompkins cooperated to the extent of providing his identification and ultimately permitting the search; Tompkins was found by the court to be a man of average intelligence who, with charges pending against him in California, was not unfamiliar with the criminal justice system; and, finally, Tompkins\u2019 knowledge that incriminating evidence would be found does not necessarily weigh against a finding of voluntary consent. For example, inasmuch as Tompkins knew that some inculpatory evidence was already in the possession of police, he might have consented in the hope that his cooperation would result in more favorable treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Under the totality of the circumstances surrounding Tompkins\u2019 consent to search his motel room, we can discern no clear error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that Tompkins\u2019 consent was voluntary. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-13\">. <em>Ornelas v.
