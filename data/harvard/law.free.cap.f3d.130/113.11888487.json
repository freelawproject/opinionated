PARKER, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">On February 19, 1996, Appellant Abdul Karem Lugman was traveling in a car driven by Nicholas Parson, when deputies of the Henderson County, Texas, Sheriffs Department attempted to stop them for a traffic violation. Lugman and Parson attempted to evade the sheriff\u2019s deputies, leading them on a high-speed chase ending when Parson lost control of the car, which flipped and landed on the hood of the deputies\u2019 patrol car. The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) indicates that the deputies observed Lugman stick his arm out of the window of the car during the chase, as though he were throwing something out. At the place along the road where the deputies observed Lugman stick his arm out of the window, they discovered two plastic bags containing a substance, which upon analysis proved to be 32.41 grams of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">On October 28, 1996, pursuant to a plea agreement, Lugman entered a plea of guilty to one count of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). In his plea agreement, Lugman agreed to cooperate fully with law enforcement and in return the United States Attorney agreed to inform the court and probation office of the extent and value of his cooperation and to recommend a three-level reduction in Lugman\u2019s base offense level for his acceptance of responsibility. It was understood that these recommendations were not binding on the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-19\">In the PSR the probation office added two levels to Lugman\u2019s base offense level for Reckless Endangerment During Flight under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2, on the basis that Parson\u2019s attempt to evade capture was attributable to Lugman. Lugman objected to the \u00a7 3C1.2 enhancement and to the probation officer\u2019s refusal to recommend a two-level decrease in the base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 on the basis that Lugman was a minimal participant. Lugman also made a motion for downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0, because the government did not make a motion for downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, in exchange for Lugman\u2019s cooperation with them in the investigation and prosecution of other drug traffickers. Lugman had apparently assisted local authorities in Texas to make cases against other drug traffickers. However, those cases had not been resolved and the government refused to request a downward departure under \u00a7 5K1.1 until they were, whereupon the government would make a motion to reduce Lugman\u2019s sentence under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Lugman\u2019s concern, naturally, was that the cases might not be resolved within the one-year time limit for motions under Rule 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-20\">On March 21,1997, the district court overruled Lugman\u2019s objections, denied his motion for downward departure and sentenced him to seventy-eight (78) months confinement, the minimum allowed under his offense level as calculated by the probation office. Lug-man appeals assigning the following errors:</p>\n<p id=\"A50\">1. The district court erred by denying Lug-man\u2019s motion for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0;</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>2. The district court erred by adding a two-level enhancement to Lugman\u2019s base offense level for obstruction of justice/reckless endangerment during flight under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2;</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">3. The district court erred by refusing to decrease Lugman\u2019s base offense level by two-levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 for being a minimal participant.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">LAW &amp; ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">\u00a7 5K2.0 Downward Departure</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 allows the district court to make a downward departure from the guidelines \u201cif the court finds \u2018that there exists [a] ... mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.\u2019\u201d To the extent that the district court\u2019s decision not to depart downward in this case involves a determination of whether \u00a7 5K2.0 can apply in cases of substantial assistance is a question of law reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Koon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 2047, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996) (noting that a district court by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law, and therefore a unitary abuse of discretion standard of review is sufficient).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Likewise, if, as a matter of law, \u00a7 5K2.0 may be applied to make a downward departure in a case of substantial assistance, then the determination of whether the facts warrant a downward departure under \u00a7 5K2.0 \u201cwill in most eases be due substantial deference, for it embodies the traditional exercise of discretion by a sentencing court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 116 S.Ct. at 2046. Yet, this Court has gone even further in the context of downward departures under \u00a7 5K2.0, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-15\">[w]e may only review a trial court\u2019s refusal to grant a downward departure from the Guidelines if the refusal was based on a violation of the law ... Thus, we have jurisdiction if a district court\u2019s refusal to depart downward is premised upon the court\u2019s mistaken conclusion that the Guidelines do not permit such departure, but we have no jurisdiction if the court\u2019s refusal is based on its determination that departure is not warranted on the facts of the ease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ahm\"><em>United States v. Palmer, </em>122 F.3d 215, 222 (5th Cir.1997), <em>citing United States v. Mitchell, </em>964 F.2d 454, 462 (5th Cir.1992). This rule of deferential review is a recognition that review even for abuse of discretion, might become a chance to second-guess the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-16\">In this ease the district court specifically found that there were no factors not taken into consideration by the Guidelines as to warrant a downward departure. The district court was apparently satisfied that any assistance Lugman had rendered or might render in aid of law enforcement would be adequately accounted for by the government\u2019s Rule 35 motion, if warranted. The district court denied Lugman\u2019s motion for downward departure on the basis that the facts adduced by Appellant as proof of his substantial assistance did not yet warrant such a departure. Therefore, this court lacks jurisdiction to review that wholly discretionary conclusion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-17\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-18\">\u00a7 3C1.2 Reckless Endangerment Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b171-19\">We review the district court\u2019s factual finding that Lugman\u2019s conduct amounted to reckless endangerment during flight under \u00a7 3C1.2 for clear error. <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>42 F.3d 1199 (9th Cir.1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>514 U.S. 1091, 115 S.Ct. 1814, 131 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>L.Ed.2d 738 (1995). <em>See also United States v. Tello, </em>9 F.3d 1119, 1122 (5th Cir.1993) (finding of obstructive conduct reviewed for clear error), <em>citing United States v. Ainsworth, </em>932 F.2d 358, 362 (5th Cir.1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 928, 112 S.Ct. 346, 116 L.Ed.2d 286 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\">Appellant does not contest that Parson\u2019s attempt to evade the sheriff\u2019s deputies and the ensuing high speed chase amounted to reckless endangerment during flight. Rather, Appellant contests the district court\u2019s finding that he was culpable for the conduct of Parsons. Application note 5 to \u00a7 3C1.2 states that \u201c[u]nder this section, the defendant is accountable for his own conduct and for conduct that he aided or abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2 (n.5). The district court adopted the PSR\u2019s findings in their entirety. In the PSR, in response to Appellant\u2019s objection to the \u00a7 3C1.2 enhancement, the probation officer stated that the defendant was responsible for Parson\u2019s conduct pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(B).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The probation officer stated that the fact that Lugman agreed to travel with Parson, knowing cocaine was inside the ear, makes \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(B) applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Furthermore, as evidence that Lugman aided, counseled, or commanded the conduct of Parson, the PSR cites the records of the Henderson County Sheriffs Department, which contained an investigator\u2019s notes of an interview with Lugman on February 20, 1996. The investigator\u2019s notes revealed that Lugman, upon being given Miranda warnings, stated that Parson was unaware of the . drugs which Lugman had on him, when Lug- \u2022 man got in the car. When the sheriffs deputies attempted to stop Parson, according to the investigator\u2019s notes, Lugman informed Parson that he had drugs on him, and that Parson needed to do something or they were going to jail. Therefore, according to the investigator\u2019s notes of his interview with Lugman, it was Lugman\u2019s idea to run from the deputies.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">Lugman insists that it was an abuse of discretion for the district court to adopt that portion of the PSR, which relies on the investigator\u2019s notes of his interview with Lugman. Nowhere in his brief does Lugman maintain that the investigator\u2019s notes are inaccurate or false. Rather, he would apparently have this Court rule that the investigators notes do not provide adequate evidentiary basis for that portion of the PSR relied on by the district court, regardless of whether they are accurate or not. However, this Court has stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-9\">A presentence report generally bears sufficient indicia of reliability to be considered as evidence by the district court in resolving disputed facts, [citations omitted] A district court may adopt facts contained in the PSR without further inquiry if the facts have an adequate evidentiary basis and the defendant does not present rebuttal evidence, [citations omitted] <em>The defendant hears the burden of showing that the information in the PSR relied on by the district court is materially untrue.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeM2\"><em>United States v. Valencia, </em>44 F.3d 269, 274 (5th Cir.1995) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">Lugman was aware of the probation officer\u2019s reliance on the investigator\u2019s notes before he was sentenced, yet Lugman did not present any evidence which would cast doubt on the truthfulness or accuracy of the investigator\u2019s notes. Lugman has presented no evidence that the investigator\u2019s account of his interview with Lugman on February 20, 1996, is somehow defective. Therefore, the investigator\u2019s notes, in point of fact, do provide adequate evidentiary basis for the PSR\u2019s conclusion that it was Lugman\u2019s idea that Parson attempt to evade the sheriffs depu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>ties, and therefore, any reckless conduct committed by Parson may be attributed to Lugman for purposes of enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.2. Hence, the district court was correct in its adoption of the PSR\u2019s findings which rely on the investigator\u2019s notes of his February 20, 1996, interview with Lugman.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">\u00a7 3B1.2 Decrease for Minimal Participants</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">This Court reviews a district court decision not to reduce the defendant\u2019s base offense level because of his minimal role in the offense for clear error. <em>United States v. Giraldi </em>86 F.3d 1368, 1378 (5th Cir.1996), <em>citing United States v. Watson, </em>988 F.2d 544, 550 (5th Cir.1993). Section 3B1.2 allows a four-point reduction in the defendant\u2019s base offense level, if he was a minimal participant in the criminal activity. The government in the plea agreement with Lugman agreed not to oppose a finding by the probation officer or the district court that Lugman was a minor participant pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.2. However, it was also clear that the plea agreement was not and could not be binding on the United States Probation Office or the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">There was no clear error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that Lugman was not a minimal participant. \u201cA downward adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2 is appropriate where a defendant was substantially less culpable than the average participant.\u201d <em>Giraldi supra, </em>86 F.3d at 1378, <em>citing United States v. Gadison, </em>8 F.3d 186, 197 (5th Cir.1993). Parson and Lugman were the only participants, and, as between them, little difference in their respective culpability can be discerned. Lugman did not drive the car, but the evidence indicated that he actively participated in the decision to flee. Lugman also admitted that Parson was unaware that Lugman had any drugs on him when Lug-man got in the car. Finally, Lugman was observed actually throwing the cocaine from the car. We cannot say on this record that the district court committed clear error by finding that Lugman was not a minimal participant within the meaning of \u00a7 3B1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">Finding no error in the sentence imposed upon Appellant, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-14\">. Rule 35 provides that: \"The court, on motion of the Government made within one year after the imposition of the sentence, may reduce a sentence to reflect a defendant\u2019s subsequent, substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b171-13\">. Although <em>Koon </em>involves a challenge to a district court decision to grant a downward departure, <em>Koon </em>does not distinguish, for purposes of the standard of review, between a decision to grant and a decision to deny the downward departure. Therefore, in either case, the standard of review is for abuse of discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b171-20\">. Since the district court properly refused to grant a downward departure under \u00a7 5K2.0, we need not reach the question of whether substantial assistance may ever be a basis for downward departure under \u00a7 5K2.0.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b172-5\">. \u00a7 IB 1.3 provides that for purposes of enhancement under \u00a7 3Cl.2 the defendant is responsible for ...</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-6\">(1)(A) all acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aps\">(B) in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity (a criminal plan, scheme, endeavor, or enterprise undertaken by the defendant in concert with others, whether or not charged as a conspiracy), all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-1m\">that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
