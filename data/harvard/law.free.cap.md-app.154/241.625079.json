For the reasons that follow, we hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The underlying facts are not in dispute. Appellant, Sheldon I. Landsman, entered into a contract for a home improvement project with David Somerville, t/a Somerville Construction, on January 19,1997. At that time, Somerville possessed a Maryland home improvement contractor\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Somerville completed some work on the project, but abandoned it on or about December 5, 1997, when he advised Landsman that he was moving to Arizona. Somerville refused to refund some of the monies that Landsman had paid him under the agreement, representing to Landsman that there was no money available. Somerville\u2019s contractor\u2019s license had expired on June 30,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Following enactment of Chapter 144 of the Maryland Session Laws of 2000, the maximum recovery under the Maryland Home Improvement Guaranty Fund (\u201cFund\u201d) was increased from $10,000.00 to $15,000.00. By express provision in the enacting legislation, the effective date was October 1, 2000. Nothing in the legislation indicated whether the statute should be applied retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">On November 10, 2000, Landsman filed a claim against the Fund. The matter came on for a hearing in March 2001, before an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). Landsman represented himself at the hearing. The Fund was represented by counsel. Somerville was not present, and no representative appeared on his behalf.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">The ALJ thereafter issued his written proposed decision. The ALJ found as a fact that Landsman had incurred an \u201cactual loss\u201d of $42,395.41, and concluded that Landsman was entitled to recover the statutory maximum of $15,000.00 from the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">In a proposed order, Panel B of the Maryland Home Improvement Commission, (\u201cCommission\u201d), appellee, ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>proved the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision but reduced Landsman\u2019s award from $15,000.00 to $10,000.00. The panel concluded that \u201cthe $15,000.00 claim limit applies to contracts entered into on or after October 1, 2000 and that contracts entered into prior to October 1, 2000 are subject to the $10,000.00 claim limit.\u201d The panel\u2019s proposed order further stated that \u201cthe contractor\u2019s liability to the Guaranty Fund constitutes a penalty, and that an increase in such a penalty may not be applied retroactively to contracts entered into before the amendment to the law took effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">Landsman filed exceptions to the proposed order. Following an exceptions hearing, the Commission entered a final order on July 24, 2001, affirming the proposed order.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Landsman thereafter filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. After a hearing on the merits, the court affirmed the Commission\u2019s final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">In an opinion and order entered on March 22, 2002, the court declared \u201cthat the Legislature\u2019s intent was clear not to make the amendment to Md. Ann. Code Art. Bus. Reg. \u00a7 8-405(e)(1) retroactive.\u201d Noting that the effective date \u201cis expressly stated to be October 1, 2000\u201d and that \u201c[tjhere is no express statement by the Legislature to the contrary,\u201d the court concluded that \u201c \u00a7 8-405(e)(l) fits neatly into the general category of statutes, which carry the strong presumption against retroactivity.\u201d The Court rejected Landsman\u2019s argument that the 2000 amendment was remedial, stating that the increase in the maximum award \u201cclearly creates new rights, new duties and new obligations thus effecting the substantive rights of the Petitioner and Somerville, a licensed contractor.\u201d The court reasoned that the 2000 amendment \u201cgives the claimant a new right to seek a higher monetary award from the Fund\u201d and affects Somerville\u2019s substantive rights by increasing the \u201cmaximum penalty,\u201d thereby exposing Somerville to greater risk of license suspension for failure to reimburse the Fund the full amount of a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Following entry of the court\u2019s order, Landsman filed this timely appeal raising five issues for our review, which we have consolidated into one:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-4\">Did the Commission err in concluding that, as a matter of law, the $15,000.00 claim limit applies only to contracts entered into on or after October 1, 2000, and that contracts entered into prior to October 1, 2000 are subject to the $10,000.00 claim limit?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">In 1962, the General Assembly enacted the Maryland Home Improvement Law, now codified at Md.Code (1992, 1998 Repl.Vol., 2003 Supp.), \u00a7 8-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Business Regulation Article.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This law, which had its genesis in a 1961 report of the Governor\u2019s Commission to Study the Home Improvement Industry in Maryland, is a regulatory scheme designed for the protection of the public. <em>Shade v. State, </em>306 Md. 372, 377, 509 A.2d 664 (1986); <em>Harry Berenter, Inc. v. Berman, </em>258 Md. 290, 294, 265 A.2d 759 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">As the title of the original statute explained, the law was enacted, in part, \u201cwith the intention of \u2018providing generally for the regulation of the home improvement business for all persons in the State,\u2019 and \u2018establishing a system of licensing certain contractors and salesmen under a new administrative agency to be known as the Maryland Home Improvement Commission.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fosler v. Panoramic Design, Ltd., </em>376 Md. 118, 126, 829 A.2d 271 (2003). \u201cThe Commission\u2019s primary functions are to investigate complaints about home improvement contractors, and to administer the licensing of those contractors in this state.\u201d <em>Brzowski v. Maryland Home Improvement Comm\u2019n, </em>114 Md.App. 615, 628, 691 A.2d 699, <em>cert. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number><em>denied, </em>346 Md. 238, 695 A.2d 1227 (1997) (code citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">In 1981, the General Assembly enacted Subtitle 4 of the Home Improvement Law, establishing the Fund. The Fund was created to provide a remedy for homeowners who suffer an \u201cactual loss that results from, <em>[inter </em>alia,] an act or omission by a licensed contractor.\u201d \u00a7 8-405(a); <em>Fosler, </em>376 Md. at 131, 829 A.2d 271.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Subtitle 4 sets forth an administrative remedy before the Commission for claims against the Fund, and provides for a contested case hearing before the Commission and payments by the Commission to claimants. <em>Fosler, </em>376 Md. at 131, 829 A.2d 271. As we have said, prior to 2000, the maximum amount that a homeowner could recover from the Fund for actual loss due to the unsatisfactory work of a home improvement contractor was $10,000.00. By Chapter 144 of the Acts of 2000, the General Assembly increased that amount to $15,000.00.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As amended, \u00a7 8-405(e)(1) reads: \u201cThe Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>sion may not award from the Fund [ ] more than <em>$15,000 to 1 </em>claimant for acts or omissions of 1 contractor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">At the heart of this appeal is whether Landsman, having established an actual loss resulting from Somerville\u2019s abandonment of the job in December 1997, is entitled to benefit from the increased maximum amount provided under the 2000 amendment. The answer to this question is dictated by whether the amendment is to be applied retrospectively or prospectively.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">As we undertake to answer that question, we note preliminarily that \u201c[i]t is well settled that a reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that of the administrative agency or make its own findings of fact when reviewing the decision of an ALJ.\u201d <em>Maryland State Bd. of Pharm. v. Spencer, </em>150 Md.App. 138, 147-48, 819 A.2d 383, <em>cert. granted, </em>376 Md. 49, 827 A.2d 112 (2003); <em>accord Marzullo v. Kahl, </em>366 Md. 158, 172, 783 A.2d 169 (2001). Although \u201can administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts,\u201d <em>Marzullo, </em>366 Md. at 172, 783 A.2d 169, an agency\u2019s decision \u201cis owed no deference ... when it is based on erroneous legal conclusions,\u201d <em>Handley v. Ocean Downs, LLC, </em>151 Md.App. 615, 642, 827 A.2d 961 (2003). Therefore, \u201cwe \u2018must substitute [our] judgment for that of the agency if our interpretation of the applicable legal principles is different.\u2019 \u201d <em>Spencer, </em>150 Md.App. at 148, 819 A.2d 383 (quoting <em>Perini Servs., Inc. v. Maryland Health Res. Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>67 Md.App. 189, 201, 506 A.2d 1207, <em>cert. denied, </em>307 Md. 261, 513 A.2d 314 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>The question we decide in this case is one of statutory construction, not involving any special expertise of the Commission. Consequently, we owe no deference to the Commission\u2019s decision respecting the applicability of the amendment. <em>Angelini v. Harford County, </em>144 Md.App. 369, 373, 798 A.2d 26, <em>cert. denied, </em>370 Md. 269, 805 A.2d 265 (2002). Rather, we examine this purely legal question <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">\u201cWhether a statute operates retrospectively or only prospectively is in the first instance a question of legislative intent.\u201d <em>Tyrone W. v. Danielle R., </em>129 Md.App. 260, 277, 741 A.2d 553 (1999), <em>aff'd sub nom. Langston v. Riffe, </em>359 Md. 396, 754 A.2d 389 (2000). \u201c \u2018Because of the potential for interference with substantive rights, however, and because of the resulting prejudice against retroactive application,\u2019 a statute that affects substantive rights is presumed to operate prospectively.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>State of Maryland Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. Amecom Div. of Litton Sys., Inc., </em>278 Md. 120, 123, 360 A.2d 1 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">When, however, a statute affects only a procedure or remedy, and not a substantive right, the presumption in favor of prospective application does not apply. <em>Rawlings v. Rawlings, </em>362 Md. 535, 556, 766 A.2d 98 (2001); <em>Langston, </em>359 Md. at 408, 754 A.2d 389. Indeed, \u201c[a]bsent a contrary intent made manifest by the enacting authority, any change made by statute or court rule affecting a remedy only (and consequently not impinging on substantive rights) controls all court actions whether accrued, pending or future.\u201d <em>Aviles v. Eshelman Elec. Corp., </em>281 Md. 529, 533, 379 A.2d 1227 (1977); <em>accord State Admin. Bd. of Election Laws v. Supervisory Bd. of Elections of Baltimore City, </em>342 Md. 586, 601, 679 A.2d 96 (1996); <em>Grandison v. State, </em>341 Md. 175, 257, 670 A.2d 398 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 1027, 117 S.Ct. 581, 136 L.Ed.2d 512 (1996). These rules of construction apply equally to amendatory acts. <em>Tyrone W., </em>129 Md.App. at 278, 741 A.2d 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Remedial statutes are \u201c \u2018those which provide a remedy, or improve or facilitate remedies already existing for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>the enforcement of rights and the redress of injuries,\u2019 \u201d but do \u201c \u2018not affect substantive or vested rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Langston, </em>359 Md. at 408-09, 754 A.2d 389 (citation omitted). If, however, the statute provides a new form of relief that itself constitutes a substantive right, it is not purely remedial, and will not be presumed to apply retroactively. <em>Amecom, </em>278 Md. at 125, 360 A.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">The General Assembly did not expressly declare that its 2000 amendment of \u00a7 8-405(e)(l) was to be applied retrospectively. Neither is there anything in the scant legislative history of the amendment that indicates the legislative intent in this regard. We therefore follow the statutory construction principles laid out above to ascertain whether the amendment affects substantive rights or liabilities, in which case the strong presumption of prospectivity applies, or whether the amendment is purely procedural or remedial, in which case there is no presumption of prospectivity and the amendment will be applied retroactively. The Commission adheres to the position it took below, arguing that the 2000 amendment is neither procedural nor remedial in nature, and that it affects the substantive rights of home improvement contractors in this State. Landsman of course takes a contrary position. He does not argue that the amendment is procedural, but does argue that it is purely remedial.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The question whether the 2000 amendment to \u00a7 8-405(a)(l) is purely remedial is one that has not been resolved by either this Court or the Court of Appeals. Our decision in <em>Brzowski, </em>however, sheds some light on the issue because we had occasion in that case to construe portions of Subtitle 4 of the Home Improvement Law. In the course of doing so, we examined the legislative history of the subtitle.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\"><em>Brzowski </em>involved a contractor\u2019s challenge to the Commission\u2019s compensation of a claimant through the Fund pursuant to an arbitration award that did not comply with \u00a7 8-409(a)(2). That section requires that an arbitration award contain a statement by the arbitrator that he \u201cexpressly found on the merits that the claimant is entitled to recover under \u00a7 8-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>405(a) of this subtitle.\u201d <em>Brzowski </em>114 Md.App. at 621-22, 691 A.2d 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">After a thorough examination of the history of the Home Improvement Law, we concluded in <em>Brzowski </em>that the law was enacted for the protection of the public, and that the Fund provides \u201can additional remedy for homeowners who suffered actual loss\u201d due to the actions or omissions of a contractor. <em>Id. </em>at 627, 691 A.2d 699.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We conclude, here, that the 2000 amendment increasing the maximum award that can be awarded from the Fund is likewise remedial in the sense that it improves a remedy \u201calready existing for the enforcement of rights and the redress of injuries.\u201d <em>Langston, </em>359 Md. at 408, 754 A.2d 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Our determination that the amendment is remedial in this sense does not end the inquiry, however, because we must also determine whether retrospective application of the amendment would \u201cinterfere with vested or substantive rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 408, 418, 754 A.2d 389. As we consider this aspect of the issue, we bear in mind that \u201c \u2018[statutes which do not destroy a substantial right, but simply affect procedure or remedies, are not considered as destroying or impairing vested rights, for there is no vested right in any particular mode of procedure for the enforcement or defense of the right.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rawlings, </em>362 Md. at 561, 766 A.2d 98 (quoting <em>Winston v. Winston, </em>290 Md. 641, 650, 431 A.2d 1330 (1981)); <em>accord Dua v. Comcast Cable of Maryland, Inc., </em>370 Md. 604, 625-26, 805 A.2d 1061 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>In this case, the Commission interpreted the 2000 amendment to \u00a7 8 \u2014 405(e)(1) to apply only to actions arising out of contracts entered into on or after October 1, 2000, because of the increased \u201cpenalty\u201d to the contractor. In affirming that decision, the circuit court found that the 2000 amendment of \u00a7 8-405(e)(l) \u201cclearly creates new rights, new duties and new obligations thus effecting the substantive rights\u201d of both Landsman and the contractor. We of course do not review the decision of the circuit court; instead, we review that of the Commission. <em>Mehrling v. Nationwide Ins. Co., </em>371 Md. 40, 57, 806 A.2d 662 (2002). Regardless, we do not agree with the court that the 2000 amendment created new rights, duties, or obligations of either Landsman or Somerville.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Indeed, insofar as Landsman is concerned, the Commission does not even discuss the extent to which, if at all, the amendment created a new substantive right of Landsman and comparably situated homeowners. In any case, Landsman did not have a vested, legally enforceable right to compensation from the Fund until July 24, 2001, the date on which the Commission determined that he was entitled to compensation. We so conclude by resort to our decision in <em>McComas v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Bd., </em>88 Md.App. 143, 594 A.2d 583 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">In <em>McComas, </em>we addressed the question of whether an amendment to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act, establishing for the first time a ceiling for the award of benefits under the Act, applied to claims that were pending prior to the effective date of the amendment. We said that rights created by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act are purely statutory and, unless vested, may be amended or repealed \u201cat the whim of the legislature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 150, 594 A.2d 583; <em>see also id. </em>at 149, 594 A.2d 583 (discussing cases). We also said that a crime victim does not have a substantive right to benefits under the Act. Instead, the victim has only an expectation of receiving benefits unless and until the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board determines that statutory requirements for the award of benefits have been met, at which time, but not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>before, the right to an award becomes vested. <em>Id. </em>at 150, 594 A.2d 583. Observing that amendments to purely statutory rights are not bound by the general rule that statutes are presumed to apply prospectively, <em>id., </em>we said, \u201c[ajbsent a saving provision or some other clear expression by the legislature that it intends to protect claims that are pending on the date of enactment, an amendment of a purely statutory right affects all claims not yet vested,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 150-51, 594 A.2d 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">We recognize that in the case <em>sub judice </em>we are dealing with an amendment that increases a statutory benefit, rather than reducing one, as was the case in <em>McComas. </em>We nevertheless find instructive the discussion in <em>McComas </em>identifying when a statutorily bestowed benefit vests. Like the right to compensation under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act granted the crime victim in <em>McComas, </em>Landsman\u2019s right to compensation from the Fund is a creature of statute. Amendments to such rights are not bound by the usual presumption against retrospective application, and these rights are subject to change \u201cat the whim of the legislature.\u201d Furthermore, <em>McComas </em>teaches that Landsman\u2019s right to an award under the Act vested only when the Commission determined that he was eligible to be compensated. By that time the amendment increasing the maximum award from the Fund had been in effect for nearly a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Nor do we agree with the Commission that the 2000 amendment affected any substantive rights or liabilities of Somer-ville. Among other arguments, the Commission contends that the amendment acted as an increased penalty to Somerville and other similarly situated contractors. We reject that argument, for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">First, it cannot be gainsaid that \u201cthere can be no vested right to do wrong.\u201d <em>Randall v. Kreiger, </em>23 Wall. 137, 90 U.S. 137, 149, 23 L.Ed. 124 (1874); <em>accord Tyrone </em>W., 129 Md.App. at 289, 741 A.2d 553. Second, as Landsman points out, the right to seek an award from the Fund is in addition to Landsman\u2019s right to recover damages from Somerville by filing suit for the lull loss resulting from Somerville\u2019s abandon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>ment of the work that had been the subject of the parties\u2019 contract. Consequently, the remedy provided under the Home Improvement Law creates no financial liability on the part of the contractor beyond that which the contractor faces in a court of law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The Commission points out that an award from the Fund results not only <em>in </em>a monetary debt to the contractor, but also in a potential license suspension.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is this \u201cpenalty,\u201d the Commission argues, that affects the contractor\u2019s substantive rights. We do not see the issue quite as the Commission does.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">To be sure, we recognized in <em>Brzowski </em>that, \u201c[w]hen the Commission orders payment from the Fund, serious repercussions can be visited upon the contractor responsible for the actual loss that the Fund payment sought to compensate.\u201d 114 Md.App. at 629, 691 A.2d 699. \u201c[I]f the Commission pays any amount from the Fund on account of a contractor\u2019s conduct, the Commission may suspend the contractor\u2019s license <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>if he fails to reimburse the Fund in full.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This, naturally, \u201ccan have dire consequences for a contractor,\u201d since \u201c[a] person may not act as contractor in this state without a contractor\u2019s license.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And, once the Commission pays a claim against the Fund, the rights of the claimant against the contractor are subrogated to the Commission to the extent of the amount paid to the claimant from the Fund; consequently, the Commission may sue any contractor on whose account a claim was paid, if the contractor does not reimburse the Fund in full, including interest. <em>Id. </em>at 630, 691 A.2d 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Yet, nothing in the legislative history of the Home Improvement Law evidences an intent by the General Assembly to treat the Fund as a penalty to contractors. The Senate Economic and Environmental Affairs Committee construed an actual loss to mean, simply, \u201c \u2018the amounts paid or payable for the cost of \u201cmaking good.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 639, 691 A.2d 699 (quoting Senate Economic and Environmental Affairs Committee, Bill Analysis for Senate Bill 507 at 3 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Moreover, there are safeguards in the Home Improvement Law to insure that the Commission does not treat the Fund as a means of penalizing contractors. As we explained in <em>Brzow-ski,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">Section 8-409 <footnotemark>[9]</footnotemark> of the Act serves as a check on the Commission\u2019s ability to use the Fund as a club to punish contractors who are on the losing end of arbitration awards or judicial decisions. To this end, the section specifies the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>requirements that must be met before the Commission may order payment of a claim against the Fund.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><em>Id. </em>We went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">When the Commission conducts its own hearing on whether a claimant should be compensated from the Fund, it is presumed that the Commission is aware of the Fund\u2019s limited purpose, to compensate for actual loss as defined by section 8-401. Thus, any award the Commission makes from the Fund must be for actual loss, because the Commission is presumed to know the scope of its authority, and act within those bounds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 631, 691 A.2d 699.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">In short, the potential for a license suspension does not create \u201ca penalty\u201d for contractors. <em>Cf. State v. Jones, </em>340 Md. 235, 251-54, 666 A.2d 128 (1995) (explaining that professional license suspensions and revocations generally serve remedial, not punitive, purposes).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">The Commission also argues that the award of a license creates a substantive right, presumably in retention of that license. The Commission cites a treatise, which states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak\">[o]nce the state issues a license, the continued possession of and the right to operate under the authority of the license may be essential to the livelihood of the licensee. Suspension or revocation of a license by the state necessarily involves state action that affects <em>an important interest </em>of the licensee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">William Otis Morris, Revocation Of Professional Licenses By Governmental Agencies, \u00a7 2-1, at 15-16 (1984) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">We, however, draw a distinction between \u201can important interest\u201d and \u201ca substantive right.\u201d The Administrative Procedure Act defines a license as \u201call or any part of permission that: (1) is required by law to be obtained from an agency; (2) is not required only for revenue purposes; and (3) is in any form, including: (i) an approval; (ii) a certificate; (iii) a charter; (iv) a permit; or (v) a registration.\u201d Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-202(f) of the State Government Article. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number><em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary at 931 (7th ed.1999) (defining a license as \u201c[a] revocable permission to commit some act that would otherwise be unlawful\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">It has thus been said that a professional license is not \u201can absolute vested right,\u201d but is at most \u201conly a conditional right which is subordinate to the police power of the State to protect and preserve the public health\u201d and welfare. <em>Dr. K. v. State Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance, </em>98 Md.App. 103, 120, 632 A.2d 453 (1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>334 Md. 18, 637 A.2d 1191, <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 817, 115 S.Ct. 75, 130 L.Ed.2d 29 (1994). Because a license is only the grant of permission to act, the Commission\u2019s authority to suspend a contractor\u2019s license for non-repayment into the Fund does not interfere with a substantive or vested right of the contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The Commission asserts that \u201c[rjetroactive application of the increased award limit to a January 1997 contract would raise serious due process issues, because it would impose additional liability upon a contractor that he could not reasonably have foreseen at the time of the contract, in January 1997.\u201d The Commission specifies that at the time the home improvement contract was entered into, neither Landsman nor Somerville \u201ccould have had the slightest inkling the General Assembly was preparing to increase the Guaranty Fund limit to $15,000 some 44 months later.\u201d The Commission further argues that Somerville entered into the contract in 1997 under the belief that the extent of its liability to the Fund was $10,000.00; therefore, a statutory increase of $5,000.00 to the contractor\u2019s maximum liability, without notice or reasonable expectation, constitutes a due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Landsman responds that applying the 2000 amendment in this case would not deprive Somerville of any vested right in the additional $5,000.00, because the Commission itself has already determined that Landsman has incurred an actual loss of more than $42,000.00 due to Somerville\u2019s abandonment of the home improvement project. We agree with Landsman.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">\u201cThe Constitution of Maryland prohibits legislation which retroactively abrogates vested rights. No matter how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>\u2018rational\u2019 under particular circumstances, the State is constitutionally precluded from abolishing a vested property right or taking one person\u2019s property and giving it to someone else.\u201d <em>Dua, </em>370 Md. at 623, 805 A.2d 1061. The Court of Appeals stated in <em>Dua </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-4\">[i]t is clear that retrospective statutes abrogating vested property rights (including contractual rights) violate the Maryland Constitution.... [T]he particular provisions of the Constitution which are violated by such acts are Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights and Article III, \u00a7 40, of the Constitution.... A statute having the effect of abrogating a vested property right, and not providing for compensation, does \u201cauthorize private property, to be taken ..., without just compensation\u201d (Article III, \u00a7 40). Concomitantly, such a statute results in a person or entity being \u201cdeprived of his ... property\u201d contrary to the \u201claw of the land.\u201d (Article 24).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 629-30, 805 A.2d 1061. We discern no such due process concerns in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Of relevance here is the principle that \u201c \u2018[cjlaims contrary to justice and equity cannot be regarded as\u2019 \u201d vested, because \u201c \u2018[t]he only right taken away is the right dishonestly to repudiate an honest contract or conveyance to the injury of the other party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tyrone W., </em>129 Md.App. at 289, 741 A.2d 553 (quoting <em>Randall, </em>90 U.S. at 149). Landsman and Somer-ville contracted for Somerville to undertake a home improvement project for Landsman at an agreed upon price. Somer-ville abandoned the project before completion and refused to repay Landsman for the work that Somerville failed to complete. The actual loss to Landsman was $42,395.41.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">It is plain that the only deprivation of property at issue is that of Landsman. Somerville simply does not have a vested right in being shielded from the additional $5,000.00 owing to the Fund upon payment of Landsman\u2019s claim. Consequently, Somerville was not entitled to either notice or a reasonable expectation of retaining that sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>The Commission also intimates some due process problem attendant to the potential for license suspension upon a contractor\u2019s failure to reimburse the Fund the full $15,000.00 in a situation comparable to the one presented by this case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To the extent the Commission makes such an argument, we reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">We fail to see how a contractor is entitled to a license where there has been a determination by the Commission that the contractor\u2019s acts or omissions have caused actual loss to a claimant. A license is essentially a privilege, not a \u201cvested right.\u201d We therefore conclude that suspension of a contractor\u2019s license pursuant to \u00a7 8-All does not infringe upon a property right protected by the Maryland Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">For the reasons we have discussed, we conclude that the 2000 amendment to \u00a7 8 \u2014 405(e)(1) is a remedial act that does not interfere with a vested or substantial right of either the homeowner or the contractor. We shall therefore apply the rule that such acts will be construed as having retrospective application unless the legislature has made it clear that the legislation be prospective. <em>Aviles, </em>281 Md. at 533, 379 A.2d 1227.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The enacting legislation provides that the effective date of the Act is October 1, 2000. Aside from that, the General Assembly did not expressly declare in the enacting legislation (or, for that matter, indicate in any way in its legislative history) that the maximum award provided by the amendment to \u00a7 8-405(e)(.l) would be prospective only.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We hold, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>fore, that the Commission erred when it refused to apply the increased maximum recovery from the Fund to Landsman\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY VACATED.

Both before and since the 2000 amendment to \u00a7 8-405(e)(l), the Home Improvement Law has provided that a contractor is required, on pain of license suspension, to repay the Fund for the full amount, with interest, of any claim paid from the Fund.
