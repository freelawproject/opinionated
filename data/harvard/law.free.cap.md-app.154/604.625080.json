In other words, was the second permittee, in this chain of possession, covered by the MAIF policy?</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">To answer that question, we begin by identifying the parties and the roles they played in this matter. We start with the insured, Dennis Ray Drewery. He lent his car to his son and namesake, Dennis Ray, Jr., who in turn allowed his friend, Leo J. Stevenson, to drive the automobile to the home of a mutual acquaintance. That proved to be a mistake with tortious consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">Shortly after Stevenson took over the wheel of the car, it collided with a parked car, causing that vehicle to strike a pedestrian, appellant Donald Andrew. As a result of that collision, Andrew incurred medical expenses and suffered a loss of wages, for which he was compensated by appellant, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (Liberty Mutual). That led Liberty Mutual and Andrew to file a declaratory judgment action in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, requesting a determination that Stevenson, as second permittee, was covered by Drewery, Sr.\u2019s MAIF policy and that MAIF <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>should therefore indemnify them for all costs and expenses they incurred as a result of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Although Andrew, Stevenson, and both Drewerys were named as parties to this suit, at bottom, it was, and remains, essentially a coverage dispute between appellant Liberty Mutual and appellee MAIF. Consequently, we will cast our discussion in terms of those two entities, which are in fact the principal parties in interest here.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">To the chagrin of Liberty Mutual, the circuit court, after a bench trial, declared that Stevenson was not covered under the MAIF policy and denied its request for indemnification. Liberty Mutual then noted this appeal presenting two issues that can be stated as one: \u201cDid the trial court err in concluding that Stevenson was not covered under the MAIF policy?\u201d For the reasons that follow, we shall hold that it did not and affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">At trial, the parties agreed to submit the depositions of both Drewerys in lieu of live testimony. In fact, the only witness to testify at trial was a MAIF adjuster, who testified as to the insurance policy Drewery had with MAIF. Consequently, the facts presented below are culled from the Drewerys\u2019 depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">On March 27, 1997, Dennis Ray Drewery, Sr.\u2019s former wife telephoned him to ask if their son, Dennis Ray Drewery, Jr., could use Drewery, Sr.\u2019s car to take her to work. Her place of employment was in Washington, D.C. Drewery, Sr. agreed to this request, and Drewery, Jr. arrived at his house to pick up the car. At that time, Drewery, Sr. instructed his son that he was to use the car to take his mother to work and then to bring the car back. Although Drewery, Sr., did not, on that occasion, instruct his son not to let anyone else drive the car, he had, in the past, \u201calways told him\u201d that only he could drive the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">After leaving his father\u2019s house, Drewery, Jr. picked up a friend, Leo Stevenson, before driving to his mother\u2019s resi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>dence. With Stevenson, he picked up his mother and dropped her off at work. After leaving his mother\u2019s place of employment, the pair decided to visit Stevenson\u2019s cousin Rashad in Washington, D.C. Because Drewery, Jr. did not \u201cknow [his] way around there,\u201d he let Stevenson drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">After picking up Rashad, the three men left Rashad\u2019s residence, with Stevenson still driving. On the way back to the residence of Drewery\u2019s mother, Stevenson struck a parked truck. The parked truck was propelled forward by the impact, striking and injuring Donald Leroy Andrew, an employee of the Flippo Construction Company. After the accident, Liberty Mutual, the worker\u2019s compensation insurance carrier for Flippo, paid Andrew worker\u2019s compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Liberty Mutual subsequently filed a complaint for declaratory relief in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, requesting a declaration that Stevenson was covered under Drewery, Sr.\u2019s automobile insurance policy with MAIF and that MAIF was therefore required to indemnify Liberty Mutual for compensation payments made to Andrew. The omnibus clause of the MAIF policy provided, in part, \u201c[i]nsured means: 1. you and any person while using the covered automobile with your permission; 2. any person or organization legally responsible for the use of the covered automobile provided its actual use is by you or with your permission.\u201d Relying on that clause, MAIF denied coverage on the grounds that, at the time of the accident, Stevenson did not have Drewery, Sr.\u2019s permission to operate the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">A bench trial was held to determine whether Stevenson was covered under the MAIF policy. At the conclusion of that proceeding, the circuit court declared that Stevenson was not, because he \u201cdid not have the express permission of the insured, Dennis Ray Drewery, Sr.\u201d to drive his car and because \u201cboth father and son ... had a mutual understanding that the driving would be restricted to the son when the car was lent to him.\u201d After the court issued a written order declaring the rights and obligations of the parties consistent with its ruling, Liberty Mutual noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">Because the trial below was a non-jury trial, our standard of review is governed by Maryland Rule 8-131. <em>Boyd v. State, </em>22 Md.App. 539, 323 A.2d 684, <em>cert. denied, </em>272 Md. 738 (1974). That rule provides that this Court \u201cwill not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d Md. Rule 8-131(c). \u201cA finding of a trial court is not clearly erroneous if there is competent or material evidence in the record to support the court\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Lemley v. Lemley, </em>109 Md.App. 620, 628, 675 A.2d 596 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Moreover, \u201c[ujnder the clearly erroneous standard, this Court does not sit as a second trial court, reviewing all the facts to determine whether an appellant has proven his case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nor is it our function to weigh conflicting evidence. <em>Bausch &amp; Lomb, Inc. v. Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>355 Md. 566, 586-87, 735 A.2d 1081 (1999); <em>Weisman v. Connors, </em>76 Md.App. 488, 547 A.2d 636 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>314 Md. 497, 551 A.2d 868 (1989). Our task is limited to deciding whether the circuit court\u2019s factual findings were supported by \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d in the record. <em>GMC v. Schmitz, </em>362 Md. 229, 234, 764 A.2d 838 (2001)(quoting <em>Ryan v. Thurston, </em>276 Md. 390, 392, 347 A.2d 834, 835-36 (1975)). And, in doing so, we must view all the evidence \u201cin a light most favorable to the prevailing party.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Although the factual determinations of the circuit court are afforded significant deference on review, its legal determinations are not. \u201c \u2018[T]he clearly erroneous standard for appellate review in [Maryland Rule 8-131] section (c) ... does not apply to a trial court\u2019s determinations of legal questions or conclusions of law based on findings of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ins. Co. of N. Am. v. Miller, </em>362 Md. 361, 372, 765 A.2d 587 (2001)(quoting <em>Heat &amp; Power Corp. v. Air Prods. &amp; Chem. Inc., </em>320 Md. 584, 591, 578 A.2d 1202, 1205 (1990)). Indeed, the appropriate inquiry for such determinations is whether the circuit court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>was \u201clegally correct.\u201d <em>Maryland Envtl. Trust v. Gaynor, </em>140 Md.App. 433, 440, 780 A.2d 1193 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Liberty Mutual contends that the circuit court erred in holding that Stevenson was not covered under the MAIF policy when the accident occurred. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The MAIF policy states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">We agree to pay, on behalf of the insured, all sums which the insured becomes legally obligated to pay for bodily injury and property damage caused by an accident and arising out of the ownership, patent or use of a covered automobile.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">It then defines an \u201cinsured\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-10\">1. You and any person while using a covered automobile with your permission;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-11\">2. Any person or organization legally responsible for the use of a covered automobile provided its actual use is by you or with your permission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">To qualify as an insured under that policy, Stevenson must fall within either of these two definitions. He does not. At the time of the accident, he was not operating the covered automobile with the permission of the owner and insured, Drewery, Sr., as the Circuit Court concluded, and therefore does not fall within either definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-13\">Appellant contends, however, that Stevenson was covered by the policy because his operation of the vehicle had not been expressly forbidden by Drewery, Sr.; because he was operating the car on behalf of the person, who was given permission to use the vehicle, Drewery, Jr.; and because no restrictions had been imposed on the use of the vehicle. Appellant further claims that the circuit court applied the wrong case in arriving at what appellant describes as an \u201cerroneous\u201d conclusion. Instead of <em>Bond v. Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l Mut. Cas. Ins. Co., </em>289 Md. 379, 424 A.2d 765 (1981), the circuit court should have followed, according to appellant, the reasoning of this Court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number><em>Maryland Indem. Ins. Co. v. Kornke, 21 </em>Md.App. 178, 319 A.2d 603 (1974). Had it done so, appellant contends, the circuit court would have found that Stevenson was operating the covered automobile within the permission granted to Drewery, Jr. to use the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">There was, however, ample evidence presented that, at the time that Stevenson was operating the covered vehicle, there was, as the circuit court put it, a \u201cmutual understanding\u201d between father and son \u201cthat the driving would be restricted to the son when the car was lent to him.\u201d In support of that conclusion, the court first quotes the following testimony of Drewery, Sr.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">Q. Okay. Now, do you recall saying anything to your son about anyone else driving the vehicle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">A. Not that day, but always like I have let my son drive the vehicle, you know, through the past, and I have always told him, you know, that only, you know, him can drive the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">It then cites the testimony of Drewery, Jr.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-9\">A. I was told not to let anyone drive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-10\">Q. You have no recollection of your father saying anything that morning that would alter that understanding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-11\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">But that was not the only evidence of the understanding between the father and son as to the son\u2019s restricted use of the car \u2014 only the evidence that was expressly mentioned by the circuit court. In addition to that testimony, on two other occasions during his deposition, Drewery, Sr. restated his belief that he and his son had an understanding that when the car was loaned to his son only his son could drive it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-13\">Q. Okay. Now, do you have any recollection on the morning of March 27, 1997 of saying anything that would give your son the impression that it was okay for someone else to use the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-14\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-15\">And then he testified later:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>A. I know I had always told my son don\u2019t let anyone drive, so I couldn\u2019t understand why he let someone else drive the car, when he was the one that was supposed to have been driving.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Thus, the circuit court was correct in concluding that when Drewery, Jr. let Stevenson drive the vehicle, he violated that understanding. Moreover, contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, there is substantial evidence that the vehicle was only to be used by Drewery, Jr. to transport his mother to and from work and not for any other purpose. Drewery, Sr. testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">Q. Okay. Tell me to the best of your recollection, and as word for word as you can recall, what you said to him and what he said to you concerning him borrowing the car that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">A. Okay. The reason why I let him use the car that day was like his mother\u2019s ear was in the shop and she had to go to work, so I let him use the car to take her to work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">Q. What conversation is there between you and him concerning him using the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-9\">A. Okay. He was supposed to have been using the car to take her and bring the car back.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">Thus, two out of three of appellant\u2019s assertions are flatly contradicted by the record, namely, that, at the time of the accident, there were no limitations imposed by Drewery, Sr. on who could drive the covered vehicle and for what purpose it could be used. It is therefore clear that Stevenson did not have Drewery, Sr.\u2019s permission to either drive the vehicle or to use it to pick up his cousin, Rashad. Because Drewery, Jr. was prohibited from allowing others to drive his father\u2019s vehicle, and because the vehicle was on the way back from an unauthorized detour when the accident occurred, Stevenson was not covered by the MAIF policy. Moreover, as we shall see, appellant\u2019s claim that the court erroneously relied on <em>Bond </em>and not <em>Komke </em>in deciding this case is without merit, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>it is <em>Bond </em>which is applicable to the instant case and <em>Komke </em>which is distinguishable from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">In <em>Bond, </em>the car owner and insured gave her daughter permission to drive her car but instructed her that she was not to allow anyone else to drive the vehicle. 289 Md. at 384, 424 A.2d 765. The persons insured under the owner\u2019s insurance policy were the owner as the \u201cnamed insured\u201d and \u201cany other person using such automobile with the permission of the named insured, provided his actual operation or (if he is not operating) his other actual use thereof is within the scope of such permission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381, 424 A.2d 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Disregarding her mother\u2019s instruction, the daughter not only permitted a friend to drive the car but was not even present when the accident occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 383, 424 A.2d 765. The vehicle\u2019s only passenger was not so fortunate, and, as a result of the accident, suffered injuries. Seeking compensation for those injuries, the passenger filed a declaratory judgment against the insurer of the vehicle, among others, to determine the extent of the driver\u2019s coverage. <em>Id. </em>at 382, 424 A.2d 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Concluding that the car, at the time of the accident, \u201cwas not being used by anyone who was authorized expressly or by implication to use the car,\u201d the circuit court held that the owner\u2019s policy did not cover the accident and therefore that her insurance company was under no obligation to defend the driver or pay any judgment rendered against her. <em>Id. </em>at 383, 424 A.2d 765 (emphasis omitted). Affirming the circuit court, the Court of Appeals stated: \u201cThe reason we conclude that appellant Bond cannot prevail here ... is that once the trier of fact determined (as without being clearly erroneous he did in this case) that the named insured \u2018had <em>specifically </em>restricted her daughter, Kathy, from allowing anybody ... to drive the car,\u2019 and that this express ban was operative when the accident occurred, there is no escape from Judge Raine\u2019s further conclusion that \u2018you cannot imply something in face of an express statement to the contrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 385, 424 A.2d 765 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Appellant maintains, however, that <em>Bond </em>is distinguishable from the instant case because in <em>Bond </em>\u201cthe policy at the heart of [the] matter was significantly different from the MAIF policy.\u201d We disagree. The language in the <em>Bond </em>policy, to which appellant refers is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Persons Insured: Under the Liability and Medical Expense Coverages, the following are insureds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">(a) with respect to an owned automobile,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">(1) the named insured,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">(2) any other person using such automobile with the permission of the named insured, provided his actual operation or (if he is not operating) his other actual use thereof is within the scope of such permission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 381, 424 A.2d 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">We perceive no substantive differences between this language and the language of Drewery, Sr.\u2019s policy that would lead us to conclude that Drewery, Sr.\u2019s policy provides broader coverage and covers an unauthorized driver on an unauthorized trip. We therefore reach the same conclusion as the <em>Bond </em>court did, namely, that the owner\u2019s insurance company is not the primary insurer in instances where the owner of the covered vehicle has not given express or implied permission to the second permittee to drive his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">Moreover, appellant\u2019s reliance upon <em>Kornke </em>for contrary authority is misplaced. Indeed, <em>Kornke, </em>as noted, is factually distinguishable from the instant case. In <em>Kornke, </em>the issue before this Court was whether the omnibus clause of an automobile liability insurance policy covered a second permit-tee, who was in an accident, while operating the insured vehicle in fulfillment of the purpose for which the owner had entrusted the vehicle to the first permittee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 21 Md.App. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>179, 319 A.2d 603. In that case, the owner of the covered car allowed his son to borrow the vehicle to drive a group of friends to a farm. He instructed his son that he was not to allow anyone else to drive the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">On the way to the farm, the car began to backfire. To find out what was wrong, the son pulled over to the side of the road. While attempting to fix the problem, the son crossed some engine wires and received an electric shock. The shock was strong enough to knock him down. Fearful that he was no longer able to drive the car, he allowed a passenger to drive the remainder of the way to the farm. On the last leg of the trip, the vehicle struck a bridge abutment, injuring the vehicle\u2019s two passengers. <em>Id. </em>at 182-83, 319 A.2d 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Bringing a declaratory judgment action, the father\u2019s insurance company argued that the insurance company of the driver was the \u201cprimary insurer\u201d and, as such, was required to provide coverage and a defense in the personal injury suits brought by the passengers of the car against the driver. The circuit court disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Affirming that decision, this Court observed that \u201c[u]pon these facts the trial court could readily conclude that 1) William Kornke, Jr. [son] received permission from his father ... to use the father\u2019s car ... and 2) Kornke, Jr., in turn, consented to the operation of the car by Lynanne Hampshire [the driver at the time of the accident] for the continuation of the trip.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183, 319 A.2d 603. We therefore framed the issue as follows: \u201cThe question for decision ... is whether in these circumstances the use of the car continued, until the time of the accident, with the permission of Kornke, Sr., [father] and the effect of the express prohibition, repeatedly communicated by father to son, against allowing anyone else to drive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183-84, 319 A.2d 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>We then noted that in determining whether the use of a vehicle falls within the omnibus clause \u201c \u2018one must examine the total facts,\u2019 and the facts of paramount significance respecting a clause for permitted use ... do not pertain to the identity of the driver but to whether at the time of the accident the operation of the car was for a purpose germane to the permission granted.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192, 319 A.2d 603. \u201cCertainly, at the time of the accident,\u201d we observed, \u201cthe operation of the car by the second permittee was for a purpose germane to the permission granted by father to son----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 193, 319 A.2d 603. We therefore concluded that \u201cWilliam, Jr. [son] was still \u2018using\u2019 his father\u2019s car, even though Lynanne Hampshire was driving the car at the time of the accident, and that the \u2018actual use\u2019 was with the permission of [the father].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the omnibus clause of the father\u2019s insurance policy covered the second permittee.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Even though Stevenson was driving because he reportedly knew the D.C. area better than Drewery, Jr., the operation of Drewery, Sr.\u2019s car was not \u201cfor a purpose germane to the permission granted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There is no dispute that Drewery, Jr. was given permission to use the car only for the purpose of taking his mother to work. After completing that task, Drew-ery, Jr. and Stevenson decided, without consulting Drewery, Sr., to continue on into the District of Columbia to pick up Stevenson\u2019s cousin. Since Drewery, Jr. was not granted permission to use the car for any other purpose than to take his mother to work, the use of the car at the time of the accident was outside of the scope of the permission granted. Therefore, the circuit court did not err in finding that Stevenson was not covered under the MAIF policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT AFFIRMED.
