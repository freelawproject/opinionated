Goshorn, a judgment of absolute divorce from appel-lee, Edna D. Goshorn and then, in words that are to play a key role in this appeal, \u201cordered that all other issues, including child support, custody and marital property have been reserved and set for a future date before the Honorable Warren J. Krug in this Court.\u201d No specific juristic mention was made of alimony. When, a year later, the circuit court awarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Mrs. Goshorn indefinite alimony, that omission would create this appeal\u2019s first issue: was alimony one of the \u201cother issues\u201d reserved for \u201ca future date\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">The second issue is a little more prosaic. It asks us to determine whether the circuit court misapplied the twelve factor test of Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 11-106(b) of the Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d) in awarding Mrs. Goshorn indefinite alimony. While the second issue is almost routine in cases such as this, the third issue is not. It takes us into less familiar territory and asks that we consider the duty of a noncustodial parent (in this instance, Mrs. Goshorn) to support a handicapped adult child, specifically, one who is not self-supporting but who is presently receiving Social Security Income (\u201cSSI\u201d) benefits until she reaches the age of twenty-one. The handicapped adult child at issue here is Sarah, the oldest of the parties\u2019 three children. After awarding custody of the two other children to Mr. Goshorn and finding, by agreement of the parties, that the eighteen year old Sarah was a \u201cdestitute adult child\u201d under FL \u00a7\u00a7 13~101(b), the circuit court did not include her in calculating Mrs. Goshorn\u2019s child support obligation because Sarah was temporarily receiving SSI assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Claiming error, Mr. Goshorn challenges the jurisdiction of the circuit court to belatedly award indefinite alimony to Mrs. Goshorn, the circuit court\u2019s application of the twelve factor alimony test, and the exclusion of the parties\u2019 adult child by that same court from Mrs. Goshorn\u2019s child support obligation. We can only grant him partial relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The circuit court, we hold, did have jurisdiction to make an award of indefinite alimony to Mrs Goshorn. Nonetheless, we shall vacate that award because of a judicial error made in calculating Mr. Goshorn\u2019s income. A vacation of an alimony award requires a vacation of any concomitant monetary award because the two must be considered in tandem. Consequently, we shall also vacate Mrs. Goshorn\u2019s monetary award so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>that the court may make any adjustment in alimony or to that award it deems appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Furthermore, we shall vacate the circuit court\u2019s child support award, as it was calculated without considering that Sarah may be without any SSI assistance once she reaches the age of twenty-one. The record and the briefs suggest that the SSI benefits are only temporary, and counsel was unable to clarify, during argument before this Court, whether Sarah will still be eligible for those or other benefits once she turns twenty-one. There is, moreover, no basis in the record for the court to conclude that Sarah\u2019s SSI benefits provide her with an appropriate level of support.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">The parties had been married for twenty years when they separated in June 2000. During their marriage, they had three children: Sarah, born on July 28, 1983; John Jr., born on August 5, 1988; and Zachary, born on May 21, 1992. Sarah, the oldest child, was bom with Down\u2019s Syndrome. Although now an adult, Sarah functions at the level of a three or four year old, and the parties agree that she cannot support herself. Because of her disability, Sarah receives $545 per month in SSI benefits; those payments apparently cease when she turns twenty-one.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Mr. Goshorn, an employee of the United States Bureau of the Census for over thirty years, was the primary breadwinner of the family, while Mrs. Goshorn devoted herself, for the most part, to the care of the parties\u2019 children. In fact, Mrs. Goshorn stopped working shortly after Sarah\u2019s birth. Three years after that, Mrs. Goshorn obtained a daycare license that permitted her to operate a small daycare business out of the family home,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which she did for approximately ten years. The daycare business allowed Mrs. Goshorn to stay at home and raise the children, while providing additional income for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>family. With the problems that Sarah faced, the arrangement \u201cworked out pretty fair,\u201d observed Mr. Goshorn.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">After her daycare business ended,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mrs. Goshorn went to work for the Kmart Corporation part-time and for the Calvert County School System as a part-time cook. Eventually, she left both jobs to work full-time as a cook for the Prince George\u2019s County School System, the position she currently holds. As a full-time cook, Mrs. Goshorn earns $9.36 an hour and works thirty hours a week. Although she works only thirty hours a week, the circuit court, without objection from Mrs. Goshorn, imputed forty hours of work a week to Mrs. Goshorn and, based on that number of hours, concluded that she earned $1622.40 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Making further professional advancement problematic, Mrs. Goshorn reads at a third grade level- and, as her testimony disclosed, she had great difficulty in understanding and preparing a financial statement for the divorce proceedings. Given \u201cMrs. Goshom\u2019s education and her skills,\u201d the circuit court concluded, \u201cit is impossible for her to be wholly self-supporting. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">In June 2000, Mrs. Goshorn took the children and left the marital home to move in with her sister in St. Mary\u2019s County. There, she lived with her children, her sister, and her brother-in-law in a house that was partly owned by a Mr. James Boswell. At some point a relationship between Mr. Boswell and appellee developed because, at the time of the divorce proceedings, the two were living together. That living arrangement apparently began when Boswell moved into the St. Mary\u2019s house in November 2000. Several months later, Mr. Boswell and Mrs. Goshorn moved to Lusby, Maryland, where they rented a three bedroom home and shared expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">On July 21, 2000, Mr. Goshom filed a complaint for absolute divorce in the Circuit Court for Calvert County seeking principally a divorce, custody of the parties\u2019 children, and child support.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A year later, on August 9, 2001, Mrs. Goshom responded by filing a counterclaim, seeking a divorce, custody of the two minor children (Sarah having by now reached adulthood), child support, and permanent alimony. Before the counterclaim was filed, however, a custody hearing was held on February 18, 2001. Seven months after that, the circuit court issued an order, granting the parties joint custody of the minor children, but awarding Mr. Goshom primary \u201cphysical and residential custody\u201d of all three children on a <em>pendente lite </em>basis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">On August 16, 2001, the parties appeared before a domestic relations master solely on the issue of the divorce. At the conclusion of that hearing, the master stated he was \u201csatisfied that there\u2019s been sufficient evidence produced to grant [Mr. Goshorn] an actual divorce from his wife, Edna Goshom.\u201d The next day, the Circuit Court for Calvert County granted Mr. Goshorn a judgment of absolute divorce. In doing so, it stated \u201cthat all other issues, including child support, custody and marital property have been reserved and set for a future date before the Honorable Warren J. Krug in this Court....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">A hearing on the issues reserved began on January 23, 2002, and continued on April 18, 2002. On the first day of what was, despite its conclusion three months later, only a two-day hearing, Mr. Goshorn\u2019s counsel moved to prohibit any testimony relating to alimony on the ground that the divorce decree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>\u201cdid not reserve alimony specifically.\u201d Disagreeing, Mrs. Goshorn\u2019s attorney asserted that he had raised the issue during the divorce hearing, that opposing counsel had orally assured him that it was preserved, and that the court\u2019s divorce decree reserved \u201call other issues.\u201d After hearing from both sides, the court ruled that it was \u201creserv[ing] on the alimony issue,\u201d but would permit Mrs. Goshorn to testify about matters relevant to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">When that hearing concluded three months later, the circuit court awarded Mrs. Goshorn indefinite alimony in the amount of $1,500 a month. In doing so, it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">Okay. Let me address the issue of alimony first. In looking at the factors in 11.106, the Court has to consider the twelve factors that are listed in that section: the ability of the party seeking alimony to be wholly or partly self-supporting. I think in view of Mrs. Goshorn\u2019s education and her skills that is impossible for her to be wholly self-supporting and it would be very difficult for her \u2014 she can partly self-support herself, but I think not to the extent that she can fully self-support herself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">The time necessary for her to gain sufficient education and training to enable the party to find suitable employment, I don\u2019t think that would be possible in light of her education and her skills.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">The standard of living the parties have established. I agree they\u2019ve established a middle income or a fairly reasonable standard of living. Nothing outlandish. Nothing\u2014 I think it\u2019s a fairly modest standard of living.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">Duration of the marriage. The parties were married about twenty years, twenty-one years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-10\">Contributions, monetary and non-monetary of each party to the well-being of the family. I think they both contributed. Mr. Goshorn was the primary breadwinner. Mrs. Goshorn was home raising the children, caring for them. Also did some \u2014 had some income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-11\">Circumstances that contributed to the estrangement of the parties. I think that\u2019s a fairly neutral factor. I think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>these parties just grew apart. Mrs. Goshorn testified that Mr. Goshorn was controlling and that was something that wras not acceptable to her, and I think they finally grew apart.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">Age of the parties. There is a few years age difference. I think, what, eight or nine years difference in the ages. Somewhere around that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">Physical and mental condition of each party. Both parties seem to be physically in good shape and mentally in good shape except that Mr. Goshom\u2019s \u2014 excuse me. Mrs. Goshorn\u2019s abilities are not up to the extent that Mr. Gos-horris are and I think never will be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">The ability of the party from whom alimony is sought to meet that party\u2019s needs while meeting the needs of the party seeking alimony. I think \u2014 certainly I think Mr. Goshorn has the ability to meet his needs while meeting Mrs. Goshom\u2019s \u2014 or while meeting the needs of Mrs. Gos-horn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">There is no agreement between the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">Financial needs and financial resources of each party, including income and assets, including property [that] does not produce income. Clearly Mr. Goshorn has much more in this way. Any award under 8-205 and 8-208 \u2014 I need to make sure I got those correct. 8-205 is a monetary award, which I\u2019ll come to in a few minutes. And 8-202 is use and possession. I\u2019ll come to both of those in just a minute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-10\">The nature and amount of the financial obligations of each party. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had much testimony or significant testimony. Obviously, there is a mortgage on the house and I don\u2019t believe there is any significant amount otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-11\">Right of each party to receive retirement benefits. Mrs. Goshorn has just started getting a \u2014 being covered under a retirement plan. Mr. Goshorn has twenty plus years of Federal service where he has \u2014 has the right to receive those retirement benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-12\">And I don\u2019t think factor twelve applies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>The other issue to look at is the issue of whether this should be rehabilitative alimony or indefinite alimony. The law favors rehabilitative alimony, but the factors to be considered are the ability of the party seeking alimony to be wholly or partly self-supporting, and the time necessary for the party seeking alimony to gain sufficient education or training to enable that party to find suitable employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">I don\u2019t think Mrs. Goshom will ever get to the point where she is able to earn income that \u2014 or, excuse me, find a job that would permit her to earn an income that would fully support herself or that would be \u2014 it would be suitable employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">So based on that I find that there is, in fact, a basis for an award of indefinite alimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">The court continued:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">All right. Let me get back to the alimony. This is a case in which we have two individuals whose income is truly disparate. Mr. Goshom\u2019s income is almost Seven Thousand Dollars a month. Mrs. Goshom, if she worked forty hours a week, would be Sixteen Hundred and Twenty-Two Dollars and Forty cents per month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-9\">Based on all of this, I am going to order that Mrs. Goshorn receive indefinite alimony in the amount of One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars per month.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">In sum, the court found that \u201cin view of [Mrs. Goshorn\u2019s] education and her skills\u201d it would not be possible \u201cfor her to be wholly self supporting\u201d or \u201cto gain sufficient education and training to enable [her] to find suitable employment.\u201d It further concluded that the parties\u2019 respective incomes were \u201ctruly disparate.\u201d And, based on these findings, the court ordered Mr. Goshorn to pay Mrs. Goshorn $1,500 a month in indefinite alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">In the written order that followed, the court also awarded Mrs. Goshorn 50% of the marital portion of Mr. Goshom\u2019s retirement pension on an as, if, and when basis; the right to elect to receive a survivor annuity in Mr. Goshorn\u2019s retirement pension; a one-third interest in Mr. Goshom\u2019s thrift savings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>plan; and, \u201cif jointly-titled, half of the proceeds of the sale of the family home after the expiration of any use and possession order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The order further awarded Mr. Goshom sole legal and physical custody of the two minor children, John and Zachary, and granted Mr. Goshorn use and possession of the family home until July 1, 2004. Although the court found, as the parties agreed, that the now eighteen-year-old Sarah was a \u201cdestitute adult child,\u201d it excluded her in calculating Mrs. Goshom\u2019s child support obligation. The court explained its actions, by stating that Sarah is \u201ccurrently receiving Social Security income benefits and is therefore considered self supportive.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">After the hearing, but before the written order was issued, counsel for Mr. Goshorn prepared and submitted a child support obligation worksheet, which calculated Mrs. Goshom\u2019s monthly child support obligation for the two minor children at $703.27. And that was the figure that the court ordered Mrs. Goshorn to pay in child support for the parties\u2019 two minor children, John and Zachary. The worksheet, it should be noted, reflected that Mrs. Goshom\u2019s child support obligation of $703.27 included her share of $273 a month in work-related child care expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">Mr. Goshom contends that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to award Mrs. Goshom indefinite alimony because it did not reserve Mrs. Goshorn\u2019s claim for alimony when it granted Mr. Goshorn\u2019s request for a judgment of absolute divorce. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">In Maryland, the circuit court has inherent power to reserve the issue of alimony when it enters a decree of divorce. <em>Turrisi v. Sanzaro, </em>308 Md. 515, 526, 520 A.2d 1080 (1987). Reserving the right to award alimony enables the court to award alimony long after the divorce decree, when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>is appropriate to do so. <em>Id. </em>at 522, 520 A.2d 1080. But, \u201c[i]f at the time of the divorce the court fails to either award alimony or reserve the right to award alimony at a later date, it is forever barred from ordering it.\u201d <em>Blaine v. Blaine, </em>97 Md.App. 689, 701, 682 A.2d 191 (1993), <em>aff'd, </em>336 Md. 49, 646 A.2d 413 (1994); <em>see also Turrisi, </em>308 Md. at 521-22, 520 A.2d 1080.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Here, the record reflects that the court reserved jurisdiction to award alimony after the entry of the divorce decree on August 17, 2001. The judgment for absolute divorce issued on August 17, 2001, specifically stated that <em>\u201call other issues </em>including child support, custody and marital property have been reserved and set for a future date before the Honorable Warren J. Krug in this Court.\u201d (Emphasis added). Those words were, to be sure, not intended to reserve only the three enumerated issues \u2014 child support, custody and marital property- \u2014 for future consideration. Those three issues are only given as examples of \u201call\u201d of the \u201cother issues\u201d that \u201chave been reserved and set forth for a future date before the Honorable Warren J. Krug____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Mr. Goshom nonetheless contends that an order reserving \u201call other issues\u201d is insufficient to reserve jurisdiction to award alimony after a divorce. To bolster that claim, he cites <em>Speropulos v. Speropulos, </em>97 Md.App. 613, 631 A.2d 514 (1993), which held that the circuit court\u2019s reservation of \u201call property issues,\u201d after granting a divorce, was insufficient to reserve jurisdiction to make a post-divorce award of alimony. <em>Id. </em>at 618, 631 A.2d 514. At the time the circuit court in <em>Speropulos </em>entered a judgment of divorce, it reserved jurisdiction over \u201call property issues including monetary award, if any ... for future determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 617, 631 A.2d 514. Noting that there is a distinction between alimony and the disposition of property, we concluded that \u201ca reservation as to \u2018all property issues\u2019 is insufficient to retain jurisdiction over the issue of alimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618, 631 A.2d 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">But, here, the circuit court did not limit its reservation to just \u201cproperty issues.\u201d Rather, the court extended its reser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>vation to \u201call other issues,\u201d which presumably included Mrs. Goshom\u2019s counterclaim for alimony. Indeed, this Court noted in <em>Speropulos </em>that had the circuit court utilized broad terminology, such as \u201c \u2018this court shall have continuing jurisdiction in these proceedings,\u2019 \u201d the court\u2019s order would have been sufficient to reserve jurisdiction to award alimony. <em>See id. </em>at 617-18, 631 A.2d 514 (quoting <em>Flood v. Flood, </em>16 Md.App. 280, 286, 295 A.2d 784 (1972) (quoting <em>Reed v. Reed, </em>11 Md.App. 396, 399, 274 A.2d 652 (1971))). The court\u2019s order in this case was therefore sufficiently broad to reserve jurisdiction on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Moreover, when the master stated at the August 16, 2001, divorce hearing that \u201c[a]ll other matters, including child support, custody, marital property, have been reserved and set for (inaudible) before Warren Krug in this court (inaudible),\u201d the following exchange occurred between Mrs. Goshorn\u2019s counsel and the domestic relations master:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">[COUNSEL]: \u201cAll the issues would include alimony. At the last second, my client filed a counterclaim and I \u2014 ,\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0F\">[MASTER]: \u201cI see. We\u2019ve included everything in the (inaudible).\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">[Counsel]: \u201cI just want to make sure. I don\u2019t want anything (inaudible).\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">[MASTER]: \u201cOh, yes. Okay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">Although parts of this exchange are inaudible, the transcript clearly suggests that the parties addressed Ms. Goshorn\u2019s alimony claim, that the master was aware of that claim, and that the master intended to reserve it with all other issues for later review.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">Mr. Goshorn claims that, in applying the twelve factor alimony test of FL \u00a7 11-106(b), the circuit court \u201cassumed and misapplied facts not in evidence.\u201d Specifically, he contends the court \u201cerred on the evidence pertaining to factors 1,2,6,9, and 11\u201d and that Mrs. Goshorn \u201cfailed to meet her burden of proof for either indefinite or rehabilitative alimony.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Neither of these claims can withstand scrutiny; but, because the trial court incorrectly calculated Mr. Goshorn\u2019s income, we shall vacate the circuit court\u2019s award of indefinite alimony and remand this case to that court to make whatever changes it may deem appropriate, if any, in light of this miscalculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\n<em>A. The Court\u2019s Findings With Respect to the Twelve Factor Alimony Test</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">As noted, Mr. Goshom contends the court \u201cassumed and misapplied facts not in evidence\u201d in applying the twelve factor alimony test of FL \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b). We begin our analysis of this claim by noting that it is not cast in the words of the applicable standard of review. The standard we must apply in evaluating this claim requires us \u201cto accord great deference to the findings and judgments of [the] trial [court],\u201d <em>see Tracey v. Tracey, </em>328 Md. 380, 385, 614 A.2d 590 (1992), unless the circuit court\u2019s factual findings were clearly erroneous, Md. Rule 8 \u2014 131(c), or its judgment was an \u201carbitrary use of discretion.\u201d <em>See Blaine, </em>97 Md.App. at 698, 632 A.2d 191. Applying that standard, it appears that Mr. Goshorn\u2019s claims, at least as to some of the findings of fact made by the circuit court, have some merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">FL \u00a7 ll-106(b) provides that the court shall consider twelve factors in determining whether to make an alimony award. With respect to those factors, this Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoC\">In making an award of alimony, the trial court is required to consider all of the factors set forth in F.L. \u00a7 ll-106(b). To be sure, the court \u201cneed not use formulaic language or articulate every reason for its decision with respect to each factor. Rather, the court must clearly indicate that it has considered all the factors.\u201d If the court fails to make clear that it has considered all of the factors, then the record, as a whole, must reveal that the court\u2019s findings were based on a review of the statutory factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-8\"><em>Digges v. Digges, </em>126 Md.App. 361, 387, 730 A.2d 202 (1999) (quoting <em>Doser v.

At bottom, the over-riding objective of the court is to do equity. <em>See Tracey, </em>328 Md. at 393-94, 614 A.2d 590 (\u201cGenerally speaking, alimony awards, though authorized by statute, are founded upon notions of equity; equity requires sensitivity to the merits of each individual case without the imposition of bright-line tests.... \u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The twelve factors are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">(1) the ability of the party seeking alimony to be wholly or partly self-supporting;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">(2) the time necessary for the party seeking alimony to gain sufficient education or training to enable that party to find suitable employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">(3) the standard of living that the parties established during their marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-9\">(4) the duration of the marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-10\">(5) the contributions, monetary and nonmonetary, of each party to the well-being of the family;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-11\">(6) the circumstances that contributed to the estrangement of the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-12\">(7) the age of each party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-13\">(8) the physical and mental condition of each party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-14\">(9) the ability of the party from whom alimony is sought to meet that party\u2019s needs while meeting the needs of the party seeking alimony;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-15\">(10) any agreement between the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-16\">(11) the financial needs and financial resources of each party, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-17\">(i) all income and assets, including property that does not produce income;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-18\">(ii) any award made under \u00a7\u00a7 8-205 and 8-208 of this article;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-19\">(iii) the nature and amount of the financial obligations of each party; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>(iv) the right of each party to receive retirement benefits; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-4\">(12) whether the award would cause a spouse who is a resident of a related institution as defined in \u00a7 19-301 of the Health-General Article and from whom alimony is sought to become eligible for medical assistance earlier than would otherwise occur.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">FL \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Although the court did dutifully consider all twelve factors, the court erred, Mr. Goshom maintains, in applying factors one, two, six, nine, and eleven to the facts of this case. Factors one and two are so closely related that we shall consider them together.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\"><em>1. Factors One and Two </em>\u2014 the <em>Ability of the Party Seeking Alimony to be Wholly or Partly Self Supporting and the Time Necessary for the Party Seeking Alimony to Gain Sufficient Education or Training to Enable That Party to Find Suitable Employment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">In the words of the applicable standard of review\u2014 though not necessarily Mr. Goshom\u2019s \u2014 Mr. Goshorn in essence contends that the court erroneously found that Mrs. Goshorn would never be wholly self-supporting and would never be able to obtain education and training necessary for suitable employment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">At the time of the proceedings, Mrs. Goshorn earned less than $10 an hour,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the trial essentially concluded that Mrs. Goshom would never progress beyond her current status in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>the labor market. There is ample support for this finding in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">Mrs. Goshorn testified that, at age forty-two, she had been assessed as reading at a third grade level. Mr. Goshorn corroborated this testimony, stating that he was aware that Mrs. Goshorn had difficulty reading and was not surprised that she had been assessed at that level. Moreover, the record plainly shows that Mrs. Goshorn had more than a little difficulty in completing a basic financial statement. That and, the menial nature of most of her prior employment, led the court to conclude that Mrs Goshorn\u2019s \u201ceducation and skills\u201d place formidable limits on her ability to \u201cfind suitable employment.\u201d For these reasons, we cannot conclude that the court\u2019s finding was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\"><em>2. Factor Six </em>\u2014 The <em>Circumstances Contributing to the Estrangement of the Parties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Mr. Goshorn contends that the court erroneously concluded that the circumstances surrounding the estrangement of the parties was \u201ca fairly neutral factor.\u201d Yet, we note that his brief does not present any facts supporting this claim. Moreover, there is sufficient evidence to support the court\u2019s finding. Testimony presented at the divorce hearing indicates only that the parties voluntarily separated. Accordingly, the court\u2019s finding that the estrangement was \u201ca fairly neutral factor\u201d is beyond cavil.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\"><em>3. Factor Nine </em>\u2014 The <em>ability of the Party from whom Alimony is Sought to Meet that Party\u2019s Needs While Meeting the Needs of the Party Seeking Alimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">Mr. Goshorn claims that the court erred by concluding that Mr. Goshorn had the ability to meet his needs while meeting the needs of the Mrs. Goshorn. Once again, however, Mr. Goshorn\u2019s brief does not present any facts supporting a claim which he advances, while, as before, the record clearly contradicts his assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>That the record does not contain a financial statement prepared by Mr. Goshorn, nor testimony about his monthly expenses is a reflection of choices made by Mr. Goshorn and his counsel. There is, however, evidence of Mr. Goshorn\u2019s needs in the Joint Statement of Parties Concerning Marital Property and Non-marital Property. That statement, which was completed by Mr. Goshorn, asserts that there was a $63,000 outstanding mortgage on the .marital home, and there were no liens on any of his automobiles. It therefore appears from the record that Mr. Goshorn\u2019s living expenses are modest.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">On the other hand, Mr. Goshorn earned $69,992 a year, or $5,832.67 a month, in 2001. He also had about $36,000 in his thrift savings account. Given this evidence, the court\u2019s finding that Mr. Goshorn has the ability to meet his needs, while meeting Mrs. Goshom\u2019s, was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\"><em>If. Factor Eleven </em>\u2014 the <em>Financial Needs and Financial Resources of Each Party</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Mr. Goshorn also contends that the court\u2019s findings with respect to the parties\u2019 financial needs and resources were clearly erroneous. In part, we agree: the court did overestimate Mr. Goshorn\u2019s financial resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">The court estimated Mr. Goshorn\u2019s monthly income was \u201calmost seven thousand dollars a month.\u201d This estimate is inconsistent with the evidence presented. Mr. Goshom\u2019s income in 2001 was $69,992. Hence, Mr. Goshorn\u2019s actual monthly income was $5,832.67 a month, which is almost 20% lower than the court\u2019s estimate in its alimony award. We therefore conclude that the court\u2019s findings with respect to Mr. Goshom\u2019s financial resources were erroneous and remand this matter to the circuit court to reconsider its alimony award in light of this error.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">Furthermore, because we are vacating the court\u2019s alimony award on the grounds that it over-estimated Mr. Goshorn\u2019s income, we must also vacate the marital property award, because any significant change in alimony requires the court to reassess its monetary award. <em>C.f Melrod v. Melrod, </em>83 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Md.App. 180, 195, 574 A.2d 1 (1990) (\u201c[Vacating the monetary award] necessitates vacation of the alimony as well, since any significant change in the monetary award will require the court to reassess its alimony award.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">\n<em>B. The Court\u2019s Award of Indefinite Alimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Mr. Goshorn contends Mrs. Goshom failed to meet her burden of proof for indefinite alimony. He further maintains that the \u201c[circuit] court did not find nor conclude the parties\u2019 standard of living was unconscionably disparate.\u201d We find no merit in either claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">We begin our analysis by noting \u201cthe purpose of alimony is not to provide a lifetime pension.\u201d <em>Tracey, </em>328 Md. at 391, 614 A.2d 590. Rather, alimony is designed \u201cto provide the recipient spouse an opportunity to become self-supporting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting the Report of the Governor\u2019s Commission on Domestic Relations 2 (1980)). Nonetheless, \u201c[i]n cases where it is either impractical for the dependent spouse to become self-supporting, or in cases where the dependent spouse will be self-supporting but still a gross inequity will exist, a court may award alimony for an indefinite period.\u201d <em>Roginsky v. Blake-Roginsky, </em>129 Md.App. 132, 141, 740 A.2d 125 (1999). Maryland favors rehabilitative alimony over indefinite alimony, <em>Tracey, </em>328 Md. at 391, 614 A.2d 590; therefore, indefinite alimony should be awarded only in exceptional circumstances. <em>See Turrisi, </em>308 Md. at 525, 520 A.2d 1080. A court may award indefinite alimony if it finds that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">(1) due to age, illness, infirmity, or disability, the party seeking alimony cannot reasonably be expected to make substantial progress toward becoming self-supporting; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\">(2) even after the party seeking alimony will have made as much progress toward becoming self-supporting as can reasonably be expected, the respective standards of living of the parties will be unconscionably disparate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">FL \u00a7 ll-106(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">Mr. Goshom correctly asserts that Mrs. Goshorn, as the economically dependent spouse seeking indefinite alimony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>bears the burden of proving the need for indefinite alimony. <em>Crabill, </em>119 Md.App. 249, 260-61, 704 A.2d 532 (1998); <em>Tho-masian v. Thomasian, </em>79 Md.App. 188, 195, 556 A.2d 675 (1989). That burden has been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">As previously indicated, the record supports the circuit court\u2019s finding that Mrs. Goshorn has made all of the progress toward becoming self-supporting that can reasonably be expected. And, even then, as we have previously noted, she is barely self-supporting.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The court also concluded that the parties\u2019 incomes were \u201ctruly disparate\u201d: even after imputing an additional ten hours of wages per week to Mrs. Goshorn\u2019s income, Mrs. Goshorn made only 27.8% of Mr. Goshorn\u2019s actual monthly salary.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This, to be sure, constitutes a gross disparity. We hasten to note, however, that \u201c[although a significant mathematical disparity in income, present and future, is not necessarily a sufficient condition to justify an award of indefinite alimony, it is nonetheless a necessary condition.\u201d <em>Ware v. Ware, </em>131 Md.App. 207, 229-30, 748 A.2d 1031 (2000). But mathematical disparity is only the starting point of an unconscionability analysis. The Court of Appeals has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">While the mathematical comparison of the incomes of the parties is the starting point of the analysis, it is never conclusive. As the statute provides, the disparity must be \u201cunconscionable,\u201d a determination which requires the application of equitable considerations on a case-by-case basis, consistent with the trial court\u2019s broad discretion in determining an appropriate award. As neither \u00a7 11-107 nor \u00a7 11-106(c) provides specific guidance with regard to making this determination, the court must look to the factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>under \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b), which provide guidance in determining an appropriate award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-5\"><em>Blaine, </em>336 Md. at 71-72, 646 A.2d 413; <em>see also Ware, </em>131 Md.App. at 232-33, 748 A.2d 1031 (\u201c[A] finding of a mathematical disparity will not automatically trigger an award of indefinite alimony and ... the trial judge must carefully consider all of the twelve factors spelled out by \u00a7 11-106(b) that are pertinent to a particular case.\u201d). Of course, \u201cthe greater the disparity, the more likely that it will be found unconscionable, all other factors remaining equal.\u201d <em>Roginsky, </em>129 Md.App. at 147, 740 A.2d 125. And it is worth mentioning that Maryland\u2019s appellate courts have upheld indefinite alimony awards in cases with comparable, and even substantially smaller, disparities in the parties\u2019 incomes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">In this case, the parties\u2019 disparity is consistent with, and in some instances greater than, other cases in which Maryland\u2019s appellate courts have upheld an award of indefinite alimony. <em>See id. </em>Furthermore, the court went beyond the mathematical disparity and adequately considered all of the relevant factors in FL \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b). We therefore cannot say that the court abused its discretion in awarding Mrs. Goshom indefinite alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Appellant contends, however, that the circuit court did not find the parties had an \u201cunconscionable disparity\u201d in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>standards of living when it awarded Mrs. Goshorn indefinite alimony. We disagree. Although the circuit court did not use the term \u201cunconscionable,\u201d that is not fatal to the circuit court\u2019s award when it was at least implicit in its ruling. In <em>Tracey, </em>the circuit court did not use the term \u201cunconscionable\u201d in awarding indefinite alimony. <em>See </em>328 Md. at 384, 614 A.2d 590. There, the trial judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">\u201cThe wife [is] working, and I don\u2019t think she can get any better job than she has now. She is not able to support herself; the husband is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">There was the question of rehabilitative alimony, and that\u2019s certainly out of the question. The wife has not done well in school. Even going back to pick up a couple of courses, they\u2019re not going to open up any doors to her.... [S]he is at a level, probably the best that\u2019s she [sic] going to obtain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">I think she is entitled to indefinite alimony because of her needs and the disparity between their relative incomes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGy\">328 Md. at 384, 614 A.2d 590. On appeal, the Court of Appeals upheld the circuit court\u2019s decision to award indefinite alimony. <em>Id. </em>at 394, 614 A.2d 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Similarly, in this case, the circuit court did not use the term \u201cunconscionable,\u201d but it nonetheless considered the equities of the case and decided, in light of these equities and the parties\u2019 \u201ctruly disparate\u201d incomes, to award Mrs. Goshorn indefinite alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">Were it not for the circuit court\u2019s miscalculation of Mr. Goshorn\u2019s income, there would be more than adequate basis upon which to affirm the court\u2019s award of indefinite alimony. Because of that error, however, we are compelled to vacate that award and remand this issue to the circuit court for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">Mr. Goshorn contends that the circuit court erroneously calculated Mrs. Goshorn\u2019s child support obligation for two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>reasons: (1) it failed to include support for Sarah, the parties\u2019 \u201cdestitute adult child,\u201d because it found her to be self-supporting; and (2) it failed to include daycare expenses in Mrs. Goshom\u2019s child support obligation for all three children. We agree that the court erred in determining that Sarah was self-supporting, but we do not agree that the circuit court failed to include daycare expenses in Mrs. Goshorn\u2019s child support obligation for all three children.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\n<em>A. The Obligation to Support a Destitute Adult Child</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">In Maryland, it is a misdemeanor for a parent with sufficient means \u201cto neglect or refuse to provide [a] destitute adult child with food, shelter, care, and clothing.\u201d FL \u00a7 13-102. A \u201cdestitute adult child\u201d is \u201can adult child who: (1) has no means of subsistence; and (2) cannot be self-supporting, due to mental or physical infirmity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 13-101(b). In applying this standard, \u201c[t]he child need not be penniless, nor may he be profligate. The duty of support arises when the child has insufficient resources and, because of mental or physical infirmity, insufficient income capacity to enable him to meet his <em>reasonable </em>living expenses.\u201d <em>Presley v. Presley, </em>65 Md.App. 265, 277-78, 500 A.2d 322 (1985) (emphasis in original). And in making this determination, \u201c[t]he court can examine the child\u2019s available assets, his eligibility for disability or other assistance, and his earning capacity and weigh them against what he reasonably needs to provide a proper subsistence level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 278, 500 A.2d 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Maryland\u2019s appellate courts have held that the legislature intended \u201cto place failure to support an incapacitated child on equal footing with failure to support a minor child.\u201d <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>227 Md. 355, 360, 176 A.2d 862 (1962); see <em>also Stern v. Stern, </em>58 Md.App. 280, 295, 473 A.2d 56 (1984) (\u201cSince the Court of Appeals has held that the legislature intended \u2018to place the failure to support an incapacitated child on equal footing with failure to support a minor child,\u2019 it follows that the procedure and remedies for the enforcement of that right must also be \u2018on equal footing.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Smith, </em>227 Md. at 360, 176 A.2d 862)). Therefore, the duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>support a \u201cdestitute adult child\u201d is enforceable in equity, and the court may order support payments for a \u201cdestitute adult child.\u201d <em>See Smith, </em>227 Md. at 360, 176 A.2d 862; <em>Presley, </em>65 Md.App. at 275-76, 500 A.2d 322; <em>Stern, </em>58 Md.App. at 295-96, 473 A.2d 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">In this case, the parties agreed, and the court determined, that Sarah is a \u201cdestitute adult child\u201d under FL \u00a7 13-101(b). Mr. Goshorn conceded that Sarah has the \u201cmentality of a three or four year old,\u201d and that she has difficulty even attending to her personal hygiene. Yet, because Sarah temporarily receives SSI benefits, the circuit court concluded that although she was a \u201cdestitute adult child,\u201d she was \u201cself-supportive.\u201d Specifically, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">By consent of the parties, their oldest child, to wit: Sarah E. Goshorn, bom July 28,1983, is determined to be an adult child pursuant to [FL \u00a7 13 \u2014 101(b)] but is currently receiving Social Security income benefits and is therefore considered self supportive and not considered in the order for the purpose of calculations of child support;----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">By concluding that Sarah was both a \u201cdestitute adult child\u201d and \u201cself-supportive,\u201d the circuit court erred. To designate Sarah as both is a contradiction in terms, or to use the word currently in vogue, an \u201coxymoron.\u201d Sarah cannot be both because a \u201cdestitute adult child\u201d is by definition an adult child \u201cwho has no means of subsistence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">But, at stake here is more than a catachresis. By designating Sarah as self-supportive and then leaving that issue, the court skipped the first and necessary task of determining whether and how the child support guidelines should be applied to her and what support should be paid now and in the future if the SSI benefits end upon her twenty-first birthday.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">Once the court determined that Sarah was a \u201cdestitute adult child,\u201d its next step should have been to apply the child support guidelines in FL \u00a7 12-204 to determine the Goshorns\u2019 support obligation for Sarah. Although there are no reported cases addressing whether the child support guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>lines apply to \u201cdestitute adult child[ren],\u201d this Court held in <em>Stern </em>that because \u201cthe legislature intended \u2018to place the failure to support a [destitute adult child] on equal footing with failure to support a minor child,\u2019 it follows that the procedure and remedies for the enforcement of that right must also be \u2018on equal footing.\u2019 \u201d 58 Md.App. at 295, 473 A.2d 56 (quoting <em>Smith, </em>227 Md. at 360, 176 A.2d 862). We therefore instruct the circuit court that the child support guidelines are applicable to destitute adult children as they are to minor children.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">The next question is whether Sarah\u2019s SSI benefits should then have any effect on the Goshorns\u2019 obligation under the child support guidelines. To answer that question, we begin by noting that \u201cft]here is a rebuttable presumption that the amount of child support which would result from the application of the child support guidelines set forth in this subtitle is the correct amount of child support to be awarded.\u201d FL \u00a7 12-202(a)(2)(i) (2003 Cum.Supp.). That presumption is not indulged in all situations. In fact, the court may deviate from the guidelines if their application would be \u201cunjust or inappropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 (a)(2)(ii). But, in making such a determination, the court \u201cshall make a written finding or specific finding on the record stating the reasons for departing from the guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 (a)(2)(v). The finding shall state: \u201c[T]he amount of child support that would have been required under the guidelines; how the order varies from the guidelines; and how the finding serves the best interests of the child; ...\u201d <em>Id.; see also Drummond v. State, </em>350 Md. 502, 517, 714 A.2d 163 (1998). That did not occur here. The court simply declared Sarah \u201cself-supportive\u201d without applying the child support guidelines and then considering how the SSI benefits should affect that obligation. Simply because an adult child receives SSI benefits does not necessarily render that child self supporting.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">For example, in <em>Stern, </em>58 Md.App. 280, 473 A.2d 56, the circuit court awarded child support for a \u201cdestitute adult <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>child,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> who was a nineteen year old, living on his own, and receiving SSI benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 289, 294, 473 A.2d 56. We affirmed, noting that because of his major medical problems, his family had to provide \u201cthe bulk of his support.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 294, 473 A.2d 56. In ordering support, the circuit court found, and we agreed, that he was a \u201cdestitute adult child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 295, 473 A.2d 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">It is important to note, however, that the child support guidelines do not provide for the automatic application of Social Security benefits directly against the obligor\u2019s support obligation. <em>Drummond, </em>350 Md. at 516, 714 A.2d 163; <em>Ley v. Forman, </em>144 Md.App. 658, 674, 800 A.2d 1 (2002); <em>Anderson v. Anderson, </em>117 Md.App. 474, 483, 700 A.2d 844 (1997), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>349 Md. 294, 708 A.2d 296 (1998). Indeed, the benefits are by no means an automatic credit or necessarily a dollar for dollar set off against a child support obligation. <em>See Drummond, </em>350 Md. at 519, 714 A.2d 163; <em>Ley, </em>144 Md.App. at 674, 800 A.2d 1; <em>Anderson, </em>117 Md.App. at 482-83, 700 A.2d 844.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">In <em>Ley, </em>this Court stated that the policy behind this rule is that \u201c[relieving] a parent of his or her obligation because the child receives a benefit to which he or she is entitled from some other source would not ordinarily be consistent with [the parent\u2019s duty to provide for the maintenance of their children.]\u201d 144 Md.App. at 671, 800 A.2d 1. Furthermore, \u201c[t]his approach puts a child of separated parents in the same situation as a child of parents because it allows the child to maintain the same standard of living as if the parents had not separated.\u201d <em>Ley, </em>144 Md.App. at 672, 800 A.2d 1 (quoting <em>Drummond, </em>350 Md. at 521, 714 A.2d 163). The same reasoning would apply to a \u201cdestitute adult child.\u201d We are therefore remanding this case to the circuit court to reconsider Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Goshorn\u2019s child support obligations, to apply the child support guidelines, and to make required findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\n<em>B. Child Care Expenses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Finally, Mr. Goshorn contends that the court erroneously calculated Mrs. Goshorn\u2019s child support obligation by failing to include daycare expenses for the children. This is incorrect. The court added Mrs. Goshorn\u2019s income share of $273 in child care expenses to her basic child support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">FL \u00a7 12-204(g)(1) provides that \u201cactual child care expenses incurred on behalf of a child due to employment or job search of either parent shall be added to the basic obligation and shall be divided between the parents in proportion to their incomes.\u201d Furthermore, \u201c[cjhild care expenses shall be determined by actual family experience, unless the court determines that the actual family experience is not in the best interest of the child\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 (g)(2)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Mrs. Goshorn\u2019s basic support obligation, without adding child care, was $586 a month.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See </em>FL \u00a7\u00a7 12-204(e), 12-204(k). But, the court, without explanation, ordered Mrs. Goshorn to pay Mr. Goshorn $703.27 per month for support of the minor children. This amount includes Mrs. Goshorn\u2019s income share, 42.7% <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of the parties joint income, of $273 in monthly child care expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">We hold that the circuit court retained jurisdiction over the issue of alimony after it granted Mr. Goshorn a judgment for absolute divorce. We shall vacate the award of indefinite alimony because of error made by the court in calculating Mr. Goshorn\u2019s income. Because we are vacating the award of indefinite alimony, we are required to vacate the court\u2019s monetary award because any significant change in alimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>will necessitate a reassessment of Mrs. Goshom\u2019s marital property award.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Furthermore, we shall vacate the circuit court\u2019s child support award and remand this matter to that court to apply the child support guidelines in FL \u00a7 12-204 to the support of all three children. The court may consider Sarah\u2019s SSI benefits as grounds for departing from the guidelines, but only if it finds applying the guidelines would be \u201cunjust or inappropriate\u201d and makes the findings that a departure would be in Sarah\u2019s best interests. We further instruct the circuit court to determine what means of support Sarah will have after she reaches the age of twenty-one and, in the event that the SSI benefits do end at twenty-one or are reduced, to make an award of child support it deems would be in her best interests. Finally, we hold that the circuit court properly included Mrs. Goshorn\u2019s share of the parties\u2019 child care expenses in determining Mrs. Goshorn\u2019s child support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">JUDGMENT VACATED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CALVERT COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">COSTS TO BE DIVIDED EVENLY BETWEEN THE PARTIES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-9\">. Ms. Goshorn was licensed to care for up to six children, but the record does not indicate how many children she actually cared lor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b222-8\">. There is some dispute as to why Mrs. Goshorn is no longer a licensed daycare provider. Mrs. Goshorn testified that she let her license lapse at the insistence of Mr. Goshorn because he was \u201cafraid [they] would get sued.\u201d But Mr. Goshorn testified that Mrs. Goshorn quit the daycare business because her daycare parents no longer needed her services.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b223-7\">. In that complaint, Mr. Goshom also requested a reasonable sum for household expenses, exclusive use and possession of the family home, a declaration that the furniture and furnishings in the family home are family use personal property, and an order allowing Mr. Goshorn to claim the three minor children as exemptions on his taxes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b223-8\">. The court's order included Sarah, but she had, by that point, reached the age of majority. The order was issued on September 18, 2001, and Sarah turned eighteen in July of that year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b232-10\">. Parenthetically, we note that, according to a report prepared for the Center on Poverty Solutions, a Maryland non-profit organization, the \u201cself-sufficiency wage\u201d for a single adult in Calvert County is $10.21 an hour, or $1,798 a month. Diana Pierce, Ph.D. &amp; Jennifer Brooks, <em>The Self-Sufficiency Standard for Maryland </em>49 (2001) (prepared for the Advocates for Children and Youth and The Center for Poverty Solutions). Mrs. Goshorn's income is below the \u201cself-sufficiency wage.\u201d As a single adult living in Calvert County, she is earning $9.36 an hour, or $1,622.40 a month.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b236-8\">. <em>See supra </em>note 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b236-9\">. In computing what percentage Mrs. Goshorn's monthly income was of Mr. Goshorn\u2019s monthly salary, we used the monthly figure he testified was his monthly income, $5,832.67, and not the erroneous figure used by the circuit court of $7,000. If we had used that figure, Mrs. Goshorn\u2019s monthly income would only have been 23.2% of Mr. Goshorn\u2019s.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b237-8\">. In <em>Lee v.
