We must determine whether the evidence was sufficient to support the vendor\u2019s claim that the bank, never intending to perform, fraudulently induced the vendor to enter the contract. In doing so, we differentiate between actionable fraudulent misrepresentations and indefinite generalities that do not support fraud in the context of discussions between two sophisticated businesses. We also analyze whether an ambiguous \u201cbest efforts\u201d clause is enforceable in contract, and explore the limits of predicating a fraud claim on the bank\u2019s intentions with respect to performance of that clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">We shall reverse a $39 million jury verdict for compensatory damages and a $200 million verdict for punitive damages, both entered against appellant First Union National Bank (\u201cFirst Union\u201d) in favor of Steele Software Systems Corporation (\u201c3S\u201d) on a fraud theory. 3S\u2019s theory was that First Union fraudulently induced 3S to enter into a written Service Agreement dated November 29, 1997 (\u201cSA\u201d), under which 3S would provide certain appraisal and title services in connection with residential real estate loans made by First Union to its customers without intending to perform thereunder. We shall affirm a judgment for approximately $37 million against First Union for breach of contract. The recovery by 3S is based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>First Union\u2019s failure to fulfill its contractual obligation to purchase these real estate settlement services from 3S as called for under the SA.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">We answer the following questions presented by First Union:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">I. Whether First Union was entitled to judgment on 3S\u2019s fraud claim because 3S failed to prove the elements of fraud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">II. Whether First Union is entitled to judgment with respect to 3S\u2019s claim that it breached the \u201cbest efforts\u201d clause of the SA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-8\">HI. Whether the compensatory damages award must be set aside because the circuit court impermissibly limited the cross-examination of 8S\u2019s damages expert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-9\">IV. Whether the compensatory damage award must be set aside because it encompassed transactions outside the geographic scope of the SA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">We answer yes to question I, and no to questions II, III, and IV. We do not reach First Union\u2019s questions regarding the amount of damages in the fraud claim, or the amount of punitive damages, because of our rejection of 3S\u2019s fraud claim. Nor do we reach First Union\u2019s contention that 3S\u2019s fraud claim was improperly predicated on alleged theft of its business methods and is therefore preempted by the Maryland Uniform Trade Secrets Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">FACTS<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"AZ8\">3S Provides Settlement Services To First Union</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">3S is a settlement service company, founded in 1987, that introduced First Union to a new, centralized and automated system for obtaining title searches and appraisals for home equity loans. First Union, a large bank with multiple branches in the eastern United States, makes a high volume of residential home equity loans. The new system introduced by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>3S enabled First Union to move away from a paper-based title search and appraisal system that was individual to each branch, to a computer-based, centralized system.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">3S first made a presentation about an automated title and appraisal processing system known as \u201cATAPS\u201d to Glenn Kinard, manager of First Union\u2019s consumer lending business in Washington, D.C., in the fall of 1994. Kinard retained 3S to conduct a pilot program at a few First Union branches in the D.C. region. During the pilot, an email sent by First Union to the branches participating in the pilot said, \u201cYou are the pilot group testing this method of processing for the entire company, so your active participation in the use and evaluation of 3S is the cornerstone for our future efforts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">3S later began serving 15 to 20 branches in that area. First Union also retained 3S to automate and centralize a pilot direct mail campaign for home equity loans in Roanoke, Virginia. 3S then performed the title searches and appraisals associated with the transactions generated by the campaign. Scott Steele advised Kinard that 3S could bring centralized, automation technology and standardization to First Union. Kinard was \u201cvery excited\u201d about this program.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Kinard told Steele that \u201cthis is such a unique opportunity, I want to get you to [First Union\u2019s headquarters in] Charlotte sooner [rather] than later.\u201d At First Union\u2019s request, Steele and another 3S officer flew to Charlotte and made a presentation to First Union officers Tom Muse, Parkes Dibble, Trent Thompson, and Doug Crisp. Parkes Dibble, wee president of Risk Management, told Steele at the meeting \u201cthat if everything I had presented, at a high level again, was real, and they had an opportunity to do due diligence and inspect what I had, that they would see this as being a long-term mutually beneficial relationship.\u201d According to Steele, Dibble also told him that \u201cif we delivered on our promise to deliver the concept of centralization and automation, executed what we were supposed to do, and helped them in their endeavor, that we would be their long-term partner.... We could be the beneficiary of all the transactions that they could send to us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>At that same meeting Crisp, First Union\u2019s senior officer in charge of the Consumer Credit Division, asked Steele whether his firm \u201ccould handle 12,000 transactions on a monthly basis.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Steele told Crisp that he \u201ccould not\u201d at that time, but that he \u201ccould put together and implement a staged process where [3S] could build to that level.\u201d Crisp later told him that Steele\u2019s honesty \u201cmade [Crisp] feel really good, and he figured he would leave it to Parkes [Dibble] to work out the rest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In his testimony, Dibble confirmed that he and Steele discussed a potential ten-year relationship, adding, \u201cmy term of relationship goes on for a long time.\u201d Dibble explained that First Union would attempt to give 3S all the transactions it could handle within First Union\u2019s \u201c2,000 approximate branch blueprint\u201d: \u201cI would put him in a position to where he could get that. That is correct.\u201d \u201cIt was not an exclusive, it was not meant to be everything, but that he could handle a significant portion of volume, yes.\u201d Dibble considered that a contract between the bank and 3S would be the \u201cfirst step to a long road partnership.\u201d Dibble thought that 3S\u2019s system provided a \u201cbig competitive advantage to the bank.\u201d Doug Crisp, a senior vice president and Dibble\u2019s boss, acknowledged that he was aware that Dibble was \u201cdiscussing a long-term relationship\u201d with 3S.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">On January 23, 1995, Dibble brought Muse, Thompson, and other officers of the bank to Baltimore to inspect 3S. Steele told them that the presentation \u201cwas confidential in nature and [he] expected them to treat it as such.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Muse responded, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. We won\u2019t go into this business. We\u2019ll just buy the damn thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Dibble left First Union in June 1996, and Bill Clewis took over contract negotiations with Steele. Steele testified that when Clewis took over, he told Steele \u201cnot to worry. Noth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>ing\u2019s changed and he was aware of what I had discussed with Parkes [Dibble] and we were the company and so I trusted these people.\u201d Dibble confirmed that, although he never explicitly told Clewis what he said to Steele, \u201cBill knew pretty much what was going on. It wasn\u2019t a one-way communication.\u201d Clewis acknowledged that he told Steele, \u201cAs we grow, you\u2019ll grow.\u201d He \u201cexpected once we revved up our business, that he would be a vendor, his business would grow with ours.\u201d Clewis\u2019 supervisor, Crisp, conveyed the same message.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">As part of Steele\u2019s presentation at the December 8, 1994 and January 23, 1995 meetings, Steele proposed a long term service contract that would have a five-year term with an option for a five-year renewal. According to Dibble, he refused to commit to that term, but said that if 3S delivered on its promises and achieved centralization and automation of home equity loans, 3S would be First Union\u2019s \u201clong-term partner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Dibble said that he believed the competitive advantage that Steele was offering the bank was his electronic method of performing appraisals, \u201chis ability to do on-line appraisals. That was \u2014 the bank\u2019s attempt was to shorten the home equity cycle by essentially integrating Scott into \u2014 from 3S into our application handling] system!.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">In May 1995, 3S made another presentation to First Union, seeking to sell the bank a range of automated and centralized loan settlement services for all of its offices nationwide. It again proposed that the bank enter into some kind of formal, long-term relationship with it, suggesting that they create a joint venture or that First Union purchase 3S debentures that would give the bank a right of first refusal to acquire the company. Steele explained what a joint venture would mean:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-8\">It [was] more of a control business arrangement, where First Union has a volume of transactions that it [is] passing out to third parties today, and not capturing any of that revenue, because they are sending it out to independent third party providers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Early on, we thought of the concept of taking the business that it [was] passing out, and trying to capture that, and dtiving it through one entity, thereby sharing the revenue that they are now not participating in....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">According to Steele, Dibble responded that there were regulatory barriers to such transactions, but that it was \u201ca great idea and interesting.\u201d Dibble later introduced 3S to First Union\u2019s Capital Markets division with the idea that First Union might make a capital investment in, or a loan to, 3S, but negotiations broke down because the parties were far apart on a valuation for the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Development Of The Parties\u2019 Relationship And Negotiations Leading To The SA</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Three years after their first discussions, First Union and 3S entered the SA. Negotiations over the exact terms of this agreement spanned two and a half years, during which 3S provided extensive appraisal and title services for First Union. During this process, 3S\u2019s request that the SA explicitly give 3S the right to supply 75% of First Union\u2019s needs for appraisal and title services for a five to ten year period was negotiated out. The course of the negotiations, which is important to resolution of this appeal, was reflected in draft agreements, which are outlined below.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Initial Contract Negotiations Between Steele And Parkes Dibble</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">The first draft of the SA was a \u201cletter of intent,\u201d which Steele sent to Dibble June 10, 1995.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It purportedly addressed the \u201cunderstanding between [the parties] ... concerning First Union\u2019s engagement of 3S as First Union\u2019s provider of real estate settlement services and other related services .... \u201d It called for 3S to be, after a defined transition period, \u201cthe exclusive provider to First Union of Real Estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>Services for all Home Equity residential and/or consumer mortgages.\u201d It also required First Union to purchase from 3S a minimum number of such transactions, although the exact number was left blank. The term of the proposed agreement was five years, \u201cwith an automatic renewal period of [five] years provided there are no uncured or incurable defaults at that time.\u201d First Union was to have the right to terminate the agreement if 3S increased its price for the services \u201cat a rate higher than 10% annually.\u201d First Union did not accept this proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Steele\u2019s second draft, in September 1995, proposed, <em>inter alia, </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">\u2022 3S receive the greater of: 70% of First Union\u2019s transactions, or an average of 2,500 transactions per month for the first year, and 7,500 transactions per month thereafter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">\u2022 The agreement would be in effect for five years, \u201cand will automatically renew for a like period, unless notice is given by one party to the other at least 30 days prior to any Agreement expiration date.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">First Union did not agree to these terms, either.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">In March 1996, First Union circulated a draft that had no minimum volume requirement and no exclusivity provision. It simply would have given 3S a non-exclusive right to provide settlement services and direct mail promotions as requested by First Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">Steele responded to this draft by letter dated March 21, 1996, describing the \u201cchanges/ideas that I believe need to be made to the contract.\u201d Steele asked for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-10\">\u2022 The exclusive right to provide Services and Reports \u201cthat are generated by a First Union Mail Promotion,\u201d except those for which a bank customer requested to use a settlement attorney of its choice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-11\">\u2022 \u201cFor all other Services and Reports as required by First Union, [the right to have] First Union ... use its best efforts to direct these transactions to Steele, however <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>this will not be an exclusive right except for the [minimum volume guarantee].\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\">\u2022 A minimum volume equal to the greater of 2,000 transactions per month, or 75% of \u201cnew loans generated\u201d after March 31,1997.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">\u2022 A term of five years, which would \u201cautomatically renew for an additional term\u201d of five years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">\u2022 A provision that the agreement \u201cmay only be Terminated by First Union for a Material Breach of this Agreement by [3S].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Around this time, Steele and Dibble discussed that \u201cbest efforts\u201d meant \u201c[t]hat they could send all the transactions that he could and that I could handle.\u201d First Union did not accept either this proposal, or an April 1996 draft sent by Steele that was similar, but allowed First Union to opt out after five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">Crisp left First Union, and Dibble\u2019s departure followed shortly in June 1996. On June 10, 1996, Steele wrote to Morgan Smith, a First Union officer, saying that \u201cI spoke with Parkes [Dibble] last week and this should finalize the issues to wrap up the Agreement.\u201d This time he sought a three year term that would \u201cautomatically renew\u201d for an additional three years, and a minimum guarantee of 2,000 packages per month.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He requested that the bank \u201cexpedite the approvals of these final changes through any channels necessary.\u201d A June 19, 1996 draft agreement set forth these requests, including a minimum volume guarantee equal to the greater of 2,000 packages per month or 75% of the bank\u2019s new loans generated. This agreement was not signed, and there was a break in negotiations about a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">Business Relationship During Negotiations</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">Throughout the negotiation period described above, 3S handled \u201ca tremendous amount of work\u201d for First Union and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>received compensation for it. He testified that by June 1996, 3S\u2019s projects for the bank included a two-million-piece direct mail campaign, centralization projects in Roanoke and Washington, D.C., and participation in First Union\u2019s \u201cFuture Bank Initiative,\u201d a long-term project designed to modernize and improve First Union\u2019s products and services. Steele testified that, based on First Union\u2019s commitment to be 3S\u2019s long-term partner, he taught First Union how to centralize and automate its direct mail campaigns for home equity loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">This project was very appealing to First Union. Steele described the reaction of First Union officials when they first heard about his direct mail campaign proposal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">The people in the room were blown away. I think Parkes [Dibble] understood it more ... because he was more technology driven, but the rest of the people in the room were just, I think their jaws dropped, ... and certainly you could hear the response from Mrs. Clariss [from First Union\u2019s Roanoke office] and the rest of the people in the room. That was the start of our database direct mail project.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">3S Actions In Anticipation Of Ongoing Relationship With First Union</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">3S did many things for which it was not compensated because Steele believed that is what a partner should do. In 1995, at Dibble\u2019s request, Steele flew to Charlotte to advise First Union about whether an automated teller loan machine, unrelated to 3S business with First Union, would be beneficial to the bank. Crisp told Steele that he \u201cappreciated my immediate response and support of their efforts,\u201d that he \u201clooked forward to being our partner,\u201d and that he \u201cappreciated everything we were doing.\u201d During 3S\u2019s implementation of the database direct mail project, Steele discovered that First Union had a \u201cbig problem\u201d that prevented automating the direct mail project \u2014 the lack of a way to electronically enter customer data into its loan application handling database. Steele offered to help First Union to solve this problem, and did not charge First Union any extra for the five to six weeks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>of work it took to write and test the program \u201cbecause I was doing what a partner should do in helping them support their efforts and doing whatever they asked me to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">In the fall of 1996, about a year before executing the SA, 3S also substantially increased its transaction capacity, upgrading its computers, adding staff, and moving to a larger facility, all in anticipation of its ongoing relationship with First Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">1997 Resumption Of Negotiations Among Steele, Clewis, And Thompson</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">In the fall of 1996, Dibble was replaced by Bill Clewis, who was assisted by one of Dibble\u2019s previous subordinates, Trent Thompson.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although there was a break in the contract negotiations, Steele said he wasn\u2019t worried because Clewis</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AL\">told me not to worry. Nothing\u2019s changed and he was aware of what I had discussed with Parkes [Dibble] and we were the company and so I trusted these people.... Bill was just kind of new in the position so, I mean, I was doing what I was supposed to be doing and we brought the issue of the contract up and Bill said he would get to it in a little bit, which was fine with us.... They were still, you know, requesting us to do things.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Clewis told Steele that he was aware of Steele\u2019s discussions with Dibble, and 3S remained First Union\u2019s vendor of choice\u2014 \u201cnothing\u2019s changed.\u201d On several occasions, Clewis said to Steele, \u201cAs we grow, you\u2019ll grow.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although the two men <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>did not discuss the specifics of the earlier contract negotiations, Steele testified that Clewis \u201cknew pretty much what was going on\u201d regarding them.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">In January 1997, Thompson met with Steele in Baltimore regarding 3S\u2019s proposals for centralization and automation of First Union\u2019s branches. Steele wrote a follow-up letter the next day, seeking confirmation that it had been agreed that 3S would be the bank\u2019s \u201cpreferred provider of appraisal, title and settlement services\u201d in the limited categories of direct mail and high-risk consumer loan products. Thompson did not respond to the letter in writing, but did send a copy to Clewis with a note: \u201cBill, Reference our trip to [Baltimore] \u2014 we didn\u2019t make any promises but would entertain their proposals \u2014 Trent.\u201d At trial, Clewis denied previously seeing that letter, but Thompson testified that he placed the letter on Clewis\u2019 desk and talked with Clewis about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">On May 21, 1997, 3S sent what it characterized as a \u201cdraft of a performance based service agreement\u201d to Thompson, with a cover letter from 3S Chief Operating Officer Carl D. Gent. The proposed agreement included the following clauses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">\u2022 \u201c \u2018First Union National Bank hereby grants to Steele, for residential real estate secured loans, the right to perform the Traditional Services and Reports (in a minimum amount of 2,000 packages per month provided such volume exists and is not more than 50% of First Union\u2019s total volume) as listed in Exhibit A as attached hereto\u2019.... [First Union] further agrees to permit Steele to bid on providing to [First Union] any of the Non-traditional Services and Reports, as defined in Appendix A, or any other Non-traditional Service or Report, as defined, developed or required by [First Union] during the term of this Agreement, or any renewal thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">\u2022 \u201cThis Agreement shall continue ... for a period of three (3) years, or until terminated in accordance with its provisions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>\u2022 \u201cThis Agreement will be automatically renewed for an additional three (3) years ... unless either party notifies the other in writing of its intent not to renew.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\">\u2022 The agreement could only be terminated \u201cFor Cause.\u201d This draft did not include the \u201cbest efforts language\u201d from Steele\u2019s March 21,1996 letter.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Clewis responded by crossing out the minimum volume level of \u201c2000 packages,\u201d and replacing it with \u201c1,000 transactions.\u201d Steele testified that he</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">was concerned about the minimum because, you know, I had stepped out there and, you know, moved, had a lot of people, lot of mouths to feed, you know, with the employees. I had taken on debt to facilitate doing this. And I said, you know, we can negotiate the minimum transactions but I still, you know, and then we put back in the best efforts because that\u2019s what had been committed and agreed to before....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Steele explained that he was disappointed that Clewis changed the minimum because \u201cI ... went into debt, expand[ed][and] hired people[.]\u201d He explained the purpose of the minimum:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">The concern about the minimum was that they had changed the tax law or something. You do this process for like home improvements and pools and so forth as well. So, if they changed the tax law, the purpose of the minimum was to make sure that I got transactions____ [B]ut in no way was it ever imagined that a thousand units would only be First Union volume unless they drastically changed the tax law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_\">Steele also said that he was unaware of the amount of First Union\u2019s total volume at the time of these negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">According to Steele, the parties discussed the reduction of the transactional volume to a thousand transactions monthly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayh\">[Thompson and Clewis told me] that since Doug Crisp was no longer there pushing the bank or the consumer credit division that Mr. Pruitt was now involved and they didn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>think that they would be able to achieve the transaction levels that we previously in concept agreed to but the intent and commitment was still there with us, don\u2019t worry, ... we\u2019re there for you, et cetera, but they didn\u2019t think they would be able to get the document signed with a large amount of transactions in it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Clewis also crossed out the three-year term, and replaced it with a one-year term. Steele objected to this and told Clewis</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFM\">that this was not acceptable and I wasn\u2019t happy and that, you know, we needed to go back to what the original commitment and promise had been and that was a long-term relationship and a partnership.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Steele also objected to the removal of the \u201cbest efforts\u201d language. Steele thought that the \u201cbest efforts\u201d language meant that, \u201cas long as we performed, produced, continued doing the things that we were going to do, then they would send us all the transactions that we could handle and all that they could send to us and there would be a minimum that would allow for our protection!.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Steele thought this meant that First Union would send 3S approximately 85% of First Union\u2019s equity mortgage loan transactions. He and Dibble talked about doing business at that volume during their discussions prior to Dibble leaving the bank in June 1996. He did not tell Clewis or Thompson, however, that he thought \u201cbest efforts\u201d meant 85% of the bank\u2019s transactions. He figured that they knew about his discussions with Dibble:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">Mr. Clewis reaffirmed that he was very aware of what Mr. Dibble and I had discussed ... What I\u2019m trying to explain to you, sir, is Mr. Clewis said he was aware of what Mr. Dibble had committed, promised, and represented to me. And Mr. Dibble and I, we threw some various numbers around, 70, 75%.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">Dibble did not testify that he and Steele discussed a specific percentage of First Union\u2019s business.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-10\">The agreement Scott and I worked on was that with the technology Scott would have the ability to get all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>transactions. It was not an exclusive, it was not meant to be everything, but that he could handle a significant portion of volume, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Dibble did not communicate to Clewis that he \u201chad made commitments to Scott Steele that [he] expected Mr. Clewis to live up to.\u201d He thought, however, that \u201cBill knew pretty much what was going on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">According to Steele, he and Clewis never discussed what the best efforts clause meant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">Q: Do you have a memory sitting here today, Mr. Steele, of discussing best efforts and what it meant and it going back in the contract with Bill Clewis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">A: Sir, I never discussed what best efforts meant with Bill Clewis. I discussed the language in the service agreement .... I\u2019ve never had a conversation asking Mr. Clewis, Mr. Clewis, do you know what best efforts means, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">Q: I want to know, sir, if in fact when you discussed with Mr. Clewis putting best efforts language in this contract, if it is in fact your testimony that at that time you had no discussion with him about what the language meant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-10\">A: The two words \u201cbest efforts,\u201d sir, I never had that discussion, what that meant. I did have discussion with Mr. Clewis with the commitment and promise that Mr. Dibble had made in the fact that the best efforts language was in the contract. Bill acknowledged that yes, that was in fact true and to put it back in there and that\u2019s exactly what I did, sir, and I didn\u2019t think any more about it because he reaffirmed what was supposed to happen all along.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">Final Version Of SA</p>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">The final version of the SA, signed on November 29, 1997, defined the partes\u2019 undertakings as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>2. RIGHT TO PERFORM SERVICES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARe\">2.1 Services. First Union hereby grants to [3S], for real estate secured loans, the right to perform the Services and Reports as listed in Exhibit A as attached hereto, as needed by First Union, for the duration of, and in accordance with this Agreement. As used herein this Agreement, \u201cExhibit A\u201d refers to \u201cExhibit A.1\u201d attached. Subsequent revisions to Exhibit A will bear a numerical decimal sequence and date, and the most current subsequent revision will replace any prior revision. First Union further agrees to permit [3S] to bid on providing to First Union any of the NonTraditional Services and Reports, as defined, developed or required by First Union, during the term of this agreement. Also, [3S] shall agree to manage other Direct Mail database information for First Union, at a price per name or for the exclusive rights to perform services which shall be added to and be included in Exhibit A, provided the database information is not related to [3S\u2019s] traditional Services and Reports. For all of the Services and Reports, as required by First Union for Residential Real Estate secured loans, First Union will use its best efforts to direct these transactions to [3S], and while this will be a non-exclusive right First Union agrees to be subject to the provisions in Section 2.1.1 of this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-4\">2.1.1. Minimum Volume. First Union will guarantee to [3S], beginning May 1, 1998, the right to perform at least One Thousand (1,000) Transactions per calendar month for the duration of this Agreement. If One Thousand (1,000) Transactions a calendar month on average are not delivered to [3S] to perform, for any calendar year during the Term of this Agreement, First Union will carry forward the deficit and if not made up during the Term of this Agreement, will extend the Term of this Agreement and Renewal period until the Transactional commitments are fulfilled. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The SA also provided for the possibility that First Union might elect to give significantly more than the minimum required volume of transactions. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>In the event that [First Union] wishes to increase its transaction volume above the minimum transaction levels, [3S] will be obligated to perform an additional amount of Thirty percent (30%) of the minimum transactions within the stated delivery times within this Agreement. If First Union wishes to increase the volume significantly above the Minimum Volume stated in 2.1.1 of this Agreement with the anticipation of [3S] maintaining its delivery schedules, then First Union shall notify [3S] in writing of such increase sixty days prior to such increase. [3S] upon receiving notice, will consider but not be obligated to re-negotiate the above pricing schedule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Regarding the term of the SA, the final version of the SA provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">4. TERM AND TERMINATION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">4.1 Term. This Agreement .... shall continue in full force and effect for a period of two (2) years commencing after the Ramp Up Period [defined as a period ending May 1, 1998], or until terminated in accordance with its provisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">4.2 Renewal. This Agreement will be automatically renewable for one year terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\">4.3 Termination.... First Union may terminate this Agreement without cause after May 1, 2000, provided however, First Union provides [3S] with a one year notice of cancellation. Said notice shall not be delivered to [3S] prior to May 1, 2000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">Steele testified that the SA was the first step to the long-term relationship and partnership, which was something the parties discussed early on.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">Implementation Of SA</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">After execution of the SA, 3S\u2019s volume of business from First Union increased from 1,500 transactions in the month before the SA was signed to an average exceeding 3,500 transactions per month in the spring of 1998. During the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>\u201cRamp Up Period,\u201d defined in the SA as the time from November 29, 1997 until May 1, 1998, transactions increased dramatically, without the bank giving Steele any advance notice of the increases. Steele said that he could not tell whether he was getting most of the bank\u2019s business because he had no access to their volume or transaction list.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Steele was aware that there were other vendors providing similar services to First Union. Regarding exclusivity, Steele said, \u201cwe would have loved to have that happen but it wasn\u2019t reality.... [I]t would not be unreasonable to have a backup vendor to support First Union in case we imploded for some reason.\u201d Clewis told Steele that one of these vendors, ATM, was just a backup vendor.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The SA was profitable for 3S in the first year. The revenue from First Union was approximately $4 million, about 40-50% of 3S\u2019s gross revenue in 1998, which was about $8 million. In 1996, the year prior to the contract, 3S lost $300,000 on gross revenues of $3.8 million. In 1998, the first full year of the SA, it had a net income of $544,000 on revenues of $8.2 million. In 1999, 3S had $862,000 of profit on revenues of 8.3 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">On February 11, 1998, Thompson, in connection with First Union\u2019s \u201cSupplier Partnership Conference,\u201d nominated 3S for an award, writing that \u201c3S has proven to be a true partner with First Union. Their dedication to serve our external customer is exemplified each day as they drive to exceed our expectation.\u201d He explained in the nomination form that 3S \u201coffers a fully automated statistical property evaluation that eliminates our customers having to take time away from work to meet with an independent appraiser. This product costs less than 75% of the traditional property evaluation products[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">Although the SA did not limit 3S to providing its services only to First Union, there were comments made by Clewis and one other bank officer that 3S should not \u201cgo across the street.\u201d Steele interpreted these comments to mean that First Union did not want 3S providing services to their fiercest competitor, NationsBank. Although Steele told First <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Union, \u201cwe\u2019re focused on your organization, we have no reason to go anywhere else,\u201d he did have discussions with both SunTrust and Wells Fargo about joint ventures with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Changes At First Union And Pricing Problems</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">In late 1998, Clewis was transferred to a new position and was relieved of his vendor management responsibilities. Thompson had been relieved of his vendor management responsibilities earlier that year. By March 1999, First Union\u2019s three consumer credit operations had been consolidated in North Brunswick, New Jersey, under the direction of Jim Keenan and Jennifer Buzzi, who had previously managed First Fidelity\u2019s credit services, using between 20 and 25 vendors.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Buzzi soon discovered that the Charlotte vendors were charging substantially higher rates than the bank was paying in New Jersey \u2014 up to $30 more per transaction. \u201cAppalled\u201d at the disparity, Buzzi arranged to meet with 3S and three other vendors in Charlotte on March 3, 1999. At this meeting, Buzzi asked the vendors to decrease their prices to a reasonable level. Steele agreed to review his pricing and get back to her. On April 16, 3S responded that it would lower its pricing for property and judgment reports to $98 in specified counties, but the pricing was \u201ccontingent upon 3S maintaining our current volume levels of a minimum of 3,000 property and judgment reports per month[.]\u201d Buzzi did not accept this proposal, because \u201cnot only did they not drop [prices] low enough[,] they wanted more volume.\u201d She indicated there was still a $20 per transaction difference in the pricing, which \u201cwould have cost the bank ... $60,000 a month.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">On April 29, Steele offered the same price on \u201cfully underwritten Property and Judgment reports,\u201d and offered to \u201cmake available our automated valuation product\u201d for $30, without the new minimum volume. By letter of May 4, Gent notified First Union that 3S was officially dropping to these prices. 3S, however, reserved the right to go back to its higher price of $113 \u201cshould we see a significant drop in volume.\u201d The volume for the month of April 1999 was 4,432 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>transactions. Buzzi told 3S that these terms were unacceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">First Union\u2019s Election Not To Renew SA</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">On April 28, 1999, Buzzi sent a letter to Steele outlining her interpretation of the Minimum Volume requirement under the SA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">Under Section 2.1.1 of the Agreement, First Union agreed to provide [3S] the opportunity to perform Services ... on a minimum of one thousand (1000) loans per month during the twenty-four month term of the Agreement. It is First Union\u2019s position that Section 2.1.1 contemplates that the 1000 loans per month volume is an average---- According to First Union\u2019s records, under the terms of the Agreement, [3S] has to date provided Services on at least 29,000 First Union loans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">Having met its minimum obligation under terms of the Agreement, First Union will no longer be providing [3S] with the opportunity to provide Services on any additional First Union loans. While this action does not constitute a termination of the Agreement, should [3S] desire to continue to provide Services to First Union, First Union is willing to negotiate an early termination of the Agreement and the execution of a new agreement which will provide for new performance levels and price criteria.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">Finally, in the event that no new agreement is executed between First Union and [3S], this letter shall serve as First Union\u2019s notice pursuant to Section 4.3 of the Agreement that First Union will allow this Agreement to expire on May 1, 2000 and that no renewal of said Agreement will be honored.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">Buzzi\u2019s letter was drafted by Christopher Tucci, Esq., an officer of First Union, and a corporate lawyer for First Union Corporation. Buzzi sought Tucci\u2019s advice on First Union\u2019s \u201cspecific obligations\u201d under the SA. Tucci and Buzzi conversed about once a week regarding 3S between April 1999 and March 2000. At the time Tucci drafted the April 1999 letter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>he knew that First Union was planning to co-own a settlement services company.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Steele responded to Buzzi\u2019s letter on May 3, 1999, expressing his \u201cshock[ ]\u201d upon receiving it. He pointed out that the SA called for \u201c \u2018a minimum of 1,000 transactions per month\u2019 \u201d and rejected her interpretation that an average of 1,000 over the entire term was sufficient. He continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">Without getting into the details of our extensive and lengthy negotiations with the Senior management at that time, the language was mutually negotiated as a compromise to provide First Union with what it determined to be the products and services it needed as well to ensure our volumes and work levels until May 1, 2001....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">We also understand your directive in your attempt to lower your fees. However, we would like First Union to state in writing that they want us to change or eliminate our current standard of underwriting as you have stated to us verbally. We have sent you a proposed pricing structure for our existing title product. We will attempt to push this down even further as we get more response from the field....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-8\">In closing, Jennifer, I do not think it is necessary to take a \u201chardball\u201d approach in attempting to negotiate. We value the First Union relationship and have serviced First Union by delivering the highest quality products and services. We look forward to continuing our relationship and hope that First Union realizes the value that we provide. Although you may not agree with the existing Terms and Conditions of the [SA] ..., we expect First Union to honor its current contractual obligations. We are open for further discussions to attempt to come to a mutually acceptable resolution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4\">Although Gent and Buzzi had a conversation on May 4 about the new pricing levels adopted by 3S, they did not discuss the April 28 letter of non-renewal. There is no evidence that Steele or anyone representing 3S said anything <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>to Buzzi or other bank officials to suggest that 3S was entitled to 85-90% of the bank\u2019s transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Overdue Invoices</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The discussions about price and volume paralleled ongoing communications about certain invoices that 3S claimed had not been paid by First Union. In October 1998, 3S submitted to First Union several hundred outstanding invoices, many of which pre-dated the SA. These totaled $375,227.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">First Union officials told Steele that they had not seen the invoices before and that it would take considerable time to \u201csort through\u201d them and verify that they were validly connected with a loan. First Union paid $72,630 in February 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Although the invoices pre-dated Buzzi\u2019s tenure in vendor management, when the invoices were only partially paid by April 1999, 3S forwarded them to Buzzi, asking her to get involved. Responding to this request, Buzzi wrote to 3S on April 24, 1999:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">I would suggest to [3S] that you identify the First Union Department and contact person that was responsible for placing these orders with 3S. The Consumer Credit Division is not going to pay for another Division\u2019s expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-9\">I will try [to] assist Steele in any way I can, but considering the age of the invoices this will take considerable time and research. Please be advised that Consumer Credit will not submit any invoice for payment unless we have both verified that our Division is responsible, backed up with sufficient 3S documentation, and also verify payment has not previously been issued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">As Buzzi suggested, 3S provided First Union again with the unpaid invoices, and the parties discussed them. By letter dated June 30, 1999, First Union offered to pay 3S $150,000 \u201cto be applied against First Union\u2019s outstanding balance with Steele[.]\u201d The letter said that the payment was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Am\">being made solely for the purposes of preventing Steele from incurring undue financial hardship and in no way constitutes an agreement or admission that any such in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>voices or charges made by [3S] under the terms of the [SA] are valid or enforceable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The letter also asked that 3S, upon written demand of First Union, immediately refund the payment, and if it did not, the bank would have the option to \u201cexercise any rights and remedies granted [under the SA], including, but not limited to immediate termination of said Agreement.\u201d 3S did not accept the terms of this offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The parties finally agreed to a mechanism for resolution of their dispute. By letter agreement dated July 9, 1999,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the bank agreed to pay $150,000 immediately \u201cas a good faith gesture toward a final disposition of the total balance outstanding,\u201d reserving the right to \u201cresearch the validity of the Invoices.\u201d The bank also agreed to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYe\">conclude its research [on the validity of the invoices] and remit payment to [3S] on all verified invoices no later than August 31, 1999. Should First Union determine that any of the Invoices are not valid or that any of said Invoices had been previously paid, and therefore are not due and owing to [3S], First Union will pay all undisputed invoices and provide [3S], with a written notice of its determination regarding disputed invoices, together with supporting documentation, no later than August 31, 1999.[3S] shall have fifteen days from the date of such notice to present additional information in support of any such challenged invoices, to which First Union will respond within fifteen days. Any unresolved dispute concerning the validity of any such invoices shall be resolved by binding arbitration[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Although First Union paid the $150,000 due on July 1, it did not live up to its agreement to determine and pay the balance of the undisputed invoices by August 31, 1999. In October, First Union made an offer to settle for an additional $120,000, provided 3S released First Union from any obligations under the SA. This offer was not accepted by 3S.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Final resolution of this dispute was not made until November 5, 1999, when the parties entered an \u201cAgreement and Release,\u201d in which First Union agreed to pay $245,000 within one day, and 3S released First Union from claims relating to the disputed invoices. This sum was paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Declining Volume For 3S</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Although the number of transactions First Union sent to 3S exceeded 2,000 per month from March 1998 through July 1999, they started to decline in August 1999 and fell below the agreed Minimum Volume in October 1999. Steele\u2019s expert witness introduced a chart showing the actual volume of transactions referred to 3S from First Union, the bank\u2019s actual volume, and the amount 3S could have handled from January 1998 \u2014 February 2003. This chart is set forth in relevant part below:</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Steele\u2019s Actual Title and Appraisal Countvs. Steele\u2019s Projected Capacity with growth at 1000 per month (Jan-May 98), 1500 per month initially (Jun-Oct 98) and 1250 per month until capacity caps off at 60,000</p>\n<p id=\"Ax\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b151-139\">Steele wrote to Buzzi on September 22,1999:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-140\">We continue to see a dramatic decrease in transaction volume during the last 90 days. Given this fact, and pursuant to Carl Gent\u2019s letter of May 4, 1999, please be advised that unless we begin to receive a flow of transactions similar to levels of earlier this year, we will return to a rate of $120.00 for title reports, per the service agreement.... When transaction volume returns to the previous levels we would welcome the opportunity to re-visit this issue with you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-141\">During late fall 1999 and January 2000, Steele attempted to coordinate further discussions with First Union about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>decrease in volume, without success. On February 8, 2000, Steele wrote a long letter to First Union summarizing the history of the relationship, including the problems with payment of invoices and the declining volume of business.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-4\">[ 3S] has historically enjoyed the highest approval from First Union processors in matters of quality, promptness, and customer support. The only issue appears to be price.... My goal has always been to convene a meeting at which we could find a positive business solution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">In March 2000, First Union scheduled a meeting with Steele to see what could be worked out about the SA. In anticipation of this meeting, Steele prepared a presentation for First Union. In this presentation, Steele characterized the 3S/First Union relationship as \u201c[t]remendous until consolidation in New Jersey where unpaid invoices, service agreement and pricing seems to have created a relationship issue.\u201d Under the heading, \u201cSummary of Current Issues,\u201d Steele wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Current contract provides for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">\u2022 Minimum 1000 orders per month (we are currently receiving less).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">\u2022 Pricing at $120 per P &amp; J: we agreed to lower our pricing per our May, 1999 letter \u2014 instead volume dramatically decreased; subsequently we notified [First Union] of our intentions with no response. Until an alternative agreement is reached, our original contract must be honored.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">\u2022 Payment terms are net 15 days from date of invoice ( [First Union] AP currently holds invoices from date they receive approved invoice even if invoice is 11 months overdue).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">We suggest that we agree to disagree at this point and talk about alternative arrangements.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">In none of his correspondence with First Union did Steele ever mention that First Union was obligated to send any specific percentage of its loan business to 3S, or assert any volume requirement under the SA except the Minimum Volume.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Four First Union vice presidents and Tucci attended the March 13, 2000 meeting with Steele. According to Steele, First Union Senior Vice President Kirk Bare, who was by then heading the Consumer Credit Division, told him that \u201che would pay the differential.... He also stated that, you know, that for us to continue doing business, we would have to tear up the agreement[.]\u201d When Steele responded that Bare\u2019s approach was \u201can extremely heavy-handed way of doing business,\u201d Bare asserted: \u201c T can be heavy-handed. I\u2019m First Union.\u2019 \u201d Buzzi\u2019s notes from the meeting confirmed that Bare agreed to pay all outstanding invoices only if Steele would \u201csend a letter terminating the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">After the meeting, on April 19, 2000, 3S sent a letter to First Union indicating that \u201cwe construe the agreement to provide for at least 12,000 more orders, plus the makeup of any monthly volume shortages before it has been satisfied.\u201d 3S also proposed that it \u201csubstantively alter its product mix and pricing for First Union in such a way that we can operate on a working basis that would enable us to shelve the written agreement, and let it expire according to its own terms.\u201d The parties failed to reach agreement on continuing their relationship, and referrals of business to 3S ceased altogether after June 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">First Union\u2019s Plans For Its Own Settlement Services Company</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">In 1993 or 1994, prior to 3S\u2019s first presentation to First Union, First Union internally discussed creating its own settlement services company to address the problem that its thousands of individual branches were decentralized and that \u201cthe branches performed all the functions of acquiring title, appraisal at the branch level. They followed up, tracked it, and did everything necessary to make that happen. And ... it was a nightmare and mess.\u201d The branches were \u201cdrowning in paper.\u201d Margaret England, a regulatory compliance attorney working for First Union Mortgage Company (FUMC) Senior Vice President Jim Maynor, was tracking legislation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>that might affect First Union\u2019s plan to establish its own settlement service business.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">During these same years, First Union also considered the alternative of buying a settlement services company. As indicated earlier, the bank\u2019s early discussions with Steele included plans for First Union to purchase an equity interest in 3S. Although Steele included some proposals for such purchase in some of his written proposals to First Union, they were not part of the final SA.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Three years later, on November 14, 1997, a date two weeks before it signed the SA, First Union issued a strategic plan in which it continued the goal of centralizing and automating the home equity loan process. In June 1998, the Comptroller of the Currency issued a letter to Mellon Bank, N.A. advising that it was permitted to enter into a joint venture with a national vendor to provide centralized services for Mellon\u2019s residential loans \u2014 the same service that 3S provided for First Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Two months later, England distributed a memorandum suggesting that FUMC, a First Union subsidiary that made home mortgage loans, work with two other First Union subsidiaries, First Union Home Equity Bank and The Money Store, to explore the possibility of forming a joint venture with an outside company to manage settlement services. The August 12, 1998 memo noted that FUMC\u2019s \u201cmajor mortgage banking competitors\u201d were setting up similar ventures.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">In the fall of 1998, First Union issued a Request For Proposals (\u201cRFP\u201d) to a number of vendors, seeking assistance in establishing a subsidiary and providing automation and management services.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Eight companies bid on the project, including ValuAmeriea, which projected a \u201cfive-year aggregate revenue of approximately $2.4 billion and a five-year aggre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>gate profit of $1.1 billion.\u201d Although 3S responded to the RFP, it was not selected as a finalist. When Steele learned that 8S was not selected, he called England on March 16 and reminded her that 3S had the SA. The next day he wrote to her offering ways in which 3S could address the problems First Union had with its proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">First Union chose ValuAmerica, and entered an agreement for ValuAmerica to provide services, and allowing First Union to buy out ValuAmerica for approximately $30 million. The new settlement services company, known as \u201cGreenLink,\u201d began doing business on June 1, 2000. Within a year, First Union bought out ValuAmerica and became the sole owner of a hugely profitable settlement services company.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">July Verdict</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">At the end of the trial, the jury found that First Union breached the SA, that it did not give proper notice of non-renewal or termination, and that the SA ended on May 1, 2001. It awarded 3S $21,240,614 in damages for breach for the period from January 1, 1998 to April 30, 2000. It awarded an additional $16,235,728 in damages for the period May 1, 2000 to April 30, 2001. It also found that First Union fraudulently induced 3S to enter the SA, and awarded compensatory damages of $39,476,342. In a separate verdict the following day, it awarded punitive damages for the fraud in the amount of $200,000,000. Finding that the $37,476,342 compensatory damages for breach of contract duplicated the $39,476,342 compensatory damages for fraudulent inducement, the trial court entered judgment against First Union for compensatory damages in the amount of $39,476,342. It entered judgment against First Union for $200,000,000 in punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">First Union filed motions for a new trial, for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and for remittitur, all of which were denied by the trial court. First Union filed a timely appeal from these verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The Facts Proven Were Not Sufficient To Establish Fraud</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The elements for a fraud action in Maryland were clearly summarized in a leading fraud case, <em>Martens Chevrolet, Inc. v. Seney, </em>292 Md. 328, 439 A.2d 534 (1982):</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">The requirements for a successful deceit suit, as they have evolved in Maryland, were stated by this court ... over fifty years ago, and they remain the same to this day:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-9\">To entitle the plaintiff to recover it must be shown: (1) that the representation made is false; (2) that its falsity was either known to the speaker, or the misrepresentation was made with such a reckless indifference to truth as to be equivalent to actual knowledge; (3) that it was made for the purpose of defrauding the person claiming to be injured thereby; (4) that such person not only relied upon the misrepresentation, but had a right to rely upon it in the full belief of its truth, and that he would not have done the thing from which the injury resulted had not such misrepresentation been made; and (5) that he actually suffered damage directly resulting from such fraudulent misrepresentation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 333, 439 A.2d 534 (citation omitted). The plaintiff must prove these elements by \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>VF Corp. v. Wrexham Aviation Corp., </em>350 Md. 693, 704, 715 A.2d 188 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">Although a cause of action for fraud may not rest on a statement about future events, a person may commit fraud if he or she enters an agreement to do something, without the present intention of performing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-12\">[Wjhere one person induces another to part with his money or property by means of a promise which he makes with the intention of not performing it, he is guilty of actionable fraud.

There is a <em>prima facie </em>presump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>tion of honesty and fairness in the dealings of mankind, and hence when one person makes a promise to another as an inducement for a change of position, the promisee has the right to assume that the promisor has an existing intention to fulfill his promise. The existing intention of a party at the time of contracting is a matter of fact, and may be material to the validity of the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><em>Appel v. Hupfield, </em>198 Md. 374, 382, 84 A.2d 94 (1951). It is this type of fraud that 3S asserted against First Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">In this appeal, we are called upon to decide whether \u201cevidence when viewed in its entirety does not establish, clearly and convincingly, a prima facie case of fraud on the part of\u2019 First Union. <em>See Wrexham, </em>350 Md. at 715, 715 A.2d 188 (reversing jury verdict finding fraudulent inducement on grounds that circumstantial evidence shown was not sufficient to establish fraudulent intent).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In doing so, we must \u201cassume the truth of all credible evidence and all inferences of fact reasonably [deducible] from the evidence supporting [3S].\u201d <em>Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Tufts, </em>118 Md.App. 180, 190, 702 A.2d 422 (1997). We resolve all conflicts in evidence in favor of 3S. <em>See Jacobs v. Flynn, </em>131 Md.App. 342, 353, 749 A.2d 174, <em>cert. denied sub nom. Kishel v. Jacobs, </em>359 Md. 669, 755 A.2d 1140 (2000). \u201cIf the record discloses any legally relevant and competent evidence, however slight, from which the jury could rationally find as it did, we must affirm the denial of the motion [for judgment notwithstanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>the verdict].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353, 749 A.2d 174. Although 3S proved hard-nosed business dealings on the part of First Union, leading up to a deliberate and substantial breach of contract, we conclude that the evidence, when viewed in its entirety, falls short of proving fraud in the inducement.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">In examining the First Union representations that 3S relies upon to prove fraud, we classify them in three categories. The first category consists of the written promise of First Union contained in the SA that we referred to as the \u201cbest efforts\u201d clause. As we explain further below, First Union\u2019s intentions regarding the \u201cbest efforts\u201d clause were not sufficient to show the scienter necessary to prove fraudulent intent not to perform, largely because this clause was ambiguous, and the parties did not discuss what it meant.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The second category consists of representations that could not be reasonably relied on in this commercial transaction because they contradict the express terms of the SA. The third category includes representations that are so broad and vague that they are not actionable misrepresentations, and fall within the category of \u201cpuffing.\u201d As shall be shown in the discussion that follows, sometimes these categories overlap.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The \u201cBest Efforts\u201d Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">3S argues that the \u201cbest efforts\u201d clause meant that First Union was promising to give it 75-85% of the title and appraisal work needed for all home equity loans made by the bank. The trial court found that the \u201cbest efforts\u201d clause at least meant that First Union promised to give 3S the settlement services on more than 50% of their loans. In support of their view that the necessary fraudulent intent was proven, both 3S and the trial court point to a statement made by Clewis at trial that he never intended to give 3S more than 50% of First Union\u2019s business because it was not prudent for the bank to \u201cput all our eggs in one basket.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">\u201cMaryland has adopted the overwhelming majority rule of the American courts in holding that fraud may be predicated on promises made with a present intention not to perform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>them.\u201d <em>Tufts v. Poore, </em>219 Md. 1, 11,147 A.2d 717 (1959). To establish a claim for fraudulent inducement based on First Union\u2019s failure to intend to give 50% or more of its business to 3S, however, requires a showing first that First Union knew that the SA clearly required that level of performance by First Union. Fraudulent intent not to fulfill a performance requirement that First Union never undertook, does not support a cause of action for fraudulent inducement.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">It must be remembered, moreover, that 3S\u2019s fraud claim was based on fraudulent inducement to enter the SA. That is what Steele stated. He said that Clewis never told him the SA was a two-year agreement limited to 1,000 transactions per month, and that if he had, Steele would not have signed the contract. Rather, he \u201cwould have asked [Clewis] to honor the commitments that he and his predecessors had made to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Most importantly, that is what the jury was asked to find, and did find, in answer to written interrogatories on the verdict sheet. On the verdict sheet, with respect to the fraud count, the jury was asked and answered the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">2. Do you find by clear and convincing evidence that [First Union] fraudulently induced [3S] to enter into the [SA]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">[Yes]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-10\">If you answered \u201cYes\u201d to Question 2, please answer Question 2(a)....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-12\">2(a) Based on a preponderance of the evidence, how much, if any, do you award to [3S] for compensatory damages for Fraud in the Inducement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-14\">$39,476,342.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-15\">Therefore, 3S needed to prove fraudulent intent with respect to the obligations undertaken in the SA</p>\n<p id=\"b159-16\">Our analysis of the whether First Union committed fraud by signing the SA and its \u201cbest efforts\u201d clause without intending to perform its obligations thereunder starts with close examination of the clause itself, and how it fits within the entire contract. Referring to the language of section 2.1 that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>quoted previously, we observe that First Union promised that, \u201c[flor all the of Services and Reports, as required by First Union for Residential Real Estate secured loans, First Union will use its best efforts to direct these transactions to [8S], and while this will be a non-exclusive right First Union agrees to be subject to the provisions in Section 2.1.1 of this Agreement.\u201d Section 2.1.1 establishes a Minimum Volume of transactions that First Union guaranteed to 3S.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The language in sections 2.1 and 2.1.1 is internally inconsistent. The isolated phrase, \u201cbest efforts to direct these transactions to [3S],\u201d could be interpreted to mean that the parties intend that, unless there are laws or circumstances precluding First Union from sending all such transactions to 3S, the bank will do so. But the parties also agreed that this is a \u201cnonexclusive right[.]\u201d Significantly, this language removes any doubt about whether First Union could make referrals to other vendors, and even suggests that there may be other vendors who can share the right to receive First Union\u2019s \u201cbest efforts\u201d to refer them business. Thus, one reasonable reading is that 3S had a right to receive referrals on at least as favorable a basis as offered to comparable vendors. Alternatively, it may be read to mean that there are other vendors to whom First Union may refer business, without necessarily making \u201cbest efforts\u201d toward them.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">There is no definition of \u201cbest efforts\u201d in the SA. Nor have we found a definitive meaning under statute or case law. Rather, \u201cbest efforts\u201d is a term \u201cwhich necessarily takes its meaning from the circumstances.\u201d <em>Bloor v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., </em>454 F.Supp. 258, 266 (S.D.N.Y.1978), <em>aff'd, </em>601 F.2d 609 (2d Cir.1979); <em>see also Triple-A Baseball Club Assocs. v.

Because courts sometimes confuse the standard of best efforts with that of good faith, it will be well ... to make plain the distinction between the two standards. Good faith is a standard that has honesty and fairness at its core and that is imposed on every party to a contract. Best efforts is a standard that has diligence as its essence and is imposed only on those contracting parties that have undertaken such performance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-7\"><em>E.

Farnsworth answered the question, \u201chow is this standard of diligence to be set?\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">Courts have generally responded in two ways. The first is to imagine the promisor and the promisee united in a single person and to ask what efforts a reasonable person in that situation would exert on his or her own behalf. The second is to imagine a third person to be in the promisor\u2019s place to ask what efforts a reasonable person in that situation would exert.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 8 (footnotes omitted). <em>See also </em>E.

Johnson Wax Dev. Corp., </em>908 F.2d 1363, 1373 (7th Cir.1990). The First Circuit has held that \u201cbest efforts\u201d in a contract \u201cto promote worldwide licensing and use\u201d of the contracting party\u2019s product required \u201cactive exploitation in good faith.\u201d <em>Western Geophysical Co. of Am., Inc. v. Bolt Assocs., Inc., </em>584 F.2d 1164, 1171 (2d Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">A promise to use \u201cbest efforts\u201d does not necessarily mean that the promisor is required to give all of its efforts toward assisting or promoting the promisee\u2019s interests or product, or that the promisor is prohibited from promoting competing products. <em>See Van Valkenburgh, Nooger &amp; Neville, Inc. v. Hayden Publ\u2019g Co., </em>30 N.Y.2d 34, 330 N.Y.S.2d 329, 281 N.E.2d 142, 144-45 (1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 875, 93 S.Ct. 125, 34 L.Ed.2d 128 (1972)(licensees who agree to make \u201cbest efforts\u201d to promote licensor\u2019s product are not restricted in promoting competing products).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number><em>Bloor, </em>601 F.2d at 614 (Falstaff Brewing could market its own beers and still fulfill promise to make best efforts to promote and market Ballentine beer); <em>Farnsworth on Contracts, Supra, </em>\u00a7 7.17c, at 388 (\u201ccourts agree ... that a duty of best efforts does not of itself impose a duty of exclusive dealing, although it should be open to the promisee to show that the parties understood the term to include such a duty\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">We are not persuaded that merely signing the best efforts clause necessarily means that First Union officials knew that they were contractually obligated to make more than 50% of their referrals to 3S. Although the clause uses the term \u201cFor all of the Services and Reports, as required by First Union for Residential Real Estate secured loans,\u201d it explicitly states that 3S\u2019s \u201cright\u201d shall be \u201cnon-exclusive.\u201d Thus, First Union could reasonably expect that it would be referring a meaningful amount of business to other vendors.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Furthermore, the term \u201cServices\u201d itself creates an ambiguity as to what was intended. \u201cServices\u201d is defined elsewhere in the SA as \u201cthose functions, documents, or other data provided by Steele to First Union National Bank in response to a request for information on a particular real property.\u201d (Emphasis added.) If \u201call Services and Reports as required by First Union\u201d means simply those services given \u201cin response to a request\u201d from the bank, then the bank would have nothing more than an obligation to act in good faith in requesting some services. Thus, incorporating the definition of \u201cServices\u201d into section 2.1, 3S reasonably could believe that it was within its discretion how much volume it requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">In interpreting a contract, courts will review the contract \u201cas a whole to determine the parties\u2019 intentions.\u201d <em>Sullins v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>340 Md. 503, 508, 667 A.2d 617 (1995). Other clauses in the SA, and the history of the negotiations suggest that the parties did not intend that First Union give more than 50% of its business to 3S. The titling of section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>2.1.1, \u201cMinimum Volume,\u201d indicates that the only specific guarantee as to volume is contained therein. That section provides only that \u201cFirst Union will guarantee to [3S], beginning May 1, 1998, the right to perform at least One Thousand (1,000) Transactions per calendar month for the duration of this Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Exhibit A.1, expressly incorporated into section 2.1, also indicates that, so long as First Union remained above the section 2.1 Minimum Volume levels, it was within First Union\u2019s discretion to decide what any additional volume would be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">In the event that [First Union] wishes to increase its transaction volume above the minimum transaction levels, [3S] will be obligated to perform an additional amount of Thirty percent (30%) of the minimum transactions within the stated delivery times within this Agreement. If First Union wishes to increase the volume significantly above the Minimum Volume stated in 2.1.1 of this Agreement with the anticipation of [3S] maintaining its delivery schedules [as specified in the SA], then First Union shall notify [3S] in writing of such increase sixty days prior to such increase. [3S], upon receiving notice, will consider but not be obligated to re-negotiate the above pricing schedule. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">We shall refer to this clause as the \u201c130% Clause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">In short, the SA was not at all clear that, in exerting its \u201cbest efforts,\u201d First Union was required to give 3S 50%, 75%, or any other specific percentage of business. Although the best efforts clause referred to \u201call of the Services and Reports,\u201d the term \u201cServices\u201d was ambiguous, the clause was qualified as non-exclusive, and the 130% Clause suggested that, above the Minimum Volume, First Union had the discretion to decide how much business to refer.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">Moreover, there is no evidence that Clewis or Thompson made representations to Steele to suggest that the \u201cbest efforts\u201d clause was intended to guarantee more than 50% of the bank\u2019s volume. Steele admitted that he never discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>with Clewis or Thompson the meaning of the \u201cbest efforts\u201d clause. He never told either Clewis or Thompson that he thought that it meant 3S would receive 75-85% of the bank\u2019s business, 50% of the bank\u2019s business, or any other specific percentage of business. Reviewing the language of the SA, and in the absence of any discussion indicating that the \u201cbest efforts\u201d clause meant that 50% was required, we cannot sustain a finding that Clewis fraudulently intended not to perform, simply because he never intended to refer more than 50% of the bank\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">3S does not contend that Dibble possessed fraudulent intent. Rather, 3S argues that Steele and Dibble had conversations that would support his interpretation that the SA meant he would get 50% or more of First Union\u2019s business, that Dibble informed Clewis about these conversations, and that Clewis never intended to give more than 50% of the bank\u2019s business. Clewis had told Steele that he \u201cwas aware of what Mr. Dibble had committed, promised, and represented to me[,]\u201d and that 3S remained First Union\u2019s vendor of choice\u2014 \u201cnothing had changed.\u201d The conversations Steele said he had with Dibble were far from concrete, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Steele testified that Dibble said that if Steele delivered on his promises, 8S \u201ccould be the beneficiary of all the transactions that they could send to us.\u201d Similarly, Steele said that he and Dibble discussed that \u201cbest efforts\u201d meant \u201cthat he could send all the transactions that he could and that I could handle.\u201d This statement is vague in itself. All the transactions First Union \u201ccould\u201d send might easily mean those that it could send after taking into account First Union\u2019s need, as Clewis explained, to maintain multiple vendors to get good service, to maintain competitive pricing, and to safeguard against natural and technological disasters. A promise to use best efforts does not require that a party disregard its own interests. <em>See NCNB Nat\u2019l Bank of N.C. v. Bridgewater Steam Power Co., </em>740 F.Supp. 1140, 1152 (W.D.N.C. 1990)(\u201cThe requirement that a party use its best efforts necessarily does not prevent the party from giving reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>consideration to its own interests\u201d)(citing <em>Bloor, </em>454 F.Supp. at 267).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">The only thing Steele said about a specific percentage was that he and Dibble, well over a year before the SA was signed, had \u201cthr[own] some various numbers around, 70, 75%.\u201d But in March 1996, even before Dibble\u2019s departure from First Union, Dibble had rejected 3S\u2019s September 1995 proposal that the bank guarantee 70%.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> To the contrary, in March 1996, First Union circulated a draft that had no minimum volume requirement and no exclusivity clause. Moreover, Steele did not testify that he and Dibble ever agreed that 75% or any particular percentage of the bank\u2019s business would be guaranteed in the contract. He also acknowledged that Thompson and Clewis told him, with respect to the Minimum Volume being reduced, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">since Doug Crisp was no longer there pushing the bank or the consumer credit division that Mr. Pruitt was now involved and they didn\u2019t think that they would be able to achieve the transaction levels that we previously in concept agreed to but the intent and commitment was still there with us, don\u2019t worry ... we\u2019re there for you, et cetera, but they didn\u2019t think they would be able to get the document signed with a large amount of transactions in it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Nor did Dibble say the bank had promised at least 50% of their transactions. Dibble testified that he wanted to put Steele into the position where his computerized appraisal and title service could be directly accessed by all the branches. We examine that testimony below.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Dibble first explained that when he was working with Steele to prepare to perform title and appraisal services for the direct mail project, it was necessary for a significant number of users to access the computer system at one time because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>the bank had 2,000 branches, with one to three lenders in a branch. This meant that the computers needed to have the capacity to handle up to 5,000 or 6,000 users at one time. He indicated that at the completion of the ATAPS pilot project, this goal was accomplished, and approximately 2,000 branches could log onto 3S.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">When asked about the \u201cbest efforts\u201d clause, Dibble said nothing about guaranteeing 50% or more:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">Q: Was it your intent, Mr. Dibble, to in any way limit the amount of transactions that were to go to 3S other than limitations by law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">A: Limitations by law and stuff that was beyond my authority. I couldn\u2019t commit branches to it, but I wasn\u2019t intentionally trying to limit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">Q: Was it your intent to send 3S all that 3S could handle and all that FU could generate except by limitations by law? A: It was my intent to create a mechanism to where Scott \u2014 we could access Scott\u2019s system, get to appraisals, [Sjcott could \u2014 and with certain ramp ups in service levels, Scott could handle the volume that was coming through those branches, whatever that would look like. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Dibble also was asked about his intent with respect to the \u201cbest efforts\u201d clause in the April 16, 1996 draft of the SA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8\">Q: What did you intend the term \u201cbest efforts\u201d to mean with respect to this relationship?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">A: That once we had a connection between Scott and First Union, that would be the best efforts to direct the transactions believing that the branches would take advantage of an ability to close loans faster and/or gain appraisals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">And for those that chose not to because they have somebody down the street to do business, obviously this would give them the ability to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-11\">Q: But you meant \u201cbest efforts\u201d to include sending as many transactions within the entire 2,000 branch [First Union] footprint as possible or that Scott could handle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>A: I couldn\u2019t direct them, but my belief was that Scott could reasonably assume to get a significant portion of the volume. And my intent was not to limit him.... The functionality would be there for him to get that. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Dibble also said, when asked about his conceptual agreement with Steele:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">[T]he agreement Scott and I worked on was that with the technology Scott would have the ability to get all the transactions. It was not an exclusive, it was not meant to be everything, but that he could handle a significant portion of volume, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Thus, although Dibble thought that 3S might get more than 50% of the transactions because of his technology, nowhere did Dibble say that he agreed to commit the bank to this amount. Nor did Dibble say that he told Steele that he had authority to commit the bank to such an amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">Even if the testimony of Steele and Dibble was sufficient to allow the jury to infer that Clewis knew that Steele and Dibble had discussed 3S getting 75% of the bank\u2019s business, we do not think that the SA was sufficiently clear to establish that Clewis, in entering the SA on behalf of First Union, knew that he was making this kind of commitment on the part of the bank. Yet proof that Clewis understood that he was committing to give more than 50% of the bank\u2019s business to 3S is essential if proof of his fraudulent intent is predicated on his trial testimony, that he never intended to give more than 50%.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">Let us be clear. We are not saying that, as a contractual matter, the \u201cbest efforts\u201d clause had no meaning, and that the only enforceable promise by First Union was the Minimum Volume. As we suggested above, and we expand on in section II, we think, in assessing 3S\u2019s contract claim, the jury could have decided that the best efforts clause imposed some requirement on First Union to diligently refer a significant amount of business to 3S, even if it did not require First Union to refer a specifically agreed upon percentage of its business.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>A cause of action for fraud, however, has a strict requirement of scienter. \u201c \u2018[R]ecovery in a tort action for fraud or deceit in Maryland is based upon a defendant\u2019s deliberate intent to deceive.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wrexham, </em>350 Md. at 704, 715 A.2d 188 (quoting <em>Ellerin v. Fairfax Sav., </em>337 Md. 216, 230, 652 A.2d 1117 (1995)). <em>See also Miller v. Fairchild Indus., Inc., </em>97 Md.App. 324, 342, 629 A.2d 1293, <em>cert. denied, </em>333 Md. 172, 634 A.2d 46 (1993)(\u201cProof of scienter is critical to a successful deceit action\u201d). As with the other elements of fraud, scienter must be proven by \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>See Wrexham, </em>350 Md. at 704, 715 A.2d 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Because there was no discussion between the parties that \u201cbest efforts\u201d required First Union to send 3S more than 50% of its business, and because one reasonable reading of the contract is that no specific transaction volume, other than the Minimum Volume, was guaranteed, the jury could not reasonably infer this fraudulent intent simply from Clewis\u2019 saying that he never intended to refer 3S more than 50%. So we must examine whether there is other evidence of fraudulent intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Motive For Fraud</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">First, we look at 3S\u2019s evidence regarding First Union\u2019s possible motives for getting 3S to enter the SA, even though First Union had no intent to perform its obligations under that agreement. 3S quotes the trial court\u2019s Memorandum accompanying its order denying a new trial and JNOV.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC\">\u201c \u2018[First Union] wanted and needed [3S] to centralize and automate its home equity loan settlement services;\u2019that in order to induce [3S] to assist [First Union] in [doing so] ... [First Union] represented to [3S] that [3S] would be its long term partner for all of the transactions that [First Union] could send to [8S] and that [3S] could handle, with a written contract being the first step in the relationship ...; \u2018that [First Union\u2019s] ... motivation in its scheme was to own its own settlement services companyf.]\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">3S contends that there is evidence that this \u201cscheme\u201d was in place because a First Union affiliate had discussions in 1993-1994 about forming its own settlement services company, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>because First Union thereafter continued to track regulatory developments regarding the legality of such a venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">A possible motive for committing a fraud, however, does not prove fraudulent intent. <em>Cf Travel Comm., Inc. v. Pan Am. Airways, Inc., </em>91 Md.App. 123, 178-79, 603 A.2d 1301, <em>cert. denied, </em>327 Md. 525, 610 A.2d 797 (1992)(general plan to change corporate direction in manner potentially inconsistent with contractual commitment did not suffice to show fraudulent intent not to abide by contract at time of execution). In <em>Miller v. Fairchild Indus., </em>we held that a speech by the chief executive of an aircraft manufacturing company to plant employees indicating that the company was not planning to close the plant, and they could continue to make major purchases without fear of job loss, was not fraud, absent proof that the executive knew, at the time of the speech, that the plant was going to lose its major contract with Boeing. <em>See Miller, </em>97 Md.App. at 343-45, 629 A.2d 1293. We held that no fraud was shown, even though, two months before the speech, the executive knew that the Boeing contract was in jeopardy, and had made a speech to a local Chamber of Commerce that the future of the plant was uncertain. <em>See id. </em>We see the evidence of First Union\u2019s discussions of acquiring a settlement services company in 1993-1994, three to four years before it contracted with 3S, as no more incriminating than the evidence that Fairchild knew a plant closing was likely.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">3S Does Not Claim Misappropriation Of Its Trade Secrets</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">It is crucial to remember, in this context, that, as 3S acknowledged in its brief and several times at trial, its claim against First Union was not a claim for misappropriation of trade secrets. The strategic decision to disclaim any claim for misappropriation of trade secrets apparently was made by 3S to avoid First Union\u2019s contention that its claim for fraud was pre-empted by the Maryland Uniform Trade Secrets Act.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Other Evidence Of Fraudulent Intent Not To Perform The Best Efforts Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">3S also urges that we can find fraudulent intent in First Union\u2019s immediate breach of the contract, without a change in circumstances, together with its subsequent conduct. The Court of Appeals has educated us on the limits on such an exercise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">A fraudulent pre-existing intent not to perform a promise made cannot be inferred from the failure to perform the promise alone. But, it may be considered with the subsequent conduct of the promisor and the other circumstances surrounding the transaction in sustaining such an inference. And it has been stated that under certain conditions, a failure or refusal to perform is strong evidence of an intent not to perform the promise at the time it was made, as where only a short period of time elapses between the making of the promise and the failure or refusal to perform it, and there is no change in the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-6\"><em>Tufts v. Poore, </em>219 Md. 1, 10, 147 A.2d 717 (1959) (citations omitted). We conclude that this case does not fall within the <em>Tufts </em>criteria for proving fraud from an immediate breach without a change in circumstances, for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>First, the bank did undertake at least partial performance under the SA through June 2000, a two and a half year period. It did not breach the Minimum Volume requirements until October 1999, nearly two years after signing the SA. Even Steele was happy with the volume of business that he got from First Union between the time the SA was executed in November 1997 and mid-1999. In May 1999, 3S announced by letter that it was dropping its prices, reserving the right to go back to higher prices \u201cshould we see a significant drop in volume.\u201d The 1999 volume preceding this letter averaged 3,464 per month, and the volume remained above 2,000 transactions per month until August 1999. Steele also expressed in a presentation to First Union in March of 2000 that their relationship had been \u201c[tjremendous ... until consolidation in [New Jersey],\u201d which took place in 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">From January 1998 through July 1999, First Union referred 3S 55,785 transactions, constituting an average of 2,936 transactions per month. Although, as we explain in section II, we think the jury could determine that these 55,785 transactions were not sufficient for full contractual performance, this was a substantial amount of business, approximately three times the Minimum Volume of 1,000 transactions per month, and more volume in most months than 3S had been receiving prior to the SA. Such meaningful partial performance, under these circumstances, precludes the jury from drawing an inference of fraudulent intent merely from the breach itself. <em>See Sass v. Andrew, </em>152 Md.App. 406, 433-43, 832 A.2d 247 (2003)(fraud verdict against builder who promised to build house but did not finish reversed because builder partially performed).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Secondly, there was a significant change in circumstances after the signing of the SA and before the drop off in referrals. The bank originally thought that there were regulatory barriers to owning its own settlement company. Seven months after the SA was signed, however, the OCC issued an authorization for a competing bank to joint venture with a settlement services company. This regulatory action cleared the way for First Union to move toward forming or purchasing a settlement services company. Learning that it could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>own a settlement services company itself may well have changed First Union\u2019s intentions with regard to buying these services from 3S. Thus, this case does not fit within <em>Tuft\u2019s </em>criteria for proving fraud largely by proving immediate breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">Moreover, in 1999, First Union restructured the organization of its Consumer Lending Division, consolidating its management in Brunswick, New Jersey, rather than Charlotte, North Carolina. This was also a change in circumstance. The bank learned, after signing the SA, that other vendors in the New Jersey area were providing similar services at substantially cheaper prices, approximately $30 less per transaction. The undisputed evidence shows that Steele was slow to adjust his prices after Buzzi pointed out the differential, and initially sought to attach greater volume requirements to any adjustment. Although there is some evidence that 3S ultimately may have approached its competitors\u2019 prices, its recalcitrance in doing so also can be viewed as a change in circumstances \u2014 it could be a signal that a future \u201cpartnership\u201d might prove difficult.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Efforts To Terminate</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Nor do the tactics used by First Union after execution of the SA suffice to meet 3S\u2019s burden to show precontract fraudulent intent. 3S argues that we should look at the bank\u2019s efforts to force termination of the SA, by \u201cinvent[ing] phony complaints about pricing,\u201d creating a \u201cpretextual\u201d billing dispute, and giving notice of termination before it was allowed to do so under the SA. These all happened in or after March 1999, more than a year into the term of the SA. The notice of termination is certainly evidence of an intent to ignore the contract terms, and to bully 3S into an early termination. The handling of the billing dispute may even reflect an effort to obscure the bank\u2019s intentional breach of the SA. In order to establish pre-contractual fraudulent intent by clear and convincing evidence, however, Maryland requires more than simply an intentional breach of contract. None of the cases relied upon by 3S proved fraudulent intent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>evidence as thin as this one, consisting entirely of post-contractual actions deliberately breaching the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">We cannot rest fraud in the inducement of a November 1997 contract on a billing dispute that surfaced in October 1998, and related to invoices dating from as early as 1994-1995, before the SA was executed.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The invoices in question totaled $375,000.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Steele said that the invoices had been sent to First Union in the normal course of business, but that he again gave complete copies of all invoices in 1998 \u201cto make sure there was no confusion on what was open and outstanding, to give them the information they needed to research and pay them[.]\u201d First Union officials denied having received them, and asserted that it was difficult, and would take time, to verify transactions that were so old. Even if the jury believed that the bills were sent timely, we do not see how First Union\u2019s failing to pay bills incurred largely before execution of the SA showed an intent not to send new business, as required by the SA. This evidence is not sufficient to support fraudulent intent existing prior to the SA</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">1993-1994 Discussions About A Settlement Services Company</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">Nor are discussions in 1993 or 1994 of future plans to acquire an interest in a settlement services company enough to show a fraudulent intent not to perform what Steele admitted was only a three year commitment. <em>Cf. Stop-N-Go of Madison, Inc. v. Uno-Ven Co., </em>184 F.3d 672, 678 (7th Cir.l999)(oil refining company\u2019s interest in and efforts to sell its rights to obtain crude oil, prior to entering a contract to supply gasoline to plaintiff, and to aggressively market its brand of gasoline, did not show fraudulent intent not to perform contract). This is especially so when one considers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>that Steele knew that First Union was interested in an eventual purchase, because one of its officers told Steele that it might be interested in purchasing 3S.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">Clewis Testimony About Renewal Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">3S claims that it proved fraud through Clewis\u2019s testimony about the renewal clause of the contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">Clewis testified that he never intended to extend the Service Agreement beyond two years, despite the clear language providing that it would be automatically renewable. Indeed, Clewis himself was forced to admit that the contract provided that it would run for three years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Clewis was artful, but upon close examination, cannot provide the foundation for fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">The colloquy went as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-9\">Q: [At your deposition] you were asked whether or not you had an intent that there be renewals in the contract and do you recall your answer, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-10\">A: Sir, my answer was yes, with the assumption that Mr. Steele would install the EDI and we would have ongoing relations and it would be no need for a contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-11\">Q: Sir, was there an intent on your part that there be renewals in the contract, yes or no?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-12\">A: Not a written contract, no, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-13\">Q: So you never intended that there be a renewal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-14\">A: I saw no need to do a renewal, if we get\u2014 fulfilled our agreement, there would be no need to do a written contract ever again....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-15\">Q: How did this section 4.2, sir, renewal, get into this agreement if it was your intent that there be no renewals of this contract, how did it get in there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-16\">A: I\u2019ll tell you. Every year Mr. Steele and I would sit down and renegotiate pricing. We\u2019re not going to pay the same price, this is a competitive business, prices are coming down, we knew it in the marketplace, the terms, the turn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>around times were spelled out. EDI was spelled out.... I wasn\u2019t signing anything we had to renew year after year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">Q: Sir, it was in the agreement, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">A: It says renewable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">A short time later, 3S counsel asked Clewis:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">Q: Can Mr. Steele rely, when this agreement where it says he\u2019s going to get a one year notice of cancellation at some point, not before May 1st, 2000, is that what it says, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1X\">A: Mr. Steele did not rely on anything beyond two years which was spelled out in that contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-9\">Q: Does this contract say, sir, you don\u2019t have to be a lawyer to read this, does this contract say that you cannot deliver a notice of termination before May 1st, 2000?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-10\">A: It does say that, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-11\">Q: And does it also say that he would get a one year notice of cancellation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-12\">A: It does say that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-13\">Q: So you know enough to tell us that this contract says that at a very minimum it\u2019s going to run until May 1sl 2001, that\u2019s what this says?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-14\">A: That is what the contract says, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-15\">This dialogue does not support a claim for fraud for two reasons. First, making a contract \u201cautomatically renewable,\u201d is not a promise to renew. It means that the parties may renew it \u2014 that the contract is capable of being renewed, and without notice to the contrary, it will be renewed. Second, whether Clewis intended to renew the term of the SA is a different question from whether the notice of termination clause effectively added a third year to the stated two-year term. Clewis stated that he did not intend to renew the written contract, although he expected the relationship would be ongoing. Although he said that Steele did not rely on more than two years, he did not say that he never intended to abide by its one-year, post-May 2000 notice of termination requirement. We simply cannot view this colloquy as being evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>of a pre-existing intent not to abide by the notice of termination provision of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">January 29, 1997 Letter</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">3S makes much of Steele\u2019s January 29, 1997 letter to Thompson, which followed a meeting regarding 3S\u2019s proposals for centralization and automation of First Union\u2019s branches. Steele\u2019s letter sought confirmation that it had been agreed that 3S would be the bank\u2019s \u201cpreferred provider of appraisal, title and settlement seivices\u201d in certain limited categories. 3S argues that this showed that \u201cClewis and Thompson had no intention of honoring their obligations to 3S.\u201d We do not see how Thompson\u2019s failure to respond to the letter, or his note to Clewis that \u201cwe didn\u2019t make any promises but would entertain their proposals,\u201d is evidence of fraudulent intent not to perform First Union\u2019s obligations under the SA.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">It is intelligent business practice for a corporate employee to be careful to appreciate the difference between discussing proposals and actually making a contractual commitment. Thompson\u2019s failure to write Steele back might be evidence of fraud if 3S were suing for fraudulently inducing it to provide services without a written contract. But the fact that 3S later actually entered into the SA reflects not dishonesty, but a willingness to commit to its obligations in writing and better define the parties\u2019 relationship.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">3S\u2019s Cases On Fraudulent Intent</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">The cases cited by 3S on inferring fraudulent intent do not persuade us otherwise. In <em>Tufts v. Poore, </em>219 Md. 1, 147 A.2d 717 (1959), a wealthy woman with a lovely home on the Potomac, called \u201cTulip Hill,\u201d wrote a 1948 will in which she left a life estate in Tulip Hill, and one half of her other assets, to her daughter, with the remainder interest to pass to her son and his descendants. Although the testatrix disliked her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>daughter\u2019s husband, at her daughter\u2019s request, on July 3, 1955, the testatrix executed a codicil to that will, simultaneously with the daughter executing a will of her own. The mother\u2019s codicil left Tulip Hill outright to her daughter in fee simple. She also left substantial other assets to her daughter outright, with the \u201crequest that she divide them equally among the testatrix\u2019 grandchildren upon her death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7, 147 A.2d 717. At this time, the testatrix\u2019s son was ill with leukemia. The daughter\u2019s will, executed at the same time, designated her brother as a beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">After the two documents were signed, the testatrix requested her son-in-law to put them on her desk. There was evidence that it was the testatrix\u2019s and her daughter\u2019s intent that the two testamentary documents would go into the testatrix\u2019s safety deposit box. Three days after the two documents were signed, the testatrix and her daughter and son-in-law departed for a trip to Europe, returning on August 20, 1955. A few days after the return from Europe, the daughter placed her mother\u2019s codicil in her mother\u2019s lock box at the bank, and put her own will in a strong box in her study.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The testatrix\u2019s son died less than two months later, on October 14. Sometime between then and the testatrix\u2019s death in February 1956, the daughter destroyed her will, without advising her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">The Court of Appeals concluded that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to infer that the daughter had never intended to maintain her will in effect, thereby depriving the descendants of her brother from inheriting those assets left to her by her mother. <em>See id. </em>at 12, 147 A.2d 717. The Court relied on the principle stated above, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-8\">under certain conditions, a failure or refusal to perform is strong evidence of an intent not to perform the promise at the time it was made, as where only a short period of time elapses between the making of the promise and the failure or refusal to perform it, and there is no change in the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 10, 147 A.2d 717. Recognizing that fraud \u201cis generally [proven] by circumstances only, by inductions of particulars, some of them often apparently trivial,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 12, 147 A.2d 717 the Court of Appeals afforded guidance on how a court should value facts relating to fraudulent intent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-4\">In valuing facts relating to the question of a present intention not to perform a promise made, courts have frequently stressed the importance and significance of the situation of the parties, the relations existing between them, the activity of the promisor in procuring the instrument, and the failure of the promisor to perform.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 10-11, 147 A.2d 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">We see marked differences between <em>Tufts </em>and this case. There, the jury could have inferred that the daughter never intended to maintain her will because, as soon as she returned from Europe, she failed to put it in her mother\u2019s lock box as the parties intended. Moreover, within six months at the outside,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the daughter changed her will, doing exactly what she promised her mother she would not do. In contrast, here the bank did not breach the Minimum Volume for almost two years, and any early breach that the jury found must have related to the \u201cbest efforts\u201d clause, with its imprecise obligations for performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The circumstances of the making of the <em>Tufts </em>agreement were different as well. In <em>Tufts, </em>the daughter was the sole instigator of the change in the mother\u2019s will, which benefitted only her and her heirs, rather than her mother. Here, we have a negotiated agreement, strongly pursued by 8S, which benefitted both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\"><em>Greenfield v. Heckenbach, </em>144 Md.App. 108, 797 A.2d 63, <em>cert. denied, </em>370 Md. 269, 805 A.2d 266 (2002), also cited by 3S, was an appeal from a summary judgment in favor of the defendants. The decision turned on whether an integration clause in a contract for sale of a waterfront property preclud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>ed, under the parol evidence rule, introduction of representations made by the seller of a house as to his intent to obstruct the view by building on his adjacent lot. The defendants did not argue, and we did not address, the sufficiency of the evidence to show fraudulent intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\"><em>Bocchini v. Gorn Mgmt. Co., </em>69 Md.App. 1, 22, 515 A.2d 1179 (1986), is not helpful to 3S because there we held there that the allegations of fraud in the complaint were insufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\"><em>Henderson v. Md. Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>278 Md. 514, 366 A.2d 1 (1976), was not a fraud case. The bank admitted liability for conversion when a bank employee ordered repossession of the plaintiffs car for non-payment, when in fact all payments had been timely. The Court of Appeals held that there was sufficient evidence to show actual malice when the employee summarily ordered repossession, without checking with other bank employees, after an angry telephone conversation in which the plaintiff explained the previous errors the bank had made in thinking his account was delinquent because they had another customer by the same name. <em>See id. </em>at 523, 366 A.2d 1. The employee\u2019s immediate summary repossession following an angry phone call, without checking the facts, is compelling evidence of malice. Here, we have no such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">In <em>Gross v. Sussex, Inc., </em>332 Md. 247, 630 A.2d 1156 (1993), also relied on by 3S, the Court of Appeals reversed summary judgment in favor of a contractor on a claim for fraudulent inducement because there was evidence that the contractor, prior to signing a contract for construction of a home, falsely told the plaintiffs that permits were in place, so that he could immediately start work on construction. <em>See id. </em>at 276, 630 A.2d 1156. The Court found sufficient evidence of fraudulent intent because the plaintiffs were able to show that, at the time he made the statement, there was no subdivision approval, and hence no building permits. <em>See id. </em>There is no comparable factual misrepresentation demonstrated in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>3S asserts that fraudulent intent can be inferred from circumstantial evidence, citing <em>State v. Raines, </em>326 Md. 582, 591, 606 A.2d 265, <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 945, 113 S.Ct. 390, 121 L.Ed.2d 299 (1992), and <em>Geisey v. Holberg, </em>185 Md. 642, 45 A.2d 735 (1946).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This is certainly true, and, as we see above, the <em>Tufts </em>case permitted an inference of fraudulent intent from circumstantial evidence. But neither <em>Raines </em>nor <em>Geisey </em>are analogous to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">In <em>Raines, </em>the issue was whether a trier of fact could infer defendant\u2019s specific intent to kill from evidence that he shot at the driver\u2019s window of a tractor-trailer being driven down the highway. The Court held that \u201cRaines\u2019 actions in directing the gun at the window, and therefore at the driver\u2019s head on the other side of the window, permitted in inference that Raines shot the gun with the intent to kill.\u201d <em>Raines, </em>326 Md. at 592-93, 606 A.2d 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\"><em>Geisey </em>involved a scheme by an estranged husband and his good friend and business associate to deprive his wife of her interest in real property through a foreclosure proceeding. The specific facts in <em>Geisey </em>are complex, and do not warrant detailed recitation here. Suffice it to say, we simply do not find the evidence of post-contract breach by First Union analogous to those facts. To be sure, the Court of Appeals in <em>Geisey </em>observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">Fraud cannot be easily proved by direct evidence because of the secrecy with which it generally is surrounded, but a court of equity cannot close its eyes to a series of circumstances, all pointing one way, indicating one purpose in view.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ao1\"><em>Geisey, </em>185 Md. at 653-54, 45 A.2d 735. We are not requiring that 8S provide direct evidence, but only that the post-contract circumstantial evidence sufficiently relate back to circumstances that existed before execution of the SA.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>The evidence that First Union had some interest in a future acquisition of a settlement services company in 1993-1994 is not sufficient. Such an interest is not necessarily inconsistent with a three year commitment to buy those settlement services from 3S, particularly when the bank accepted then prevailing views that existing regulations made such a purchase illegal. First Union could have waited three years and not been in breach of its promise. This is unlike the situation in <em>Tufts, </em>where the daughter\u2019s desire to leave assets to her husband was diametrically at odds with her promise to leave them to her brother\u2019s descendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Maryland differentiates between intentional breach and fraud with good reason. Contracts are often breached when companies change their business direction because of competitive market forces. Business persons entering contracts know and expect this. Many times, because the parties anticipate potential breach, contracts provide for liquidated damages and/or attorney\u2019s fees if breach occurs. The law provides a remedy for breach. Businesses will be hesitant to enter contracts at all if a breach, without evidence of pre-existing fraudulent intent, can expose them to punitive damage awards.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">Representations Collateral To The SA</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">3S argues that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">[T]he record is clear that [First Union] made fraudulent representations both in and collateral to the [SA], and that 3S relied on such representations in executing that Agreement and in preparing to service an increased commitment to [First Union] on a long-term basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">3S points specifically to the following verbal representations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-10\">(1) In his discussions and plans with Steele in 1995-1997, Dibble told Steele that the parties would have a \u201clong-term mutually beneficial relationship.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-11\">(2) Crisp and Clewis said \u201cas we grow, you\u2019ll grow.\u201d Crisp also asked whether 3S \u201ccould handle 12,000 transactions on a monthly basis\u201d and \u201cleft it to Parkes [Dibble] to work out the rest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>(3) Prior to June 1996, Dibble said that the SA was only \u201cthe first step [in the parties\u2019] long road partnership.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-4\">(4) Dibble negotiated a \u201cfive year contract with like renewals,\u201d meaning that the parties would have a ten-year relationship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">(5) After he took over from Dibble, Clewis said \u201cdon\u2019t worry, everything\u2019s fine, nothing\u2019s changed[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">(6) The January 29, 1997 letter from Steele to Thompson, expressed Steele\u2019s understanding that 3S was to be the bank\u2019s \u201cpreferred provider of appraisal, title and settlement service[s];\u201d First Union did not respond.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">(7) Clewis told Steele that the term of the SA was two years, and that \u201c[i]t would automatically be renewed each and every year thereafter, which was consistent of [sic] the long-term relationship, partnership that we expected and it would continue going unless I screwed up.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">As we explain below, we conclude that the representations identified as numbers (1), (2), (3), (5), and (6) are overly general statements of expectation that are not sufficiently definite in terms for a sophisticated business person to reasonably rely on. The representations identified as numbers (4) and (7) were sufficiently definite, but could not reasonably be relied on by a sophisticated business entity entering a negotiated contract because they were contradicted by the explicit terms of the SA. Although in certain instances, fraud can be premised on representations that are inconsistent with a written agreement, we do not agree that the circumstances of this case allow such recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Overly Vague Statements Of Expectation</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">The Court of Appeals has differentiated between general expectations and actionable representations for over a hundred years. In <em>Robertson v. Parks, </em>76 Md. 118, 132, 24 A. 411 (1892), the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-11\">[Representations to be material, must have been in respect of ascertainable facts, as distinguished from mere matters of opinion or speculation. A representation which merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>amounts to a statement of opinion, judgment, probability or expectation, or is vague and indefinite in its nature and terms, or is merely a loose, conjectural, or exaggerated statement, goes for naught, though it may not be true; for a party is not justified in placing reliance on such statement or representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Relying on <em>Robertson, </em>the Court, seventy years later, reaffirmed this limitation on claims of fraud:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">Ordinarily, however, the representation must be definite, and mere vague, general, or indefinite statements are insufficient, because they should, as a general rule, put the hearer upon inquiry, and there is no right to rely upon such statements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-7\"><em>Fowler v. Benton, </em>229 Md. 571, 579, 185 A.2d 344 (1962), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Fowler v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>375 U.S. 845, 84 S.Ct. 98, 11 L.Ed.2d 72 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Comment a to <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>(1977), section 530 excludes from actionable fraud those statements in a business transaction that are merely \u201cpuffing\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-9\">The state of a man\u2019s mind is as much a fact as the state of his digestion. A false representation of the actor\u2019s own intention to do or not to do a particular thing is actionable if the statement is reasonably to be interpreted as expressing a firm intention and not merely as one of those \u201cpuffing\u201d statements which are so frequent and so little regarded in negotiations for a business transaction as to make it unjustifiable for the recipient to rely upon them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">We find instructive the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Milkton v. French, </em>159 Md. 126, 150 A. 28 (1930). There the plaintiff purchased from the defendants a lot, which was improved with a bungalow. The plaintiff was concerned about the basement and the roof \u201cbecause [he had heard] so many complaints here in Baltimore about the damp cellars and leaking roofs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129, 150 A. 28. He requested that the defendants insert a covenant in the documents of sale assuring that \u201cthe construction [of the bungalow] is right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130, 150 A. 28. When the seller was called to inquire if he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>wiling to include this covenant, he said that he \u201crefused to give any assurance of heating the house to 70 degrees,\u201d but the purchaser \u201cwas perfectly safe on the concrete, roof and everything else of the construction because [he] had built it himself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court held that the seller\u2019s statement about the condition of the house was mere puffing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\">In the first place, the use of the term \u201cperfectly safe\u201d in connection with every detail of construction was so extravagant in scope and measure, and so indefinite and elusive in meaning, that the statement would fall within the category of a puff instead of a representation, and the plaintiff, who was an architect of experience, could not have been misled or influenced.... It is difficult to find these words, when reasonably considered, as capable of being understood by a man of average intelligence as a clear and definite representation of any particular fact. The language does not condescend to detail. The words used are so vague and general as to be incapable of particular application. They fail, therefore, to amount to a misrepresentation, and are but the indefinite generalities of exaggeration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 132-33, 24 A. 411 (citations omitted and emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">In a more recent case, this Court in <em>McGraw v.

We think they fall into the category of being \u201cso vague and general as to be incapable of particular application.\u201d <em>Milkton, </em>159 Md. at 133, 150 A. 28. When dealing with transactions involving potentially millions of dollars, a sophisticated business entity cannot reasonably rely on such vague and general statements, particularly when the parties contemplate a written agreement that will define their relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Similarly, in this context, the statement that the SA is \u201conly the first step to a long road partnership\u201d can only be seen as a statement of general expectation. The parties discussed various and complex ways of working together. There were simply too many potential ways for these two organizations to structure a \u201clong road partnership\u201d for those words to constitute a meaningful representation. When the parties were negotiating the terms of a concrete written agreement, statements about what further complex agreements they might enter down the road, without any concrete terms, cannot reasonably be relied on as anything more than statements of expectation.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Nor are statements that 3S would be the \u201cpreferred provider\u201d of certain services sufficiently concrete to warrant reliance. <em>See, e.g., Travel Comm., Inc. v.

There, Giant\u2019s represen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>tations about its commitment to buy ice from Ice King included very specific terms: \u201cthe type, price, quality, and quantity of ice;\u201d \u201cthe delivery terms;\u201d \u201cthe location of Ice King\u2019s plant at a site most suitable to Giant;\u201d \u201cthe size of the storage facility needed to satisfy Giant\u2019s demand;\u201d \u201carrangements for inspection of Ice King\u2019s plant by Giant representatives;\u201d and \u201cthe demand by Giant that Ice King supply further samples of ice and a certificate of insurance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191, 536 A.2d 1182. This level of detail was not discussed by 3S and First Union except in connection with negotiating the SA itself. In <em>Giant Food,, </em>the parties never discussed a written contract, and certainly never entered one with a specific termination clause. Rather, the principal of Ice King told Giant that he had \u201cinvest[ed] everything he owned\u201d based on his reliance on Giant\u2019s buying ice from him and Giant authorized him to state on his loan application that Giant was going to buy ice from him. <em>See id. </em>at 192-93, 536 A.2d 1182. In contrast, here, Steele testified that he needed the written SA, with its guarantee of volume, in order to obtain his financing. Thus, the parties contemplated that their agreement would not be final until a written agreement containing specific terms was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">3S cites the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Edell &amp; Assocs. v. Law Offices of Peter G. Angelos, </em>264 F.3d 424 (4th Cir.2001), as support for the proposition that these pre-contract representations were sufficiently definite to be actionable. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Edell alleged that the Law Offices of Peter G. Angelos (\u201cAngelos Firm\u201d) breached a contract to pay Edell, an attorney with expertise in mass tort tobacco litigation, a fair share of any contingency fee recovered, in addition to his hourly fee, in return for his work with the Angelos Firm in litigation brought by the State of Maryland against the tobacco industry. Edell also alleged false representations of the Angelos\u2019 Firm\u2019s intent to pay the contingency award. Both the contract and fraud claims were based on statements such as: Angelos would \u201cdeal with him fairly!;]\u201d Edell would be \u201cgenerously compensated!;]\u201d Edell would receive \u201cadditional compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>sation\u201d above hourly rates; they were \u201cpartners in the tobacco litigation[;]\u201d they would experience a \u201crewarding partnership[;]\u201d there would be a \u201cone for all team approach!;]\u201d and \u201cwhen the litigation was resolved, Peter will do the right thing.\u201d The Fourth Circuit vacated the summary judgment entered by the federal district court for Maryland in favor of the Angelos Firm on both the contract and fraud counts. <em>See id. </em>at 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Regarding the contract claim, the court relied heavily on Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct (MLRPC) 1.5(e)(2), which provides with respect to contingency fees, that \u201c[a] division of fee between lawyers who are not in the same firm may be made only if: (1) the division is in proportion to the services performed by each lawyer or, by written agreement with the client, each lawyer assumes joint responsibility for the representation.\u201d The court reasoned that, although the parties never agreed on a specific percentage of the contingency fee, the contract to share fairly the contingency fee was so overly vague as to be enforceable because the MLRPC 1.5(e)(2) \u201cin proportion\u201d standard was sufficiently definite to allow the fact finder to resolve any dispute as to the actual proportion. <em>See id. </em>at 443. With this rule in the place, the court reasoned, \u201cthe missing term sought to be supplied is implied by law rather than the court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The Fourth Circuit was brief in its analysis of Edell\u2019s fraudulent inducement claim, reasoning that the summary judgment record</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">reveals a masterful plan by the Angelos Firm to fraudulently benefit from Edell\u2019s undisputed reputation and experience as a tobacco litigation expert by luring him and his law firm into falsely believing the Angelos Firm would share fairly ... any contingency fee it might receive at the conclusion of the Maryland AG Action if they continued their substantial participation in the case at the expense of working on other fee-generating cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">We interpret the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision on the fraud claim in light of its analysis of the contract claim. Just as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>found that the MLRPC 1.5 requirement that fees between separate law firms be divided in proportion to the work performed sufficient to imply a missing contractual term, we think it considered that the representations that a fair contingency fee would be paid were also sufficiently specific to form the basis for fraud because MLRPC 1.5 gave them a concrete meaning. Because there is no profit-sharing standard for bank joint ventures under Maryland law, no such concrete meaning can be attached to the promises of a \u201clong term mutually beneficial relationship\u201d and a \u201clong road partnership\u201d that 3S relies on here. <em>Edell </em>is also distinguishable because the disputed issue involved the fee in a single, albeit large, lawsuit, rather than the general and broad concepts of \u201crelationship\u201d and \u201cpartnership\u201d on which 3S relies. Further, the parties in <em>Edell </em>did not contemplate, as they did here, that their agreement would not be final until a written contract containing specific terms was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Representations Contradicted By The Terms Of The SA</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Dibble\u2019s statements that he made an agreement for two five-year terms, or a \u201cten-year agreement\u201d with Steele, is certainly more specific than the general statements discussed above. This term, however, was specifically negotiated out of the SA, and a three-year contract (a two-year term, with an additional year\u2019s notice of termination which could not be given until the end of two years) was substituted. 3S cannot reasonably rely on an agreement or representation that was specifically negotiated out of the parties\u2019 contract. <em>See, e.g., Cooper v.

In one deal, Mellon loaned money to First Union Equity, and in the other First Union Equity loaned money to Mellon. Under the loan agreements, Mellon\u2019s loan to First Union Equity allowed prepayment without penalty by the borrower, but First Union Equity\u2019s loan to Mellon did not. When First Union Equity prepaid its loan, Mellon alleged an oral side agreement by which First Union Equity promised that, if it pre-paid its loan, it would otherwise protect Mellon against the market risk of a decline in interest rates. The Third Circuit rejected Mellon\u2019s claim of fraud, reasoning that Mellon could not have reasonably relied on First Union Equity\u2019s oral promises not to prepay without protecting Mellon against a decline in interest rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The agreements in this case are between sophisticated businessmen. Mellon Bank is a major banking institution. After consulting with counsel at all stages of the transaction and closing on detailed written documents, it is not reasonable for Mellon to rely on oral promises that directly contradict the written agreements between the parties.... When Mellon formally agreed to First Union [Equity\u2019s] terms when it executed the agreement, it should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>known it was left to First Union [Equity\u2019s] good offices, not the law, to insulate it from market risk if First Union [Equity] prepaid. Under the circumstances present here, we are unable to say Mellon could justifiably rely on a gentlemen\u2019s agreement not to do what the formal agreement gave one party, but not the other, the right to do.</p>\n<p id=\"ad-dedup-0\"><em>Id. </em>at 1412 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Our holding in <em>Parker v.

First, we are not basing our decision on the parol evidence rule. Unlike <em>Parker, </em>which was an appeal from the dismissal of a complaint, we are evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence to show fraud. More importantly, we noted in <em>Parker </em>that, although the buyers were professional people, \u201cthey had little or no experience in real estate transactions; had never built a custom home; [and] were relying on Columbia\u2019s counsel, advice and representations regarding all aspects of the project that related to financing[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362, 604 A.2d 521. We distinguished a transaction between two businesses, expressing the view that \u201c[a] commercial borrower\u2019s reliance on these sorts of representations ... might well be unreasonable as a matter of law\u201d. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Clewis\u2019s statement to Steele that the term of the SA was two years, and that it would be \u201crenewed each and every year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>thereafter, which was consistent of [sic] the long-term relationship, partnership that we expected and it would continue going unless I screwed up,\u201d is also contradicted by the clear termination provisions of the SA. Section 4.8 unequivocally says that \u201cFirst Union may terminate this Agreement without cause after May 1, 2000[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">We observe, moreover, that Steele did not testify that Clewis promised him that First Union would not exercise its right of termination. To the contrary, Steele testified that he knew the agreement might only last for three years:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">Q: Mr. Steele, what if anything did Mr. Clewis say to you about the term of this agreement, the final agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACR\">A: The term, it was two years.

First Union had the opportunity to terminate the agreement but they had to give me one year\u2019s notice of cancellation, at some point after, I think it was May 1st, 2000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">Given the clear language of the SA, and Steele\u2019s understanding about its limited term, we cannot affirm a finding of fraud predicated on a promise of a longer term.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">Conclusion Regarding Fraud</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">In sum, we hold that there was insufficient evidence to support 3S\u2019s claim for fraud, based either on representations in the SA, or representations made prior to its execution. Accordingly, the trial court erred in denying First Union\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. We reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling, and accordingly reverse the judgment in the amount of $39,476,342 based on fraud. We also reverse the judgment for $200,000,000 in punitive damages because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>punitive damages are only allowable when there is a valid award of compensatory damages based on a tort. <em>See Wrex-ham, </em>350 Md. at 703 n. 2, 715 A.2d 188.

NationsBank, N.A., </em>365 Md. 166, 178, 776 A.2d 645 (2001). This means that the clear and unambiguous language of a written agreement controls, even when the language is not consistent with the parties\u2019 actual intent at the time of the creation of the contract. <em>See Auction &amp; Estate Representatives, Inc. v. Ashton, </em>354 Md. 333, 340, 731 A.2d 441 (1999). Contractual language is considered ambiguous \u201cif, when read by a reasonably prudent person, it is susceptible of more than one meaning.\u201d <em>Calomiris v. Woods, </em>353 Md. 425, 436, 727 A.2d 358 (1999). The determination of whether contract language is ambiguous is a question of law for the court. <em>See Ashton, </em>354 Md. at 341, 731 A.2d 441. When the language is ambiguous, the trier of fact, in this case the jury, must determine \u201cwhat a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought it meant.\u201d <em>Fultz v. Shaffer, </em>111 Md.App. 278, 299, 681 A.2d 568 (1996). In such case, the parties \u201cwill not be allowed to place their own interpretation on what it means or was intended to mean[.]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">First Union argues that the best efforts clause of the SA does not give rise to a valid claim for breach of contract. First Union offers three grounds in support of this conclusion. First, it claims the best efforts clause was too vague to be enforceable, and suffered from an absence of mutual assent. Second, it urges that there was no evidence in the record, either from the SA or extrinsic evidence, to support 3S\u2019s contention that a reasonable person entering the SA, in First <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Union\u2019s position, can be said to have \u201cagreed to obligate itself to use 3S on a virtually exclusive basis.\u201d Third, it insists that \u201c[t]he record demonstrates that Steele himself did not believe that the best efforts clause imposed any binding obligation on [First Union].\u201d We find these contentions unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Best Efforts Not Too Vague To Be Enforceable And Mutual Assent Shown</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">We said in section I that there could be no inference of fraud from First Union\u2019s merely signing the SA, with its best efforts clause, without intending to give 3S more than 50% of its business. We reached this conclusion because we do not consider the language of the SA sufficiently clear to draw an inference that Clewis, on behalf of First Union, necessarily knew that he was committing to send 3S more than 50% of its volume because of the ambiguous definition of \u201cServices,\u201d the non-exclusivity clause, and the 130% Clause. We concluded that the evidence was sufficient to show only that Clewis believed that, in agreeing to the best efforts clause, First Union was obligated to make diligent efforts to send a substantial amount of business to 3S, without defining that level of diligence by specific volume.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">The lack of specificity in the best efforts clause does not mean, however, that the clause was meaningless. The term \u201cbest efforts,\u201d while not clearly defining a specific percentage or amount of business, \u201cis a standard that has diligence as its essence[.]\u201d <em>See E. Allan Farnsworth, On Trying to Keep One\u2019s Promises: The Duty of Best Efforts in Contract, </em>46 Pitt. L.Rev. 1, 8 (1984). As we indicated, it is a term that \u201ctakes its meaning from the circumstances.\u201d <em>Bloor v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., </em>454 F.Supp. 258, 266 (S.D.N.Y.1978), aff<em>'d, </em>601 F.2d 609 (1979). In determining whether the performance by 3S met the \u201cbest efforts\u201d standard in this context, we think the jury was entitled to consider such things as, the overall volume of First Union, the level and promptness of service provided by 3S, 3S\u2019s ability to handle an increasing amount of volume as time went on, the reasonable business needs of a large regional bank to place its business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>with multiple vendors, the risks First Union took in sending the majority of transactions to one vendor, what business people mean when they promise to make \u201cbest efforts,\u201d and the standard in the industry regarding similar contracts between banks and their settlement service vendors. The performance required of the parties by a best efforts clause may be explicit in the contract or implied from the circumstances. <em>See NCNB Nat\u2019l Bank of N.C. v. Bridgewater Steam Power Co., </em>740 F.Supp. 1140, 1152 (W.D.N.C.1990). A party committed to using best efforts may still give reasonable consideration to its own interests. <em>See id. </em>The jury also was able to consider the reasonable expectations of Steele in light of the pattern of his discussions and negotiations with Dibble and Clewis. We do not consider it critical to the formation of the contract that the parties did not specifically discuss what \u201cbest efforts\u201d meant.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">When contracting parties enter business relationships that cannot be specifically defined in advance, they set up standards that will allow a neutral decision maker some basis for decision. <em>See </em>Mark P. Gergen, <em>The Use of Open Terms in Contract, </em>92 Columbia L.Rev. 997, 1000 (1992)(\u201copen terms\u201d such as best efforts clauses are \u201csimilar in form or function to a negligence rule\u201d). In doing so, they recognize that there is a certain murkiness to exactly how that standard will be applied to the business circumstances that eventually exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">This uncertainty, however, does not preclude formation of an enforceable contract if that is what the parties intended. Thus, best efforts clauses generally have been held enforceable because the parties intend to be bound, and there is an articulated standard. <em>See, e.g., Mor-Cor Packaging Prods., Inc. v. Innovative Packaging Corp., </em>328 F.3d 331, 334, 2003 U.S.App. LEXIS 8288, *5 (7th Cir.2003)(factual determination as to whether best efforts clause breached); <em>Western Geophysical Co. of Am., Inc. v.

Perillo, <em>Corbin on Contracts, </em>\u00a7 4.1, at 530 (Revised ed.1993) (\u201ccourt must take language as it is and people as they are. All agreements have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>some degree of indefiniteness and some degree of uncertainty\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">A rational juror could infer that the parties had a meeting of the minds and therefore met the requirement of mutual assent because they understood that First Union was undertaking to be reasonably diligent in referring business to 3S. They agreed to the standard of \u201c \u2018best efforts,\u2019 on a nonexclusive basis. They did not necessarily agree on exactly what volume of referrals would meet that standard. First Union clearly had some discretion in determining what was diligent. <em>See Brewster of Lynchburg, Inc. v. Dial Corp., </em>33 F.3d 355, 364-65 (4th Cir.1994)(in requirements contract, buyer was entitled to reduce its requirement to zero, so long as it did so in good faith); <em>Angelica Uniform, Group, Inc. v. Ponderosa Sys., Inc., </em>636 F.2d 232, 232 (8th Cir.1980)(same); <em>R.A. Weaver &amp; </em>Assocs., <em>Inc. v. Asphalt Constr., Inc., </em>587 F.2d 1315, 1322 (D.C.Cir.1978)(requirements buyer may diminish requirements, even if reductions are disproportionate to the normal prior requirements or to any stated estimate, provided the buyer is acting in good faith\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">But it also had an obligation of good faith in determining that volume. <em>See Julian v. Christopher, </em>320 Md. 1, 9, 575 A.2d 735 (1990)(in every contract, \u201c \u2018there exists an implied covenant that each of the parties thereto will act in good faith,\u2019 \u201d including times when a party exercises discretion). Thus, although diligence is at the core of best efforts, First Union also has an obligation to act in good faith. The jury may have determined that First Union, under the circumstances, did not act in good faith in exercising diligence, even though the best efforts clause did not create a specific obligation to direct a certain percentage of First Union\u2019s transactions to 3S. We do not read the damage award as an indication that the jury concluded that the parties made a specific agreement to give a certain percentage, but rather as a determination by the jury, after the fact, of what level of business would have resulted from reasonably diligent efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>85% Of First Union\u2019s Business Volume</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">First Union attacks the jury verdict for contract damages on the ground that it rested on the jury\u2019s finding that the bank was obligated to refer as much as 85% of its business to 3S. It complains that neither the SA, the negotiations preceding the SA, nor the parties\u2019 course of dealing supported the conclusion that First Union was obligated to refer 85% of its business to 3S. We are not persuaded by this argument because, as we explain below, the jury may have concluded that a much smaller percentage was required under the SA.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The special verdict form did not ask the jury to specify exactly how many transactions the jury decided First Union should have referred to 3S. Nor is this number immediately apparent from the jury verdict, because, in calculating the damage award, the jury had to make an assumption as to what profit per transaction 3S could have made had First Union completely fulfilled its obligations. In reviewing the denial of a JNOV, we consider all inferences from the evidence in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is made. <em>See Impala Platinum, Ltd. v. Impala Sales (U.S.A.), Inc., </em>283 Md. 296, 327, 389 A.2d 887 (1978). If there is any legally relevant and competent evidence, however slight, from which a jury rationally could have found in the plaintiffs favor, the motion for JNOV must be denied. <em>See Jacobs v. Flynn, </em>131 Md.App. 342, 353, 749 A.2d 174, <em>cert. denied sub. nom. Kishel v. Jacobs, </em>359 Md. 669, 755 A.2d 1140 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Applying these principles here, we have ascertained the lowest percentage of First Union\u2019s business that could have resulted in the damage verdict awarded by the jury. We first conclude that the jury could have utilized an incremental profit per transaction of $70, which was the profit assigned by 3S\u2019s expert in his testimony.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Using this figure, we compute that the jury may have found that 3S was entitled to 42.5% of First Union\u2019s transactions for the period January 1, 1998 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>April 30, 2000, and 51% for the period May 1, 2000 through April 30, 2001.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Alternatively, the jury could have simply determined that 3S was entitled to 535,376 transactions, which is 46.1% of First Union\u2019s loan volume during these same periods. They could have computed the total damages award ($37,476,342) by multiplying this 535,376 by the $70 average incremental profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">We previously reviewed the negotiations leading up to the SA during which First Union refused to agree to commit itself to a specific percentage of business. We do not know why it did that, or why it decided to commit itself to the best efforts clause. In deciding to commit itself to the non-specific standard created by the best efforts clause, however, First Union took a risk as to what volume level the trier of fact would determine that good faith diligence required.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">A reasonable person could conclude that First Union was contractually required to send 3S one of these percentages of its business, after considering such factors as the amount of business 3S was getting before the SA,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> the contract provision for a \u201cramp-up\u201d period (suggesting that business would increase), the timeliness and high quality of the service provided by 3S, the smooth operation of the centralized and automated service, the ease with which 3S adjusted to the bank\u2019s huge expansions, and the downward adjustments in pricing offered by 3S. A reasonable person could have reached this conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>sion, taking into account the bank\u2019s need to spread its risk among several vendors. Given the large volume of business enjoyed by First Union, a rational person could conclude that preserving for other vendors <em>48 </em>\u2014 58% of its business would enable the bank to preserve good business relationships with those other vendors.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ARd\">Again, we distinguish 3S\u2019s breach of contract claim from its fraud claim. The evidence does not support the claim that Clewis fraudulently knew in advance that he was committing to a volume equal to a specific percent of the bank\u2019s business, and never intended to comply. Nevertheless, he did agree, on behalf of the bank, to a non-specific best efforts standard that would allow the jury to find that 42-52% of business was required to meet the diligence requirement of a best efforts clause under the circumstances. In other words, we think that the parties set up a standard, rather than a specific percentage, and that Clewis, in saying he never intended to refer more than 50% of the bank\u2019s business, may not have anticipated fully what that standard could mean to a jury. His view was backed up by the non-exclusivity provision in Section 2.1, and the 130% Clause, suggesting that it was within the bank\u2019s discretion how much to send. But the jury may have interpreted the 130% Clause to be intended only for the protection of 3S, giving it notice of expected increases in demand for services, as Steele testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The key is that there was more than one reasonable interpretation of the provisions in the SA. This is why the trial court held that it was ambiguous, and allowed the parties to introduce extrinsic evidence to explain its meaning. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>jury\u2019s task was to interpret the agreement, and it did so, within the bounds of a rational fact finder.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">3S\u2019s Failure To Assert Its Rights Under The Best Efforts Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">First Union urges that 3S\u2019s \u201cinterpretation of the best efforts clause is also decisively belied by the fact that, despite many occasions when it would have been natural to do so, 3S never asserted that it had a contractual right to anything beyond the 1,000 transaction per month minimum[.]\u201d We agree that it is odd that 3S never mentioned the best efforts clause when First Union decreased the volume of business going to 3S. We do not agree, however, that this failure constitutes grounds to reverse the jury\u2019s decision to enforce the best efforts clause. There is no dispute that the clause appeared in the contract. Because the clause was ambiguous, the jury had the job of determining what, if anything, it meant. The jury considered all of the evidence about the best efforts clause, and obviously found it to be enforceable. Although First Union doesn\u2019t use the term \u201cwaiver,\u201d the underpinning of the bank\u2019s argument seems to be waiver. Whether waiver exists is a question of fact for the jury, \u201cfor the determination of its existence <em>vel non </em>turns on the intent of the party ostensibly waiving the right, a state of mind which is to be derived from the facts and circumstances surrounding the purported relinquishment.\u201d <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Molloy, </em>291 Md. 139, 145, 433 A.2d 1135 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Conclusion Regarding Breach of Contract</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">In sum, we hold that the best efforts clause of the SA was not too vague to be enforced and there was sufficient evidence to support the damage award. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment for damages for breach of contract in the amount of $37,476,342.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">Dr. Jaynes\u2019s Testimony Regarding 3S\u2019s Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">First Union also complains that 3S\u2019s proof of damages rested on the testimony of economist Dr. Gerald Jaynes, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>should not have been admitted. First Union argues that Dr. Jaynes constructed a model that purported to account for the incremental revenue and costs that 8S would have received and incurred ... had [First Union] sent 3S 90 percent of the transactions generated by all of its branches nationwide, limited only by 3S\u2019s capacity</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-4\">____[a] model [that] had no foundation in the evidence. It ignored 3S\u2019s actual performance and capacity; it rested on spectacularly unrealistic growth assumptions; and it disregarded market conditions.... \u201cAn expert\u2019s opinion has no probative force unless there is a sufficient basis upon which to support his conclusions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">First Union\u2019s primary complaint is that Dr. Jaynes \u201cdid not take into account 3S\u2019s actual performance \u2014 its rate of capacity growth and its cost and revenue structure \u2014 during the time period in question.\u201d It also complains that \u201cJaynes himself had no idea how many employees 3S actually had at any of the relevant times, and he did not research market employment conditions as a means of determining whether the company would have been able to hire enough people to meet those rates of growth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">We are not persuaded by First Union\u2019s contentions because we think they all address merely the weight to be given the expert testimony, not its admissibility. Dr. Jaynes was well qualified as an economist, and he aided the jury by providing a model for calculating damages, based on certain assumptions. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-702 (expert testimony may be admitted if the court determines it will assist the trier of fact to determine a fact in issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Although 3S\u2019s actual per transaction profit differed from his assumptions, Jaynes\u2019s role was to project what 3S\u2019s per transaction profit potentially could have been with a much higher volume of transactions. Dr. Jaynes testified that higher volumes would have produced greater incremental revenue per transaction because of economies of scale, while fixed costs would have remained the same. We are unwilling to say that expert testimony based on the familiar business wisdom that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>one can earn a higher profit per transaction with a higher volume of business, is so unrealistic as to be without foundation and inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Dr. Jaynes\u2019s assumptions as to capacity also are based in reason. Jaynes described the work he did in the course of preparing his testimony on damages.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-6\">I looked at the counts or tax documents of Steele Software and various other documents for pertaining to that business, and I also made several site visits to Steele Software to examine the operation of that business and talk to Mr. Steele and people working for him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">Now, the primary reason for that was because one of the first things that an economist would have to do, in attempting to build a model of this kind, is to attempt to model what we would call the production function or basically in more lay terms to a model [sic] the process by which Steele Software does appraisals and titles. And how they evaluate those and how, in effect, they run their business to make decisions on the amounts of time it would take to do a particular kind of appraisal versus a title because how many Steele Software could do over a given length of time was going to be a very important factor in determining what the damages were.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Jaynes prepared the chart that we earlier set forth in part, which included a column showing 3S\u2019s capacity to produce titles and appraisals on a monthly basis from January 1998 into 2003.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> For January 1998, he used a capacity of 3,000 per month, which he said was \u201ca very small number which I already knew was probably lower than what Steele\u2019s capacity actually was as a[n] initial basis point.\u201d He then</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-9\">[increased] that by 1,000 units a month because that was lower than all of the evidence that I had seen for the amount of ... growth in employees and therefore capacity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>of appraisals and titles that could be produced by Steele would be. That took me to May 1998.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">For the period after May 1998, Jaynes used information he had received from a letter 8S wrote to First Union on August 31, 1998, stating that 3S had \u201c \u2018geared up\u2019 and staffed [its] organization\u201d to handle 500 transactions per day, beginning September 8, 1998, and 650 transactions per day, beginning October 5, 1998. Taking the October numbers, Jaynes used 14,500 capacity for October 1998.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> He then worked back from these to \u201callow [3S\u2019s] capacity to increase between May and October by an amount which would give them that capacity when the fall arrived.\u201d He made clear repeatedly that the numbers he assigned for each month were estimates and projections. For the period after October 1998, he allocated increased capacity based on the theory that, with appropriate advance notice, 3S could expand its business capacity to meet the available demand by hiring more people.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Although 3S may not have actually possessed the capacity projected by Dr. Jaynes, it is rational to suppose that, if First Union had referred a higher volume of business to 3S, then 3S could have increased its capacity accordingly. As Dr. Jaynes explained, the SA required First Union to give it advance notice of big increases in transactions, which would allow 3S to increase its capacity in preparation for them. The question of whether Jaynes researched the availability of new employees in the marketplace was a subject that First Union had the opportunity to cover in cross-examination. It also could be addressed by First Union\u2019s experts. We cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting Jaynes\u2019 testimony. Nor can we say that the damage evidence was insufficient to support the $37 million verdict for breach of contract.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>First Union also complains that the trial court improperly limited its cross-examination of Dr. Jaynes when it declined to allow the bank to cross-examine him about his methodology in computing damages by using 3S\u2019s tax returns or actual profit figures. First Union was permitted to ask Dr. Jaynes several times during cross-examination whether, in calculating his damage model, Jaynes had looked at \u201cactual\u201d capacity or capability at particular points. Jaynes responded that, although he looked at actual capacity for 1997 and 1998, used actual November 1997 capacity as a starting point, and looked at November 1998 capacity, his damages model was not based on actual capacity. He explained that actual capacity was \u201cpretty much irrelevant to calculating the damages[,]\u201d and his model was based \u201con the difference between what actually happened and what should have happened if the contract were honored.\u201d He explained that 3S could increase its capacity by hiring new employees and taking other steps. His model was based on the \u201cassumption that the contract had started in November of \u201997 and was working smoothly and that they were given warning that the transactions that they would need to be doing in any subsequent months might be increasing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">First Union also asked Dr. Jaynes how the profits he projected \u201cmatched up\u201d to what 3S\u2019s actual profit per transaction was over the history of 3S, attempting to use 3S\u2019s tax return and profit and loss statement to do so. When 3S objected, the court agreed with 3S that \u201che\u2019s comparing apples to oranges,\u201d and suggested that First Union ask what \u201cfigure that he used, was it gross or net after deductions in taxes?\u201d Counsel for First Union then insisted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-5\">He didn\u2019t use either figure. No, I have the right to cross-examine the witness. They put $140 million number out there and I want to show that he is ignoring reality in coming up with this model of things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">So I want to show him reality and then I\u2019m going to ask him to do some calculations and compare his methods to the real world and I think I\u2019m perfectly entitled to do that, Judge....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>He used a model based in part on actuals and he tried to account for actual costs, and I think he didn\u2019t account for those costs and I\u2019m going to take him through his model.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\">The court sustained 3S\u2019s objection:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">I agree. It\u2019s confusing. You want to get into specific examples that would detract from any extrapolation that he made or any interpolation that he made with regard to the existing figures, the past figures like when he backed in, but this doesn\u2019t even resemble what he testified to----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-8\">It\u2019s because it\u2019s a model that represents what gross receipts he would have received had the defendant used best effort to send the transactions to [3S]. That\u2019s why, that\u2019s why he\u2019s right when he says this is not relevant and not probative of his testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">A trial court has discretion to control the scope of cross-examination. <em>See Wrobleski v. de Lara, </em>353 Md. 509, 525, 727 A.2d 930 (1999). Here, First Union obtained Jaynes\u2019s admission several times that his models were not based on actual profit per transaction earned by 3S. What it was not allowed to do was to compare 3S\u2019s actual expenses and earnings with Jaynes\u2019s model. To be sure, it would have been within the trial court\u2019s discretion to allow such cross-examination. In light of Jaynes\u2019s protestations that his model was not based on actual expenses or actual capacity, however, we do not consider the trial court\u2019s ruling excluding more detailed exploration of this point to be an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">Even if the trial court erred, moreover, First Union suffered no prejudice because both of its economic experts criticized Dr. Jaynes for failing to base his damage model solely on 3S\u2019s historical profits. Further, one of the bank\u2019s experts testified about his detailed calculation of damages solely using 3S\u2019s historical experience. None of these figures were contradicted by Jaynes because he simply said that actual figures were irrelevant to his damage calculations. Thus, the jury had sufficient basis to reject Jaynes\u2019 testimony if it wished to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Geographic Scope Of The SA</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Finally, First Union contends that, \u201c[e]ven if [First Union] had an enforceable duty pursuant to the \u2018best efforts\u2019 clause, that duty extended only to the six-state region specified in Exhibit A.1.0 of the [SA], not to [First Union\u2019s] entire nationwide footprint.\u201d It points out that Section 2.1 of the SA granted 3S \u201cthe right to perform the Services and Reports as listed in Exhibit [A.1] as attached hereto.\u201d It argues that Exhibit \u201cA\u2019T.O, which was part of Exhibit A.1, listed only six states: Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">The SA was entered by \u201cFirst Union and its Affiliates,\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and the body of the agreement contains no geographic limitation regarding which First Union branches are included. In the SA, \u201c \u2018Exhibit A\u2019 refers to \u2018Exhibit A.1\u2019 attached.\u201d \u201cExhibit A.1,\u201d which is attached, states that 3S \u201cwill provide to [First Union] and its affiliates (collectively \u2018First Union National Bank\u2019), the following Services and Reports, at the prices as listed below.\u201d After some general provisions about pricing (not a price list), the following services are listed under the heading, \u201cTraditional Service/Report Pricing and Turnaround Time\u201d: Title Report, Recording Service, Drive-By Evaluation (referred to as \u201cDB\u201d), Appraisal Report (referred to as \u201cAP\u201d), Automated Ownership Verification and RealValue Report, and Tax Assessment Confirmation. Next to each listed service item are set forth details about the nature of the service and/or the timing of completion. The specifics regarding the Title Report, the Drive-By Evaluation, and the Appraisal Report, each say \u201csee Attached Chart for Pricing.\u201d There is no geographical limitation in the description of services on Exhibit A.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Attached to Exhibit A.1, however, is a document titled \u201cExhibit \u2018AT.O, Pricing as of ll/21/97[,]\u201d which lists counties in Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia, and assigns prices to three different services for properties located in those counties.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Although it does not argue on appeal that the SA was unambiguous in its favor, First Union relies heavily on this price list to support its argument that the SA was only intended to cover First Union operations within those six states.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The trial court held that the SA was ambiguous with respect to geographic scope, and allowed extrinsic evidence of intent. Although we are not asked to review this ruling, the contract itself is our starting point for resolving the question we are asked to review, <em>i.e., </em>whether the evidence supported the award of damages for failure to refer title and appraisal work to 3S relating to loans outside the six state footprint. Section 2.1 of the SA says that 3S has the \u201cright to perform the Services and Reports as listed in Exhibit [A.1] attached.\u201d The best efforts clause says that, \u201cFor all of the Services and Reports, as required by First Union for Residential Real Estate secured loans, First Union will use [its] best efforts to direct these transactions to Steele[.]\u201d A natural placement for a geographical limitation to either of these clauses would have been either in the body of section 2.1, or in Exhibit A.1, which describes the nature of the Services included in the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">While it is clear that the parties were relying on Exhibit \u201cA\u2019T.O to designate prices for the services, it is not as clear that the failure to designate prices for services relating to properties outside the six state area necessarily meant that a geographical restriction was imposed on the contract. Nowhere on Exhibit \u201cA\u2019T.O is there a clear statement of intent to impose a limitation, such as, \u201c \u2018Services and Reports\u2019 as de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>fined on Exhibit A.1 shall be limited to the following states.\u201d <footnotemark>33</footnotemark> It is quite possible that 3S only listed the six state area on Exhibit A1.0 because it had not yet developed pricing for the other states. Indeed, Exhibit A.1 states</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">[Djuring the term of this Agreement, ... Services or Reports may be modified, other Services or Reports may be added, or if pricing changes are made, a revised \u201cExhibit A\u201d, with a new numerical decimal suffix and effective date, will be provided to [First Union], at the notification address as per the Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">There was significant extrinsic evidence offered by both parties. This included evidence as to the parties\u2019 construction of the contract after its execution. <em>See Anne Arundel County v. Crofton Corp., </em>286 Md. 666, 673, 410 A.2d 228 (1980)(when contract is ambiguous, the trier of fact determines the intent and purpose of the parties by considering the circumstances and conditions affecting the parties at time of execution, and their subsequent conduct and construction); <em>Nat'l Union Mort. Corp. v. Potomac Consol. Debenture Corp., </em>178 Md. 658, 674, 16 A.2d 866 (194Q)(construction placed by parties after execution and before controversy has arisen, is extremely significant in determining intention).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">There was evidence supporting 3S\u2019s interpretation that the SA had no geographical limitation. Shortly after execution of the SA, on February 3, 1998, 3S sent Thompson a nationwide price list. He testified that he did so pursuant to the authority to modify pricing given to 3S on Exhibit A.1.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Although-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>this nationwide list was not designed as Exhibit \u201cA.1.0,\u201d Steele explained this was so</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">because it was being attached to the first one, sir.... [I]t was being attached to the original A.l. It wasn\u2019t not replacing that, sir.... If you look at Maryland, Georgia, and the other states, those will match up exactly with the existing price list, and this was to be a part of that.... It was adding to it, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The nationwide price list was sent to Thompson. The transmittal of this price list suggests that 3S considered the scope to be nationwide at a time when the parties were not in dispute about the meaning of the SA, and is thus evidence as to its meaning. <em>See Nat\u2019l Union Mort., </em>178 Md. at 674, 16 A.2d 866 (construction by party before dispute arises is significant). Steele also testified that the Exhibit \u201cA\u2019T.O price list was not intended to limit the geographical scope of the SA. He testified, \u201cthere was no limitation ... with anyone that we ever talked with at First Union regarding geographical limitation.... [T]hey wanted us to do the transactions wherever they were.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The first people to assert to Steele that the price list was intended to limit the geographical scope of the SA were the defense attorneys in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">That First Union, in turn, paid 3S for 8,0000 transactions outside the states listed on the original price list supports 3S\u2019s interpretation that the SA covered more than six states.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> 3S\u2019s pre-contract provision of services through First Union\u2019s direct marketing program to 2,000 branches of First Union, which covered far more than the six-state area, also corroborates 3S\u2019s interpretation of the SA.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">Trent Thompson also testified that affiliate First Union Direct, which was First Union\u2019s direct marketing arm, en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>gaged in nationwide transactions. Thus, the inclusion of \u201cAffiliates\u201d as parties to the contract could be interpreted to mean that the parties intended to cover a greater geographic scope than the six states in which Clewis directly operated.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">First Union argues that, even if the SA could be interpreted to include a nationwide area, extrinsic evidence showed that neither Clewis nor Thompson had authority beyond the regions specified on the price list. Specifically, First Union urges that \u201cSteele conceded that Clewis and Thompson had \u2018no ability to direct transactions out of either the New Jersey service center or the Jacksonville service center\u2019 until \u2018they consolidated the operations\u2019 in March 1999[.]\u201d Steele did, indeed, acknowledge that, \u201cnot until they consolidated the operations would they have the ability to do that.\u201d First Union, however, ignores his testimony given a few moments later:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">I don\u2019t say they couldn\u2019t, sir. They were not taking that approach from a political standpoint internally, sir. They were merged banks. They were, you know, it\u2019s a political football going on.... I believe [Clewis] had the authority, sir. He bound it for First Union National Bank, whether they politically did it internally, sir, that\u2019s a different issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The jury may have chosen to believe this latter statement accurately reflected Steele\u2019s understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">During his dealings with First Union, Steele knew that officers at high levels of the bank were aware of the services he offered, and were delegating authority to lower-level officers, such as Dibble and Clewis, to negotiate and formalize a contract. In the early days of the negotiations, this included Doug Crisp, First Union\u2019s Senior Officer in charge of the Consumer Credit Division. Later, Clewis and Thompson told Steele that Mr. Pruitt had taken over Crisp\u2019s role.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>\u201c[Sjince Doug Crisp was no longer there pushing the bank or the consumer credit division that Mr. Pruitt was now involved and they didn\u2019t think that they would be able to achieve the transaction levels that we previously in concept agreed to but the intent and commitment was still there with us, ... but they didn\u2019t think they would be able to get the document signed with a large amount of transactions in it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Thus, during both the 1995-1996 and the 1997 phases of the negotiations, Steele was made to believe that officials holding positions higher than Clewis or Thompson, who presumably had authority to bind the bank outside the six-state area, were overseeing the course of the negotiations. First Union does not point to any evidence that these officers had no authority to bind the bank outside the six-state area, or that Steele had been told they lacked authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">A June 10, 1996 letter to the bank illustrates Steele\u2019s belief that the necessary corporate authority would be obtained before any contract was signed. In that letter, Steele asked First Union officer Morgan Smith to \u201cexpedite the approvals of these final changes through any channels necessary. Once reviewed by First Union, we will prepare two originals for execution.\u201d Steele was also aware that Clewis had given versions of the SA to First Union\u2019s legal department for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">It is not required that -3S prove that Clewis had actual authority, if the evidence is sufficient to show apparent authority. \u201cIn order to establish that [Clewis] was clothed with at least apparent authority to enter the subject agreement, [3S was] required to prove that the actions of [Clewis], when reasonably interpreted by [3S] gave rise to apparent authority and that [3S\u2019s] reliance on such actions was reasonable.\u201d <em>Atl. Richfield Co. v. Sybert, </em>51 Md.App. 74, 84, 441 A.2d 1079 (1982), <em>aff'd, </em>295 Md. 347, 456 A.2d 20 (1983). Our examination of the record reveals sufficient evidence for a jury to infer that Steele reasonably thought Clewis, a senior vice-president who received direction from above, had authority to bind First <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Union to a contract for services outside the six-state area. The record also includes sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that the parties did not intend to limit the SA to the six-state area.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">JUDGMENT FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT AFFIRMED.

It is undisputed that Steele\u2019s second draft contract, sent in September 1995, proposed that 3S receive the greater of: 70% of First Union's transactions, or an average of 2,500 transactions per month for the first year, and 7,500 transactions per month thereafter. This proposal was not accepted by First Union.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b170-8\">. 3S chose not to bring its action under the Maryland Uniform Trade Secrets Act (\u201cMUTSA\u201d), <em>codified at </em>Md.Code (1975, 2002 Repl.Vol., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>2003 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 11-1201 <em>et seq. </em>of the Commercial Law Article (CL). Indeed, it repeatedly renounced any claim that First Union stole or misappropriated trade secrets. These renouncements constituted a strategic decision not to subject its claims to the limitations contained in MUTSA. MUTSA provides for damages for misappropriation of a trade secret, which consist of the \"actual loss caused by misappropriation,\u201d and \"[t]he unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation that is not taken into account in computing actual loss[,]\u201d or alternatively, a \"reasonable royalty\" for ihe misappropriation.. <em>See </em>CL \u00a7 11 \u2014 1203(b)\u2014 (c). It also allows exemplary damages, but in \"an amount not exceeding twice any award\u201d allowed under a compensatory damage theory, upon proof of \"willful and malicious misappropriation!;.] \u201d CL \u00a7 11-203(d)(emphasis added). MUTSA remedies displace \"conflicting tort, restitutionary, and other law of this State providing civil remedies for misappropriation of a trade secret[,]\u201d CL \u00a7 ll-1207(a), except, for contractual remedies. <em>See </em>CL \u00a7 11 \u2014 1207(b)(i). Thus, a claim under MUTSA would have precluded 3S\u2019s claim for fraud. 3S elected to disclaim any MUTSA claim, and sued for breach of contract and fraud.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b174-9\">. According to Steele, many other invoices had been paid during the time period 1996-1998.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b174-10\">. Between late September or October 1998, and May 3, 1999, when 3S wrote Buzzi, First Union paid $72,000 on the outstanding invoices, reducing the balance to $303,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b177-10\">. As we discuss later in this section, we consider the phrase \u201cpreferred provider\u201d too vague and general to amount to an actionable misrepresentation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b179-9\">.

There the court reversed summary judgment in favor of the defendant based on alleged fraudulenl representations made by a car dealership that a contract to purchase a vehicle was just a \"formality\u201d and would not be effective until Mr. Smith obtained the consent of his wife. We rested our decision on the doctrine that, \u201c \u2018where the parties to a written agreement agree orally that performance of the agreement is subject to the occurrence of a stated condition, the agreement is not integrated with respect to the oral condition.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62, 573 A.2d 418 (quoting <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 217). There was no oral condition that the SA would only be effective upon occurrence of a stated condition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b196-6\">. We recognize that in these cases, the \u201cbest efforts\u201d were directed toward accomplishing something not totally within the control of the promisor, while here, First Union had substantial control over how many transactions it referred to 3S. We do not think this difference precludes application of a similar best efforts standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b198-7\">. The expert testified that this was the average incremental profit per transaction over the years in question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b199-7\">. The damage award for the period from January 1, 1998 to April 30, 2000 was $21,240,614. Assuming an incremental profit per transaction of $70, this meant the jury decided that 3S was entitled to 303,437 transactions ($21,240,614 divided by $70). 303,437 transactions represents <em>42.5% </em>of 713,567, First Union\u2019s total transactions for this period. For the period May 1, 2000 to April 30, 2001, the jury awarded $16,235,728. Dividing this by 70, we arrive at 231,938 as the number of transaction First Union should have referred to 3S. This number divided by First Union\u2019s total transactions for the period, 448,167, equals 51.8%. If the jury used a single transactions number for the total award of 535,376, which is 46.1% of the bank\u2019s volume, they could have just allocated it between the two time periods on the verdict sheet.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b199-8\">. 3S received approximately 1,500 transactions per month in the latter months of 1997, before the SA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b200-6\">. First Union\u2019s volume of transactions for 1999 and 2000, was 415,274 and 419,928, respectively. 48% of these volumes equaled 199,331 transactions and 201,565 transactions, respectively. If a vendor\u2019s profit per transaction was $70, the volume of First Union business to spread among 3S\u2019s competitors would equal between $13,953,170 and $14,109,580. We cannot say that it is irrational to conclude that the bank could maintain good relations with two other vendors, and thereby protect its own interests, by referring each of them annual business approximating $7 million.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b203-10\">. The chart extended beyond the period that the jury found to be the term of the SA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b204-8\">. Twenty three weekdays in October, multiplied by 650 transactions per weekday equals 14,950 for the month of October.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b204-9\">.

It could mean that counties outside the six state area are included.

First Union argues that payment for invoices for areas outside the six state area does not necessarily mean that the bank was obligated under the SA to refer business outside the six states. We agree that alternate inferences can be drawn, but all that is necessary to sustain the verdict is that the jury\u2019s inference be a permissible one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b211-9\">. Again, that an alternate inference is also possible, <em>i.e., </em>that First Union only intended to use its direct mail affiliate for transactions within the six-state region, does not bar this inference.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b213-5\">THEODORE G. BLOOM, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ASK\">Retired, Specially Assigned, concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">I concur in the opinion written for the Court by Judge Adkins, but for a different reason than that set forth in that opinion with respect to reversal of the verdict and judgment in favor of appellee on its claim for fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">In its brief, appellee referred to evidence that indicated that the phrase \u201cbest efforts\u201d that was inserted in the written contract between the parties had a special meaning. Further references to that evidence were made during oral argument. I agree with the majority opinion that the \u201cbest efforts\u201d phrase (absent some special meaning) was too ambiguous, too general, to serve as a basis for a claim of fraudulent inducement to enter into a contract that appellant never had any intention to perform. Appellee refers however, to testimony by Mr. Steele that, in negotiations between him and Parkes Dibble, one of appellant\u2019s vice-presidents, the term \u201cbest efforts\u201d had been given a particular meaning: Dibble told him that \u201cthey could send all the transactions he could and that [Steele] could handle.\u201d Mr. Steele understood that \u201cbest efforts\u201d meant that appellee would receive approximately 85% to 90% of appellant\u2019s transactions, provided appellee had the capacity to handle that many transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">There was also testimony to the effect that, when Senior Vice-president Bill Clewis succeeded Dibble as appellant\u2019s agent in negotiating the terms of the contract between the parties, he told Mr. Steele \u201cnot to worry. Nothing\u2019s changed,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>and that \u201c[Clewis] was aware of what [Steele] had discussed with Parkes [Dibble] and we are the company.\u201d That evidence, coupled with testimony by Clewis that, under no circumstances would appellee receive more than 50% of the transactions that the bank would refer for processing, could, I believe, have supported a finding that appellee had been induced to enter into the Service Agreement by appellant\u2019s fraudulent representation that appellant would refer to appel-lee all of the transactions covered by the agreement that appellant had and that appellee could handle.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">That theory of \u201cfraudulent inducement,\u201d based on a special agreed meaning of best efforts, however, was never presented to the jury for its consideration. With respect to the \u201cbest efforts\u201d provision in the Service Agreement, the trial judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">In this contract it calls for best efforts. Best efforts clauses impose an obligation to act with good faith in light of one\u2019s own capabilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">Good faith is defined as follows: good faith is an intangible and abstract quality with no technical meaning or statutory definition, and it encompasses, among other things, an honest belief the absence of design to defraud or to seek unconscionable advantage and an individual\u2019s personal good faith is concept of his own mind and inner spirit. Honesty of intention and freedom from knowledge of circumstances which ought to put the holder upon inquiry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-8\">In common usage this term is ordinarily used to describe that state of mind denoting honesty of purpose, freedom from intention to defraud, and generally speaking means being faithful to one\u2019s duty or obligation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">That instruction is consistent with the majority opinion\u2019s thorough discussion of the meanings that courts and writers on the subject have ascribed to the phrase \u201cbest efforts\u201d in contacts. I agree with the conclusion in the majority opinion that the \u201cbest efforts\u201d phrase in the Service Agreement between the parties, and as defined by the court in its instructions to the jury, was too ambiguous to support appel-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>lee\u2019s claim of fraud in the inducement, although it is sufficient to support the breach of contract verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The court did instruct the jury that the plaintiffs claim that it was promised a long-term relationship \u201cis relevant only to the fraud in the inducement claim,\u201d and that appellee\u2019s attorney did stress that point in his argument to the jury. I agree with the majority opinion, however, in its conclusion that, in light of the short-term provisions in the Service Agreement, appellee could not have relied on the \u201clong-term relationship\u201d assurances as a basis for its fraud claim.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
