On appeal, Thrasher asks three questions that we have condensed into one and reworded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-6\">Is there a private cause of action, under Md.Code (2003 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 11 \u2014 523(b) of the Financial Institutions Article (\u201cFI\u201d), against a licensed mortgage lender who allows a mortgage to be executed at a place for which the person does not have a license to conduct business?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">We answer \u201cno\u201d and affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">Thrasher owns real property located at 1820 Gapland Road in Jefferson, Maryland. On or about November 6, 2000, he executed and delivered a \u201cjunior deed of trust\u201d to Homecomings Financial Network, Inc. (\u201cHomecomings\u201d) securing a loan with his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-14\">In a complaint filed September 18, 2002, Thrasher averred that the loan documents were executed at his home and that, in violation of FI \u00a7 ll-505(e), Homecomings did not have a license to act as a mortgage lender at that location. Citing FI \u00a7 ll-523(b), Thrasher asserted \u201cthat no interest, costs, finders fees, brokers fees or other charges may be collected from [him] on the subject loan and [for] cancellation of the deed of trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-15\">Homecomings filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that, even if a violation had occurred, there was \u201csimply no private right of action\u201d under FI \u00a7 ll-523(b). According to Homecomings, that provision of the statute only penalized an \u201cunlicensed\u201d person who made or assisted a borrower in obtaining a mortgage loan and not a \u201clicensed\u201d person who violated a provision of the Maryland Mortgage Lender Law (the \u201cMMLL\u201d). In support of its position, Homecomings cited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number><em>Staley v. Americorp Credit Corp., </em>164 F.Supp.2d 578 (D.Md. 2001). Thrasher responded that Homecomings\u2019 license to conduct business at one location did not \u201ccreate any type of \u2018color of license\u2019 that affords protection to someone who conducts \u2018unlicensed\u2019 activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The central issue at the hearing on the motion to dismiss was whether a licensed mortgage lender became an \u201cunlicensed person,\u201d under FI \u00a7 11 \u2014 523(b), when conducting business at an unlicensed location. According to Homecomings\u2019 attorney, the parties had stipulated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ary-dedup-0\">at all times relevant to the facts in this case Homecomings ... was a licensed mortgage lender under the [MMLL] and that license was ... for a location that is other than the alleged location being [Thrasher\u2019s] home where the loan was actually closed. That is, the second part of the stipulation, is that assuming for the sake of this case that the facts do bear out that the loan was closed in the borrower\u2019s home, clearly Homecomings is stipulating that ... that\u2019s not a licensed location. [Thrasher\u2019s] home, kitchen, living room, whatever it was, is not a licensed location.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Thrasher\u2019s attorney clarified the stipulation, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\">[W]e don\u2019t dispute that [Homecomings] held a license for a particular location. But, [the license] wasn\u2019t [for] the borrower\u2019s home, and the reason I make the distinction, Your Honor, is just because part of the argument is whether ... having a license at another location gave \u2018em the right to act anywhere else. Whether they would be considered a licensed lender still or an unlicensed lender if they acted at another location.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">The circuit court, in granting the motion, stated that in</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZO\">the <em>Staley </em>case, the Court did dismiss plaintiffs complaint in part and held that [FI \u00a7 ]ll-505 did not create a private right of action. And there is a distinction here. Being unlicensed initially and then being licensed and violating a provision of holding the settlement in another place where they were not authorized is certainly a difference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-9\">Now, I don\u2019t think that [FI \u00a7 ]11 \u2014 505 did create a private right of action. I think that the [legislature] intended the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>[Commissioner], not private parties, to enforce the licensing provisions of the MMLL. Now, no question that [FI \u00a7 ]11-523[(b)] does provide for suits against creditors who failed to get a license at all. But it does not allow individual [borrowers] to enforce the licensing provisions of the MMLL. And in fact, if it did, that would be inconsistent with the administrative scheme [that] the [legislature] established to enforce the MMLL.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Thrasher argues that the circuit court erred in its determination (1) that there was no private cause of action, under FI \u00a7 11 \u2014 523(b), against a licensed mortgage lender who allows a secondary mortgage to be executed at a place for which the person is not licensed to conduct business; (2) that a license under the MMLL allows the holder to conduct business at any location; and (3) that Homecoming \u201cwas licensed to close a second mortgage loan\u201d at his home. Homecomings counters that the court correctly found no private cause of action, but that it did not make the determinations contained in Thrasher\u2019s second and third assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">Contrary to Thrasher\u2019s contention, the circuit court determined that FI \u00a7 ll-523(b) created a private cause of action only against lenders who had failed to obtain a license, and not against licensed lenders who violated the MMLL. The court did not hold that a licensed lender could conduct business at any location or that Homecomings was \u201clicensed to close a second mortgage loan\u201d at Thrasher\u2019s home. Rather, the court determined that such license violations were to be enforced by the Commissioner, and not private parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">In <em>Staley, </em>the federal district court determined that there is no private right of action, either express or implied, under FI \u00a7 11 \u2014 523(b), against a licensed mortgage lender violating the MMLL.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this case, appellant contends that Homecom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>ings was in effect an \u201cunlicensed\u201d lender when the documents relating to the loan transaction were executed because they were not executed at a licensed place of business. Therefore, he claims the right to the private cause of action that is expressly created by FI \u00a7 ll-523(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">\u201c \u2018[T]he cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intention.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Green, </em>367 Md. 61, 81, 785 A.2d 1275 (2001) (citations omitted). When we interpret a statute, our starting point is always the text of the statute. <em>W. Corr. Inst. v. Geiger, </em>371 Md. 125, 141, 807 A.2d 32 (2002). \u201c[I]f the plain meaning of the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, and consistent with both the broad purposes of the legislation, and the specific purpose of the provision being interpreted, our inquiry is at an end.\u201d <em>Breitenbach v. N.B. Handy Co., </em>366 Md. 467, 473, 784 A.2d 569 (2001). Nevertheless, the plain meaning rule is \u201celastic, rather than cast in stone[,]\u201d and if \u201cpersuasive evidence exists outside the plain text of the statute, we do not turn a blind eye to it.\u201d <em>Adamson v. Correctional Med. Servs., </em>359 Md. 238, 251, 753 A.2d 501 (2000) (citing <em>Kaczorowski v. Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 513-14, 525 A.2d 628 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">In determining a statute\u2019s meaning, we are permitted to \u201cconsider the statute\u2019s structure, including its title, and how the statute relates to other laws.\u201d <em>McKay v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Servs., </em>150 Md.App. 182, 194, 819 A.2d 1088 (2003). We may \u201cconsider the context in which a statute appears, including related statutes and legislative history.\u201d <em>Ridge Heating, Air Conditioning &amp; Plumbing, Inc. v. Brennen, </em>366 Md. 336, 350-51, 783 A.2d 691 (2001). Also, we may \u201cconsider the particular problem or problems the legislature was addressing, and the objectives it sought to attain.\u201d <em>Sinai Hospital of Baltimore, Inc. v. Department of Employment &amp; Training, </em>309 Md. 28, 40, 522 A.2d 382 (1987). This enables us to put the statute in controversy in its proper context and thereby \u201cavoid unreasonable or illogical results that defy common sense.\u201d <em>Adamson, </em>359 Md. at 252, 753 A.2d 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>With the codification of the MMLL, the legislature created a comprehensive licensing scheme to regulate mortgage lenders. Under the MMLL, subject to certain exceptions not relevant to this case, a person may not act as a mortgage lender unless licensed by the Commissioner of Financial Regulation (the \u201cCommissioner\u201d) in the Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation. FI \u00a7 11-504. The license authorizes a person to act as a mortgage lender at a licensed place of business, and that person \u201cmay not conduct any mortgage loan business at any location or under any name different from the address and name that appears on the person\u2019s license.\u201d FI \u00a7 ll-505(d)(2). Only one place of business may be \u201cmaintained under any 1 license,\u201d FI \u00a7 11 \u2014 505(b), and a mortgage lender must obtain a license for each location at which a mortgage loan business will be conducted. FI \u00a7 ll-505(c). The statute expressly prohibits a \u201clicensee\u201d from allowing \u201cany note, or loan contract, mortgage, or evidence of indebtedness secured by a secondary mortgage or deed of trust to be signed or executed at any place for which the person does not have a license____\u201d FI \u00a7 11 \u2014 505(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">The Commissioner is authorized to suspend or revoke a license if the licensee</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">(1) Makes any material misstatement in an application for a license;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">(2) Is convicted under the laws of the United States or of any state of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">(i) A felony; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-8\">(ii) A misdemeanor that is directly related to the fitness and qualification of the person to engage in the mortgage lending business;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-9\">(3) In connection with any mortgage loan or loan application transaction:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-10\">(i) Commits any fraud;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-11\">(ii) Engages in any illegal or dishonest activities; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-12\">(iii) Misrepresents or fails to disclose any material facts to anyone entitled to that information;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>(4) <em>Violates any provision of this subtitle or any rule or regulation adopted under it or any other law regulating mortgage loan lending in the State; </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-4\">(5) Otherwise demonstrates unworthiness, bad faith, dishonesty, or any other quality that indicates that the business of the licensee has not been or will not be conducted honestly, fairly, equitably, and efficiently.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">FI \u00a7 ll-517(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The Commissioner is given broad enforcement powers, including imposition of civil fines and the issuance of orders to licensees to cease and desist from illegal actions or to take affirmative actions to correct their illegal actions. FI \u00a7 11-517(c). The Commissioner\u2019s orders may be enforced by a circuit court. FI \u00a7 ll-517(c) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Moreover, under FI \u00a7 ll-523(a), a person who \u201cwillfully violates\u201d any provision is guilty of a felony and subject to a fine not exceeding $50,000 and/or imprisonment not exceeding ten years. Pursuant to FI \u00a7 ll-523(c), a person who misappropriates or converts money \u201crightfully belonging to a borrower\u201d or \u201ccommits any fraudulent act in the course of engaging in the mortgage lending business\u201d is guilty of a felony and subject to a fine not exceeding $100,000 and/or imprisonment not exceeding fifteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Clearly, the statute creates a private cause of action against an unlicensed person. Under FI \u00a7 ll-523(b), any unlicensed person</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-9\">who is not exempt from licensing under this subtitle who makes or assists a borrower in obtaining a mortgage loan in violation of this subtitle may collect only the principal amount of the loan and may not collect any interest, costs, finders fees, broker fees, or other charges with respect to the loan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">The MMLL does not define an \u201cunlicensed person,\u201d but the terms \u201clicense\u201d and \u201cperson\u201d are defined. A license is \u201cissued by the Commissioner ... to authorize a person to engage in business as a mortgage lender.\u201d FI \u00a7 ll-501(f). A \u201cperson\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>is defined as \u201can individual, corporation, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, association, 2 or more persons having a joint or common interest, or any other legal or commercial entity.\u201d FI \u00a7 ll-501(m). It follows, then, that an \u201cunlicensed person\u201d is a person who does not have a license to engage in business as a mortgage lender.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">To be sure, a license issued by the Commissioner only \u201cauthorizes the licensee to act as a mortgage lender under the license at the licensed place of business.\u201d FI \u00a7 ll-505(a). Moreover, the law expressly provides that a <em>\u201clicensee </em>may not allow any note, or loan contract, mortgage, or evidence of indebtedness secured by a secondary mortgage or deed of trust to be signed or executed at any place for which the person does not have a license,\u201d except at certain specified locations under certain circumstances. FI \u00a7 ll-505(e) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Assuming the truth of the allegations of the complaint, the licensee violated a provision of the subtitle and is subject to suspension or revocation of its license. FI \u00a7 ll-517(a)(4). It would appear that the Commissioner also could require Homecomings \u201cto take affirmative action to correct the violation including the restitution of money or property to any person aggrieved by the violation.\u201d FI \u00a7 ll-517(c)(l)(i)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">On the other hand, the MMLL does not automatically transform a licensee who allows loan documents to be executed at a location other than at the person\u2019s \u201clicensed place of business\u201d into an \u201cunlicensed person.\u201d Although the violation of this provision may result in the suspension or revocation of a license, the licensee remains licensed until the license is actually suspended or revoked by the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Because Homecomings was not an \u201cunlicensed person,\u201d appellant cannot rely on a cause of action created by FI \u00a7 11-523(b). In addition, FI \u00a7 ll-523(b) does not create a private cause of action against a licensed mortgage lender who allows a mortgage to be executed at a place for which the person does not have a license to conduct business. Therefore, the circuit court did not err in dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-10\">.
