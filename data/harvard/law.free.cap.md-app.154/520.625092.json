On August 23, 2002, the Honorable Kaye A. Allison entered an Order that granted appellants\u2019 Motion to Seal the Record but denied their Motion to Quash the Subpoena. Appellants have appealed the denial of their Motion to Quash, and present the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">I. DID THE CIRCUIT COURT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION BY DENYING APPELLANTS\u2019 MOTION TO QUASH THE SUBPOENA?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-9\">II.

The complaint included newspaper articles about Mr. Doe\u2019s June 2001 convictions of child abuse and third degree sex offenses involving his granddaughter. According to the articles, Ms. F., who had been counseling the appellants, did not report Mr. Doe\u2019s abuse to the authorities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The Maryland Social Workers Act (Social Worker Act)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides that a social worker may be disciplined for failure to report suspected child abuse.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 56*Pursuant to its statutory authority,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Board initiated an investigation of the complaint and, on April 25, 2002, subpoenaed Ms. F.\u2019s complete patient files for Mr. and Mrs. Doe for the year 1998. Appellants subsequently moved to quash the subpoena and to seal the record. Judge Allison ultimately (1) granted appellants\u2019 Motion to Seal the Record, but (2) denied appellants\u2019 Motion to Quash the Subpoena.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">Appellants argue that Judge Allison abused her dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>cretion by denying their Motion to Quash.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This assertion presents three separate questions, the first of which pertains to the status of the records, <em>ie. </em>whether the records sought by the Subpoena contain information that is confidential, privileged, or both. The second question is whether the Board has the right to subpoena mental health records that are confidential under the Confidentiality of Medical Records Act (Confidentiality Act).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The third question is whether the Board is authorized to subpoena mental health records that are privileged under the statutorily created social worker-client privilege.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We answer \u201cyes\u201d to all three questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Status of Appellants\u2019 \u201cPatient File\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">There is a difference between a \u201cconfidential\u201d medical record and a \u201cprivileged\u201d communication. <em>Shady Grove Psychiatric Group v.

HG \u00a7 4-302. Section 4-307(b) of HG states: \u201cThe disclosure of a medical record developed in connection with the provision of mental health services shall be governed by the provisions of this section in addition to the other provisions of [the Confidentiality Act].\u201d The Confidentiality Act also compels a health care professional, including a social worker, to disclose mental health records to a licensing board pursuant to the disciplinary investigation of a social worker. HG \u00a7 4 \u2014 306(b)(2) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-9\">(b) <em>Permitted disclosures. </em>A health care provider shall disclose a medical record without the authorization of a person in interest:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-10\">(2) Subject to the additional limitation for a medical record developed primarily in connection with the provision of mental health services in \u00a7 4-307 of this subtitle, to health professional licensing and disciplinary boards, in accordance with a subpoena for medical records for the sole purpose of an investigation regarding:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>(i) Licensure, certification, or discipline of a health professional----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">More specifically, HG \u00a7 4-307(k)(l)(vi)(l) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">A health care provider shall disclose a medical record without the authorization of a person in interest: In accordance with a subpoena for medical records on specific recipients ...

In <em>Shady Grove, supra, </em>as a result of a \u201chate crime\u201d that occurred near the office of a mental health professional group, the State issued a subpoena for information that included names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, and appointment histories of patients who had appointments around the time of the crime.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Applying HG \u00a7\u00a7 4-306(b)(7) and 4-307(c) of the Confidentiality Act,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we granted Shady Grove\u2019s Motion to Quash the Subpoena at issue on the ground that the State had failed to comply with \u00a7 4-306(b)(7), which requires written procedures for protecting the confidentiality of the record. <em>Shady Grove, </em>128 Md.App. at 179, 736 A.2d 1168.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Appellants argue that <em>Shady Grove, supra, </em>supports their position that the circuit court erred in denying their motion to quash the subpoena for the records at issue. <em>Shady Grove </em>is, however, inapplicable to the subpoena at issue here. Although the written procedures requirement applies to subpoenas issued pursuant to criminal investigations, there is no such requirement for subpoenas issued by a health care licensing/disciplinary board. HG \u00a7\u00a7 4 \u2014 306(b)(2) and 4-307(k)(l)(vi)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The Power to Subpoena Records Protected by the Social Worker \u2014 Client Privilege</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Section 9-121 (b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, titled <em>Communications between licensed social worker and client, </em>states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">Unless otherwise provided, in all judicial or administrative proceedings, a client has a privilege to refuse to disclose, and to prevent a witness from disclosing, communications made while the client was receiving counseling or any information that by its nature would show that such counseling occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">(Emphasis added). In light of the language \u201cunless otherwise provided,\u201d \u00a7 9-121 (b) cannot be interpreted without reference to related statutes that are also relevant to the scope of the social worker-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">Section 5-704(a)(l) of the Family Law Article, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-10\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including any law on privileged communications, each health practitioner, police officer, or educator or human service worker, acting in a professional capacity, who has reason to believe that a child has been subjected to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-11\">(i) abuse, shall notify the local department or the appropriate law enforcement agency; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-12\">(ii) neglect, shall notify the local department;....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>md. code (1999), fam. law \u00a7 5-704(a)(l) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Appellants argue that the testimonial privilege between social worker and client abrogates and supercedes the health professional\u2019s statutory duty to provide a licensing/disciplinary board with patients\u2019 mental health records in response to a subpoena issued by that board in the course of a disciplinary investigation. According to appellants, C.J. \u00a7 9-121(b) creates an absolute privilege that trumps the Board\u2019s subpoena power. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The Maryland General Assembly has authorized the Social Worker Board to investigate complaints of possible violations of the Social Worker Act, which contains an extensive list of violations for which a social worker can be disciplined. [\u00b6] \u00a7 19-311. In this case, the Board received a complaint that a licensed social worker, Ms. F., had reason to believe that a child had been subjected to abuse and failed to notify the appropriate agency. Such an omission would constitute a violation of [\u00b6] \u00a7 19-311(15), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">[T]he Board may deny a license to any applicant, fine a licensee, reprimand a licensee, place any licensee on probation, or suspend or revoke a license if the applicant or licensee:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">(15) Knowingly fails to report suspected child abuse in violation of \u00a7 5-704 of the Family Law Article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">Resolving the Conflict between the Board\u2019s Statutory Subpoena Power and Appellants\u2019 Statutory Protections Against Disclosure</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">The legislature has given the Board the authority to hold hearings and issue subpoenas:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number><em>\u201cSubpoenas and oaths. </em>\u2014 Over the signature of an officer or the administrator of the Board, the Board may issue subpoenas and administer oaths in connection with any investigation under this title and any hearings or proceedings before it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">HO \u00a7 19\u2014312(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">\u201cIt is well settled that when two statutes, one general and one specific, are found to conflict, the specific statute will be regarded as an exception to the general statute.\u201d <em>Farmers &amp; Merchants National Bank v. Schlossberg, </em>306 Md. 48, 63, 507 A.2d 172 (1986) (citations omitted). The Confidentiality Act establishes the confidentiality of medical records. HG \u00a7 4-302. While C.J. \u00a7 9-121 establishes the social worker-client privilege, the Social Worker Act provides the Board with subpoena power over the records of licensed social workers when investigating a violation of that Act, HO \u00a7 19-312(c). Under HG \u00a7 4 \u2014 307(k)(1)(vi)(1) of the Confidentiality Act, a social worker must comply with a records subpoena issued by the Board whether or not the social worker\u2019s client objects to the disclosure of the client\u2019s records. As HO \u00a7 19-812(c) and HG \u00a7 4 \u2014 307(k)(1)(vi)(1) are more specific, we therefore conclude that, (1) the Legislature intended that social worker-client records be confidential and privileged under the Confidentiality Act and C.J. \u00a7 9-121, but (2) the Legislature never intended that the client of a social worker whose records have been subpoenaed by the Board would be entitled to rely upon either the Confidentiality Act or C.J. \u00a7 9-121 as a basis for prohibiting the Board from obtaining the client\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">In support of their constitutional challenge, appellants point out that HG \u00a7 4-307(k)(6) \u201c[does] not preclude a ... person in interest from asserting in a motion to quash or a motion for a protective order any constitutional right or other legal authority in opposition to disclosure.\u201d According to appellants, Judge Allison erred when she held that the interest of the State in subpoenaing these types of records in the course of an invest\u00ed-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>gation outweighed appellants\u2019 constitutional privacy interests. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">\u201c \u2018[T]he right of privacy is protected by the federal constitution and ... where the right is applicable, regulation limiting it must be justified by a compelling state interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dr. K., </em>98 Md.App. at 111, 632 A.2d 453 (quoting <em>Montgomery County v.

The constitutional protection of the right to privacy \u201cextends to two types of privacy interests: \u2018one is the individual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters, and another is the interest in independence in making certain kinds of important decisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v.

These factors include: the type of record requested, the information contained therein, the potential for harm from any subsequent nonconsensual disclosure, the injury that disclosure would cause in disclosure to the relationship for which the record was generated, the adequacy of safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure, the government\u2019s need for access, and the presence or absence of an express statutory mandate, an articulated public policy, or other public interests indicating the need for access to the records at issue. <em>Id. </em>at 578. We shall apply the <em>Westinghouse </em>factors to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">\n<em>Type of record and information contained therein</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The subpoena in this case directed a social worker to deliver \u201cthe complete patient file\u201d for Jane and John Doe \u201cfor the calendar year 1998.\u201d It is obvious that the records at issue contain information of a highly private nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">\n<em>The potential for harm in subsequent nonconsensual disclosure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Even though Mr. Doe has been convicted of criminal charges, the records at issue are potentially harmful to the Does. Because of the nature of the charges being investigated, and the potential for embarrassment if the records were subsequently disclosed, without the consent of the interested parties, the \u201cpotential for harm\u201d is present.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">\n<em>The injury to the relationship for which the record was generated</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">Even though the professional relationship between Ms. F. and the Does has now terminated, the social worker-client relationship is a very personal one and any disclosure of records created within the confines of that environment of trust could conceivably damage any such relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>\n<em>The adequacy of safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Maryland law provides an abundance of safeguards to prevent the unauthorized redisclosure of the Does\u2019 records once the Board has obtained them. Section 4-302(a) of the Confidentiality Act requires that health care providers keep medical records confidential, and allows disclosure only as provided by the Act or Maryland law. Section 4-302(d) expressly prohibits the redisclosure of health records by those to whom the records are disclosed:</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\"><em>Redisclosure. </em>\u2014 A person to whom a medical record is disclosed may not redisclose the medical record to any other person unless the redisclosure is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">(1) Authorized by the person in interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-8\">(2) Otherwise permitted by this subtitle;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-9\">(3) Permitted under Article 88A, \u00a7 6(b) of the Code; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-10\">(4) Directory information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">HG \u00a7 4-302(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">There is no other provision in the subtitle that permits redisclosure of mental health records obtained by the Board. Moreover, under HG \u00a7 4-309, the disclosure of a medical record in violation of the Confidentiality Act subjects the violator to a criminal fine and to civil damages.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-13\">Although these safeguards may not be fail-proof, security precautions that are substantial but \u201cnot foolproof\u2019 are constitutionally adequate. <em>Schachter v. Whalen, </em>581 F.2d 35, 37 n. 2 (2nd Cir.1978). The United States District Court for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>District of Maryland has noted that \u201cMaryland statutes provide an adequate safeguard against unauthorized disclosure [of medical records].... \u201d <em>Patients of Dr. Solomon v.

If the Social Worker Board receives a complaint that a social worker failed to notify the appropriate agency of his/her reason to believe that a child had been subjected to abuse, a lack of access to the worker\u2019s records would \u201ceffectively foreclose any meaningful investigation into that conduct and any basis for disciplinary action.\u201d <em>Dr. K., </em>98 Md.App. at 118, 632 A.2d 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">\n<em>Express statutory mandate, articulated public policy, and/or other public interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">There is express statutory authority mandating the disclosure of records to the Board. \u201c[D]isclosures of private medical information to ... public health agencies are often an essential part of modem medical practice even when the disclosure may reflect unfavorably on the character of the patient.\u201d <em>Whalen v.

There is a \u201ccompelling public interest\u201d in completing these investigations without creating opportunities for the health provider, through his or her patients, to stall the proceedings. <em>See Patients of </em>Dr. Solomon, 85 F.Supp.2d at 548.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>In <em>Dr. K., supra, </em>the State Board of Physician Quality Assurance (Physician Board) received formal complaints about Dr. K., a psychiatrist licensed to practice in Maryland, and his behavior in relation to a former patient of his, patient A. In the course of its investigation, the Physician Board investigated and subpoenaed Dr. K.\u2019s records relating to his treatment of patient A. Dr. K. filed a motion to quash the subpoena, which was ultimately denied.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> On appeal, Dr. K. and patient A raised only one question with this Court: \u201cDoes a patient\u2019s constitutional right to privacy bar the disclosure of mental health records to the Board of Physician Quality Assurance when the patient asserts such a right upon the patient\u2019s physician being subpoenaed to produce those records to the Board of Physician Quality Assurance?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 107, 632 A.2d 453. Noting that a patient\u2019s privacy interests are not absolute, we held that the legislature made a clear policy decision to require compliance with Board subpoenas without patient consent. <em>Id. </em>at 119, 632 A.2d 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">After utilizing the analytical framework established in Westinghouse,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> we hold that Judge Allison did not err or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>abuse her discretion and we affirm the circuit court\u2019s Order denying appellants\u2019 Motion to Quash the Subpoena. The relevant statutes and case law make it clear that the legislature has concluded that (1) the public\u2019s interest in regulating health care professionals is best served by providing the Board with the power to subpoena the records at issue, and (2) it would create an absurd result to mandate that a social worker report child abuse, while at the same time, permit the abuser and/or the social worker to prevent the Board from investigating a complaint of failure to report the suspected abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">After the parties had filed their briefs in this Court, but before the argument date, (1) appellants moved to supplement the record with a redacted Consent Order, and (2) appellee notified us that it would not oppose that motion, provided that the record be supplemented with an unredacted Consent Order. According to appellants, because the Board has agreed that it will not attempt to impose any further discipline upon Ms. F. as a result of Ms. F.\u2019s failure to report Mr. Doe\u2019s abuse, there is no valid reason why the subpoena at issue should be enforced at this point in time. According to appellee, because the Consent Order expressly provided that the Board would continue its effort to obtain judicial enforcement of the subpoena, the Consent Order does not resolve the issue of whether appellants are entitled to an order quashing the subpoena for their records.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">We are persuaded that the case at bar is not moot merely because Ms. F. faces no additional discipline for her failure to report her former client\u2019s abuse. Moreover, a case that involves \u201cfrequently recurring issues of public importance ... ought to be decided.\u201d <em>Rutherford v. Rutherford, </em>296 Md. 347, 352, 464 A.2d 228 (1983). Because it has a statutory duty to promote and maintain high professional standards for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>practice of social work, the Board is entitled to examine records that will assist the Board in developing procedures that are likely to ensure that social workers fulfill their obligation to report suspected child abuse. For these reasons, appellants have neither a statutory nor a constitutional right to quash the subpoena at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANTS TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-11\">.
