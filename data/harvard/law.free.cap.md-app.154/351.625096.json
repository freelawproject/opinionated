The court merged the theft conviction for sentencing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Appellant raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">I. Is the evidence sufficient to support a conviction for first degree burglary, when there was no evidence of a breaking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">II. Did the trial court err in denying relief for a discovery violation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">TIT. Did the court err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence recovered in the course of a search pursuant to a warrant, when, with reckless disregard for the truth, the affiant omitted crucial information as to the identification of the suspect?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall reverse the burglary conviction but affirm the remaining convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">FACTUAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">Just after dark on March 3, 2002, eighty-one year old James William Carter, also known as \u201cHam,\u201d left his home at 105 North Fifth Street in Denton to purchase chewing tobacco at a nearby convenience store. On route to the store, Carter passed appellant at the intersection of North Fifth and Gay Streets, approximately thirty feet from Carter\u2019s home. Appellant, who was dressed in a heavy black coat and baggy black pants, was still at the intersection when Carter returned from the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">Upon returning to his house, Carter closed the screen door but did not lock it. Moreover, he left the wooden door to his home ajar some twelve to fourteen inches. When Carter sat down to watch television, he heard a knock at the door. Thinking that it was one of the neighborhood boys, Carter responded, \u201ccome in.\u201d At that point, someone opened the screen door and stood in the area between the screen door and the wooden door.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">After a brief silence, the individual demanded that Mr. Carter give him his money. When Carter did not respond, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>the suspect again demanded money while he \u201chit for his [coat] pocket.\u201d Although Mr. Carter did not know whether the suspect had a gun, he thought he had \u201csomething.\u201d Carter refused to give the assailant any money. Instead, he called out for his roommate, Edward Taylor. Just as Mr. Taylor responded, the suspect fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Carter testified that he was only able to see the assailant\u2019s eyes, nose, and mouth, because the suspect\u2019s face was partially covered by the hood of his parka. Mr. Carter further stated that the suspect \u201cwasn\u2019t no grown person.\u201d Moreover, he was convinced that the assailant was the same person he had seen on the corner when he (Carter) went to and from the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Although the police came to Carter\u2019s residence with some photographs, Mr. Carter was unable to identify the assailant. He stated: \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t see it in there.\u201d Yet, in court, Carter identified appellant as his assailant. Carter acknowledged, however, that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t see [the assailant\u2019s] eyes real good because he had it [i.e., the parka hood] pulled close.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The trial court then questioned Mr. Carter at length about how he knew that appellant was the assailant if he could not see the suspect\u2019s face. Carter insisted that appellant was the assailant. The following exchange is noteworthy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">[THE COURT]: Now I understand when the person came in, you couldn\u2019t tell who was under that hood?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-9\">[MR. CARTER]: No, ma\u2019am, no ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-10\">[THE COURT]: When you were walking to the Farm Store and you noticed the person on the comer wearing the parka, could you see that person\u2019s face?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-11\">[MR. CARTER]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-12\">[THE COURT]: Okay when you came back from the Farm Store and you saw that same person on the corner ... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABu\">[MR. CARTER]: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-13\">[THE COURT]: Could you see that person\u2019s face?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-14\">[MR. CARTER]: No, ma\u2019am, I couldn\u2019t see him until he come and knocked on my door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>[THE COURT]: All right and then you just saw his eyes, his nose and his mouth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-5\">[MR. CARTER]: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s all I could see.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">[THE COURT]: Now a little earlier you told Mr. Walker that it was the boy standing on the corner, the person on the corner was the Defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">[MR. CARTER]: It wasn\u2019t him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">[THE COURT]: That it was him, you pointed to Mr. Holland, that that was the boy standing on the comer with the parka?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-9\">[MR. CARTER]: Yeah, yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-10\">[THE COURT]: How do you know that if you didn\u2019t see his face?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-11\">[MR. CARTER]: I could see it but he\u2019s the only, he\u2019s the only one out on the street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-12\">[THE COURT]: Okay but if you didn\u2019t see his face, how do you know it was Mr. Holland?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-13\">[MR. CARTER]: Oh, it was him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-14\">[THE COURT]: Okay, can you tell, it\u2019s very important, how do you know it was him if you couldn\u2019t see his face?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8u\">[MR. CARTER]: I couldn\u2019t see his face until he come in the house but if he hadn\u2019t had that hood pulled up on his head, I could have told that, I could have saw his face but I couldn\u2019t see. He had it all pulled up like it was freezing out there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq4\">[THE COURT]: I understand that but at what point did you decide that that person in the hood was Mr. Holland?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7D\">[MR. CARTER]: That\u2019s the only one I saw standing there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2s\">[THE COURT]: Okay, let\u2019s go back, okay, when you passed the person on the comer, you couldn\u2019t see their face?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMW\">[MR. CARTER]: No ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-15\">[THE COURT]: When did you decide in you own mind that that person who\u2019s face you couldn\u2019t see was Mr. Holland?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3g\">[MR. CARTER]: Well, I couldn\u2019t say but one thing about it but when I come back and I kind of looked over there, now I say in mind, something ain\u2019t right. He\u2019s standing there, why he [sic] standing there and nobody else because any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>other time all them street, street be full but he was the only one on that corner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">[THE COURT]: Okay, this is real, real important Mr. Carter and you\u2019ve done a great job testifying and you\u2019ve been, I\u2019ve understood everything you\u2019ve said but you have to understand that I need to know why you think it\u2019s that young man over there that was in that parka?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">[MR. CARTER]: Well, I\u2019m going to tell you, that\u2019s the only one I saw on that corner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">[THE COURT]: Okay but you just told me you didn\u2019t, you couldn\u2019t see their face?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-8\">[MR. CARTER]: I could see, you\u2019re right ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\">[THE COURT]: Okay ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-10\">[MR. CARTER]: ... I couldn\u2019t see a face but still, I still say he was the one on that corner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-11\">[THE COURT]: Okay you need to tell me why you think that, why, I mean how, I mean it could have been somebody else in that parka?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-12\">[MR. CARTER]: No ma\u2019am, no ma\u2019am, no ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-13\">[THE COURT]: Then you need to tell me why ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-14\">[MR. CARTER]: No ma\u2019am, no ma\u2019am, nuh-uh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-15\">[THE COURT]: Okay ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-16\">[MR. CARTER]: That was him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-17\">[THE COURT]: Okay, so what ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-18\">[MR. CARTER]: Now I might, I might (inaudible) but one thing about it, no ma\u2019am, he was the one on that corner because if a person standing on the corner and he\u2019s standing when you go by and you come back, they got to be moved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ap-dedup-0\">[THE COURT]: Okay but you need, okay Mr. Carter you need to tell me why you think it was him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-19\">[MR. CARTER]: I know it was him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-20\">[THE COURT]: Tell me how you know it was him if you couldn\u2019t see ... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-21\">[MR. CARTER]: I couldn\u2019t see his face good but he was the one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Mr. Taylor testified that he responded to Mr. Carter\u2019s call and saw \u201ca person going out of the door from the side view and then I saw the back view of this person going outside the door.... \u201d He noticed the individual\u2019s walk, which he described: \u201c[T]he type of walk that they used, like a lazy person walk or a slur walk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Mr. Taylor described the suspect as a dark complected male, about 120 to 130 pounds, approximately o'2\" tall. He wore a dark colored, hooded jacket with fur around the outside edge of the hood and dark, baggy, \u201cbulky\u201d clothes. Nevertheless, when Taylor was asked if he saw the face of the person who entered his residence, Mr. Taylor answered, \u201cNo, I did not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Taylor recalled that Carter said the suspect had tried to rob him (Carter). Accordingly, Taylor called the police. Taylor testified: \u201cI gave them a description of the person that I saw leaving out of the doorway.... \u201d Then, Taylor went outside to look for the assailant. As he \u201cwent around the street,\u201d Taylor \u201cnoticed the police had a person standing outside on the passenger side talking to him.... \u201d Taylor claimed that person matched the description of the assailant. He also thought this person lived in that area. However, he noticed that the person was not wearing any bulky clothes. Rather, he wore a white tee shirt and jeans. Nevertheless, Taylor recognized the individual because of his \u201clazy\u201d walk.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">A few days after the incident, Taylor called the police again to report that, across the street from their home, he saw \u201cthat same type of person with that type of clothes on.... \u201d Because of the person\u2019s walk and clothing, he concluded that the person across the street was the assailant. The following testimony is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: Can you describe what you saw?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">[MR. TAYLOR]: The person had that same type of slow walk with a little dip in his walk and I told Ham [Mr. Carter], I said that\u2019s that person and Ham looked over there, he said it sure is, just like that and that\u2019s when I had called the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: And did you provide information to the police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">[MR. TAYLOR]: Yes I did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">After the incident, Taylor was shown a photo array, but he was unable to make an identification. Nevertheless, Taylor made an in-court identification of appellant. Taylor explained that he identified Holland based upon \u201c[h]is height and his size\u201d and \u201che had that same type walk.\u201d Indeed, Taylor insisted that \u201c[t]here\u2019s no question at all\u201d that Holland was the perpetrator of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Patrolman First Class (\u201cPFC\u201d) Thomas Conneely, Jr. of the Denton Police Department testified that, on March 3, 2002, at approximately 6:30 p.m., he went to 105 North Fifth Street in Denton in response to a call about an attempted armed robbery. There, he met Carter and Taylor. Among other things, they told Conneely that they could not see all of the suspect\u2019s face, because it was partially covered by his hood.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">After the interview, the officer \u201cbroadcast a lookout giving a description of the suspect.\u201d PFC Conneely then received information from PFC Michael Rodano, indicating that appellant had been seen wearing the described clothing. As a result, appellant was developed as a suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">PFC Conneely stopped appellant \u201ca half an hour to an hour\u201d after he interviewed Carter and Taylor. At the time, appellant was wearing a black nylon \u201crunning suit.\u201d PFC Conneely conducted a pat-down and told appellant that \u201cthere had been an attempted robbery or a robbery, home invasion.\u201d He also informed appellant that he resembled the description of the suspect involved in the \u201cattempted robbery\u201d at North Fifth Street. Appellant told PFC Conneely that he could not have been involved in the incident because he was at a relative\u2019s house, located at 106 North Fifth Street. After talking to appellant, the officer continued to patrol the area, but was unable to locate anyone else who matched the description of the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">On the day of the incident, Conneely also responded to 106 North Fifth Street, where appellant\u2019s mother, Francis Robin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>son, and appellant\u2019s cousin, Vanessa Hudson, were seated on the front porch, along with other unidentified persons. While PFC Conneely spoke with Ms. Robinson, appellant and his brother, Michael Holland, arrived. Conneely recalled that appellant asserted: \u201c T would have got money if I robbed somebody.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Following his encounter with appellant, PFC Conneely prepared a photo array of six individuals, which included appellant. PFC Conneely related that he showed the array to both Carter and Taylor, neither of whom could identify a suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">On March 4, 2002, Conneely returned to the victim\u2019s residence to conduct another interview. Thereafter, Conneely obtained a search warrant for appellant\u2019s residence at 515 Lincoln Street, which was executed on March 6, 2002. Con-neely told appellant that a BB gun had been recovered during the search. Appellant responded that he found the BB gun at the basketball court and concealed it behind his house because he knew that his mother would not approve.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">PFC Michael Rodano testified that he saw appellant on the day of the incident. He related that appellant was wearing a fur-trimmed, hooded jacket matching the one described by Mr. Carter. This information was relayed to PFC Conneely.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Patrolman Daniel Franklin testified that, at the outset of the search, appellant was served with the warrant. Franklin stated: \u201cI believe he was reviewing the charges with his mother and in a louder voice than the rest he had been talking, he said \u2018assault, I didn\u2019t assault that man.\u2019 \u201d As we discuss in more detail, <em>infra, </em>appellant unsuccessfully moved to strike this statement on the ground that the State failed to disclose it in discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">During the search of appellant\u2019s residence, the police recovered a navy blue parka with a fur lined hood. Two unused Crossman brand C02 cartridges were found in an upstairs bedroom. A plastic baggie containing suspected crack cocaine was also seized, but it was later found to contain pebbles and candle wax. In addition, in the rear yard the police recovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>a chrome colored Daisy C02-powered BB gun with a black handle.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Appellant gave a written statement to the police after his arrest in which he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">I was chilling all day playing with my dogs at my house[.] I don\u2019t know what time I was on the block with me and my brother and somebody and he went home and me and Mic went home I was taking my bath and Mic went outside and in the fourt [sic] of the house then he came in the house an[d][sic] side [sic] some body got rob [sic] and they said it was me my [sic] brother went back outside and then I came out[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">I don\u2019t know about what time I was over Vanessa because it was my mom and sister Vanessa was backup [sic] at the time when the cops came to her house so she got scared and did not know what to say[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">I find [sic] the gun to the [sic] playground Tuesdayf.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVS\">Vanessa Hudson, appellant\u2019s cousin, testified that appellant was not at her home at the time of the incident. But, she claimed that appellant had asked her to tell the police that he was at her residence at that time. Ms. Hudson further testified that appellant was close to her children, and her children may have seen him at her house at the time of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">At the close of the State\u2019s case, the court granted appellant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal as to the charge of wearing, carrying, and transporting a handgun. Appellant also moved for acquittal as to the burglary charge, claiming that the evidence of a breaking was insufficient to support a burglary conviction. Defense counsel said: \u201cThe evidence is that, well, one of the elements of burglary is a break in and according to case law, break in requires entering by trespass .... \u201d The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-9\">THE COURT: Well but I think it also says it doesn\u2019t preclude if someone used it by trickery, knocking on the door. To come in with the intent of robbing I think constitutes breaking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, trickery, yeah but constructive breaking would be using trickery, a falsehood to gain entry. Now I submit knocking on a door is not trickery.... It\u2019s not a breaking, there\u2019s not fraud involved. I think the cases where that would apply would be where someone lies to get in or they impersonate someone else to get in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">THE COURT: So if he had knocked on the door and said I\u2019m the mailman, he said come on in that would constitute breaking but if he\u2019s smart enough....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Like if he had some story.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">THE COURT: ... not to say anything at all and just wait to see if someone says come in, that\u2019s not a breaking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aso\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No, it\u2019s, it could be ... no, it\u2019s not. Part of, I mean ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">THE COURT: Well my idea of the trickery is you knocking on the door. That\u2019s, I mean, in other words, most people that gain entry will ring a doorbell and knock on the door and if someone inside doesn\u2019t come to the door to see who it is and just says come on in, in my view that\u2019s still gaining entrance by tricking someone to think you\u2019ve got legitimate business that you\u2019re ringing the doorbell or knocking on the door.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">After the court denied the motion for judgment, appellant called Thomas Harris, an investigator with the Public Defender\u2019s Office, as his only witness. Harris testified that on July 12, 2002, Taylor told him that when he (Taylor) entered the room, the suspect was leaving and had his back turned toward Mr. Taylor. Moreover, Taylor said he did not see the suspect\u2019s face. Mr. Taylor also told Mr. Harris that he did not see the suspect walk to the corner, because at that point Mr. Taylor had turned to call 911. When he turned back, however, he saw the suspect standing on the comer.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">Harris again spoke to Taylor on July 17, 2002, because the statement of probable cause had been issued and was inconsistent with what Taylor had told Harris. Harris testified that he asked Taylor if he had seen the suspect on March 3, 2000, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>standing with a group of people on a porch, and Taylor told Mr. Harris that he had not. But, Taylor saw the suspect standing on the corner.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The State called Mr. Taylor in rebuttal. He testified that, a few days after the incident, he called the police a second time, because he saw \u201cthe same individual\u201d standing across the street, and he \u201cmade the same identification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">Appellant was convicted of first degree burglary, in violation of Md.Code Ann., Art. 27, \u00a7 29.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-10\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 A <em>person may not break and enter </em>the dwelling of another with the intent to commit theft or a crime of violence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-11\">(b) <em>Penalty. </em>\u2014 A person who violates this section is guilty of the felony of burglary in the first degree and on conviction is subject to imprisonment for not more than 20 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">Appellant contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for first degree burglary because there was no evidence of either an actual or constructive breaking of Carter\u2019s home. With regard to an actual breaking, appellant asserts that \u201cno reasonable fact finder could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant broke into Mr. Carter\u2019s residence, because the entry was with consent.... \u201d Noting that \u201cMr. Carter shouted out an invitation to enter,\u201d appellant contends the \u201centry [was] based upon consent,\u201d and a \u201cpermissive or consensual entry is not a breaking\u201d under Maryland law. In addition, appellant argues that no breaking occurred because \u201cthe screen door was closed but not locked\u201d and \u201c[t]he inside door was sitting open.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Holland also maintains that the evidence did not establish a constructive breaking. In this regard, he observes that the State did not show that he gained entry through fraud, trickery, or artifice.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Further, appellant complains that, in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, \u201cthe prosecutor argued that there was a burglary here, because there was an entry with the intent to commit theft.\u201d He recognizes that, in \u201csome other states, a mere entry can constitute burglary, as long as at the time of the entry, the defendant had the intent to commit a crime within.\u201d Appellant adds: \u201cIf the \u2018entry with intent to commit a crime\u2019 formulation were the law in Maryland, the evidence here would be sufficient.\u201d But, appellant insists that, under Maryland law, an entry does not amount to a constructive breaking merely because the entry is made with an illegal intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The State counters that the evidence was sufficient to sustain Holland\u2019s conviction. In its view, the evidence satisfied \u201cthe \u2018entering\u2019 element necessary to sustain [appellant\u2019s] burglary conviction,\u201d and established both an actual breaking and a constructive breaking. Pointing to appellant\u2019s \u201cfelonious intent,\u201d the State asserts: \u201cHolland\u2019s act of knocking and remaining quiet, with the sole intent to take Carter\u2019s money, was sufficient evidence of an intent to deceive.\u201d In addition, the State contends that \u201cHolland\u2019s act of knocking and remaining silent constituted a constructive breaking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">In reviewing a sufficiency claim, we must determine \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 313-14, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). The issue is whether the verdict was supported by sufficient evidence that, directly or circumstantially, supports a rational inference of facts that could convince a trier of fact of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 478-79, 649 A.2d 336 (1994). Put another way, \u201c[t]he limited question before an appellate court is \u2018not whether the evidence <em>should have </em>or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number><em>probably would have </em>persuaded the majority of fact finders but only whether it <em>possibly could have </em>persuaded <em>any </em>rational fact finder.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mora v. State, </em>123 Md.App. 699, 727, 720 A.2d 934 (1998), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>355 Md. 639, 735 A.2d 1122 (1999) (quoting <em>Fraidin v.

It will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d Md. Rule 8-131(c). <em>See State v. Raines, </em>326 Md. 582, 589, 606 A.2d 265, <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 945, 113 S.Ct. 390, 121 L.Ed.2d 299 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">We agree with appellant that there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction for burglary, whether based on the theory of an actual or a constructive breaking. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The evidence showed that appellant was silent as he knocked on Carter\u2019s door. Nor did appellant make any deceptive or threatening comments. In response to appellant\u2019s knock, Carter answered, \u201ccome in.\u201d At that point, appellant opened the unlocked screen door and stood between that door and the wooden door that Carter had left ajar. Carter testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">When [appellant] come in, he come in there and he stayed inside the screen door, didn\u2019t quite shut all the way, he stand in the screen door and ain\u2019t nobody in the wooden door and so he come, he come in there and so I didn\u2019t say nothing....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Did he move the door at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-10\">H* H\u00ed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-11\">[CARTER]: No, the wooden door, see I had a latch, a bundle at the wooden door, I had it open.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-13\">[CARTER]: And the screen door wasn\u2019t even locked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>To be sure, a breaking may occur by opening a closed but unlocked door. <em>See Robinson v. State, </em>67 Md.App. 445, 458, 508 A.2d 159, <em>cert. denied, </em>307 Md. 261, 513 A.2d 314 (1986); <em>Reagan v. State, </em>2 Md.App. 262, 267-68, 234 A.2d 278 (1967). But, the State does not contend that appellant committed an actual breaking merely because he opened the unlocked screen door.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\"><em>Finke v. State, </em>56 Md.App. 450, 468 A.2d 353 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>299 Md. 425, 474 A.2d 218, <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1043, 105 S.Ct. 529, 83 L.Ed.2d 416 (1984), is instructive in regard to the breaking element of a burglary offense. Finke was convicted of the felony murder of his aunt, who was found stabbed to death in her home. <em>Id. </em>at 457-58, 468 A.2d 353. He argued on appeal that the evidence was insufficient regarding the breaking and intent elements of the underlying felony. <em>Id. </em>at 466-67, 468 A.2d 353. This Court noted that there was \u201cno direct evidence as to how or under what circumstances\u201d Finke entered his aunt\u2019s home, other than his statement to the detective that \u201che guessed his aunt let him in.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 467, 468 A.2d 353. Accordingly, the Court said that \u201cthe finding of a trespassory entry, or breaking, essential to the verdict could only have been reached by deduction or inference from evidence of other facts.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The Court explained that \u201c[t]he breaking of a dwelling house or other structure, within the meaning of that term as applied to burglary and related statutory crimes, may be actual, as where physical force is applied, or constructive, as where entry is gained through fraud or trickery. It may involve simply lifting a latch or opening a door closed by its own weight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 467, 468 A.2d 353 (citing <em>Jones v. State, 2 </em>Md.App. 356, 360, 234 A.2d 625 (1967)); <em>see Reagan v. State, 2 </em>Md.App. 262, 267-68, 234 A.2d 278 (1967). The Court went on to state that \u201c[tjurning a doorknob and opening a closed door or merely further opening a door left ajar involves sufficient force to constitute an actual breaking, <em>provided it is a trespas-sory act.\u201d Id. </em>(Emphasis added). Nevertheless, the Court cautioned: \u201c \u2018There is no \u2018breaking\u2019 if a person has a right to enter or <em>if he enters with the consent of the owner.\u2019 \u201d Finke, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>56 Md.App. at 467, 468 A.2d 353 (quoting <em>Martin v. State, </em>10 Md.App. 274, 279, 269 A.2d 182 (1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The Court concluded that a rational inference could be drawn from the evidence that Finke \u201copened the door and entered\u201d his aunt\u2019s home \u201cwithout invitation,\u201d given that \u201che had not visited his aunt for about a year and half and was not expected on this occasion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 479, 468 A.2d 353. Therefore, \u201cin the absence of any legitimate basis for his presence, the jury could have rationally inferred that Finke\u2019s entry was trespassory in nature, i.e., a breaking.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\"><em>Martin v. State, supra, </em>10 Md.App. 274, 269 A.2d 182, is also instructive. There, two brothers, Claude and-William Martin, were found parked in front of a recently burglarized home with stolen items in their car. <em>Id. </em>at 277, 269 A.2d 182. At trial, Claude testified that, on the night in question, his brother approached him at a bar and asked him if he would move a few things around the corner for an individual named Tony, who offered to pay them for their services. <em>Id. </em>at 278, 269 A.2d 182. The trial court did not accept Claude\u2019s explanation of how he came into possession of the stolen goods and convicted the brothers of burglary. <em>Id. </em>at 278, 269 A.2d 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">On appeal, Claude claimed that the evidence was not sufficient to support his conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 276, 269 A.2d 182. Specifically, he asserted that the State failed to prove that Claude, William, or Tony lacked the homeowner\u2019s permission to enter the dwelling. <em>Id. </em>at 278, 269 A.2d 182. The Court explained that \u201cbreaking, as an element of burglary, requires a breach of the dwelling made by a trespass. There is no \u2018breaking\u2019 if a person has a right to enter or if he enters with the consent of the owner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279, 269 A.2d 182 (citing <em>Perkins on Criminal Law, </em>2d Ed., p. 195; Clark and Marshall, <em>Law of Crimes, </em>7th Ed., \u00a7 13.03, pp. 1000-1001.) Because the trial court did not find that the defendants had permission to enter the house, the Court held that the trial court did not err in concluding that the breaking was trespas-sory; that was a rational inference from the facts and circumstances shown. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Appellant relies on <em>Brooks v. State, </em>25 Md.App. 194, 333 A.2d 352 (1975), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>277 Md. 155, 353 A.2d 217 (1976), to support his claim that his entry into Carter\u2019s residence was consensual rather than trespassory. In <em>Brooks, </em>the defendant was convicted of storehouse breaking after he entered a department store while it was open to the public and then secreted himself in the store until after it closed. <em>Id. </em>at 195, 333 A.2d 352. This Court held that \u201cwhether or not we can term appellant\u2019s original entrance into the store to be by trick, fraud, artifice, deception or otherwise, we think it can be fairly said that appellant\u2019s failure to leave the premises when the store closed for business made his original entrance a constructive, illegal breaking and entering, <em>ah </em>initio.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198, 333 A.2d 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The Court of Appeals affirmed, but on other grounds. <em>Brooks v. State, </em>277 Md. 155, 353 A.2d 217 (1976). It concluded that there was sufficient evidence of an \u201cactual breaking\u201d because the door leading to the shoe department, where appellant had secreted himself, had been pried open. <em>Id. </em>at 163, 353 A.2d 217. But, the Court left \u201cfor another day, and for other factual findings, the resolution of the question: whether or not one, who enters premises lawfully, such as an invitee, and then, possessing an intent to steal, or commit a felony, manages by stealth or artifice, to remain upon the premises, after the termination of the lawfulness of his presence, can be guilty of either common law burglary or the statutory offense.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 161, 353 A.2d 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">In this case, Carter acknowledged that appellant merely knocked on the door and, in response, he told appellant to \u201ccome in.\u201d Thus, there was no actual breaking by appellant in opening the unlocked door; appellant\u2019s entrance was consensual. <em>See Martin, </em>10 Md.App. at 279, 269 A.2d 182 (\u201cThere is no \u2018breaking\u2019 if a person has a right to enter or if he enters with the consent of the owner.\u201d). Because there was no actual breaking by appellant, we next consider the State\u2019s claim that appellant\u2019s conduct amounted to a \u201cconstructive break.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>It appears to us that the State offers two primary reasons to support its position that appellant\u2019s actions constituted a constructive breaking. First, the State contends that appellant harbored a felonious intent that gave rise to a constructive breaking. The State asserts that appellant\u2019s \u201cact of knocking\u201d on Mr. Carter\u2019s door while \u201cremaining quiet, with the sole intent to take Mr. Carter\u2019s money, was sufficient evidence of an intent to deceive.\u201d Notwithstanding Carter\u2019s statement of \u201ccome in,\u201d the State argues that appellant knew he was not invited into Mr. Carter\u2019s home because of his illicit purpose. The State adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">Indeed, as Holland\u2019s acts upon entering Carter\u2019s apartment consisted only of repeated demands for money, there was simply no evidence to support the conclusion that Holland had anything other than a felonious intent when he entered Carter\u2019s apartment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Second, the State contends that a constructive breaking occurred based on appellant\u2019s trickery and fraudulent conduct. The State asserts: \u201cHolland was posing as someone known to Carter by knocking and failing to announce himself, and therein lies the fraud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">We agree that \u201c[t]he breaking element of burglary \u2018may be satisfied where it is shown that ... the breaking occurred \u2018constructively,\u2019 through an entry gained by artifice, by fraud, conspiracy, or by threats.\u2019 \u201d <em>Oken v. State, </em>327 Md. 628, 662, 612 A.2d 258 (1992) (citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S. 931, 113 S.Ct. 1312, 122 L.Ed.2d 700 (1993); <em>see Winder v. State, </em>362 Md. 275, 326, 765 A.2d 97 (2001) (defining \u201cconstructive breaking to include \u2018every unlawful entry,\u2019 \u201d) <em>(citing Brooks, </em>277 Md. at 159-160, 353 A.2d 217); <em>Reed v. State, </em>316 Md. 521, 524, 560 A.2d 1104 (1989) (\u201cAt common law, a constructive breaking occurred \u2018when entry was gained by fraud or threat of force.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Jones v. State, supra, </em>2 Md.App. at 360, 234 A.2d 625; <em>Reagan v. State, </em>2 Md.App. 262, 267-68, 234 A.2d 278 (1967). However, there was no evidence adduced at trial that appellant used any threats, trickery, or force to gain entry to Carter\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>This is not a case in which appellant gained entry by a false statement that induced Carter to open the door. In other words, appellant did not claim to have a lawful objective and, \u201cupon gaining entry The] turned out to have no such lawful objective.\u201d <em>Reed, </em>316 Md. at 524, 560 A.2d 1104. Nor did appellant respond falsely to an inquiry by Carter; the victim never inquired as to who was at the door or for what purpose. Had Carter posed such an inquiry, appellant\u2019s silence might be construed as trickery of some sort. But, absent such an inquiry, Carter did not engage in fraud merely because he stood silent while knocking.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\"><em>Oken, </em>327 Md. 628, 612 A.2d 258, is instructive. There, the State claimed that the defendant committed a constructive breaking in connection with the first degree murder of Dawn Garvin, whose body was found in her apartment. <em>Id. </em>at 634-35, 612 A.2d 258. Witnesses testified that, on several prior occasions, Oken had attempted to gain entry to residences by fraudulently representing to the occupants that he needed to use the telephone. <em>Id. </em>at 662, 612 A.2d 258. And, on one occasion, Oken stopped a woman by posing as a policeman. <em>Id. </em>The State argued that, based on this evidence, \u201cthe jury could have reasonably inferred that Oken employed a similar ruse to gain entry to Dawn Garvin\u2019s apartment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Oken claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>that the evidence was insufficient in regard to the burglary. <em>Id. </em>at 661, 612 A.2d 258. The Court of Appeals agreed, concluding that the record was \u201ccompletely devoid of any evidence showing a breaking, either actual or constructive, of Dawn Garvin\u2019s apartment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 663, 612 A.2d 258. Therefore, it reversed Oken\u2019s burglary conviction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\"><em>Spence v. State, </em>51 Md.App. 359, 362, 443 A.2d 648 (1982), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>296 Md. 416, 463 A.2d 808 (1983), is also illuminating. In that case, the victim testified that he was at home with his family when, at about 10:15 p.m., his son opened the door in response to a knock. <em>Id. </em>at 360, 443 A.2d 648. Two strangers entered the apartment; one remained by the door while the other, the appellant, went into the living room. <em>Id. </em>This Court held that the defendant\u2019s \u201cmumbling to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>gain entrance to the apartment\u201d constituted \u201can artifice or fraud within the meaning of <em>Brooks.\u201d Id. </em>at 362, 443 A.2d 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Under the circumstances of this case, we cannot conclude that appellant\u2019s silence while knocking on Carter\u2019s door amounted to the kind of trickery or fraud that supports a finding of constructive breaking. Moreover, the State has not provided us with any authority to support its claim that Holland\u2019s illicit purpose or motive in knocking on Carter\u2019s door, standing alone, constituted a constructive breaking. Accordingly, we shall reverse appellant\u2019s first degree burglary conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to strike the testimony of Patrolman Daniel Franklin, who testified about a remark allegedly made by appellant upon arrest. Although the defense did not request the statement in discovery, appellant maintains that his statement to Franklin was exculpatory and thus should have been disclosed as \u201cmandatory discovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">The State maintains that the issue is not preserved, because appellant failed to object to the testimony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Even if preserved, the State contends that the issue lacks merit. We agree with the State that the contention is not preserved because appellant did not timely object. The following exchange at trial is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Did you have an occasion to be at the police station when the Defendant was interviewed or served with a warrant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-10\">[PATROLMAN FRANKLIN]: Yes I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: Could you tell the Court what if anything the Defendant said or what response he had with regard to that process?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">[PATROLMAN FRANKLIN]: When he was given his copy of the warrant after it had been served, I believe he was reviewing the charges with his mother and in a louder voice than the rest he had been talking [sic], he said assault, I didn\u2019t assault that man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay, did he make any other statement that you can ... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">[PATROLMAN FRANKLIN]: He didn\u2019t make anything else that I could understand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">As the above exchange reflects, appellant\u2019s counsel did not object to the direct testimony. Then, on cross-examination, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Did you talk to Mr. Taylor about the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-10\">[PATROLMAN FRANKLIN]: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-11\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay and did he identify</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-13\">THE COURT: Outside the scope?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-14\">[PROSECUTOR]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-15\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-16\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Did you take any notes or include this statement by Sam Holland in a police report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1S\">[PATROLMAN FRANKLIN]: Did I put it in a police report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-17\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Yes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-18\">[PATROLMAN FRANKLIN]: No. I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AB_\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Did Officer Conneely?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdK\">[PATROLMAN FRANKLIN]: I\u2019m unsure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcK\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>[PATROLMAN FRANKLIN]: It\u2019s not my report.

It\u2019s Officer Conneely\u2019s report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0J\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: No further questions, Your Honor although I would move to strike the statement as not previously provided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">As we have shown, appellant\u2019s counsel did not object when the question was posed by the State or when the answer was provided. Therefore, the contention is waived. <em>See Bruce v. State, </em>328 Md. 594, 627-30, 616 A.2d 392 (1992) (stating that an objection must be made when question is asked or, if objectionable material comes in unexpectedly in answer, then at that time by motion to strike), <em>cert. denied, </em>508 U.S. 963, 113 S.Ct. 2936, 124 L.Ed.2d 686 (1993); <em>Williams v. State, </em>99 Md.App. 711, 718, 639 A.2d 180 (1994) (noting that because an objection was not immediately made, issue was not preserved for review), <em>aff'd, </em>344 Md. 358, 686 A.2d 1096 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Even if the issue had been preserved, we would agree with the trial court\u2019s ruling. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">At trial, appellant\u2019s counsel argued that Md. Rule 4-263(a)(2) required mandatory disclosure of information regarding appellant\u2019s statement, even without a defense request, because it was made to a State agent, Patrolman Franklin, and the content was exculpatory. The trial court found that appellant\u2019s statement was made to his mother, in the presence of a State agent. Further, it determined that appellant\u2019s statement was not exculpatory or mitigating. Therefore, the court ruled that the State was not obligated to produce the statement in discovery in the absence of a request, and appellant made no such request.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Appellant renews his contentions on appeal. In our view, they lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">Maryland Rule 4-263 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">Discovery and inspection in circuit court shall be as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak_\">(a) <em>Disclosure without request. </em>Without the necessity of a request, the State\u2019s Attorney shall furnish to the defendant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>(1) Any material or information tending to negate or mitigate the guilt or punishment of the defendant as to the offense charged;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">(2) Any relevant material or information regarding: (A) specific searches and seizures, wire tapes or eavesdropping, (B) the acquisition of statements made by the defendant to a State agent that the State intends to use at a hearing or trial, and (C) pretrial identification of the defendant by a witness for the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">(b) <em>Disclosure upon request. </em>Upon request of the defendant, the State\u2019s Attorney shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">(2) Statements of the defendant. As to all statements made by the defendant to a State agent that the State intends to use at a hearing or trial, furnish to the defendant, but not file unless the court so orders: (A) a copy of each written or recorded statement, and (B) the substance of each oral statement and a copy of all reports of each oral statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABI\">As we noted, the court found that appellant\u2019s statement was made to his mother. That finding was not clearly erroneous. And, a statement made to a non-state agent is not within the scope of Maryland Rule 4-263(b)(2). <em>See Jennings v.

The court did not err in finding that the statement was inculpatory. Indeed, we agree with the State that \u201cHolland would have had a better argument that his statement was exculpatory if he had stated that he was not involved at all in the commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>of the crime rather than isolate certain conduct in the list of various acts which he believed he did not do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\u201cEvidence is considered material, and relief is therefore appropriate, if \u2018there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.

Relying on <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978), appellant argued that the affidavit in support of the search warrant, signed by PFC Conneely and Sgt. George W. Bacorn Jr., was \u201cmisleading,\u201d and the affiants intentionally or recklessly omitted key information. Specifically, appellant complained: (1) the affidavit did not disclose that Carter and Taylor were unable to see the suspect\u2019s full face because it was covered by the hood of his parka; (2) the affidavit did not reveal that neither Carter nor Taylor identified appellant as the assailant during a photo array; (3) the affiants falsely \u201cstated that a positive identification of the defendant was made by a witness to the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AfP\">The court denied the suppression motion, and appellant now complains about that ruling. In appellant\u2019s view, the officers omitted the \u201ccrucial facts that the robbery suspect\u2019s face was not seen by the witnesses and that both witnesses failed to pick the defendant out of the photo arrays----\u201d Further, he argues that if the disputed information had been included in the search warrant, it would not have established probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>The court held an evidentiary motion hearing on July 10, 2002, at which appellant\u2019s counsel called PFC Conneely as his only witness. He also offered into evidence the affidavit and warrant application, as well as the officer\u2019s police report and an evidence inventory form of the items seized in the search. The State did not present any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">In the affidavit, PFC Conneely and Sgt. Bacom averred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">On March 3, 2002 at approximately 6:30 PM, your Affiant responded to the residence located at 105 North Fifth Street Denton, Caroline County, MD in reference to a reported Attempted Armed Robbery. Your Affiant spoke with the victim, William Carter, who stated that an unknown African American male had entered Carter\u2019s apartment, without knocking or being invited, displayed a black in color handgun and demanded money. Carter stated that his roommate, Edward Henry Taylor, exited the back bedroom of the apartment at which time the suspect fled the residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">Carter described the suspect as an African American male, dark complexion, approximately five feet four inches tall, wearing a dark colored hooded parka having fur around the outside edge of the hood. Carter stated that he observed the suspect standing on the sidewalk at the corner of North Fifth Street and Gay Street just prior to the incident. Taylor confirmed all of the information that Carter provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">Your Affiant is familiar with an African American male, Samuel Marcel Holland, from previous police contacts, the most recent being January 29, 2002. Holland closely resembles the physical description as given by Carter and Taylor. Your Affiant has observed, on numerous occasions, Holland wearing a coat similar to that described by Carter and Taylor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-9\">On March 4, 2002 your Affiant again spoke with Taylor. Taylor advised that on the night of the incident he observed your Affiant speaking with a group of individuals on the front porch of 106 North Fifth Street, one of which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Samuel Holland. Taylor further advised that the suspect was one of the individuals that your Affiant spoke with at 106 North Fifth Street. Taylor described the suspect as an African American male wearing all dark clothing. Your Affiant observed that no one on the porch was wearing all dark clothing except Samuel Holland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">Samuel Holland resides at 515 Lincoln Street Denton, Caroline County, MD. Your Affiant and your Co-Affiant, through their training knowledge and experience, know that perpetrators of the crime of Armed Robbery often conceal the weapons used in that robbery at their places of residence. Your Affiant and your Co-Affiant also know that clothing worn during such crimes is kept at the perpetrators [sic] residence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">PFC Conneely testified that he conducted the investigation of the attempted robbery of Carter, which began on March 3, 2002. He learned that the suspect was in the victim\u2019s apartment for a brief time. Mr. Carter told the officer that the suspect demanded money and showed Mr. Carter part of a gun, which Mr. Carter believed was real. The officer recalled that Mr. Carter described the suspect as an African-American male with a dark complexion, about \u201cfive (5) feet, four (4) inches tall and wearing a dark colored hooded parka with fur around the edge of the hood.\u201d Because the hood of the parka was up, the witness reported that the suspect\u2019s face was partially covered. Therefore, Carter said he only saw the upper part of the suspect\u2019s face, including his nose and eyes. No estimate of age or weight was provided. According to the officer, Taylor provided a similar description.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">That night, PFC Conneely compiled a photo array which included appellant\u2019s photograph. The officer showed the photo array to both Mr. Carter and Mr. Taylor. He acknowledged that neither witness identified the assailant in the array.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">After Conneely showed the photo array to Carter and Taylor, he spoke to appellant\u2019s mother, Ms. Robinson, and told her that her son had not been identified from the photo array. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>The conversation with appellant\u2019s mother took place on the porch at 106 North Fifth Street. Other family members, including appellant, were present. At that time, Mr. Taylor saw the individuals on the porch, but the officer did not know that Mr. Taylor was watching.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">PFC Conneely further testified that Mr. Taylor contacted Officer Franklin the next day, and PFC Conneely re-interviewed him. Taylor told the officer that the person standing on the far south part of the porch, wearing dark clothing, was the person who had attempted to rob Carter. Specifically, Taylor told the officer that \u201cthe guy who pulled the gun out was the guy on the porch with you [i.e., with Officer Conneely] that night wearing black.\u201d PFC Conneely identified that person as appellant, because he was the only individual wearing black. Moreover, the officer testified that the porch was approximately fifty feet from the residence of Mr. Carter and Mr. Taylor at 105 North Fifth Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The officer conceded that the case turned on identification. Yet, he acknowledged that the affidavit did not disclose that neither of the witnesses had seen the suspect\u2019s entire face, because the suspect\u2019s face was partially covered by the hood of his parka. Nor did it disclose that the witnesses failed to identify appellant in the photo array. The officer also acknowledged that the affidavit indicated that appellant was identified as the one who committed the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The following testimony is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Now at that point, at this point, the case is a case of identification isn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">[PFC CONNEELY]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: There\u2019s, they don\u2019t really see the face right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-10\">[PFC CONNEELY]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-11\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: You know, the identification is only by the type of clothing worn and they don\u2019t pick him out of the line up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-12\">[PFC CONNEELY]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Now, but what you tell the Judge is you got a description, it matches, it generally matches Sam Holland and you tell the Judge that Mr. Taylor affirmatively pointed him out as the one who committed the robbery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">[PFC CONNEELY]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: But you didn\u2019t tell the Judge that both Mr. Carter and Mr. Taylor failed to pick Sam Holland out of two photo arrays each?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">[PFC CONNEELY]: No, that\u2019s not in the warrant, in the application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And you don\u2019t tell the Judge that this perpetrator, the suspect\u2019s face was covered up to the nose?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-9\">[PFC CONNEELY]: No, I don\u2019t see it anywhere in here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: You don\u2019t tell him that the suspect had the hood of the parka up on his head at the time of the robbery?

Conneely responded that the witnesses must have seen the suspect\u2019s face \u201cif they pointed the guy out as being the one.... \u201d The following colloquy ensued on re-direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-16\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay and I asked you, well, was, did they see his face, you said I don\u2019t know, they didn\u2019t say one way or the other?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-17\">[PFC CONNEELY]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay did they say one way or the other did they not, I mean let\u2019s lock this in, yes or no?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">[PFC CONNEELY]: I don\u2019t recollect, it\u2019s not in my report that they did see his face, so they did not say ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWi\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Did they say anything ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvY\">[PFC CONNEELY]: ... from that point that they had seen his face when he was standing on the corner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVN\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: They didn\u2019t say it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">[PFC CONNEELY]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay well then why when the prosecutor asked you, you know, the victim saw his face twice, you said yes, when did they see his face twice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxZ\">[PFC CONNEELY]: They must have seen it twice if they pointed the guy out as being the one, he saw it somewhere else before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay so one time is when he sees him on the porch?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-9\">[PFC CONNEELY]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And he saw his face?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-11\">[PFC CONNEELY]: (No audible response.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYR\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And you\u2019re concluding that he must have seen the face one time prior to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-12\">[PFC CONNEELY]: The State\u2019s Attorney had asked me if he was seen prior to the incident and the answer is yes and that is in my report. Prior to the incident he was seen. Now I don\u2019t know if he actually saw his face but the suspect was seen before the incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-13\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay so you don\u2019t know whether he saw his face, isn\u2019t the face a very important part of identifying somebody?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-14\">[PFC CONNEELY]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-15\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay and the way that he described the guy on the corner prior to the incident was that he was wearing a parka?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-16\">[PFC CONNEELY]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: He didn\u2019t give any, they didn\u2019t indicate that they saw his face?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-4\">[PFC CONNEELY]: They didn\u2019t indicate one way or the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">At the end of the testimony, appellant\u2019s attorney argued that PFC Conneely acted with reckless disregard by omitting from the affidavit facts relevant to the identification of the suspect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">Okay, the eyewitness I.D.\u2019ed [appellant]. But the eyewitnesses apparently didn\u2019t see his face because it was half covered and then this, and then the hood covered the rest of his head. The eyewitness didn\u2019t pick him out of two photo arrays. Actually both I.D.\u2019s, eyewitnesses. That he was standing a distance away from Mr. Holland when he did I.D. him. And when you haven\u2019t seen a person\u2019s face it\u2019s very difficult to I.D. someone and that I.D. by Mr. Taylor which is the basis of the probable cause, it doesn\u2019t rise to the level of probable cause given the rest of the facts that were not put in by the officers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">Denying appellant\u2019s suppression motion, the court reasoned: The contention by the Defendant in effect is that the State has to try their case up front, that they\u2019ve got to convince a judge beyond a reasonable doubt up front that all the identifications are valid, that they will be able to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of twelve people on a jury. Then they\u2019ll never get a search warrant and that simply is not the law, never has been. It is not uncommon at all for people who wore ski masks in robberies to be arrested on probable cause, similar situations as this or to have their houses searched. It is also not uncommon for people to be arrested based on videotapes which are not clear even to juries later on when you try the case right here in this courtroom or on televisions or anything else. You say, well, you know, the person ... that was robbed or in the video store or the undercover officer says this is the person right there, I saw it. Most courts and decisions I\u2019ve ever seen said that\u2019s sufficient probable cause, eyewitness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>fingering, identification, whatever you want, is sufficient to get the ball rolling. It may not later be sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt to that the person [sic] charged is in fact guilty and most of the points that [defense counsel] has made will certainly be presented, I am sure, when and if the case is tried.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">So I\u2019m not going to require police officers to also put in applications for statement of charges any exculpatory information they may have that ... let\u2019s suppose one of these people identified somebody else, how do we know that [the issuing judge] would have said, oh well, if that\u2019s the case, then obviously I\u2019m not going to issue a search warrant. If I was a judge and they presented that to me, I would say, I\u2019ll tell you what you guys do, I\u2019m signing this search warrant but I want you to go get another search warrant for the guy that they did identify and we\u2019ll search both houses and hopefully we won\u2019t find the same items in both places but we will find them in one and that will help prove who it is. Same way with fingerprints and other things like that. <em>You don\u2019t have to try your case up front, that\u2019s never been required. </em>It\u2019s a small town. I essentially would say to you this, if [the issuing judge] was here now and we gave him the police report and you said it\u2019s an application that he\u2019d still issue the warrant. I would. <em>The fact that there\u2019s these exculpatory things in here doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s an unreasonable search of Mr. Holland\u2019s place to go in and look for these items, </em>some of which I guess they found. So that\u2019s the reason why the motion to suppress the items listed on Exhibit No. 1 is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>Mapp v.

We said in <em>West </em>that \u201c[rjeviewing courts (at the suppression hearing level or at the appellate level) do not undertake <em>de novo </em>review of the magistrate\u2019s probable cause determination but, rather, pay \u2018great deference\u2019 to that determination\u201d (quoting <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 236, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 ... (1983)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">To effectuate the preference for warrants, great deference is accorded to the issuing judge\u2019s determination. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 236, 103 S.Ct. 2317; <em>see McDonald v.

But, wholly eonclusory statements in a warrant application ordinarily will not suffice. <em>See Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 239, 103 S.Ct. 2317 (citing <em>Nathanson v. United States, </em>290 U.S. 41, 54 S.Ct. 11, 78 L.Ed. 159 (1933) and <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964)). Moreover, the issuing judge should not function as a mere \u201c \u2018rubber stamp for the police.\u2019 \u201d <em>Grimm v.

To the contrary, there are limits \u201cbeyond which a magistrate may not venture in issuing a warrant\u201d, <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 239, 103 S.Ct. 2317, and \u201c[djeference to the magistrate ... is not boundless.\u201d <em>United States v.

This means that we must determine if the judge who issued the search warrant had \u201ca substantial basis for concluding that the evidence sought would be discovered in the place described in the application and its affidavit.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>330 Md. at 326, 624 A.2d 492; <em>see Massachusetts v. Upton, </em>466 U.S. 727, 728, 104 S.Ct. 2085, 80 L.Ed.2d 721 (1984) (reiterating that \u201cthe task of a reviewing court is not to conduct a <em>de nmo </em>determination of probable cause, but only to determine whether there is substantial evidence in the record supporting the magistrate\u2019s decision to issue a warrant\u201d); <em>McDonald, </em>347 Md. at 467, 701 A.2d 675; <em>Birchead, </em>317 Md. at 701, 566 A.2d 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">As we noted, appellant\u2019s challenge rests on <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978). In that case, the Supreme Court carved out an exception to the \u201cfour corners\u201d review of a warrant application. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak8\">[Wjhere the defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit, and if the allegedly false <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause, the Fourth Amendment requires that a hearing be held at the defendant\u2019s request. In the event that at that hearing the allegation of perjury or reckless disregard is established by the defendant by a preponderance of the evidence, and, with the affidavit\u2019s false material set to one side, the affidavit\u2019s remaining content is insufficient to establish probable cause, the search warrant must be voided and the fruits of the search excluded to the same extent as if probable cause was lacking on the fact of the affidavit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-5\"><em>Franks, </em>438 U.S. at 155-56, 98 S.Ct. 2674. <em>Franks </em>applies to omissions as well as misstatements. <em>Wilson v. State, </em>87 Md.App. 659, 667, 591 A.2d 524, <em>cert. denied, </em>324 Md. 325, 597 A.2d 422 (1991); <em>Yeagy, </em>63 Md.App. at 8, 491 A.2d 1199.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">In <em>McDonald v. State, supra, </em>347 Md. at 471-72 n. 11, 701 A.2d 675, the Court of Appeals elucidated the process that attends a <em>Franks </em>hearing. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-7\">In fact, <em>Franks v. Delaware </em>set out a procedure, requiring a detailed proffer from the defense before the defendant is even entitled to a hearing to go behind the four corners of the warrant. Under <em>Franks, </em>when a defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that the affiant intentionally or recklessly included false statements in the supporting affidavit for a search warrant, and that the affidavit without the false statement is insufficient to support a finding of probable cause, the defendant is then entitled to a hearing on the matter. The burden is on the defendant to establish knowing or reckless falsity by a preponderance of the evidence before the evidence will be suppressed. Negligence or innocent mistake resulting in false statements in the affidavit is not sufficient to establish the defendant\u2019s burden. <em>Id. </em>at 171-72, 98 S.Ct. at 2684-85....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">More recently, Judge Moylan, writing for this Court in <em>Fitzgerald v. State, </em>153 Md.App. 601, 638-39, 837 A.2d 989 (2003), reiterated that Maryland has steadfastly adhered to the \u201cfour comers\u201d doctrine. <em>Id. </em>at 638-39, 837 A.2d 989. Therefore, under <em>Franks, </em>a defendant must make \u201ca threshold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>showing that a governmental affiant has perjured himself on a material matter____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 638, 837 A.2d 989. And, unless that threshold showing is met, \u201cthere will be no witnesses called.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Accordingly, to challenge a misstatement or an omission in an affidavit based on <em>Franks, </em>the accused must make a substantial \u201cpreliminary showing,\u201d by a preponderance of evidence, that the alleged omission was made intentionally or with reckless disregard for accuracy. A showing of negligent or innocent mistakes will not suffice. <em>Connelly v. State, </em>322 Md. 719, 727, 589 A.2d 958 (1991); <em>Yeagy, </em>63 Md.App. at 8, 491 A.2d 1199. Rather, the omissions or misstatements must be material. As the <em>Yeagy </em>Court said, \u201c \u2018[a] magistrate cannot adequately determine the existence of probable cause with the requisite judicial neutrality and independence if the police provide him or her with a false, misleading, or partial statement of the relevant facts ... but we will not invalidate a search warrant unless the omissions were material.\u2019 \u201d <em>Yeagy, </em>63 Md.App. at 8, 491 A.2d 1199 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Only when this threshold burden is met by the defendant does the court conduct an evidentiary taint hearing. It must determine whether probable cause would exist based on the affidavit if the information improperly included were excised or, conversely, whether probable cause remains if the omitted information were deemed included. If probable cause would no longer exist, then the search warrant will be invalidated and the evidence obtained pursuant to the warrant will be suppressed. <em>Franks, </em>438 U.S. at 156, 98 S.Ct. 2674.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">In this case, the motion court proceeded to the taint hearing. Accordingly, appellant obtained the relief contemplated by <em>Franks; </em>he was not confined to the four corners of the affidavit in arguing that the affidavit did not establish probable cause. Upon hearing the evidence, the trial court disagreed that the affiants made deliberate or reckless material omissions in the affidavit. Moreover, and significantly, even if the disputed information had been included, the court was of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>the view that there was probable cause to issue the search warrant. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Although the affiants omitted information that certainly was relevant at trial, and the affiants could have been more forthcoming in regard to their affidavit, the court was entitled to conclude that the affiants did not purposefully act to mislead the issuing judge, nor did they act with reckless disregard in omitting the information from the affidavit. Con-neely testified that he merely included information he believed to be relevant to a finding of probable cause for the search warrant, but did not deliberately omit damaging information in the affidavit. More important, even if the disputed information had been included, the court was quite satisfied that the affidavit would have established probable cause. We perceive no error in regard to that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CAROLINE COUNTY REVERSED AS TO THE BURGLARY CONVICTION BUT AFFIRMED IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS.
