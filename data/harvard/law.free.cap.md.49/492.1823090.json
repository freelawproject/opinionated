Held :</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b504-6\">That the testimony taken in this case had the same effect as if the defendants had appeared and answered, and it not appearing from the record that any objection to the evidence in this case was taken by the appellants in the Court' below, no such objection could be considered by the Court of Appeals.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b504-7\">Appeal from the Circuit Court for Washington County, in Equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-8\">On the 22nd of July, 1876, the appellee filed her bill of complaint to foreclose a mortgage against the appellants, and the proper parties were made defendants.

After the lapse of nine months less one day, the defendants appealed from the said decree.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>The cause was argued before Bartol, C.

Unauthenticated copies are often offered in evidence by consent, or if not offered by consent, and the objection had been made at the proper time, it could easily have been obviated.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">It is no answer to say the defendants were not in Court to make the objection. They had been summoned and it was their business to have been there, or take the consequences of their own default.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">For these reasons the decree below will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">\n<em>Decree affirmed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
