A demurrer to the indictment, and a motion in arrest of judgment, were successively overruled; and after judgment entered upon the verdict of guilty the case was brought before this Court as upon writ of error, the traverser alleging that the indictment was fatally defective, 1st, because it did not aver that the furnace and boiler \u2022used in so carrying on the said offensive trade were located near a <em>public </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>' road or high way,or at any place where the public had any right or interest; 2nd, that what was charged amounted to nothing more than a private nuisance for which an indictment would not lie.

The law, as we contend, is, if the acts com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>plained of affect only the rights of an individual, or of a definite number of individuals, it is a <em>private </em>nuisance ; and the several persons actually injured have their remedy by private action.

J., said that the'word \u201c highway \u201d -was the <em>genus o\u00ed </em>all public ways for carts, horsemen and footmen. A common street, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>therefore, is a public highway. <em>City of Cincinnati vs. White, </em>6 <em>Peters, </em>438; <em>Angell on Highways, Ed. </em>1857, <em>secs. </em>24, 25; 2 <em>Dillon on Municipal Corporations, 2nd Ed., sec. </em>538; <em>Common Council vs. Croas, </em>7 <em>Indiana, </em>12; <em>State vs. Mathis, </em>21 <em>Ind., </em>278; <em>State vs. Duncan, </em>1 <em>McCord, </em>404. As a street is a highway, the first objection stated in the petition of the traverser falls to the ground. But it is submitted that the use of the word \u201c road,\u201d without designating such road as a \u201c public road,\u201d was sufficient. It has been seen that, under our Code of Laws, the word \u201c road \u201d imports a \u201c public road.\u201d In the statute law of the State of New York, the word i\u00a3 road \u201d is used in the same large sense. <em>Fowler vs. Lansing, </em>9 <em>Johns., </em>349; <em>Griffin vs. Martins, </em>7 <em>Barb., N.

It may very well be that a large number of houses may be rendered untenantable on account of the proximity of a noxious factory, which houses may be in a settlement near to which no highway <em>or public </em>road leads. And so we find, that though, as a general thing, the draftsmen of indictments for nuisances include the allega-tion that the source of it is near to a highway, in addition to the allegation that it is near to the dwelling houses of divers of the inhabitants there residing, yet this is not always so. <em>King vs. Davey, </em>5 <em>Esp., </em>217; <em>Prescott\u2019s Case, </em>2 <em>City Hall Recorder, </em>161; <em>Com. vs. Ashbrook, </em>1 <em>Bush, (Ky.,) </em>139; <em>Hackney vs. State, </em>8 <em>Indiana, </em>495; <em>Rex vs. Cross, </em>2 <em>Car. &amp; P., </em>483; <em>Rex vs. Neil, </em>2 <em>Car. &amp; P., </em>485; <em>Wood\u2019s Law of Nuisance, </em>21, 30, 83; <em>Comm. vs. Upton, </em>6 <em>Gray, </em>473.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-7\">We have seen <em>(Rex vs. White &amp; Ward, </em>1 <em>Burr., </em>337, and <em>Rex vs. Pappineau, </em>2 <em>Strange, </em>686,) that whether the neighborhood is sufficiently populous to make the nuisance a public one, as contradistinguished from <em>a private </em>one, is a question of <em>fact </em>for the jury, and not a question of pleading upon the indictment. 1 <em>Russell on </em>Cr.,319; <em>Roscoe Cr. Ev., </em>791.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-8\">It is not at all necessary to allege' that the neighborhood is a <em>populous </em>one, as seems to be supposed by the appellant judging from the reasons assigned in his petition for the writ of error. Nor will any form of indictment, as given in the leading text books, be found to contain any such averment. The language used in this indictment to aver that this furnace and boiler were a nuisance, because of their proximity to, and effect upon the persons\u2019 <em>dwelling </em>in the neighborhood, has been directly judged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>to be sufficient. The language is, \u201c near unto the dwelling houses of <em>divers </em>liege inhabitants of the State of Maryland, there situate and being.\u201d See <em>Form, Arch. Cr. Pl., </em>889, 890. This also given in 2 <em>Bishop\u2019s Or. Procedure, sec. </em>820. The words <em>\u201cdivers inhabitants\u201d arc </em>sufficient. 2 <em>Bishop\u2019s Cr.

The defendant demurred to the indictment, and the demurrer was overruled; and, upon plea of not guilty, the defendant was tried, and found guilty by verdict of a jury. He then made a motion in arrest, of judgment, and that was overruled ; and after judgment entered upon the verdict, the cause was brought here as upon writ of error, and the errors assigned are certain alleged defects in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">It is charged in the indictment that the defendant, \u201cnear unto divers roads and streets, and also near unto the dwelling-houses of <em>divers </em>liege inhabitants of the State, there situate and being, unlawfully and injuriously did use, and yet doth continue to use, a certain furnace and boiler, for the purpose of boiling the skins, hoofs, tripe, entrails and offal of beasts, before that time, &amp;c., and unlawfully and injuriously did boil, &amp;c., divers large quantities of skins, hoofs, tripe, and other parts and offal of beasts, by reason of which said premises, divers noisome, offensive and unwholesome smokes, smells and stenches, during the time, &amp;c., were from thence emitted and issued, so that the air then and there was, and yet is greatly filled and impregnated with the said smokes, smells and stenches, and was, and is rendered, and become, and was and is corrupted, offensive, uncomfortable, and unwholesome, to the great damage and common nuisance of all the liege inhabitants of the State, there inhabiting, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>being and residing, and going and returning, and passing through the roads and highways.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AGY\">The objection taken to this indictment is, that it does not aver that the furnace and boiler were located near a <em>public </em>road or - highway, or at any place where the public have any right or interest, and consequently, what' is charged amounts to' nothing more than a private nuisance, for which no indictment lies. And whether the indictment does sufficiently charge a public offence is the sole question in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">And before stating what constitutes the elements of the offence, it may be proper to state, that, as a general proposition, every indictment must charge the crime of which the party is accused with such certainty and precision that it may be understood without the resort to intendments, and that all the elements to constitute the offence must be averred. This is important not only as means of notice to the accused, but as means of identification of the particular accusation, with a view to future protection against a second prosecution for the same offence.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">This being the general rule in framing the indictment, let us see of what the crime consists, for which the defendant is indicted. -</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">And it will be found, upon examination of the authorities, tfiat there has been considerable difficulty experienced, in cases like the present, in determining what constitutes the public to be offended by the nuisance, and what degree of annoyance will subject the party causing it to public prosecution. In determining these questions, reference must always be had to the local situation of the nuisance complained of; and where the trade or business producing the alleged nuisance is in itself lawful, before it can be declared a nuisance, it must be shown to be in such proximity to public ways, or other places of public resort, as to be offensive to those passing or resorting to such places, or that it seriously incommodes the people generally in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>neighborhood,or community where the trade is carried on. If, therefore, a party carry on an offensive trade or manufacture in a settled neighborhood, or near places of usual public resort or travel, whether the offence be to the sight, smell or hearing, it constitutes a nuisance, and subjects the party producing it to indictment and prosecution. And in conformity to this general doctrine we find the law laid down by <em>BawJcins, </em>in his <em>Pleas of the Oroion, vol. </em>1, <em>Bk. </em>1, <em>ch. </em>32, <em>sec. </em>10, where it is stated that a brew-house, erected in such an inconvenient place, wherein the business cannot be carried on without greatly <em>incommoding the neighborhood, </em>may be indicted as a common nuisance ; and so in the like case may a glass-house or swine-yard. So, in the case of <em>Rex vs. Smith, </em>2 <em>Str., </em>704, where the defendant was indicted for making great noises in the night with a speaking-trumpet, to the disturbance of the neighborhood, it was held to be a nuisance, and the party was convicted and fined. So, again, in <em>Rex vs. Pappineau, </em>2 Str., 686, an indictment charging a nuisance to consist in working a mill for steeping sheep-skins in water, near a highway, and also near several dwelling-houses, whereby the air was corrupted, was held to be sufficient. And in the case of <em>Rex vs. White &amp; Ward, </em>1 <em>Burr., </em>333, buildings for making acid spirit of sulphur, whereby the air was impregnated with noisome and offensive stenches, near the King\u2019s highway, and near several dwelling-houses, were declared to be a nuisance; and it was also held, that it is not necessary that the smell should be unwholesome.; it is enough if it renders the enjoyment of life and property uncomfortable. These cases have never been overruled, nor even questioned, so far as wre have been able to discover; and the doctrine maintained by them would seem to be founded both in principle and reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">In this case the specific objection urged to the indictment is, that it does not charge the offence as having been committed against the public; that charging the source <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>of the nuisance to exist \u201c near unto divers roads and streets, and also near unto the dwelling-houses of <em>divers </em>inhabitants of the State there situate and being,\u201d is not sufficient, according to the argument for the defendant, to bring the case within the definition of a common nuisance. But in this we cannot agree with the counsel for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">As we have seen, it is sufficient to lay the nuisance to that portion of the general public that may pass and re-pass on the public highways, or to that portion of the public that may resort to any other public place to which any considerable number of people are in - the habit of resorting. <em>Wood, L. Nuis., p. </em>30, <em>sec. </em>20. This we do not understand to be controverted by the defendant. But it is insisted that the terms <em>roads and </em>streets, used in the indictment, should not be taken as descriptive of public roads and streets, but should be taken to mean private roads and streets, inasmuch as the statute law of the State recognizes and provides for opening private ways. Such construction, however, we do not feel justified in adopting. The noun \u201c road,\u201d according to legal definition, means a passage through the country for the use of the people. 2 <em>Bouv. L. Dic., </em>488. The ordinary and accepted meaning <em>of </em>the term is a way for public travel, unless qualified by the adjective \u201cprivate,\u201d or some other qualifying expression. <em>Respublica vs. Arnold, </em>3 <em>Yeates, </em>421. And so as to the noun \u201c street.\u201d That term is defined to mean a public thoroughfare or highway in a city or village. 2 <em>Bouv. L. Dic., </em>549, 551; 4 <em>Sergt. &amp; R., </em>106. Taking then these terms as meaning public ways or thoroughfares, the nuisance is sufficiently charged, according to all authority and precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Bu1 it is also charged that the nuisance complained of is \u201c near unto the dwelling-houses of <em>divers </em>inhabitants of the State, there situate and being ;\u201d and at the conclusion of the indictment the nuisance is alleged to be \u201cto the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>great damage and common nuisance of all the liege inhabitants of the \u00a1State, there inhabiting, being and residing, and going and returning, and passing through the roads and highways.\u201d It is true, this latter or concluding allegation, will not supply any defects in the preceding parts of the indictment. There must be sufficient facts charged in the body of the indictment to justify the .conclusion. <em>Whart. Cr. L., sec. </em>2362; 2 <em>Bish. Cr. Pro., sec. </em>812; <em>Mains vs. State, </em>42 <em>Ind., </em>327. But the allegation that the nuisance existed near the dwelling-houses of <em>divers </em>inhabitants of the State there being, would seem to be sufficient. In the case of <em>Rex vs. Crunden, </em>2 <em>Camp., </em>89, where the defendant was indicted for exposing himself naked while bathing on the sea-beach, the indictment contained two counts, as we find it in 2 <em>Chitty Cr. L., </em>41; the first charging that the defendant exposed himself naked near to and in front of <em>divers </em>houses, and also near to a certain highway, and in the presence of <em>divers </em>persons; and the second charging only that he exposed himself naked to <em>divers </em>of the King\u2019s subjects. The party was convicted, and the indictment was held to be supported by evidence that he bathed in the sea naked opposite to the East cliff at Brighton, on which cliff there was a row of inhabited houses, from the windows of which he could have been distinctly seen, while undressed. And it fully appears from the precedents, that the allegation that the nuisance existed to the dwellings of <em>divers </em>citizens or inhabitants, is sufficient. <em>Whart. Prec., </em>(3rd <em>Ed ,) Nos. </em>706, 707, 708, 712, 719 <em>and </em>721; 2 <em>Whart. Cr. L., secs. </em>2363, 2364, 2378-9. See also, <em>Reg. vs. Watson, </em>2 <em>Cox Cr. Cas., </em>376, and <em>Reg. vs. Webb, </em>1 <em>Den. Cr. Cas., </em>338.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The indictment in the present case is very near in form to that used in the case of <em>Rex vs. White &amp; Ward, </em>1 <em>Burr., </em>633; and, in that case, in speaking of the manner of charging the nuisance, the Court said: \u201cIt is <em>sufficiently laid, </em>and in the accustomed manner. The very existence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>the nuisance depends upon the number of houses and concourse of people ; and this is a matter of fact to he judged of by the jury.\u201d</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b300-7\">(Decided 27th June, 1878.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">After careful examination of the indictment, in the light of authority and precedent, we think the oifence is sufficiently charged, and that the Court below committed no error in overruling the demurrer, and also the motion in arrest of judgment; and the judgment will therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
