ORS 426.130. The trial court found that appellant \u201cis suffering from a mental disorder, is a danger to himself and others, will not benefit from voluntary commitment and although is able to provide for his basic personal needs, outside the institutional setting is not now receiving such care as is necessary for his health or safety.\u201d Appellant contends that the trial court erred in ruling (1) that appellant was a danger to himself or others and (2) that he \u201cwas not receiving necessary care without state intervention.\u201d The state concedes both errors \u2014 that is, it agrees with appellant that the evidence is insufficient to support commitment based on danger to self or others and that \u201cthe trial court erred by, having found appellant able to meet his basic needs, nonetheless ordering him committed based on inability to meet basic needs.\u201d We agree and accept the state\u2019s concessions. <em>See State v. K. K. G., </em>267 Or App 319, 320-21, 340 P3d 735 (2014) (holding that the trial court erred in ordering appellant\u2019s involuntary commitment based on appellant \u201cnot receiving [such] care for his basic needs as is necessary for health and safety even though the trial court found him able to provide for his basic needs\u201d). Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
