Claimant argues that the board\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence or substantial reason. <em>See </em>ORS 183.482(8)(c). We disagree and, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">As we have explained, \u201c[i]n assessing the major contributing cause of a combined condition, ORS 656.005(7)(a)(B) requires \u2018a comparison of the relative contribution of the preexisting disease or condition and the work-related incident.\u2019\u201d <em>Cummings v. SAIF, </em>197 Or App 312, 318, 105 P3d 875 (2005) (quoting <em>Dietz v. Ramuda, </em>130 Or App 397, 401, 882 P2d 618 (1994), <em>rev dismissed, </em>321 Or 416 (1995)). Here, the board credited the opinions of employer\u2019s three medical experts, all of whom opined that claimant suffered from a preexisting degenerative disc disease that was the major contributing cause of the L4-5 disc herniation for which claimant required surgery following his work injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Claimant contends, however, that those opinions do not constitute substantial evidence, and that the board\u2019s decision to credit them lacks substantial reason, because employer\u2019s experts reviewed only an MRI report to evaluate claimant\u2019s preinjury condition. Claimant relies on our decision in <em>Cummings, </em>in which we remanded for the board to address an \u201capparent deficiency\u201d in the opinion of an expert who \u201cassumed\u201d and \u201csuspected\u201d that the claimant had a preexisting condition but did not review <em>any </em>preinjury records before offering an opinion that the claimant\u2019s preexisting condition was the major cause of his combined condition. 197 Or App at 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">Here, unlike in <em>Cummings, </em>employer\u2019s experts did not simply speculate about claimant\u2019s preexisting condition. The preinjury MRI report documents the nature of claimant\u2019s preexisting degenerative low back changes, including at the level of his eventual disc herniation. Although claimant argues that the experts needed to review the actual diagnostic films or preinjury chart notes to \u201creliably\u201d evaluate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>the extent of claimant\u2019s preexisting condition, neither claimant\u2019s expert nor any other evidence in the record suggests that the MRI films materially differed from the MRI report or that the MRI findings were inaccurate. On the record in this case, substantial reason supports the board\u2019s finding that the opinions of employer\u2019s experts are more persuasive than those of claimant\u2019s expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
