J.</author>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Petitioner seeks judicial review of two administrative rules of the Department of Corrections (DOC) pursuant to ORS 183.400. Petitioner argues that OAR 291-105-0069 and OAR 291-158-0065, which together allow the DOC to impose restitution as a sanction for breaching DOC rules and to withdraw money from an inmate\u2019s trust account to pay that restitution, violate various constitutional provisions and extend beyond DOC\u2019s statutory authority. As explained below, we hold that the rules are valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">DOC imposes disciplinary sanctions for various types of misconduct, including \u201cmajor violations\u201d and \u201cminor violations.\u201d OAR 291-105-0066(5) (referencing two \u201cinmate disciplinary grids\u201d that outline available sanctions for violations). Several other rules describe various requirements for imposing inmate discipline, including the inmate\u2019s right to a hearing. OAR 291-105-0056; <em>see generally </em>OAR 291-105-0021 - 291-105-0100. The first challenged rule, OAR 291-105-0069, authorizes a hearing officer to impose \u201crestitution\u201d as an \u201cadditional sanction[]\u201d for a \u201cmajor violation[]\u201d of DOC rules.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The second challenged rule, OAR 291-158-0065, authorizes DOC to apply a percentage of funds in an inmate\u2019s trust account to the inmate\u2019s indebtedness, which includes the obligation to pay restitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>We start with petitioner\u2019s argument that the rules \u201c[v]iolate[] constitutional provisions.\u201d ORS 183.400(4)(a). Petitioner\u2019s principal claim is that the challenged rules violate \u201cOregon Constitution Article I Section 10 Due Process of Law.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Petitioner argues that the rules unconstitutionally permitted DOC to \u201cgarnish\u201d funds from his inmate trust account to make restitution payments resulting from his violation of DOC rules. He points to criminal statutes related to court-ordered restitution and garnishment proceedings, and states that the DOC ordered him to pay restitution and withdrew money from his trust account even though he was not criminally convicted or subject to garnishment proceedings in court. He asserts that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-4\">\u201c[t]he challenged rules specify the hearing officer can question witnesses, (Finding of Facts shows I had 50 witnesses who were never questioned.)!,] [and] he can review video evidence (Mine was erased before we ever had a hearing. Complex 1 had a camera in the Bubble.) [.] Administrative hearing officer never considered or tried to find out if this was a unilateral assault.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Referencing the specific amounts DOC has \u201cgarnished\u201d from his trust account, petitioner also suggests that he was not provided the right \u201cto be heard\u201d before that \u201cgarnishment.\u201d DOC responds that petitioner\u2019s arguments are improper under ORS 183.400(4)(a) because he makes an \u201cas applied\u201d challenge, rather than a challenge to the rule on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">We agree with DOC. This court\u2019s review \u201c\u2018is limited to the face of the rule and the law pertinent to it.\u2019 \u201d <em>WaterWatch v. Water Resources Commission, </em>199 Or App 598, 605, 112 P3d 443 (2005) (quoting <em>AFSCME Local 2623 v. Dept. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number><em>Corrections, </em>315 Or 74, 79, 843 P2d 409 (1992)). Petitioner\u2019s assertions that the rules are invalid relate to the way DOC has applied those rules to him. That is, he claims that his due process rights were violated because of specific actions that DOC took (or failed to take) in imposing discipline. To the extent that the challenged rules relate to the administrative procedures that govern restitution orders or the withdrawal of funds from an inmate\u2019s trust account,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> petitioner\u2019s claims that those rules violated his due process rights are beyond the scope of our review under ORS 183.400(4)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Petitioner also contends that the challenged rules are beyond the \u201cauthority\u201d of DOC because those rules do not require, as a condition for ordering restitution or applying an inmate\u2019s funds to a debt, a \u201cCriminal Conviction or a Judgment docketed in the circuit court concerning garnishment proceedings.\u201d He argues that ORS 137.106 \u201crequires a criminal conviction for restitution\u201d and that ORS 18.605 \u201crequires a judgment docketed in the circuit court before garnishment proceedings can begin.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In petitioner\u2019s view, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>DOC does \u201cnot have the authority to fine or restitute inmates [their] legal property via money on their inmate accounts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">To the extent that petitioner argues that OAR 291-105-0069 and OAR 291-158-0065 \u201c[e]xceed[] the statutory authority of\u2019 DOC, ORS 183.400(4)(b), we reject petitioner\u2019s argument. Petitioner does not engage with any of the statutes cited as authority for the rules in question. ORS 423.075(5)(d), for example, provides that \u201c[t]he Director of the Department of Corrections shall *** [p]rovide for the safety of all prisoners in the custody of the department and may adopt rules for the government and administration of the department.\u201d And ORS 421.180 explains that, as part of that administration, DOC \u201cby rule shall adopt procedures to be utilized in disciplining persons committed to the physical and legal custody of the department.\u201d Without addressing those statutes or any other statutes related to DOC\u2019s disciplinary authority, petitioner points to ORS 137.106, which authorizes a trial court to award restitution to victims in criminal cases, and ORS 18.605, which provides that a creditor can invoke the authority of a court to pay a debt that is the result of a judgment. Because those statutes do not limit DOC\u2019s authority to discipline inmates, which is described in ORS 421.180 and other statutes, petitioner has not established that the challenged rules are outside the statutory authority given to DOC.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">OAR 291-105-0069 and OAR 291-158-0065 held valid.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-6\"> OAR 291-105-0069(l)(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">\u201cThe additional sanctions available to the hearings officer for major violations are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">\u201c(a) Restitution or Reimbursement: Inmates shall be responsible for making full restitution for any damage or loss of property. In addition, inmates shall be financially responsible for all costs associated with or resulting from the violation. These shall include the costs of any drug urinalysis testing. There is no limit on the amount of restitution or reimbursement which can be imposed for a major sanction. There must always be a factual basis in the record to support the restitution or reimbursement amount and that amount must be reasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b153-9\"> OAR 291-158-0065 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-10\">\u201c(1) An inmate who is indebted to the Department of Corrections for whatever reason shall be permitted to spend on commissary during the calendar month one half of the first $60 (up to $30) of funds that have been received and posted for that inmate during the calendar month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-11\">\u201c(a) The remainder of the funds received by the inmate during the calendar month shall be applied to the inmate\u2019s debt until such indebtedness is satisfied, in accordance with the procedures provided in these rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3N\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>\u201c(b) Any unused funds remaining in an inmate\u2019s trust account at the end of the last business day of the calendar month shall be applied to the inmate\u2019s indebtedness.
