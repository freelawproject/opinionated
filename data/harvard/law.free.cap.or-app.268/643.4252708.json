Defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion to dismiss the proceeding and to the trial court\u2019s decision not to offset a prior judgment that defendant had obtained against plaintiff against the restitution award. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The facts pertinent to the issues on appeal are not disputed. Defendant rented a room in a house owned by plaintiff in 2008. Defendant\u2019s monthly rent under the rental agreement was $355, with rent due \u201cmonthly in advance on the 4th day of each and every month.\u201d In 2011, conflicts developed between the parties as to their respective obligations under the rental agreement. As a result of those conflicts, defendant tendered less than the full amount of rent due under the rental agreement in February 2011; plaintiff declined to accept the tender. <em>See </em>ORS 90.417(1) (providing that \u201c[a] landlord may refuse to accept a rent tender that is for less than the full amount of rent owed or that is untimely\u201d). The next month, March 2011, defendant tendered a rent payment of $355; plaintiff accepted that payment. Each month thereafter, through the rental period starting in October 2011, defendant either tendered less than the amount of rent due<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or tendered no rent at all. Plaintiff declined to accept any partial payments of rent; as a result, defendant made no rent payments after March 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">After defendant failed to pay the rent due on October 4, 2011, plaintiff notified defendant by letter that plaintiff would terminate defendant\u2019s tenancy for nonpayment of rent and seek possession of the premises in the manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>authorized by ORS 90.394.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In accordance with the requirements of ORS 90.394, the letter stated that defendant owed a total of $2,201 in unpaid rent for the period extending from February 2011 through October 2011, excluding March 2011, and informed defendant that she had 72 hours in which to pay that amount in order to cure the nonpayment of rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">Defendant did not tender the payment of any amount of rent within the 72-hour period, and plaintiff initiated this FED proceeding to obtain possession of the premises. At the FED trial, defendant moved to dismiss. Defendant argued that plaintiff had accepted a \u201cpartial payment\u201d of the February rent within the meaning of ORS 90.417(4)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>when plaintiff accepted defendant\u2019s payment of the March rent and had, consequently, waived the right to terminate the tenancy based on defendant\u2019s nonpayment of the February rent. Defendant further asserted that dismissal was required as a result of plaintiffs alleged waiver of the right to terminate the tenancy based on the nonpayment of the February rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">The trial court rejected that argument and ultimately found that plaintiff was entitled to the premises. The court entered judgment awarding possession of the premises and $2,201 in restitution to plaintiff. In so doing, the trial court rejected defendant\u2019s request to offset against the restitution award the amount of a money judgment that defendant had obtained against plaintiff in a separate matter. The court noted that such an offset might be appropriate if the parties stipulated to it, but otherwise concluded that the offset was not required, in light of the fact that the judgments arose from separate matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">On appeal, defendant first renews her argument that the trial court was required to dismiss the proceeding in the light of the \u201cinvalid\u201d notice of intent to terminate the tenancy. She again asserts that plaintiff accepted a \u201cpartial payment of rent\u201d under ORS 90.417(4) in accepting rent for March 2011 because, at that point in time, defendant owed two months\u2019 rent and defendant paid only one month\u2019s rent. Defendant contends further that plaintiffs acceptance of that \u201cpartial payment of rent\u201d \u201cwaiv[ed] the right of the landlord to terminate the tenant\u2019s rental agreement under ORS 90.394 for nonpayment of rent,\u201d ORS 90.417(4), and that defendant is entitled to dismissal of this case as a result. In response, plaintiff asserts that defendant\u2019s March 2011 tender was not \u201ca partial payment of rent\u201d within the meaning of ORS 90.417(4), and, therefore, plaintiff did not waive the right to terminate defendant\u2019s tenancy based on her failure to pay rent in February 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">We need not resolve the parties\u2019 dispute as to whether defendant\u2019s payment of the rent in March 2011 constituted a \u201cpartial payment of rent\u201d within the meaning of ORS 90.417(4) and, therefore, a waiver of plaintiffs right to terminate for failure to pay the February rent. Even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>defendant\u2019s interpretation of that statute is correct, defendant has not presented a sufficiently developed argument as to why that interpretation would entitle defendant to <em>dismissal </em>under the circumstances of this case. Regardless of any waiver of the right to terminate the tenancy for nonpayment of rent in March 2011, plaintiff did not attempt to terminate the tenancy for nonpayment of rent at that time. Instead, plaintiff waited until October 2011 to terminate the tenancy for nonpayment of rent. At that point in time, defendant had not paid rent for seven months, and it is undisputed both that plaintiff did nothing to waive the right to terminate for nonpayment of rent based on defendant\u2019s nonpayment of rent from April through October, and that defendant made no effort to cure <em>that </em>nonpayment of rent within 72 hours of receiving the notice of intent to terminate the tenancy. That is, even if plaintiff gave up the right to terminate for nonpayment of rent in March 2011, it is undisputed that plaintiff did not give up the right to terminate for nonpayment of rent based on subsequent failures to pay rent. <em>See Reach Community Development v. Stanley, </em>248 Or App 495, 500-01, 274 P3d 211 (2012) (landlord was entitled to terminate tenancy where tenant failed to pay all accrued rent within 72 hours of receiving notice under ORS 90.394).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">As noted, defendant does not squarely address in her brief why she would be entitled to dismissal if she is correct that plaintiffs acceptance of the March 2011 rent effected a waiver of plaintiffs right to terminate for nonpayment of rent at that point in time. Instead, defendant\u2019s argument on the point consists of a single sentence: \u201cA termination notice is defective if it demands too much money.\u201d But defendant has provided us with no developed argument as to why the notice in this case demanded \u201ctoo much money\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or as to why that defect would compel dismissal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>of this proceeding under the circumstances present here. Absent a developed argument as to why dismissal would be required if defendant\u2019s interpretation of ORS 90.417 is correct, defendant has not demonstrated that the trial court committed reversible error by denying her motion to dismiss. <em>See Beall Transport Equipment Co. v. Southern Pacific, </em>186 Or App 696, 700 n 2, 64 P3d 1193, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>187 Or App 472, 68 P3d 259 (2003) (\u201cNor is it our proper function to make or develop a party\u2019s argument when that party has not endeavored to do so itself.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Defendant next asserts that the trial court erred when it declined to offset the amount of the judgment that she had obtained against plaintiff in the separate case against the amount of the restitution award in this case. However, whether to offset the competing judgments was a discretionary call for the trial court, and there is nothing in this record to suggest that the trial court\u2019s decision not to offset the judgments represented an abuse of discretion. <em>Ketcham v. Selles, </em>96 Or App 121, 124, 772 P2d 419 (1989) (\u201c[Offsetting one judgment against another is not a matter of right [.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-7\"> In June 2011, as a result of a separate court case between plaintiff and defendant, defendant\u2019s rent was reduced. From that date forward, defendant treated the reduced amount as the amount of rent owed under the parties\u2019 rental agreement. Even taking into account that reduction in defendant\u2019s monthly rent obligation, it is undisputed that for any given month from April 2011 through October 2011, defendant did not tender the full amount of rent that she owed for that particular month.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b663-5\"> ORS 90.394 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\">\u201cThe landlord may terminate the rental agreement for nonpayment of rent and take possession as provided in ORS 105.105 to 105.168, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">\u201c(1) When the tenancy is a week-to-week tenancy, by delivering to the tenant at least 72 hours\u2019 written notice of nonpayment and the landlord\u2019s intention to terminate the rental agreement if the rent is not paid within that period.

Because defendant continued to owe that amount to plaintiff, it is not obvious that it was impermissible for plaintiff to include that amount in the notice, once defendant\u2019s subsequent defaults gave plaintiff new grounds to terminate the tenancy. We do not resolve the issue, because the parties have not sufficiently addressed it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
