J.</author>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction for both second-degree assault, ORS 163.175, and third-degree assault, ORS 163.165, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s grant of the state\u2019s motion to amend the indictment in the case. Defendant contends that the trial court lacked authority to allow the amendment because the amendment added a missing element to the crime charged and was, therefore, a substantive amendment that was beyond the court\u2019s authority to allow. We conclude that the amendment was not a substantive amendment \u2014 that is, one that added a missing element to the crime charged in the original indictment\u2014 and, hence, the trial court had authority to allow it. We also reject defendant\u2019s additional assignment of error without discussion. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The pertinent facts are undisputed. In early 2010, the victim, a 19-year-old man, was walking home when a car stopped next to him. Defendant jumped out of the car holding a baseball bat and rushed toward the victim, swinging the bat at the victim\u2019s head. The victim used his arm to block the blow and then ran home. Defendant chased the victim and hit him a second time as he reached his home. Once the victim was safely inside his home, defendant smashed a window in the home and fled. The victim later discovered that his arm was broken.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">A grand jury indicted defendant. Count 1 of the indictment alleged that \u201cdefendant on or about January 19, 2010, in Washington County, Oregon, did unlawfully and intentionally cause serious physical injury to [the victim] by means of a dangerous.\u201d That allegation contained an obvious error: The prepositional phrase \u201cby means of a dangerous\u201d was incomplete, <em>viz., </em>it contained a preposition, \u201cof,\u201d and an adjective, \u201cdangerous,\u201d that did not modify any other word in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Count 1 also explicitly alleged that defendant had committed the crime of first-degree assault. That crime can be committed in four ways: (1) by causing serious physical injury by means of a deadly or dangerous weapon, (2) by causing serious physical injury to a child under six years of age, (3) by committing second-degree assault against a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>pregnant victim, or (4) by causing serious physical injury while driving under the influence of intoxicants. ORS lGS.lSSH).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Each of those theories of culpability requires the state to prove at least one fact not required by the other theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">At the close of the state\u2019s case-in-chief, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on Count 1. First, defendant argued that the indictment was legally insufficient because the failure to include the word \u201cweapon\u201d at the end of the phrase, \u201ccause [d] serious physical injury to [the victim] by means of a dangerous,\u201d meant that the indictment failed to allege an essential element of the crime charged in Count 1, <em>viz., </em>first-degree assault. In making that argument, defendant conceded that the original indictment had provided him with adequate notice of the charge notwithstanding the failure to include the word \u201cweapon\u201d in it. In response, the state moved to amend the indictment to add the word \u201cweapon\u201d after the word \u201cdangerous\u201d in Count 1. Second, defendant argued that the state had failed to present evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that the victim had suffered a serious physical injury, which the state was required to prove to convict defendant of first-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The trial court granted the state\u2019s motion to amend the indictment, but it also granted defendant\u2019s motion to acquit him of first-degree assault based on the state\u2019s failure to prove that the victim had suffered a serious physical injury. However, the trial court allowed the state to proceed on a charge of second-degree assault as a lesser-included offense of the indicted crime of first-degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>assault.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury found defendant guilty of second-degree assault, and defendant appeals the resulting judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Article VII (Amended), section 5(3), of the Oregon Constitution provides that \u201ca person shall be charged in a circuit court with the commission of any crime punishable as a felony only on indictment by a grand jury.\u201d Article VII (Amended), section 5(6), of the Oregon Constitution provides, in turn, that the \u201cdistrict attorney may file an amended indictment or information whenever, by ruling of the court, an indictment or information is held to be defective in form.\u201d An amendment that adds a missing material element to a crime charged in an indictment is a substantive amendment and not an amendment that corrects a defect in the form of the indictment. Hence, whether the court properly allowed the state to amend the indictment depends on whether the amendment added a missing material element to the crime that the indictment purported to charge in Count 1. Predictably, the parties disagree on whether the amendment added a missing element, or whether it merely corrected a defect in form.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Generally, an indictment has alleged all of the elements of a charged crime if it tracks the wording of the statute that defines the crime. <em>See, e.g., State v. Lotches, </em>331 Or 455, 466, 17 P3d 1045 (2000), <em>cert den, </em>534 US 833 (2001). If an indictment does not track the wording of the statute, the indictment is nonetheless sufficient to inform the defendant of the charge if it states \u201cthe acts constituting the offense in ordinary and concise language * * * in such a manner as to enable a person of common understanding to know what is intended.\u201d ORS 132.550(7). To determine what an indictment communicates, we examine the indictment as a whole. <em>State v. Jennings, </em>131 Or 455, 461, 282 P 560 (1929). Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>an indictment can be sustained even if an essential element or fact was communicated only by implication or context.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">For example, in <em>State v. Crampton, </em>176 Or App 62, 65, 31 P3d 430 (2001), <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Caldwell, </em>187 Or App 720, 69 P3d 830 (2003), we concluded that an indictment alleging that the defendant \u201c\u2018did unlawfully and knowingly carry concealed * * * a handgun\u2019\u201d implicitly included the allegation that the defendant lacked a permit or license to carry the concealed handgun. In that case, an officer stopped the defendant for driving with a suspended license and found several guns concealed in the defendant\u2019s car. The defendant was charged with, and convicted of, unlawful possession of a weapon, ORS 166.250. On appeal, the defendant challenged the adequacy of the indictment to charge that crime because the indictment did not explicitly allege that the defendant did not have a concealed-weapons permit. We rejected that argument because we concluded that the word \u201cunlawfully,\u201d meant \u201cwithout legal authorization or justification,\u201d and, when read in context, that word necessarily conveyed the idea that the defendant did not have a concealed-weapons permit. <em>Crampton, </em>176 Or App at 68. In other words, even though the original indictment did not expressly allege that the defendant did not have a permit, it was sufficient that the allegation was implicitly communicated by the word \u201cunlawfully.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Similarly, in <em>State v. Reynolds, </em>229 Or 167, 169, 366 P2d 524 (1961), the Oregon Supreme Court concluded that an indictment alleging that the defendant \u201c\u2018did then and there unlawfully and feloniously fail to immediately stop [his] motor vehicle at the scene of [an] accident,\u201d\u2019 adequately alleged, in context, that the defendant had acted with a knowing mental state. There, the state charged the defendant with leaving the scene of an accident that had caused injury or death to another person without providing reasonable aid and assistance, <em>former </em>ORS 483.602 (1959), <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 1983, ch 338, \u00a7 978. The defendant appealed his conviction, arguing that the state was required, but had failed, to allege in the indictment that the defendant knew that he was involved in an accident involving injury or death. The Supreme Court disagreed, reasoning that \u201can indictment which charges that a person \u2018unlawfully and feloniously\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>performed an act is equivalent to alleging that he knowingly did so, and thus supplies the element of knowledge where that element is necessary for averment in the indictment.\u201d <em>Reynolds, </em>229 Or at 172. The court held that, in the context of the balance of the indictment, the phrase \u201cunlawfully and feloniously\u201d communicated the allegation that the defendant claimed was missing. <em>Id. </em>at 172-73; <em>see also State v. Jim/White, </em>13 Or App 201, 220, 508 P2d 462 (1973) (\u201cWhere the words used in the indictment necessarily imply other words those words need not be used in the indictment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Here, we conclude that the original indictment, when read in its entirety, alleged that defendant had assaulted the victim with a dangerous weapon, because the phrase \u201ccause [d] serious physical injury to [the victim] by means of a dangerous\u201d necessarily communicated, albeit imperfectly, that defendant had used a dangerous weapon to injure the victim. Count 1 of the indictment explicitly alleged that defendant had committed first-degree assault. As noted earlier, 268 Or App at 38 n 2, there are four statutorily defined ways to commit first-degree assault, and each requires the state to prove a fact that is not present in the others. The original indictment did <em>not </em>allege the factual predicates of three of the four theories of culpability for first-degree <em>assault </em>\u2014 viz., that defendant had assaulted a child less than six years of age or a pregnant person or that defendant was driving while intoxicated \u2014 and the factual predicate for the fourth theory is the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon to inflict serious physical injury. Further, the indictment was obviously missing a word. As previously indicated, it contained a prepositional phrase, \u201cby means of a dangerous,\u201d that contained the preposition \u201cof,\u201d and an adjective, \u201cdangerous,\u201d that did not modify any other word in the indictment. In context, the incomplete prepositional phrase \u201cby means of a dangerous\u201d in the indictment had to be understood to communicate that the grand jury had charged defendant with first-degree assault for causing serious physical injury to the victim by means of a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Moreover, even a reader who was unaware that there are four distinct ways to commit first-degree assault would have read the indictment to allege that defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>injured the victim by means of a dangerous weapon. The incomplete prepositional phrase \u201cby means of a dangerous\u201d was preceded by the allegation that defendant had \u201cintentionally\u201d caused \u201cserious physical injury to [the victim].\u201d When a person uses an object to \u201cintentionally cause serious physical injury\u201d by definition, that object becomes a weapon. <em>See Webster's Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>2589 (unabridged ed 2002) (defining the word \u201cweapon\u201d as \u201csomething * * * used in destroying, defeating, or physically injuring an enemy\u201d). Therefore, when read with the words immediately preceding the incomplete prepositional phrase, it becomes evident that the missing word that the incomplete prepositional phrase was intended to modify had to be a word for something that is used to cause \u201cserious physical injury,\u201d <em>viz., </em>the missing word had to be \u201cweapon\u201d or a term for a weapon. If the missing word were anything other than \u201cweapon,\u201d then it could not be the \u201cmeans by which\u201d the defendant had \u201cintentionally\u201d caused the \u201cserious physical injury.\u201d In essence, the amendment merely made explicit an allegation that was already adequately, though implicitly, expressed in the original indictment, and the court had the authority to grant the amendment to add the missing word.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">In summary, Count 1 of the original indictment alleged that defendant had assaulted the victim by means of a dangerous weapon notwithstanding the failure to include the word \u201cweapon\u201d in the indictment. Therefore, the defect in the original indictment, <em>viz., </em>the omission of the word \u201cweapon,\u201d was one of form only, and the trial court did not err in granting the state\u2019s motion to amend the indictment to add the word \u201cweapon\u201d to Count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b55-6\"> ORS 163.185(1) provides, as pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">\u201cA person commits the crime of assault in the first degree if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQf\">\u201c(a) Intentionally causes serious physical injury to another by means of a deadly or dangerous weapon;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">\u201c(b) Intentionally or knowingly causes serious physical injury to a child under six years of age;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-9\">\u201c(c) Violates [the statute defining second-degree assault] knowing that the victim is pregnant; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-10\">\u201c(d) Intentionally, knowingly or recklessly causes serious physical injury to another while operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicants in violation of ORS 813.010 ***.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b56-6\"> Second-degree assault is defined in ORS 163.175(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">\u201cA person commits the crime of assault in the second degree if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AS\">\u201c(a) Intentionally or knowingly causes serious physical injury to another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Au\">\u201c(b) Intentionally or knowingly causes physical injury to another by means of a deadly or dangerous weapon; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-8\">\u201c(c) Recklessly causes serious physical injury to another by means of a deadly or dangerous weapon under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
