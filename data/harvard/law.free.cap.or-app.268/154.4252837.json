We write only to address defendant\u2019s first through third assignments of error, in which he argues that the trial court erred when it (1) concluded that he had waived his right to counsel; (2) excluded defendant from the courtroom for the majority of the trial; and (3) conducted the majority of the trial without the presence of defendant or defense counsel. For the reasons below, we reverse and remand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The facts of this case are procedural and not in dispute. The key events occurred on the day before and the first day of trial and led to defendant\u2019s self-representation and later removal from the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">To provide some context for the facts of this case, we note that defendant employed what is known colloquially as the \u201cflesh and blood\u201d defense, which is \u201cthe embodiment * * * of a movement sometimes referred to as the \u2018sovereign citizen\u2019 or \u2018anti-government\u2019 movement.\u201d <em>See </em>James Erickson Evans, Comment, <em>The \u201cFlesh and Blood\u201d Defense, </em>53 Wm &amp; Mary L Rev 1361, 1363 (2012). A common feature of that defense is the defendant\u2019s claim that he or she is a \u201cflesh and blood\u201d person, who is distinct from the person named in the indictment and that, accordingly, the trial court lacks jurisdiction over the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 1372. That was defendant\u2019s argument in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">The state charged defendant with first-degree robbery, second-degree robbery, first-degree theft, felon in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>possession of a firearm, and unlawful use of a weapon in connection with an armed robbery. In the pretrial proceedings, defendant asserted that he was not the \u201cdebtor juristic person Damascus Lord Seymor Menefee,\u201d listed in the charging instrument, but rather that he was the \u201csecured party creditor\u201d over that \u201ccorporate entity.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, defendant contended that the court had to prove that it had \u201csubject matter jurisdiction\u201d over him, the \u201cflesh and blood, sentient man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">Defendant\u2019s trial was scheduled to begin on July 6. On that date, defendant was in custody and appeared without counsel. The trial court warned defendant about the risks of proceeding <em>pro se </em>and asked him repeatedly if he wanted to postpone trial and have a lawyer appointed to represent him. However, each time the court asked defendant about counsel, defendant refused to give a direct answer and continued to assert that he was not waiving any of his rights and that the court had failed to establish that it had jurisdiction over him. Ultimately, the trial court ruled that defendant\u2019s responses reflected a decision on his part to waive his right to counsel and to proceed <em>pro se. </em>In response to that ruling, defendant stated, \u201cI object to that completely, wholeheartedly, with every right that I reserve as a human being [,]\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant, however, did not state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>that he wanted an attorney appointed to represent him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The prosecutor then asked the court to consider whether it should, on its own motion, appoint defendant a lawyer, even if just to serve as a legal advisor. However, defendant stated that he was \u201cready to proceed today without a lawyer,\u201d and the court decided not to appoint counsel for defendant on its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">As the court continued to address other pretrial issues, defendant renewed, multiple times, his objection to the court\u2019s authority over him as well as the legitimacy of the proceedings. The court overruled defendant\u2019s repeated jurisdictional arguments and objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The next day, before the trial court swore in the jury, the court told defendant three separate times that he still had an opportunity to have appointed counsel represent him. Defendant did not respond that he wished to have counsel appointed. Defendant had apparently told a deputy that he intended to walk out of the courtroom during the proceedings, and the court asked defendant about his intention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>to do so. Defendant stated that he intended \u201cto proceed <em>sui juris </em>until\u201d he was \u201cdone proceeding.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">After dealing with other pretrial issues, the court again addressed defendant\u2019s jurisdictional claim, ultimately-rejecting it again. Defendant then asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-5\">\u201cI\u2019m a sovereign human being with natural born birthrights. All of those have been violated today and every last person here who does not have an oath of office, and everybody who does have an oath of office will be held accountable according to legitimate due process, and I will be excused from this sham of a courtroom right now.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">As a result, the court ordered that, at defendant\u2019s request, he would be removed from the courtroom. Defendant was taken out of the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">The court then recessed to consider whether it could proceed without defendant given that he was proceeding <em>pro se. </em>After the court reconvened, the prosecutor summarized his research on the issue, citing <em>State v. Harris, </em>291 Or 179, 630 P2d 332 (1981), and <em>State v. Skillstad, </em>204 Or App 241, 129 P3d 232 (2006), <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 727 (2007). The prosecutor explained to the court that, under those cases, a defendant can waive his or her right to be present and that the trial can proceed without a defendant even if the defendant is not represented by counsel. At that point, however, one of the deputies indicated that defendant wished to return to the courtroom. The court told the deputy to bring him in. It then stated that the question whether it could proceed in defendant\u2019s absence was now moot because defendant wished to return but that it was finding that defendant had left freely and voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">After the court swore the jury in and delivered its preliminary jury instructions, the prosecutor delivered his opening statement in the usual course. Defendant made a single objection regarding the relevance of evidence that the prosecutor had mentioned; aside from that objection, defendant did not interrupt the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Defendant\u2019s opening statement focused on his position that he was \u201cthe secure party\u201d and a \u201cflesh and blood living breathing sentient natural person and private man,\u201d that the indictment had been returned against a \u201clegal creation,\u201d and, therefore, that the court lacked jurisdiction over him. Defendant\u2019s opening statement began as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-4\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: First, I don\u2019t know again, any rule, jargon or anything, I\u2019m not a lawyer. I have not reviewed the discovery, so I don\u2019t know about the evidence that\u2019s placed against- \u2014 not me \u2014 but the juristic person who\u2019s being charged as a defendant in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">\u201cUltimately the point that I intend to make here is that I, the secure party, Damascus Menefee, am a flesh and blood living breathing sentient natural person and private man. I\u2019m not a corporate fiction, I\u2019m not an entity created by legal procedures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">\u201cThe indictment that was returned was returned against a legal creation, not a flesh and blood man, so again, I do not have a lawyer solely because of the fact that no lawyer will come and represent \u2014 not no lawyer, but no lawyer that I\u2019ve been afforded the opportunity to have represent me or my copywritten [sic] property, which is the juristic person Damasca \u2014 Damascus Lord Seymor Menefee \u2014 \u2022\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">At that point, the prosecutor objected to defendant\u2019s reference to his lack of an attorney; the court told defendant to confine his opening statement to what he anticipated the evidence would be. Defendant then continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-8\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: All right. Let me \u2014 let me make clear for the record. I don\u2019t have a lawyer, I\u2019ve asked for one, and it\u2019s stating I got documentation that I did that was just introduced, but whatever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-9\">\u201cStrike that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-10\">\u201cI\u2019m here by special appearance. I\u2019m proceeding <em>sui juris, </em>this is for you guys \u2014 special appearance and special appearance only until I am notified that I\u2019m in an Article III court of constitutional due process. Be it known to this Court, to the jury, and for the record that I am a living breathing flesh and blood sentient natural person and private man.

You\u2019re going to have to muffle me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-21\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. All right. Then I can do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>\u201c [DEFENDANT]: No, I know you can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right.

Then I will have you removed from the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-9\">\u201c [DEFENDANT]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. We will proceed in that fashion. We\u2019ll have [defendant] removed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">Before he could be removed, defendant said that he would like to finish his opening statement. The court told defendant that he could finish his opening statement, but not in front of the jury. Defendant indicated that he intended to tell the jury that there is a difference between a flesh and blood person and a juristic person. He then said that, after giving his opening statement, the court \u201ccan proceed with your * * * case, and I\u2019ll leave, you can have it, but I want to make them known to that, ultimately for them and for the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">The court told defendant that it did not consider any of that information appropriate for an opening statement. The following colloquy \u2014 which ultimately devolved into disrespectful and provocative comments by defendant \u2014 then ensued concerning the court\u2019s jurisdiction and defendant\u2019s interest in remaining for trial and pursuing his defense theory:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-13\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Is it true, though? Is any of what I\u2019m saying legally documented in any of which you represented by oath or about to represent (indiscernible)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: There is not anything in what you described\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>\u201c [DEFENDANT]: Well, anything in your oath of office to the constitution, and your oath of \u2014 your\u2014you guys can help me out here \u2014 your oath to the Oregon [C] onstitution as well as to the Constitution of the United States, is anything I\u2019m saying there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-3\">\u201cTHE COURT: There\u2019s no \u2014 you have no foundation in the \u2014 in my oath of office, in the oath of office that\u2019s required in the Oregon [C] onstitution for\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-4\">\u201c [DEFENDANT]: What about in the constitution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: \u2014that supports any of the points that you\u2019re making.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">\u201c [DEFENDANT]: What about right here, laws inherent to the rights of men?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Natural rights or laws inherent in the rights of men?

Free Menefee. Shoot me, mother fucker. Shoot me.\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">At the state\u2019s request, the court made the following findings concerning why it had removed defendant from the courtroom:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-12\">\u201cWell, I think it\u2019s evident from the record. I can\u2019t imagine how I could possibly make findings that would describe more clearly what I have characterized as obstructionism, and so I\u2019m finding that he\u2019s making a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to be present in this proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-13\">\u201cThe record should reflect that [defendant] knows very well what he\u2019s doing. He responds and has responded over the course of these two days in numerous instances intelligently, and we have engaged in dialogue from time to time that I think makes it altogether evident that he is not suffering from any mental disability, any mental illness. He is aware of what he\u2019s doing, and this Court, as I described, considers that his disruption is an artifice designed to undermine these proceedings and prevent justice from taking place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-14\">\u201cAnd so for that reason \u2014 for those reasons, I am concluding that he is deciding consciously not to be present here during the course of this trial, and if the Court were to entertain more than it already has, his presence, it would only serve to undermine its authority, and so we are not going to proceed further with [defendant], and I\u2019m going to have the State proceed without him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>The court then ordered the jury back into the courtroom and resumed the trial without defendant\u2019s presence and, because he was <em>pro se, </em>without any defense counsel present. The state called and examined two of its witnesses (the robbery victim and defendant\u2019s ex-girlfriend) before the court adjourned for the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">The next day, before the trial court brought the jury into the courtroom, the prosecutor stated that he had received an e-mail from a sergeant at the jail indicating that defendant had refused to come out of his cell to attend court that day. The court explained that it had wanted defendant to be present so that it could ask him if he was prepared to sit through the proceedings \u201cand behave properly today,\u201d but that it was now reluctant to force defendant to attend unless the state insisted. The prosecutor told the court that he was prepared to proceed without defendant present. The court then had the jail sergeant who had authored the e-mail testify telephonically about his interaction with defendant that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The sergeant testified that he had gone to defendant\u2019s jail cell that morning, but defendant was not dressed for court. The sergeant related that he told defendant that he was scheduled for court, that \u201cif he did not go to court there would be adverse consequences possibly coming his way,\u201d and that \u201cthe judge could issue an order to have him brought to court, including the use \u2014 if he resisted \u2014 the use of a taser.\u201d The sergeant testified that, at that point, defendant told the sergeant to tase him, started yelling that \u201cwe were violating his rights,\u201d and called the judge \u201can asshole.\u201d The court concluded that, in light of those circumstances, it would not be bringing defendant to the courtroom that day. The court then brought the jury into the courtroom and instructed the state to call its next witness. The state continued its case and examined a total of 12 witnesses before the court adjourned for the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The next and final day of the trial, before bringing the jury in, the court indicated that defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">\u201chas again refused to make himself available to be present at this trial. So we\u2019re going to proceed without him. I received that information from the jail deputies this morning and I don\u2019t intend to make any more of a record. I think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>the record from yesterday and previously his own statements on the record are more than sufficient to establish that he is waiving his right to be present.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">The court then had the jury brought in, the state finished presenting its side of the case, and the prosecutor delivered his closing argument. The jury returned a guilty verdict on all charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Defendant, who is now represented by legal counsel, challenges his convictions on appeal. In a combined argument pursuant to ORAP 5.45(6),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> he asserts three assignments of error that we consider here: the trial court erred when it (1) concluded that he had waived his right to counsel, (2) excluded him from the courtroom for the majority of the trial, and (3) conducted the majority of trial without the presence of defendant or defense counsel. Because we believe that defendant\u2019s first assignment of error presents a distinct question from his second and third assignments, we consider it separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">A. <em>Waiver of right to counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">In his first assignment of error, defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling before the trial began that he was waiving his right to counsel. We review whether a defendant has knowingly and intentionally waived his or her right to counsel for legal error. <em>State v. Langley, </em>351 Or 652, 666, 273 P3d 901 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">Under Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution, a defendant in a criminal case has a constitutional right to an attorney.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Langley, </em>351 Or at 663. A defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>however, may waive his or her right to counsel and proceed <em>pro se. State v. Meyrick, </em>313 Or 125, 131, 831 P2d 666 (1992). To be valid, that waiver must be knowing and intentional. <em>Langley, </em>351 Or at 665. \u201cThe requirement that a waiver be \u2018intentional\u2019 refers to a defendant\u2019s intent to waive the right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(some internal quotation marks omitted). A prerequisite to a waiver of counsel is the defendant\u2019s knowledge of his or her right to counsel. <em>Meyrick, </em>313 Or at 133. Because we are \u201creluctant to find that fundamental constitutional rights have been waived,\u201d we will not presume a waiver of the right to counsel from a silent record. <em>State v. Phillips, </em>235 Or App 646, 653, 234 P3d 1030, <em>modified on recons, </em>236 Or App 465, 236 P3d 789 (2010). \u201cWhether there has been an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of that right will depend on the particular circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>State v. Mendonca, </em>129 Or App 463, 465, 879 P2d 233 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Here, defendant argues that a court may not assume the waiver of a constitutional right from a silent record and that, when defendant refused to request a lawyer, he was not waiving his right to an attorney, but was \u201csimply remaining silent on that point.\u201d Furthermore, defendant contends that, because he objected to the trial court\u2019s interpretation of his response, \u201cno rational court could take defendant\u2019s actions as a voluntary waiver of his right to counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The state responds that defendant does not dispute that the trial court adequately warned him of the risks of self-representation, that the trial court repeatedly tried to have defendant accept court-appointed counsel for trial, but that defendant refused to cooperate with the court\u2019s attempts to appoint him counsel. The state further argues that, in any case, defendant expressly waived his right to counsel when he told the court directly, \u201cI\u2019m ready to proceed today without a lawyer,\u201d and that the court did not err in allowing defendant to proceed <em>pro se. </em>We agree with the state that, under the totality of the circumstances, defendant knew of his right to counsel and that he intentionally relinquished that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Defendant does not dispute that the court adequately informed him of his right to counsel. Notably, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, the record in this case is not silent. The trial court sought multiple times to determine whether defendant wanted appointed counsel, and each time defendant failed to provide a responsive answer, insisting instead that he wanted the court to prove subject matter jurisdiction and that he was not waiving his rights. The court\u2019s questions, and defendant\u2019s responses, created a standstill in which defendant would neither tell the court that he wanted counsel, nor affirmatively state, at least initially, that he was proceeding without counsel. The trial court also warned defendant that it would have to conclude that he did not want to be represented by appointed counsel if defendant did not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">This situation is common in cases in which the defendant asserts the \u201cflesh and blood\u201d defense<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and puts the trial court in the position of having to move forward with trial without getting an answer to its inquiries about appointed counsel. Though it is true that defendant objected when the court ruled that he was waiving his right to counsel, in context and properly understood, his objection was part of his overall \u201cflesh and blood\u201d defense that he was not waiving his rights and that the court lacked jurisdiction. Defendant never expressed that he wanted counsel to be appointed. Even after the court\u2019s ruling on waiver of counsel, the court repeatedly told defendant that he could still request an appointed attorney; each time, however, defendant did not indicate that he wished to do so. Furthermore, defendant ultimately unequivocally waived his right to counsel when he told the court that he was \u201cready to proceed\u201d that day \u201cwithout a lawyer.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court did not err in determining that defendant waived his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>B. <em>Right to be present at trial and rights to mount a defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">In his second and third assignments of error, defendant contends that the trial court erred when it excluded him from the courtroom and conducted a majority of the trial in his absence and in the absence of any defense counsel.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Defendant contends that his exclusion was not warranted because his behavior was not sufficiently egregious to require removal and because his \u201cerrant behavior\u201d consisted of his legal arguments and the manner in which he executed the role of an attorney. Thus, defendant contends, it was not his presence in the courtroom that was disruptive, but the fact that he was serving as his own attorney \u2014 a ground that he contends is an invalid reason for excluding a <em>pro se </em>defendant from trial altogether. Defendant argues that, by excluding him from the courtroom, the trial court left him without anyone to represent him at trial, thus denying him rights to representation, to confront witnesses, to present witnesses in his own defense, and to present a closing argument. Under those circumstances, defendant contends, it was impossible for him to receive a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The state first responds that defendant failed to preserve his arguments for appeal. As a general rule, we will not review a claim of error that was not raised in the trial court. ORAP 5.45(1) (\u201cNo matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claim of error was preserved in the lower court * * *.\u201d); <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 341, 15 P3d 22 (2000). The Oregon Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">\u201cPrecisely what suffices to \u2018present [] clearly\u2019 a particular position, for preservation purposes, is not something that can be explained by a neat verbal formula. And, in fact, this court has cautioned that \u2018problems *** may arise if the preservation onion is sliced too thinly.\u2019 <em>State v. Amaya, </em>336 Or 616, 629, 89 P3d 1163 (2004). Instead, the court has counseled attention to the purposes of the rule and the practicalities it serves. As we explained in <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number><em>Parkins, </em>346 Or 333, 341, 211 P3d 262 (2009), \u2018[ujltimately, the preservation rule is a practical one, and close calls * * * inevitably will turn on whether, given the particular record of a case, the court concludes that the policies underlying the rule have been sufficiently served.\u201d\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-4\"><em>State v. Walker, </em>350 Or 540, 548, 258 P3d 1228 (2011) (brackets and ellipses in original). The policies underlying the preservation rule include providing the trial court with an opportunity to avoid or correct an error, as well as allowing the opposing party to respond to arguments. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Here, we conclude that defendant\u2019s arguments are sufficiently preserved. Defendant objected to his removal by stating multiple times that he wanted to be present at his trial and that he wanted to present his defense at trial. Those responses to the trial court\u2019s decision to remove defendant sufficiently conveyed to the court and the prosecutor that defendant disputed that his conduct, that is, his insistence on making his defense argument to the jury, warranted his removal from the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Furthermore, the court and the prosecutor had already considered whether the trial could proceed in the absence of a <em>pro se </em>defendant when defendant had requested to leave at an earlier part of the proceedings. The court, in considering that issue, acknowledged the due process concerns with continuing trial in the absence of a defendant and any defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">\u201cIt is highly unusual obviously, the notion that we would proceed without a defendant present, without anyone available to represent the defendant\u2019s interests in his absence, does invoke due process considerations, and we want to be as sure of ourselves as we can be before we decide that we\u2019re going to proceed here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">The prosecutor argued to the court that, under <em>Harris, </em>291 Or 179, and <em>Skillstad, </em>204 Or App 241 \u2014 two of the cases the state cites to support its position on appeal \u2014 a court can proceed in the absence of a defendant and defense counsel if the defendant is voluntarily absent. Therefore, though defendant\u2019s arguments could have been more clearly preserved, we conclude that the record demonstrates that the policies behind the preservation rule were sufficiently served in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>We move on to consider the merits of those arguments. Defendant asserts that he had a right to be present at his trial, that his behavior was not sufficiently egregious to warrant the trial court\u2019s termination of that right, and, because his disruptive behavior was his persistence in making legally irrelevant arguments \u2014 conduct that was directly related to his exercise of the role of attorney \u2014 the court could not remove him for that behavior. Defendant further argues that the court erred when it proceeded in his absence because, when it excluded him from the courtroom, the trial court left him with no one to represent him during the trial and deprived him of significant constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">In response, citing <em>State v. Williams, </em>11 Or App 227, 501 P2d 328, <em>rev den </em>(1972), and <em>Illinois v. Allen, </em>397 US 337, 90 S Ct 1057, 25 L Ed 2d 353, <em>reh\u2019g den, </em>398 US 915 (1970), the state contends that it is well established that a trial court \u201cmay order a defendant to be removed from the courtroom if he persistently engages in misconduct so disruptive that the trial cannot be carried out with him in the courtroom.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Then, citing <em>Harris, </em>291 Or 179, and <em>Skillstad, </em>204 Or App 241, the state argues that \u201cit is also well established that a trial may proceed in the defendant\u2019s absence if the trial court finds that he voluntarily chose not to be present.\u201d From those principles, the state seems to argue that (1) the trial court properly exercised its discretion in removing defendant because it found that he was being intentionally disruptive and (2) because defendant\u2019s behavior was intentional, he was voluntarily choosing to be absent from his trial, thus permitting the court, under <em>Skillstad, </em>to proceed in his absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Before we address the legal principles that apply to defendant\u2019s arguments, we pause to note that defendant has cited four sources for his right to be present at trial: Article I, section 11, the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> an Oregon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>statute, ORS 136.040(1),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Defendant does not explain whether, and to what extent, those rights overlap or conflict. Furthermore, defendant does not directly argue the application of Article I, section 11, or the application of ORS 136.040(l).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Instead, defendant overwhelmingly cites to federal cases applying the federal constitution to support his arguments regarding his right to be present at trial. Accordingly, we understand defendant to be making his arguments under the federal constitution.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>\u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to be confronted with the witnesses against him[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Under the federal constitution, a criminal defendant has the right to be present at his or her trial. <em>Allen, </em>397 US at 338. That right, however, is not absolute, and \u201cmay be lost by consent or at times even by misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 342-43 (internal quotation marks omitted). As the United States Supreme Court explained <em>in Allen:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">\u201cIt is essential to the proper administration of criminal justice that dignity, order, and decorum be the hallmarks of all court proceedings in our country. The flagrant disregard in the courtroom of elementary standards of proper conduct should not and cannot be tolerated. We believe trial judges confronted with disruptive, contumacious, stubbornly defiant defendants must be given sufficient discretion to meet the circumstances of each case. No one formula for maintaining the appropriate courtroom atmosphere will be best in all situations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 343. The Court then explained that there are at least three constitutionally permissible ways to deal with a disruptive defendant: \u201c(1) bind and gag him, thereby keeping him present; (2) cite him for contempt; (3) take him out of the courtroom until he promises to conduct himself properly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 343-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>As to the third choice \u2014 removing the defendant from the courtroom \u2014 the Court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-4\"><em>\u201ca </em>defendant can lose his right to be present at trial if, after he has been warned by the judge that he will be removed if he continues his disruptive behavior, he nevertheless insists on conducting himself in a manner so disorderly, disruptive, and disrespectful of the court that his trial cannot be carried on with him in the courtroom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 343. The Court counseled that, after being removed, a defendant can reclaim his right to be present \u201cas soon as the defendant is willing to conduct himself consistently with the decorum and respect inherent in the concept of courts and judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">In <em>Allen, </em>the defendant refused court-appointed counsel and attempted to conduct his own defense. <em>Id. </em>at 339. During <em>voir dire, </em>the court told the defendant to confine his questions to relevant matters, and the defendant began to \u201cargue with the judge in a most abusive and disrespectful manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The judge asked the defendant\u2019s standby counsel to take over the questioning, though the defendant \u201ccontinued to talk, proclaiming that the appointed attorney was not going to act as his lawyer\u201d; told the judge, \u201cWhen I go out for lunchtime, you\u2019re * * * going to be a corpse here\u201d; and tore the file that his attorney had and threw the papers on the floor. <em>Id. </em>at 340. The court warned the defendant that another outburst like that would result in his removal from the courtroom. <em>Id. </em>The defendant did not heed that warning and instead continued to talk back to the judge, saying that \u201c[t]here\u2019s not going to be no trial, either.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After more abusive remarks, the court removed the defendant and ordered that the trial continue in his absence. <em>Id. </em>Later, the court brought the defendant back to the courtroom and told him that he could stay if he behaved himself. But the defendant again indicated that he was going to disrupt the proceedings, and so the court removed him again. On review, the Supreme Court concluded that the trial court had not abused its discretion in removing the defendant because the defendant\u2019s \u201cbehavior was clearly of such an extreme and aggravated nature as to justify either his removal from the courtroom or his total physical restraint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Allen </em>makes clear that, when faced with a disruptive defendant, a trial court has at least three legally permissible options for dealing with the defendant. The trial court has the discretion to choose among those options, and, if the record demonstrates that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in making the choice that it did, we must affirm the court\u2019s ruling. <em>See id. </em>at 347 (\u201cWe do not hold that removing this defendant from his own trial was the only way the Illinois judge could have constitutionally solved the problem he had. We do hold, however, that there is nothing whatever in this record to show that the judge did not act completely within his discretion.\u201d); <em>accord Williams, </em>11 Or App at 230-31 (stating that the determination whether a defendant\u2019s misconduct is \u201cso disruptive that the trial cannot be carried on with him in the courtroom\u201d \u201cmust lie within the sound discretion of the trial judge,\u201d and concluding that, in a case in which the defendant chanted in a monotone voice throughout his trial, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in removing the defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Here, defendant acknowledges that a defendant can lose the right to be present at trial, but argues that his behavior was not sufficiently egregious to warrant removal from the courtroom. For example, he points out that he never showed any signs of violence, that the court and prosecutor stated that he had been polite at various times in the proceedings, and that he did not obstruct the various stages of the trial apart from refusing to participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Although defendant\u2019s conduct did not involve physical violence, he was at times cooperative and polite with the court and prosecutor, and his conduct was perhaps not as egregious as the defendant\u2019s conduct in <em>Allen, </em>defendant\u2019s behavior was nonetheless disruptive and repeated. At the height of his interaction with the court, defendant used abusive language toward the judge and indicated, on more than one occasion, that he would continue to engage in the behavior that the judge had told him was inappropriate. Furthermore, the record demonstrates that defendant was persistent in making his jurisdictional argument, even after the court had explained to him multiple times the reasons that it had rejected that argument. The fact that defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>continued to make the same argument despite the court\u2019s multiple rulings and admonishments, paired with his promise that he would be making that argument \u201cevery opportunity\u201d he got and that the court would have to \u201cmuffle\u201d him, permitted the court to conclude that defendant\u2019s behavior was aimed at disrupting the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">Defendant nonetheless argues that the fact that his \u201cerrant behavior occurred when he was acting in the role of attorney\u201d is dispositive in this case. Specifically, he argues that \u201c [i] t was [his] legal arguments and how he executed the attorney role that that court objected to,\u201d and that, because \u201che was not disruptive when the court and prosecutor were performing their legal functions,\u201d \u201cit was not defendant\u2019s presence in the courtroom that caused the problems; it was the fact that he was acting as his own attorney.\u201d Defendant argues that, under the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Badger v. Cardwell, </em>587 F2d 968 (9th Cir 1978), that is \u201can invalid reason to exclude a defendant from his own trial.\u201d For the reasons that follow, we disagree with defendant\u2019s analysis under <em>Badger.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\"><em>Badger </em>involved the trial of two co-defendants, both of whom elected to represent themselves, though standby counsel was provided. 587 F2d at 970. Badger, the defendant who is the subject of the opinion, was removed from the trial a total of four times. The trial court removed the defendant for the first time after he had interrupted and argued with the judge about a ruling relating to his co-defendant, had \u201craised a clenched fist,\u201d and \u201ctaunted the court to expel him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 973. The second removal occurred after the defendant, dissatisfied with the court\u2019s ruling regarding the questioning of a witness, had interrupted the court, complained that the jurors \u201cnever hear what\u2019s going on,\u201d and then continued to argue about the function of the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 974. The next removal occurred after an incident involving the defendant\u2019s examination of certain witnesses. During those examinations, the defendant became increasingly argumentative, repetitious, irrelevant, and hostile to objections of the prosecutor. After admonishing the defendant repeatedly, the court excused the jury and told the defendant not to argue with the witness. In the conversation that followed, the defendant \u201crefused to give the court a straight answer, interrupted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>court as it was advising him, indicated that his own perceived harassment in prison justified the scope of his examination, and in a disrespectful manner agreed to follow the court\u2019s instructions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 975. The court then ordered him to be removed. Finally, the court removed the defendant for a fourth and final time after the defendant had refused to respond directly to the court\u2019s repeated inquiries.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The Ninth Circuit affirmed the trial court\u2019s first removal, but reversed on the other three. In its view, the trial court was justified in removing the defendant the first time because his behavior \u201cwas seriously disruptive,\u201d \u201c[b]aiting the trial judge to remove him was a direct challenge to the court\u2019s authority,\u201d and the \u201cdisplay of a clenched fist, either as a sign of disrespect or as a gesture of intimidation, would shatter the courtroom\u2019s atmosphere of careful inquiry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 973. The court concluded that those \u201cacts transcended the defendant\u2019s role as his own attorney,\u201d and that, because he was warned and told that he would have an opportunity to return if he could conform his conduct, the court did not err in excluding him. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The Ninth Circuit contrasted the defendant\u2019s actions that led to his first removal with those that led to his subsequent removals on the basis that the latter behavior was connected to the defendant\u2019s attempt to serve as his own attorney. For example, as the court explained in analyzing the behavior that led to the defendant\u2019s second removal,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">\u201cwe are looking at an inartful and inept examiner, occasionally irrelevant, often repetitious, and \u2014 most serious\u2014 seemingly incapable of letting others finish speaking when what they said went against him. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">\u201cWe find no sign in these proceedings to compare with the earlier baiting and raised fist, or, much less, with the verbal and physical assaults of the defendants in <em>Allen </em>and <em>[United States v. Ives, </em>504 F2d 935 (9th Cir 1974)], which would indicate an opposition to the concept of a trial itself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 975. The court explained that, in the case of a <em>pro se </em>defendant, a court must consider whether the defendant\u2019s disruptive behavior is related to the defendant\u2019s execution of his or her role as an attorney or whether that behavior would persist if the defendant was removed from that role <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>but allowed to remain in the courtroom. <em>Id. </em>at 979. In that case, the court concluded that the defendant\u2019s \u201cbehavior was exhibited as he was playing the attorney\u2019s role,\u201d and the court concluded that \u201c[i]n light of all the evidence, including both the limited nature of his misconduct and the evidence as to his intent, it is impossible to tell if the arguing and the interruptions would have persisted, had that role been withdrawn and assigned to another person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 975. The court went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-4\">\u201cIt is reasonable to suppose that there are cases in which a defendant becomes so aroused in arguing and questioning, so frustrated by an inevitable succession of defeats on matters he little understands, so angered at his inability to elicit favorable testimony and to discredit damaging testimony, that in representing himself he loses self-control and seriously disrupts his trial. Yet, the same accused may be capable of listening and even assisting while another person, more versed in the substance and procedure of law, conducts his defense. Appellant may have been such a person. On this record we do not know; neither could the trial judge have known.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 979.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Defendant\u2019s behavior in this case is closer to that of the first removal in <em>Badger </em>than to the second through fourth removals. Though initially, when discussing the court\u2019s ruling about his opening statement, defendant attempted to explain why he felt that it was legally relevant to tell the jury his theory of the case, his interaction with the court soon took a different turn. Defendant told the judge that he would continue to make his argument at \u201cevery opportunity\u201d and that the court would have to remove him to prevent him from making his argument. He then reverted to his jurisdictional argument, during which he continuously interrupted the judge, became very argumentative, and would not desist. Finally, as the court was trying to state its ruling regarding defendant\u2019s obstructionist behavior, defendant insulted the judge. In short, defendant\u2019s interactions with the court transformed from what could be characterized as an \u201cinartful\u201d attempt at self-representation to defiance of the court\u2019s authority and integrity, including insulting the judge. We conclude that, given the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>findings that defendant was being intentionally disruptive and the evidence of defendant\u2019s behavior in the record, the trial court acted within its discretion in removing defendant from the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">That conclusion, however, does not end our inquiry. Defendant also assigns error to the trial court\u2019s decision to proceed with the trial after removing him from the courtroom. Defendant contends that, when the court removed him, he was left with no one to represent him at trial and therefore was denied various trial rights, such as the right to representation and the right to confront witnesses. The state, relying on <em>Harris </em>and <em>Skillstad, </em>seems to argue that defendant voluntarily absented himself from trial by virtue of his misconduct, and therefore, the trial court was permitted to conduct the trial in his absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The state\u2019s reliance on <em>Harris </em>and <em>Skillstad, </em>however, is misplaced. Defendant\u2019s argument on appeal is based on his claim that the trial court violated his rights under the federal constitution. Both <em>Harris </em>and <em>Skillstad </em>are limited to an interpretation of ORS 136.040, an Oregon statute that confers on criminal defendants a statutory right to be present at trial. In combination, those cases provide that a defendant\u2019s statutory right to be present at trial is not absolute and can be waived, and that, if the defendant\u2019s waiver is valid, the trial court can proceed in his or her absence. However, neither of those cases discusses a defendant\u2019s federal constitutional rights, nor do the cases involve a situation in which the defendant was present at trial but was removed by the court for misconduct. Both <em>Harris </em>and <em>Skillstad </em>involved defendants who simply failed to show up to their trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The question presented by defendant\u2019s third assignment of error is whether, under the federal constitution, a trial court can proceed in the absence of a <em>pro se </em>defendant after the court has removed the defendant for his or her disruptive behavior. Neither party has cited any Oregon case, nor could we find any, which addresses under what circumstances the federal constitution permits a trial court to proceed with a trial after removing a <em>pro se </em>defendant for his or her misconduct. Accordingly, we turn to the decisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>other courts that have addressed that issue to aid in our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">In <em>United States v. Mack, </em>362 F3d 597 (9th Cir 2004), the Ninth Circuit considered whether the trial court erred when it conducted a portion of a trial in the absence of a <em>pro se </em>defendant who had been removed by the court due to his misconduct. In that case, the defendant elected to represent himself and had been removed from his trial for his disruptive behavior. After removing the defendant, the court truncated the trial and precluded both parties from delivering closing arguments. The jury found the defendant guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">On appeal, the Ninth Circuit explained that (1) defendants have a right to be present at trial, but that that right can be forfeited by misconduct; (2) defendants have the right to waive counsel and to proceed <em>pro se; </em>and (3) a trial court can terminate a defendant\u2019s self-representation if the defendant engages in misconduct. <em>Id. </em>at 600-01. However, the court concluded that \u201c[a] defendant does not forfeit his right to representation at trial when he acts out. He merely forfeits his right to represent himself in the proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601. The court concluded that, in that case, when the court removed the defendant, he was left with no one to represent him and that, \u201c [i]n practical effect, he had been removed as his own counsel and nobody stepped in to fill the gap.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The result was that the defendant was deprived of counsel, which also deprived him of other trial rights, such as the right to give a closing argument. <em>Id. </em>at 602-03. The court concluded that effectively leaving the <em>pro se </em>defendant without representation upon his removal was structural error and that, no matter how vexatious the defendant\u2019s conduct, the trial court \u201ccannot eliminate important elements of a trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">In <em>State v. Eddy, </em>68 A3d 1089 (RI 2013), the Rhode Island Supreme Court considered whether a trial court is constitutionally required to appoint counsel to represent a <em>pro se </em>defendant who has asked to leave the trial. After examining a number of cases, the court explained that, \u201cwhen a <em>pro se </em>defendant absents himself from his trial of his own volition, courts are almost uniform in holding that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>trial judge is not constitutionally required to appoint counsel to represent the absent defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1105. In contrast, the court noted that the outcome is different if \u201cthe cause of the defendant\u2019s absence is the court-ordered removal of the <em>pro se </em>defendant, which carries with it the concomitant termination of the defendant\u2019s right of self-representation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1108. Because the defendant in that case had asked to be removed, the court held that the trial court was not constitutionally obliged to appoint him counsel and could proceed in his absence. <em>Id. </em>at 1109; <em>see also People v. Cohn, </em>160 P3d 336 (Colo Ct App 2007) (holding that the <em>pro se </em>defendant forfeited his right to be present at trial by his misconduct, but that the defendant\u2019s exclusion during portions of the trial violated the defendant\u2019s right to counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">What <em>Eddy </em>and the cases it cites demonstrate is that there is a distinction between a \u201cvoluntary absence,\u201d in which a defendant does not appear for trial or asks to leave during trial, and an \u201cinvoluntary absence,\u201d in which the court removes a defendant from the trial. In the former cases, the constitution does not require the trial court to take steps to protect the defendant\u2019s right to representation, and in the latter, it does. The trial court in this case apparently believed that defendant was voluntarily absent because he had decided, through his deliberate disruption, \u201cconsciously not to be present\u201d at trial. However, the fact that the trial court ordered that defendant be removed places this case in the category of \u201cinvoluntary absence\u201d cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Those cases highlight the complex constitutional issues that are involved when a trial court removes a <em>pro se </em>criminal defendant from his or her trial for misconduct. In any case in which a defendant is <em>pro se, </em>the defendant is simultaneously exercising two fundamental constitutional rights: (1) the right to self-representation and (2) the right to be present at trial. The United States Supreme Court has held that a defendant can lose both of those rights through misconduct. <em>See Allen, </em>397 US at 342-43; <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 US 806, 834 n 46, 95 S Ct 2525, 45 L Ed 2d 562 (1975) (\u201c[T]he trial judge may terminate self-representation by a defendant who deliberately engages in serious and obstructionist misconduct.\u201d). However, we agree with the Ninth Circuit that, although a defendant who acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>out at trial may forfeit the right to be present and the right to self-representation in the proceeding, the defendant does not also forfeit the right to any representation at trial. <em>See Mack, </em>362 F3d at 601. Accordingly, we hold that, after a trial court has removed a <em>pro se </em>defendant for his or her misconduct, the trial court cannot proceed in the defendant\u2019s absence unless and until the trial court has either secured the defendant\u2019s waiver of his or her right to representation at trial or has taken some other course of action that protects the defendant\u2019s right to representation, which may include the appointment of counsel.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">In this case, the court removed defendant because he was being disruptive. However, without considering defendant\u2019s right to representation at trial, the court continued the trial in defendant\u2019s absence, allowing the prosecutor to call and examine two of his witnesses before recessing for the day.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The trial court erred in doing so because defendant did not forfeit his right to representation when he acted out, and the trial court failed to obtain defendant\u2019s waiver of that right or to appoint him counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The trial court in this case could have taken a number of actions that would have avoided that error. For example, it could have ordered a recess, brought defendant back to the courtroom, told him that it was terminating his right to represent himself, and advised him of his right to representation. The court then could have determined whether defendant wanted counsel to be appointed to represent him or determined whether, instead, he was waiving that right. If defendant waived his right to representation by refusing appointed counsel, the court could have excluded defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>and proceeded in his absence. If defendant did not waive his right to representation, then the court would have had to appoint defendant counsel before continuing the trial and would have had to attempt to secure defendant\u2019s agreement that he would proceed appropriately as a client in the courtroom. The court also could have brought defendant back to the courtroom and warned him that he could continue to represent himself if he was willing to conduct himself appropriately at trial, but that, if he acted out again, he would be removed from the courtroom and his misconduct would result in the waiver of his right to self-representation at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The bottom line is that a <em>pro se </em>defendant\u2019s right to representation at trial is not instantly forfeited through misconduct, even though the defendant may have lost the right to be present and the right to self-representation. The right to representation, like any constitutional right, may be waived, but that waiver must be knowing and intelligent. <em>Argersinger v. Hamlin, </em>407 US 25, 37, 92 S Ct 2006, 32 L Ed 2d 530 (1972); <em>cf. Langley, </em>351 Or at 669-70 (noting that some state and federal courts have held that a defendant may impliedly waive his or her Sixth Amendment right to counsel by engaging in repeated misconduct in the attorney-client relationship if the defendant has received an advance warning that a repetition of behavior that amounts to misconduct will result in the defendant waiving the right to counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">In sum, the trial court did not err in ruling that defendant had waived his right to counsel pretrial, nor did it err in removing defendant from the courtroom. However, under the circumstances, the court erred when it proceeded with the trial in defendant\u2019s absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-9\"> In a <em>pro se </em>supplemental brief, defendant raises three additional assignments of error. He argues that the trial court erred in (1) conducting the trial without entry of a plea; (2) not providing defendant with an opportunity to return to the courtroom and finding that he had waived his right to be present for the remainder of the trial; and (3) abandoning the information, not arraigning defendant on the indictment, and proceeding without jurisdiction. Because we resolve defendant\u2019s appeal on a different issue, we do not reach his <em>pro se </em>assignments. We also do not reach defendant\u2019s other five assignments of error, none of which would entitle defendant to any greater relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b175-5\"> It is typical for defendants using the \u201cflesh and blood\u201d defense to \u201crefuse to acknowledge that they are the person named in the indictment, often because the indictment names the defendant in all capital letters, and flesh and blood theory instructs that the all-capital name represents the \u2018corporate citizen\u2019 named on one\u2019s Social Security card.\u201d Evans, 53 Wm &amp; Mary L Rev at 1372.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b175-6\"> The colloquy leading to the court\u2019s ruling is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">\u201c[THE COURT:] So we\u2019re now \u2014 we\u2019re moving on now, and so now we\u2019re at the point where \u2014 the Court understands that you do not wish to exercise your right to have a lawyer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-8\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: I never waived any of my rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, what you have to say is, you know \u2018Judge, I would like to have a lawyer appointed,\u2019 and then I\u2019ll make arrangements for that to occur.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-10\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Okay.

As noted, because we resolve this appeal on another basis, we need not consider that assignment of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b193-6\"> The Sixth Amendment provides, in relevant part:</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b194-7\"> ORS 136.040(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">\u201cIf the charge is for a misdemeanor, the trial may be had in the absence of the defendant if the defendant appears by counsel; but if it is for a felony, the defendant shall appear in person.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b194-9\"> Article I, section 11, provides in part, that in \u201call criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have the right to public trial ***; to be heard by himself and counsel; ***[and] to meet the witnesses face to face[.]\u201d We note that defendant does not cite to any Oregon case, nor can we find any, that has held that Article I, section 11, secures a defendant\u2019s right to be present at trial. Article I, section 11, does provide a constitutional right to adequate assistance of counsel. <em>Langley, </em>351 Or at 663.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b203-6\"> We note that, because the constitution may require the court to provide a <em>pro se </em>defendant with counsel mid-trial, it is advisable for a trial court to appoint advisory counsel for a defendant whom the court suspects will be disruptive so that the court can appoint that lawyer as counsel if the defendant can no longer represent himself. The United States Supreme Court has endorsed that approach as well, stating that a court \u201cmay \u2014 even over objection by the accused \u2014 appoint a \u2018standby counsel\u2019 to aid the accused if and when the accused requests help, and to be available to represent the accused in the event that termination of the defendant\u2019s self-representation is necessary.\u201d <em>Faretta, </em>422 US at 834 n 46.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b203-7\"> We recognize that, after defendant was removed on July 7, he refused to return the next two days of his trial. The state does not argue that defendant\u2019s subsequent refusal to return to court requires a different result.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
