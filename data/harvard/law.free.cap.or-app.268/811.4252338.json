Shortly after the designation, Richard Wilmot, one of the original owners of the property,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> attempted to have the historic designation removed. The city rejected that request. Hanson made a second request for removal of the designation in 2013. The city\u2019s Historic Resources Advisory Board rejected Hanson\u2019s request, and the city council held a hearing on the issue. At Hanson\u2019s behest, the city considered her request \u201csolely under ORS 197.772(3)\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and not under a land use application.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Respondent Lake Oswego Preservation Society (LOPS)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> appeared through counsel at the hearing to oppose removal of the historic designation. The city concluded that, \u201cas the local government that imposed the historic designation,\u201d it was \u201cmandated by state law to remove the historic designation\u201d and that Hanson was \u201centitled per ORS 197.772(3) to require the [c]ity to remove the historic designation from the subject property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">LOPS filed a timely appeal with the Land Use Board of Appeals (LUBA). LUBA concluded that the city had erroneously interpreted ORS 197.772(3), and reversed and remanded the city\u2019s decision to remove the historic designation. Hanson now seeks judicial review of LUBA\u2019s final order, raising two assignments of error. Hanson contends that LUBA lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal and that LUBA\u2019s conclusion on the merits was incorrect. We reject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>Hanson\u2019s contention that LUBA lacked jurisdiction but conclude that LUBA\u2019s interpretation of ORS 197.772(3) was erroneous. LOPS also filed a cross-petition, which we summarily reject.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse LUBA\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-3\">On review, Hanson first argues that the city\u2019s decision under ORS 197.772(3) is not a \u201cland use decision,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> over which LUBA has exclusive jurisdiction, ORS 197.825(1), because that statute only requires the city to determine whether a historic designation was imposed on a property\u2014 a determination that does not concern planning goals, comprehensive plan provisions, or land use regulations. To support that argument, Hanson cites <em>Leupold &amp; Stevens, Inc. v. City of Beaverton, </em>226 Or App 374, 203 P3d 309 (2009). For the following reasons, we reject that argument.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">In <em>Leupold, </em>the city adopted an ordinance annexing Leupold\u2019s property into the city In the midst of other legal actions before LUBA and this court challenging the adoption of that ordinance, Leupold sent a letter to the city \u201cdemanding that it rescind the * * * ordinance\u201d in light of a newly enacted state law that \u201crestrict [ed] the city\u2019s ability to annex certain industrial properties\u201d without the property owner\u2019s consent. <em>Id. </em>at 376-77. The city did not take any action on the demand, in part, because the Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>and LUBA cases were pending.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Leupold then filed an action in circuit court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the question whether the city\u2019s ordinance was valid in light of the adoption of the new state law. <em>Id. </em>at 377-78. The circuit court dismissed the action, concluding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to determine whether the ordinance was valid, in light of the new state law, as that would be a \u201cland use decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">Leupold appealed the dismissal and we reversed. After assuming that the city\u2019s decision not to act on Leupold\u2019s demand was a \u201cdecision,\u201d we concluded that it was not a land use decision, noting that a \u201cdetermination by a local government relating only to the applicability of [the state legislation] would not, on its own, be a land use decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 379-80. We further noted that, because the state legislation did not \u201cinvolve application of land use planning goals or any comprehensive plan provision,\u201d a decision that does \u201cnothing more than determine the applicability of the [state legislation] would not meet the statutory definition of a land use decision.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Relying on that language, Hanson asserts that the city\u2019s decision to remove the historic designation under ORS 197.772(3) is not a land use decision. In Hanson\u2019s view, the city has simply made a \u201cdecision determining the applicability of state law,\u201d and, like in <em>Leupold, </em>that decision does not involve the application of any land use planning goals or comprehensive plan provision. Thus, Hanson argues that LUBA did not have jurisdiction because the city did not make a land use decision as defined in ORS 197.015.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">The problem with Hanson\u2019s argument is that it fails to account for the city\u2019s actions that occurred as a consequence of its conclusion that ORS 197.772(3) applied to Hanson\u2019s property. The city concluded that the statute applied, requiring removal of the historic designation. The city lists all historic resources on the Landmark Designation List \u2014 the local inventory of historic sites, structures, and objects \u2014 which is codified in Lake Oswego Municipal Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>section 50.06.009. After deciding that ORS 197.772(3) required it to remove the historic designation, the city then removed the property from the Landmark Designation List by amending section 50.06.009. Thus, the city did more than just determine the applicability of state law. It amended the Landmark Designation List, a land use regulation, which places the city\u2019s actions squarely within the definition of \u201cland use decision.\u201d ORS 197.015(10)(a)(A)(iii) (defining \u201cland use decision\u201d to include \u201c[a] final decision or determination made by a local government * * * that concerns the * * * amendment * * * of * * * [a] land use regulation\u201d). Hanson does not point to any applicable exclusion from the definition of \u201cland use decision\u201d and we find none. Thus, we reject Hanson\u2019s first assignment of error and conclude that LUBA had jurisdiction to hear LOPS\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-3\">We next examine Hanson\u2019s second assignment of error challenging LUBA\u2019s interpretation of ORS 197.772(3). ORS 197.772 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-4\">\u201c(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a local government shall allow <em>a property owner </em>to refuse to consent to any form of historic property designation at any point during the designation process. Such refusal to consent shall remove the property from any form of consideration for historic property designation under ORS 358.480 to 358.545 [concerning application, classification, and assessment of historic properties for statewide preservation program] or other law except for consideration or nomination to the National Register of Historic Places pursuant to the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-5\">\u201c(3) A local government shall allow <em>a property owner </em>to remove from the property a historic property designation that was imposed on the property by the local government.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">(Emphasis added.) Thus, the statute has two functions. Under subsection (1), for designations made after the statute\u2019s enactment, a local government cannot place a historic designation on the property if the property owner refuses to consent to the designation. And, under subsection (3) of the statute, a local government must remove a designation placed on the property if (1) the individual seeking removal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>of the historic designation is <em>\u201ca </em>property owner\u201d to whom the statute applies, and (2) <em>\u201ca </em>historic property designation\u201d had been \u201cimposed on the property by the local government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">In determining if the city properly applied subsection (3) to Hanson\u2019s property, in its order, LUBA confronted the meaning of \u201cimposed on the property\u201d and whether <em>\u201ca </em>property owner\u201d included only persons who owned the property at the time of the historic designation or also included subsequent owners. Based on a prior LUBA opinion and the legislative history of ORS 197.772(3), LUBA concluded that the phrase \u201cimposed on the property *** meant imposed over the objections of the property owner at the time of designation,\u201d which would apply to the Hanson property. However, based on its examination of the text, context, and legislative history of the statute, and applying statutory maxims of interpretation, LUBA then concluded that the phrase \u201ca property owner\u201d does not include \u201cpersons who become owners of the property after it is designated.\u201d Thus, because Hanson was not the property owner at the time of its historic designation, LUBA reversed the city\u2019s decision applying ORS 197.772(3) to her property. Hanson challenges LUBA\u2019s interpretation of the phrase \u201ca property owner\u201d in the statute. Thus, the question before us is whether the legislature intended subsection (3) to apply only to the property owner at the time of the historic designation, or whether it also intended that subsequent owners could remove a designation imposed on the property before their ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">We review LUBA\u2019s interpretation of ORS 197.772 to determine whether it is \u201cunlawful in substance.\u201d ORS 197.850(9)(a); <em>Greenfield v. Multnomah County, </em>259 Or App 687, 690, 317 P3d 274 (2013). In construing that statute, we apply the methodology set out in <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610, 859 P2d 1143 (1993), <em>as modified by State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-73, 206 P3d 1042 (2009), and \u201cgive primary weight to the text and context of the provision [s] in light of any legislative history that may be appropriately considered.\u201d <em>Greenfield, </em>259 Or App at 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">We have considered both the text and context of the statute, as well as the parties\u2019 arguments based on the text and context. In brief, we note that the legislature used the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>term <em>\u201ca </em>property owner,\u201d and not <em>\u201cthe </em>property owner ,\u201d in subsection (3), which indicates generally that the universe of property owners was not necessarily circumscribed by the legislature. <em>See State v. Rodriguez, </em>217 Or App 24, 30-31, 175 P3d 471 (2007) (citing <em>Carroll and Murphy, </em>186 Or App 59, 68, 61 P3d 964 (2003), for the proposition that the legislature generally uses the indefinite article <em>\u201ca\u201d </em>to refer to an unidentified, undetermined, or unspecified object). However, the use of an indefinite, instead of a definite, article, in this instance, does not answer the precise question before us. Also, because post-enactment, subsection (1) ensures that property owners have a mechanism to prevent local designation, the contextual structure of the statute indicates that subsection (3) was meant to provide a mechanism for property owners to remove a designation placed on their property and over an owner\u2019s objection before enactment of ORS 197.772. Again, that context does not clarify whether the legislature intended that <em>subsequent owners </em>could use subsection (3) to remove a pre-enactment designation. Thus, the text and context of the subsection does not shed much light on the parties\u2019 particular dispute over the term <em>\u201ca </em>property owner,\u201d and a lengthy discussion of the term in that regard would not be beneficial to the bench, bar, or the parties. However, the legislative history is helpful, so we focus our discussion on that history.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-3\">The issue of owner consent to a local historic designation was hotly contested in the committee work sessions on the section of the bill that became ORS 197.772 because it eliminated local government control. On May 2, 1995, the House Committee on General Government and Regulatory Reform met to consider Senate Bill (SB) 588.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At that work session, the representatives discussed several newly introduced amendments. Relevant to this case are the SB 588-A9 amendments and the A10 amendments. The A9 amendments eventually became ORS 197.772(3) and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>A10 amendments became ORS 197.772(1). Or Laws 1995, ch 693, \u00a7 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">At the May 2, 1995, work session, Representative Lewis stated that the original intent in drafting the A9 amendments had been to allow \u201cpeople who, since the implementation of the historic designation under Goal 5[,] * * * have basically been coerced into the historic property designation\u201d to use the mechanism under the A9 amendments to have the historic property designation removed. Tape Recording, House Committee on General Government and Regulatory Reform, SB 588, May 2, 1995, Tape 126, Side A (statement of Rep Lewis).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">At the May 4, 1995, work session, the committee was split on the advisability of the A9 amendments, with those opposed expressing concern that the A9 amendments would \u201cwreak havoc\u201d on established local historic districts. <em>See </em>Tape Recording, House Committee on General Government and Regulatory Reform, SB 588, May 4, 1995, Tape 130, Side B (statement of Rep Johnston). The majority of the committee, however, adopted the A9 amendments as proposed. The committee then took up the A10 amendments and the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-6\">\u201c [Rep. Johnston:] *:|: * [C] ould somebody, as you understand this, consent under [A] 10 and later ask to be out under [A] 9?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-8\">\u201c [Rep. Johnston:] * * * I\u2019m just trying to see how these things merge. I want to know if \u2014 [on] my number [A] 10\u2014 we are granting a property owner the right to refuse to consent to any form of historic property \u2014 if they choose to. They could choose to agree. You know, I have a piece of property in downtown Ashland, and I decide to agree. And now I\u2019m part of this historic district. Could I then, under the [A] 9 we just [passed,] two years later decide to take it out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-9\">\u201c[Rep. Milne:] Representative Johnston, my intent in this amendment, where it says on line 3, \u2018historic property designation that was imposed on the property.\u2019 My feeling there is that what we\u2019re trying to say \u2014 what my intent <em>is </em>\u2014 when <em>property owners were not allowed to consent and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number><em>government imposed it on them, that now they would have an opportunity to remove their property from that designation.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-3\">\u201c[Rep. Johnston:] Ok, let\u2019s call those Class A. So I understand those. So, now, I\u2019m talking about Class B. A person who does it under section [A] 10 \u2014 had the opportunity not to do it, went ahead and did it \u2014 can they, two years later, under [A] 9, take their property out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-4\">\u201c[Rep. Milne:] That was not my intent, Representative Johnston.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-6\">\u201c[Chair Tiernan:] So, I guess once you put your property in, it\u2019s in.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">Tape Recording, House Committee on General Government and Regulatory Reform, SB 588, May 4, 1995, Tape 130, Side B (statements of Reps Johnston, Hayden, and Milne, and Chair Tiernan) (emphasis added)). As that exchange shows, the committee that added ORS 197.772(3) intended that the amendments would allow individuals who own property on which historic designations had been involuntarily imposed by the local government \u2014 before the enactment of ORS 197.772 \u2014 to have that designation removed. However, the committee also intended to limit that mechanism, so that property owners who had consented to designation before enactment, or not utilized the mechanism provided by subsection (1) to refuse consent after the enactment of ORS 197.772, could not use subsection (3) to remove the designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">The House passed SB 588 with the A9 and A10 amendments. The bill then went to a joint conference committee after the Senate refused to concur in the House version, which resulted in additional amendments to the bill which are not relevant here. Minutes, Joint Conference Committee on SB 588, June 3, 1995. After that conference, both the Senate and the House repassed SB 588. The text of ORS 197.772(3) is the same as originally proposed in the A9 amendments. <em>See </em>House Committee on General Government and Regulatory Reform, May 2, 1995, Ex N (proposed A9 amendments).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">From that legislative history, we conclude that the legislature intended to allow any property owner that had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>local historic designation forced on their property to remove that designation. The House Committee that adopted the A9 amendments did not contemplate that \u201ca property owner\u201d in subsection (3) would be limited to the property owner at time of the designation; instead, the committee was concerned with addressing, and rectifying, local government designations that had been \u201cimposed\u201d on property. Indeed, the A9 amendments\u2019 opponents were concerned that the amendments would lead to the dismantling of local historic districts, and the amendments\u2019 proponents did not assert otherwise in the face of those concerns, which supports the understanding that ORS 197.772(3) was intended to be broadly applicable. The legislature was thus focused on correcting impositions of unwanted designations, and not on the identity of the property owner that might be now stuck with that designation. And, the legislature did not include any narrowing text that would lead us to conclude otherwise. We thus conclude that Hanson, as the successor property owner to Wilmot, who objected to the original historic designation, is entitled to have that designation removed under ORS 197.772(3). Accordingly, we reverse LUBA\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">Reversed on petition; affirmed on cross-petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b831-6\"> Richard and Mary Wilmot acquired the property as tenants by the entirety.

Having reviewed LUBA\u2019s order, the city council\u2019s \u201cFindings, Conclusions, &amp; Order,\u201d and the evidence in the record, we conclude that LUBA\u2019s determination that Richard Wilmot had objected to the historic designation was supported by substantial evidence.
