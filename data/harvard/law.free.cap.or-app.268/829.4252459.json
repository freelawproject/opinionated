Youth\u2019s sister spoke to youth\u2019s father, and youth\u2019s father called youth.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Youth told his father that he had been kidnapped from the house at gunpoint and driven to Portland, but that he had escaped and had called two friends, who had come to pick him up. Youth\u2019s father met youth and his friends in Salem and drove youth back home. During the drive, youth\u2019s father told youth that they needed to call the police, and youth twice told his father not to do so. After they returned home, youth\u2019s father, who believed that his son had been kidnapped, called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">Miller, a detective with the Lincoln County Sheriffs Office, responded to the family\u2019s home in Depoe Bay. She first interviewed youth\u2019s father, who told her that youth had told him that youth had been kidnapped to Portland but had escaped.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">Miller then interviewed youth. In the \u201cfirst version\u201d of his story, youth told Miller that, while he was in his bedroom, he had seen a man standing outside his window. According to youth, the man \u201cwas wearing sunglasses, a hoodie, and a scarf over his mouth. He had a gun, and he ordered [youth] to come outside.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>Youth told Miller that he climbed out of the window, and the man, who \u201chad him at gunpoint [,]\u201d then walked him to the car, put him in the backseat of a black sedan, and drove him to Portland. Youth said that, while they were driving around in Portland, they stopped at a stoplight, and youth jumped out of the car, ran, \u201czigzag[ged],\u201d found a 7-Eleven, and called two of his friends, who came to pick him up.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-3\">When youth showed Miller his bedroom and the scene outside his bedroom, Miller observed that youth\u2019s story was not consistent with what she found in the bedroom. The bedroom had not been disturbed. The screen was on the window, the lights were out, and the blinds were up. Because things \u201cjust did not make sense\u201d to Miller, she told youth that she did not believe him. Youth then \u201cgave [Miller] a new and improved version\u201d of the events on the night in question. \u201c[H]e added that the gunman was speaking Russian with the other man who was driving.\u201d He also added that, \u201cafter he ordered him out the window, then the gunman turned and put the screen back in the window.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">Miller repeatedly advised youth that she did not believe him and gave him \u201clots of opportunities to tell the truth, because the evidence was just not fitting the story.\u201d She also advised him that, if he persisted with his story, she was going to have to call out the Major Crime Team. Specifically, Miller told youth that the police were going to have to go to Portland and that \u201c[t]here was going to be a lot of investigation, because if he was kidnapped, it was very serious.\u201d In other words, she told youth that, \u201cif someone\u2019s out there who\u2019s going to kidnap people and hurt people [,]\u201d then the police \u201cneeded to get on it\u201d because it was a \u201cserious matter.\u201d She also explained that it was a \u201cfinancial burden\u201d \u2014 i.e., that it involved a significant expense \u2014 to call out the members of the Major Crime Team on a weekend. She also specifically warned youth that, if his story was determined to be false, he could get a citation for initiating a false report.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">When, despite those warnings, youth \u201cstuck to * * * his version\u201d of events, Miller \u201cactivated the Major Crime Team.\u201d Several members of the Major Crime Team responded, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>and they met at the Depoe Bay Fire Hall. \u201c [P] art of [the] Major Crime Team is State Police from Springfield!,]\u201d and two detectives came from Springfield, Oregon, to assist. In the meantime, Miller interviewed youth\u2019s friends, who had picked him up in Portland. Another deputy, who assisted Miller, photographed youth\u2019s bedroom. He also photographed the outside of the bedroom window and the yard and seized the screen to fingerprint it. Miller, who had obtained youth\u2019s consent to search two cell phones, assigned a sergeant and a detective to search those phones.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">While searching the phones, the police discovered text messages between youth and his friends \u201cabout a plan to *** meet and sneak out.\u201d For example, in one message, youth texted, \u201cI\u2019m going to * * * Portland tonight. Wish me all the luck you can.\u201d In another message, youth texted, \u201cKK, tell me when you\u2019re off so I know the fifteen-minute mark.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">The police then returned to the house and told youth what they had found. When confronted with that evidence, youth was initially \u201cdefiant,\u201d but, after speaking to his parents, he admitted that he had not told the truth \u2014 that is, \u201che admitted that he wasn\u2019t kidnapped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">The Lincoln County Juvenile Department subsequently filed an amended petition to find youth within the jurisdiction of the court for violating ORS 162.375 by \u201cunlawfully and knowingly initiating] a false report, which was transmitted to a law enforcement agency, to-wit: Lincoln County Major Crime Team.\u201d At an adjudicatory hearing, youth moved to dismiss the case on the ground that the state failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish that he had violated ORS 162.375 under a proper construction of the statute. Youth argued that he \u201cdid not do anything unlawful\u201d because he merely lied to his father about a kidnapping and there was no evidence that he knew that his father was going to call the police. Youth also argued that he did not violate ORS 162.375 when he lied to Miller, on the ground that false statements made to a police officer in the context of an investigation \u201cdo not constitute a violation of the law.\u201d To support his latter argument, youth relied upon <em>State v. McCrorey, </em>216 Or App 301, 172 P3d 271 (2007), which we discuss below.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>The state responded that there was sufficient evidence for the court to find that youth violated ORS 162.375. The state argued that there were \u201ctwo pivotal points\u201d in this case \u2014 the point at which youth\u2019s father called the police and the point at which Miller activated the Major Crime Team. As to the first pivotal point, the state argued that youth knowingly initiated a false alarm or report when he told his father that he had been kidnapped, because youth had to have known that his father was going to call the police. As to the second pivotal point, the state argued that youth\u2019s conduct was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-4\">\u201cnot merely just lying to officers in the course of an investigation. It is, \u2018If you persist with this story, I\u2019m going to have to report this to the Major Crime Team. I\u2019m going to have to report this to a further law enforcement agency. And so this is your time to tell me, \u2018Don\u2019t do that.\u2019 Because you, you are initiating this action that I am going to have to take,\u2019 is what Detective Miller is telling him. \u2018This is your time to stop that.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-5\">\u201cAnd he persisted with his story. He caused her to initiate a callout of the Major Crime Team. And that is * * * initiating a false report.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">The juvenile court denied youth\u2019s motion to dismiss. In so doing, the court stated, \u201cIn this case, the initial report was false, * * * going to Father then to the police. And * * * [youth] kept the thing going by pushing * * * Detective Miller on to doing what the statute was intended to stop, which was imposing an *** obligation on * * * law enforcement on matters which weren\u2019t true.\u201d The court then found youth within the jurisdiction of the court for violating ORS 162.375, and youth now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">On appeal, youth argues that the court erred in finding him within the jurisdiction of the court for violating ORS 162.375, essentially renewing his argument that there was insufficient evidence to support his adjudication under a proper construction of the statute. Youth first argues that he did not violate ORS 162.375 because \u201cyouth\u2019s father, not the youth, initiated a police investigation, directly contrary to the youth\u2019s requests that he not do so.\u201d Again relying on <em>McCrorey, </em>youth also argues that his statements to Miller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>were merely \u201cunsworn, oral falsifications made in response to police questioning.\u201d 216 Or App at 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">The state responds that \u201cyouth\u2019s conduct violated the statute in two different ways.\u201d The state first argues that \u201cyouth initiated a false alarm or report which was transmitted to a law enforcement agency when youth falsely told his father that youth had been kidnapped, when youth knew that his father would transmit that false alarm or report to law enforcement.\u201d The state also argues that \u201cyouth again initiated a false report to the Lincoln County Major Crime unit when he falsely reported to Detective Miller that he had been kidnapped, knowing that she would have to transmit that report to the Lincoln County Major Crime Team[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">The issue on appeal is whether the juvenile court erred when it found youth within the jurisdiction of the court for violating ORS 162.375 \u2014 that is, whether there was sufficient evidence to support youth\u2019s adjudication. That ruling involves an issue of statutory interpretation, which we review for legal error. <em>See State v. Thompson, </em>328 Or 248, 256, 971 P2d 879, <em>cert den, </em>527 US 1042 (1999) (\u201cA trial court\u2019s interpretation of a statute is reviewed for legal error.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">When interpreting a statute, our goal is to discern legislative intent. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). We start with the statutory text because it is \u201cthe best evidence of the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). When a term is defined by a statute, we look to the statutory definition, but when a term is not statutorily defined, we look to dictionary definitions to ascertain the plain meaning of the term. <em>See Gaines, </em>346 Or at 175 (using dictionary definitions to discern the plain, natural, and ordinary meaning of terms); <em>see also State v. Fries, </em>344 Or 541, 545-50, 185 P3d 453 (2008) (using context to determine which of multiple definitions is the one that the legislature intended). \u201cWe ascertain the legislature\u2019s intentions by examining the text of the statute in its context, along with relevant legislative history, and, if necessary, canons of construction.\u201d <em>State v. Cloutier, </em>351 Or 68, 75, 261 P3d 1234 (2011) (citing <em>Gaines, </em>346 Or at 171-73).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>As noted above, ORS 162.375(1) provides that \u201c[a] person commits the crime of initiating a false report if the person knowingly initiates a false alarm or report which is transmitted to a fire department, law enforcement agency or other organization that deals with emergencies involving danger to life or property.\u201d The relevant terms of ORS 162.375 are not statutorily defined. However, as we have previously explained, \u201c[t]he dictionary definition of\u2018initiate\u2019 is \u2018to begin or [s]et going\u2019\u201d and \u201c[t]he term connotes proactive, as opposed to reactive, conduct.\u201d <em>McCrorey, </em>216 Or App at 305 (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1164 (unabridged ed 2002)). As used in ORS 162.375, the statutory term \u201calarm\u201d refers to something, like a fire alarm, which makes a sound or provides a signal that gives notice of danger. <em>See Webster\u2019s </em>at 48 (defining \u201calarm\u201d as \u201ca sound or signal giving notice of danger or calling attention to some event or condition\u201d). As used in ORS 162.375, the statutory term \u201creport,\u201d at minimum, refers to an assertion that a person should reasonably understand, in the context in which the assertion is made, is likely to be transmitted to one of the specified emergency responders and cause a response. <em>See id. </em>at 1925 (defining the noun \u201creport\u201d as \u201cnotification\u201d; defining the verb \u201creport\u201d as \u201cto make known to the proper authorities : give notification of &lt;~a fire&gt; &lt;~an accident&gt;\u201d) (boldface in original). The statutory term \u201ctransmitted\u201d is a form of the word \u201ctransmit,\u201d which may be defined as \u201cto cause to go or be conveyed to another person or placet.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2429. Thus, under the plain terms of the statute, a person violates ORS 162.375 when the person knowingly begins or sets going either a false alarm (a sound or signal) or a false report (an assertion or notification that the person should reasonably understand is likely to be transmitted to one of the specified emergency responders and cause a response), causing that false alarm or report to be conveyed to a fire department, law enforcement agency, or other organization that deals with emergencies involving danger to life or property.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">When considering those terms in context, we note, as an initial matter, that ORS 162.375 contains both active and passive verbs. The term \u201cinitiates,\u201d which connotes proactive conduct, is set out in the active voice. By setting out the term \u201cinitiates\u201d in the active voice, the legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>signaled that the actor is \u201cthe person\u201d who knowingly begins or sets going a false alarm or report. In contrast, the term \u201ctransmitted\u201d is set out in the passive voice. By setting out the term \u201ctransmitted\u201d in the passive voice, the legislature signaled that it was choosing not to identify the actor or mechanism that must transmit the false alarm or report. <em>See State v. Mullins, </em>352 Or 343, 349, 284 P3d 1139 (2012) (stating that the statutory wording, \u201c\u2018after the defendant receives notice,\u2019\u201d as provided in ORS 138.083, \u201cis set out in the passive voice and therefore does not identify the actor who must deliver notice to the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">We further note that ORS 162.375 was enacted as part of the omnibus 1971 criminal code revisions by the Criminal Law Revision Commission. Or Laws 1971, ch 743, \u00a7 212. While revising the Oregon Criminal Code, the Oregon Criminal Law Revision Commission kept careful records of the proceedings. <em>See State v. Garcia, </em>288 Or 413, 416, 605 P2d 671 (1980) (noting that carefully kept records of the proceedings \u201cprovide a rich source for determination of the drafters\u2019 intent\u201d). Commentary regarding the section that is now codified as ORS 162.375 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-5\">\u201cCriminal statutes dealing with false fire alarms are found in nearly all American jurisdictions. The rationale supporting criminal liability is based upon the waste of government resources involved and the creation of circumstances where personnel and equipment are made unavailable to deal with legitimate emergencies. Section 212 is intended to reach fire and police departments, and all other organizations, public or private, that respond to emergency alarms involving danger to life or property. The section applies whether the false alarm was directly or indirectly caused to be transmitted. Criminal liability should not be dependent on whether the person acted himself or caused another to act for him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Commentary to Criminal Law Revision Commission Proposed Oregon Criminal Code, Final Draft and Report \u00a7 212, 208-09 (July 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Before applying those principles to the facts of this case, we pause to clarify the scope of our analysis. The parties appear to agree that this case involves two separate acts \u2014 as the trial court put it \u2014 (1) youth \u201cgoing to Father\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>who then went to the police,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) youth \u201cke[eping] the thing going by pushing *** Detective Miller on to doing what the statute was intended to stop, which was imposing an * * * obligation on * * * law enforcement on matters which weren\u2019t true.\u201d We focus our analysis on youth\u2019s second act\u2014 that is, his conduct with Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">When we apply the plain terms of the statute to youth\u2019s second act, we first note that, when speaking to Miller, youth repeatedly asserted that he had been kidnapped, when in fact, he had not been kidnapped. We further note that, at that point, Miller had not yet activated the Major Crime Team, and thus, no false report had been transmitted to the Major Crime Team. That fact is significant to our analysis because, according to Miller\u2019s uncontroverted testimony, Miller repeatedly told youth that she did not believe his story and gave youth \u201clots of opportunities to tell the truth.\u201d Presumably, if youth had told Miller the truth at that point, no false report would have been transmitted to the Major Crime Team and the Major Crime Team would not have been activated. We also note that Miller advised youth that, if he persisted with his story, she was going to have to call out the Major Crime Team. That fact is also significant to our analysis because, in the context of this case, youth knew that his assertion was going to be transmitted to a law enforcement agency and cause a response. Thus, we conclude that, when, in this case, youth repeatedly and falsely asserted to Miller that he had been kidnapped, he knowingly initiated a false report which was transmitted to the Major Crime Team, an organization that deals with emergencies involving danger to life or property, in violation of ORS 162.375.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">That conclusion is supported by legislative history. As noted above,, legislative history indicates that criminal liability under ORS 162.375 does not depend on whether a person acts for himself or causes another to act for him. Thus, the fact that the false report was transmitted to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>Major Crime Team by Miller, and not by youth, does not make ORS 162.375 inapplicable. Further, youth, who was warned that there was significant expense involved in calling out the members of the Major Crime Team on a weekend, caused \u201cthe waste of government resources\u201d and made law enforcement personnel and equipment \u201cunavailable to deal with legitimate emergencies [,]\u201d thus causing the exact harm that the statute was enacted to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">In so concluding, we specifically reject youth\u2019s argument, based on <em>McCrorey, </em>that his statements were merely \u201cunsworn, oral falsifications made in response to police questioning.\u201d 216 Or App at 306. In <em>McCrorey, </em>the defendant\u2019s daughter was driving a vehicle without a license when the vehicle was struck by a hit-and-run driver, and someone<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> reported that accident to the police. The defendant, who was not in the vehicle at the time of the accident, later told an investigating officer that, when the accident occurred, she was driving the vehicle with her daughter as passenger. Based on that conduct, defendant was charged with violating ORS 162.375.</p>\n<p id=\"AOR\">The issue in <em>McCrorey </em>was \u201cwhether a person may be convicted under [ORS 162.375] for initiating a true report and later supplying false information about that true report in response to police questioning, or whether a person is culpable only if the initial report of the incident is false.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 305. After reviewing the legislative history of ORS 162.375,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>we \u201cconcluded] that a conviction under that statute must be supported by evidence that the defendant <em>initiated </em>the falsification, rather than mere evidence that a defendant initiated a process that later resulted in that person giving false information about a true incident to police.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 306 (emphasis in original). We further concluded that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the defendant had initiated a false report within the meaning of ORS 162.375, because the record revealed only that the \u201cdefendant lied while later giving a statement to the police\u201d and that evidence did \u201cnot support an inference that [the] defendant gave that information as part of the initial report\u201d of the incident. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">As our review demonstrates, <em>McCrorey </em>does not aid youth. First, the question at issue in <em>McCrorey </em>\u2014 \u201cwhether a person may be convicted under [ORS 162.375] for initiating a true report and later supplying false information about that true report in response to police questioning\u201d \u2014 is not directly at issue in this case because youth\u2019s conduct does not involve a true report or a true incident. <em>Id. </em>at 305. Further, the conduct at issue in <em>McCrorey </em>\u2014 making false statements to police about a true incident \u2014 did not cause a false report \u201cto go or be conveyed to another person or place\u201d \u2014 that is, the defendant\u2019s false statements were not further transmitted to another law enforcement agency or other organization that deals with emergencies involving danger to life or property. <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 2429.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">In sum, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support youth\u2019s adjudication based on a violation of ORS 162.375 \u2014 that is, we conclude that, when youth repeatedly and falsely asserted to Miller that he had been kidnapped, he knowingly initiated a false report which was transmitted to the Major Crime Team, an organization that deals with emergencies involving danger to life or property. Thus, the juvenile court did not err when it found youth within the jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b848-9\"> ORS 162.375(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-10\">\u201cA person commits the crime of initiating a false report if the person knowingly initiates a false alarm or report which is transmitted to a fire department, law enforcement agency or other organization that deals with emergencies involving danger to life or property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">ORS 162.375 was amended in 2013.
