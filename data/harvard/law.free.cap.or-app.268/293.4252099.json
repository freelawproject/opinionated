Defendant argues that the permanent suspension of her driving privileges violates her substantive due process right to travel under the United States Constitution. The state argues that we must dismiss defendant\u2019s appeal because her claim is not appealable under ORS 138.050. As explained below, we agree with the state that we lack jurisdiction over defendant\u2019s challenge to her sentence and, accordingly, we dismiss her appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The facts are mainly procedural and are undisputed. Defendant pleaded guilty to, and was convicted of misdemeanor DUII. Defendant had two prior DUII convictions in 1985. Because defendant had a total of three DUII convictions, the court was required under ORS 813.400(2)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and ORS 809.235(l)(b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to impose a lifetime suspension of defendant\u2019s driving privileges. Defendant objected, arguing that a lifetime suspension of driving privileges based on the two, older DUII convictions violated her substantive due process rights. The court overruled the objection and imposed the suspension of defendant\u2019s license. Thereafter, defendant filed this appeal challenging the constitutionality of the lifetime suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The state moved to dismiss defendant\u2019s appeal on the ground that her constitutional claim was not appealable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>under ORS 138.050 given the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of that statute in <em>State v. Cloutier, </em>351 Or 68, 261 P3d 1234 (2011). The Appellate Commissioner agreed with the state and ordered dismissal of the appeal. Defendant then petitioned for reconsideration, arguing that <em>Cloutier </em>did not address whether a defendant who has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor may appeal a sentence under ORS 138.050(1) (a) on the ground that the statute under which the defendant was sentenced was unconstitutional on substantive due process grounds. On reconsideration, the Appellate Commissioner vacated the order of dismissal and referred the issue to the panel considering defendant\u2019s appeal on the merits. The state\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal is now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">Criminal defendants do not have an inherent right to appellate court review. Rather, \u201cthe right to appeal is wholly statutory and an appellant must establish that the decision from which the appeal is taken is appealable under some statutory provision.\u201d <em>Waybrant v. Bernstein, </em>294 Or 650, 6 53, 661 P2d 931 (1983). As in this case, \u201c[w]hen the appeal is from a judgment based on a plea to a misdemeanor, jurisdiction lies, if at all, under ORS 138.050(1).\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>265 Or App 425, 432, 335 P3d 332 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Under ORS 138.050(1),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">\u201cexcept as otherwise provided in ORS 135.335, [concerning conditional pleas,] a defendant who has pleaded guilty or no contest may take an appeal from a judgment or order described in ORS 138.053 only when the defendant makes a colorable showing that the disposition:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">\u201c(a) Exceeds the maximum allowable by law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-8\">\u201c(b) Is unconstitutionally cruel and unusual.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">Here, defendant argues that her claim is appeal-able under subsection (l)(a), because she has made a colorable showing that the lifetime suspension of her driving privileges \u201c[e]xeeds the maximum allowable by law\u201d on the ground that it violates her substantive due process right to travel under the federal constitution. In essence, defendant\u2019s argument is that the statute that required the court to impose the lifetime suspension is unconstitutional and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>invalid, and, therefore, her sentence \u201c[e]xceeds the maximum allowable by law.\u201d She argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Cloutier </em>is distinguishable because, there, the defendant contested the constitutionality of the <em>procedures </em>used to impose the sentence, and, here, defendant contests the constitutionality of the underlying legislation itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The state replies that <em>Cloutier </em>is dispositive. In that case, the Supreme Court determined that appealability under ORS 138.050(l)(a) is limited to challenges to <em>\u201ca </em>disposition that exceeds a maximum expressed by means of legislation, not the state or federal constitution.\u201d 351 Or at 104. According to the state, defendant\u2019s contention that her substantive challenge to the constitutionality of the underlying law is distinct from the procedural challenge in <em>Cloutier </em>is unavailing given the court\u2019s conclusion that challenges under subsection (1) (a) must be based on statutory, rather than constitutional, limits. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">In our recent opinion in <em>State v. Taylor, </em>266 Or App 813, 340 P3d 68 (2014), we examined and, in light of <em>Cloutier, </em>rejected the appealability of a similar constitutional challenge under ORS 138.050(l)(a). In <em>Taylor, </em>a jury in 2009 had found the defendant guilty of misdemeanor DUII. After a successful appeal, <em>see State v. Taylor, </em>247 Or App 339, 268 P3d 795 (2011), the defendant on remand pleaded guilty to the charge, and the court entered a judgment of conviction in 2012. By that time, the legislature had increased the DUII conviction fee in ORS 813.030 and required courts to impose the higher fee regardless of when the offense occurred so long as the judgment of conviction was entered after the effective date of the amendment. <em>Taylor, </em>266 Or App at 814. Accordingly, the trial court imposed the higher fee over the defendant\u2019s objection that doing so violated the <em>ex post facto </em>clauses of the Oregon and federal constitutions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">On appeal, the defendant argued that his claim was appealable because his challenge to the DUII conviction fee fit within ORS 138.050(l)(a). The defendant contended that the fee imposed by the court \u201c[e]xceed[ed] the maximum allowable by law\u201d because the fee was greater than that authorized by the statute that the court should have applied, <em>i.e., </em>the 2009 statute. <em>Taylor, </em>266 Or App at 815-16. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>We noted that, contrary to the defendant\u2019s argument that he was not making a constitutional claim regarding his sentence, to support his conclusion that the fee imposed exceeded the maximum allowed by law, the defendant had to have been making a constitutional argument, namely, that the 2012 statute was an unconstitutional <em>ex post facto </em>law that the trial court could not apply. <em>Id. </em>at 816-17. We concluded that the defendant\u2019s jurisdictional argument failed because, in <em>Cloutier, </em>the Supreme Court determined that ORS 138.050(l)(a) \u201cdoes not encompass claims brought under the Oregon or United States constitutions, and ORS 138.050(l)(b) only encompasses the constitutional claim that a disposition is cruel and unusual.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>266 Or App at 818. Because the defendant\u2019s claim required the application of a constitutional provision other than the protection against cruel and unusual punishment, it fell outside the scope of ORS 138.050(1). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">In this case, defendant does not contend that we have jurisdiction over her appeal because the sentence is unconstitutionally cruel and unusual under ORS 138.050(l)(b). Nor does she argue that the trial court violated the <em>statute </em>governing the suspension and revocation of driving privileges. Rather, defendant\u2019s only claim on appeal is that the statute that permitted the court to order the permanent suspension of her driving privileges is unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. As we explained in <em>Taylor, </em>however, we do not have jurisdiction under ORS 138.050(l)(a) to review such a claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">\u201c[A]s interpreted in <em>Cloutier, </em>neither ORS 138.050(l)(a) nor ORS 138.050(l)(b) allows this court to review constitutional challenges to a disposition in a judgment of conviction for a misdemeanor that follows a defendant\u2019s guilty or no contest plea, except for a challenge that the disposition is cruel and unusual. Constitutional claims that fall outside of the scope of ORS 138.050(1) \u2018must be left to possible post-conviction relief.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">266 Or App at 817 (quoting <em>Cloutier, </em>351 Or at 104). As in <em>Taylor, </em>because defendant\u2019s claim rests on a constitutional provision other than the protection against cruel and unusual punishment, and because she does not argue that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>the trial court was not authorized by statute to impose the sentence in this case, we lack jurisdiction over defendant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">We also reject defendant\u2019s argument that the fact that her claim rests on a <em>substantive </em>due process ground \u2014 in this case, her right to travel \u2014 as opposed to a <em>procedural </em>due process ground \u2014 as in <em>Cloutier </em>\u2014 is a meaningful distinction under ORS 138.050(l)(a). Although defendant has seized on the Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>Cloutier </em>that ORS 138.050(l)(a) \u201cdoes not refer to a sentence that was imposed by <em>means of procedures </em>that violate the Due Process Clause of the federal constitution,\u201d 351 Or at 104 (emphasis added), the <em>Cloutier </em>court\u2019s holding and reasoning do not leave room for defendant\u2019s claimed distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">In <em>Cloutier, </em>the Supreme Court analyzed the text, context, and legislative history of ORS 138.050(1) and rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the word \u201claw,\u201d as used in the phrase \u201c[e]xceeds the maximum allowable by law\u201d in subsection (l)(a), was broad enough to include any sentence that had been entered in violation of the constitution. 351 Or at 94, 104. The court concluded that, although the defendant\u2019s proposed reading of ORS 138.050(l)(a) \u201cmay be a plausible reading of the bare wording of that statute,\u201d such a reading \u201cis ultimately untenable when other indicia of legislative intent are taken into account,\u201d including the fact that more than a century of sentencing legislation and case law \u201cconsistently refers to \u2018maximum\u2019 sentences in terms of <em>statutory </em>m\u00e1ximums.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104 (emphasis in original). In sum, the court\u2019s analysis in <em>Cloutier </em>does not permit defendant\u2019s challenge to her sentence under ORS 138.050(l)(a), because she does not assert that her sentence exceeds a statutory maximum. Therefore, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss granted; appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-7\"> ORS 813.400(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-8\">\u201cA person convicted of felony driving while under the influence of intoxicants, or a person convicted of misdemeanor driving while under the influence of intoxicants for a third or subsequent time, is subject to revocation of driving privileges as provided in ORS 809.235.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b312-9\"> ORS 809.235(l)(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-10\">\u201cThe court shall order that a person\u2019s driving privileges be permanently revoked if the person is convicted of felony driving while under the influence of intoxicants in violation of ORS 813.010 or if the person is convicted for a third or subsequent time of any of the following offenses in any combination:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-11\">\u201c(A) Driving while under the influence of intoxicants in violation of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-12\">\u201c(i) ORS 813.010; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-13\">\u201c(ii) The statutory counterpart to ORS 813.010 in another jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
