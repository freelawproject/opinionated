J.</author>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">The Real Estate Agency issued a final order revoking petitioner\u2019s real estate license based on her involvement in two real estate matters, referred to as the McDonald/ Whitney transaction and the Middleton transactions. The agency concluded in its final order that petitioner had violated ORS 696.805(3)(a) in the McDonald/Whitney transaction and had violated ORS 696.805(3)(a), (b), (c), and (d), and OAR 863-015-0145(1) in the Middleton transactions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Petitioner seeks judicial review of the agency\u2019s order, raising four assignments of error. First, she contends that the administrative law judge (ALJ) erred in denying her motion to stay the proceedings or, in the alternative, to grant her use immunity, in light of criminal charges then pending against her in federal court. In her second and third assignments of error, she challenges the merits of the agency\u2019s conclusions that her conduct violated the specified statutory and rule provisions. In her fourth assignment of error, she contends that the agency erred in imposing revocation of her license as a sanction for her conduct because her license had expired during the pendency of the proceedings. We reject petitioner\u2019s second and third assignments of error without discussion. For the reasons explained below, we also reject her first and fourth assignments of error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">We begin by describing the pertinent facts with respect to each transaction; because petitioner does not dispute the agency\u2019s findings of fact, we state the facts consistently with the agency\u2019s final order. We then describe the proceedings below.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">A. <em>The McDonald/Whitney Transaction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">In January 2008, the McDonalds listed their Bend, Oregon, home for sale, with petitioner as the listing agent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Petitioner showed the home to Whitney, whom petitioner also represented, in May of that year. The McDonalds signed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>a disclosure form consenting to the dual representation, though they were not aware that petitioner had a personal relationship with Whitney and had known her for several years.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\">On July 31, 2008, Whitney made an offer to purchase the McDonalds\u2019 home for $585,000, with an earnest money deposit of $1,000 and a closing date of October 25, 2008. In preparing the Residential Real Estate Sale Agreement, petitioner checked a box acknowledging receipt of a check for the earnest money, although petitioner had not actually received a check from Whitney. Along with the agreement, she also presented to the McDonalds a separate document entitled \u201cPromissory Note for Earnest Money,\u201d signed by Whitney, in which Whitney promised to pay the $1,000 earnest money 10 days after mutual acceptance of the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">On August 1, 2008, the McDonalds rejected Whitney\u2019s offer and submitted a counteroffer for $610,000, with an earnest money deposit of $2,500. Whitney accepted and signed the counteroffer on August 5, 2008. Petitioner did not require Whitney to execute a new promissory note or otherwise set a deadline for payment of the increased earnest money. By check dated August 25, 2008, Whitney paid the earnest money amount of $2,500, and it was deposited into a client trust account. In September, Whitney decided not to proceed with the purchase and sought a refund of her earnest money; the McDonalds did not agree to release the earnest money. After negotiations with petitioner\u2019s principal broker, Whitney agreed to surrender the earnest money, and it was paid to the McDonalds on November 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">B. <em>The Middleton Transactions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">On October 16, 2006, Thomas Middleton executed a durable power of attorney (POA), appointing petitioner, his friend of approximately 20 years, as his agent and attorney-in-fact. On the same date, Middleton instructed his attorney, Albertazzi, to hold the POA until Middleton requested that it be provided to petitioner or until Middleton became incapacitated or incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>In 2008, petitioner operated three separate business entities \u2014 Tami Sawyer PC for her real estate activities; Starboard LLC, a real estate investment company; and Genesis Futures, LLC, a property-management company. Due to the declining real estate market at that time, all three businesses \u201cwere experiencing significant financial stress and had difficulty making payments to creditors\u201d; Starboard LLC, for example, owed more than $2,000,000 to four investors. As of January 1, 2008, Middleton had invested $250,000 in Starboard LLC.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">On March 5, 2008, Middleton instructed Albertazzi to deliver the POA to petitioner. On the same date, he established the Thomas S. Middleton Revocable Living Trust (the trust), naming himself as trustee and appointing petitioner successor trustee in the event of Middleton\u2019s resignation, death, or incapacity. The trust required the trustee to sell Middleton\u2019s personal residence following his death, and the proceeds were to be added to the corpus of the trust. Petitioner\u2019s three adult sons were among the beneficiaries of the trust. On July 15, Middleton amended the trust to give the trustee the discretion to rent or sell his residence based on market conditions; he also changed some of the details regarding the distribution of the trust after his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">On July 20, 2008, Middleton provided Albertazzi with final instructions \u2014 signed by petitioner as \u201c[POA] for Thomas S. Middleton\u201d \u2014 stating that he had decided to give the spa at his residence to petitioner \u201cbecause my house is going to be a rental until the real estate market improves. The idea is to eliminate all liability due to injury or accidental drowning from the spa.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Middleton died two days later, on July 22, 2008. On that morning, petitioner told Maunder, an employee of Genesis Futures, LLC, that Middleton wanted to know the rental value of his home. Maunder evaluated the home on July 22 or 23 and told petitioner that she could rent it for $995 per month. The next morning, another of petitioner\u2019s employees asked Maunder for the keys to the house because petitioner had decided to sell it rather than rent it. Petitioner listed the house for sale on July 24, with her company, Tami Sawyer PC, as the listing agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>On September <em>4, </em>an offer was accepted for the purchase of Middleton\u2019s home. Neither the Residential Real Estate Sale Agreement nor the real estate listing disclosed that petitioner was acting as a principal in the transaction in her capacity as successor trustee. In response to an e-mail note from one of Middleton\u2019s sons in early October asking about the house, petitioner told him that she had received an offer on the house and that the sale was likely to close within the week. She told another of Middleton\u2019s sons that she had tried to rent the home but \u201chad not one call\u201d and decided to sell it.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-3\">Petitioner, her husband, and her businesses had outstanding obligations of more than $150,000 due in September and October 2008. Petitioner told employees that the debts would be paid following the sale of Middleton\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">On October 8, petitioner hired a company to move the spa from Middleton\u2019s home to petitioner\u2019s residence. The $550 cost to move the spa was eventually paid from the proceeds of the sale of Middleton\u2019s home; Middleton\u2019s estate was never reimbursed for that cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">On October 9, petitioner, in her capacity as trustee of the Middleton trust, signed a statutory warranty deed conveying Middleton\u2019s home for $219,900; after deducting certain costs associated with the sale, including the costs of moving the spa, the escrow officer issued a check for $202,077.06, payable to petitioner as successor trustee of the trust. Petitioner received a commission of $4,464.85.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">On October 10, Starboard LLC received a bank deposit of $202,077.06; before that deposit, the balance on the Starboard LLC account was $86.80. Also on that date, $70,000 was transferred from the Starboard LLC account to an account held by Genesis Future, LLC, and $20,000 was transferred from the Starboard LLC account to one held by Tami Sawyer PC.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">A \u201cSuccessor Trustee\u2019s Inventory Report\u201d for the trust, prepared by petitioner on November 26, 2008, stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>that, at the time of Middleton\u2019s death, the trust had an investment with Starboard LLC valued at $250,000. The report also stated that the trust had invested an additional $150,000 in Starboard LLC from the proceeds of the sale of Middleton\u2019s home. It also listed $52,568 as an additional asset of the trust, but did not indicate where those funds were held. The value of the trust bank account was listed as $4,563.04 on the date of Middleton\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">C. <em>Agency Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">On December 17, 2009, the agency issued notice to petitioner that it intended to revoke her real estate license based on her conduct in the McDonald/Whitney and Middleton transactions. Petitioner had been licensed by the agency since at least 1995, and her then-current license was set to expire on April 30, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">In connection with the McDonald/Whitney transaction, the notice alleged that petitioner had failed to account for earnest money in a timely manner, in violation of ORS 696.805(3)(a) and (b), ORS 696.810(3)(a) and (b), and ORS 696.815(2), and had violated ORS 696.805(3)(a) and ORS 696.810(3)(a) when she had marked the box in the agreement indicating that she had received a \u201ccheck\u201d for the earnest money deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Based on petitioner\u2019s conduct in the Middleton transactions, the notice alleged that petitioner (1) had violated ORS 696.805(3)(a), (c), and (d) by removing the spa from Middleton\u2019s residence for her personal use, contrary to Middleton\u2019s instructions that it be removed only while the house was held as a rental; (2) had violated ORS 696.805(3)(a), (c), and (d) by selling Middleton\u2019s home contrary to instructions that it was to be held as a rental property until market conditions improved; (3) had failed to provide written disclosure \u201cthat she was acting as a principal in her capacity as a successor trustee\u201d in violation of OAR 863-015-0145(1); (4) had failed to account for over $52,000 in proceeds from the sale of the Middleton home in violation of ORS 696.805(3)(a) and (b) and ORS 696.815(2); and (5) had used proceeds from the sale of the Middleton home to pay for personal bills and debts of Starboard LLC, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Genesis Futures, LLC, and Tami Sawyer PC in violation of ORS 696.805(3)(a), (b), and (c) and ORS 696.815(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">The notice alleged that petitioner was subject to discipline under various provisions of ORS 696.301<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>her conduct in the two matters. Petitioner requested a hearing, the agency referred the hearing request to the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH), and an ALJ was assigned. Between the time that the notice of revocation was issued and the hearing was held, two events occurred: (1) on October 21, 2010, petitioner was indicted in federal district court for conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, false statement to financial institution, and money laundering; and (2) petitioner\u2019s real estate license expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">On October 29, 2010, petitioner moved to dismiss the administrative proceeding on the ground that the agency lacked jurisdiction over her because her real estate license had expired on April 30, 2010. She also moved to stay the proceeding or, in the alternative, to grant use immunity to her on the ground that there was a factually related federal criminal case pending against her. With regard to that motion, she stated, in part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">\u201c[a] comparison of the Notice [in the agency proceeding] and the Indictment [in the federal criminal proceeding] demonstrates that the two proceedings arise out of a common set of facts, are factually related, that [petitioner] has a good faith need and basis to assert the privilege against self-incrimination in this proceeding, and that absent an opportunity to participate in this proceeding, would be denied a full and fair hearing as required by ORS 183.415(10) [sic] and the Oregon and United States constitutions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">At the start of the hearing on November 3, 2010, the ALJ, after extended discussion, denied both motions, concluding that, unlike a circuit court, he had no authority to grant use immunity, and, regarding the motion to stay, that there was \u201ca public interest in moving forward with the case.\u201d The ALJ ruled that the case \u201cwould go forward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>* * * with the understanding that [petitioner] has the right to assert her 5th Amendment rights not to testify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">The evidentiary portion of the hearing then began. The agency called petitioner, and petitioner invoked her privilege against self-incrimination under the state and federal constitutions in response to the agency\u2019s questions. The ALJ heard other evidence, and the parties filed written closing arguments. Subsequently, the ALJ issued a proposed order concluding that petitioner had committed all of the violations alleged by the agency, except it concluded that petitioner \u201cdid not fail to account to a seller for earnest money\u201d in the McDonald/Whitney transaction, as had been alleged by the agency. The ALJ also concluded, however, that, although the agency had jurisdiction to discipline petitioner under ORS 696.775, it had no \u201cpower to revoke a license [that] does not exist.\u201d Nor could it deny the issuance or renewal of a license in the absence of an application for one. Thus, the ALJ concluded, the only discipline available under the circumstances was a formal reprimand, and that is what the ALJ proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The agency issued an amended proposed order largely adopting the findings and conclusions of the ALJ, with one notable exception: The agency concluded that, under ORS 696.775 and ORS 696.301, it retained authority to revoke petitioner\u2019s license. Accordingly, it rejected the ALJ\u2019s recommended sanction and ordered that \u201cthe license that formed the basis of the present case is revoked due to [petitioner\u2019s] repeated and serious violations of ORS 696.805(3) and OAR 863-015-0145(1).\u201d Petitioner did not file exceptions to the amended proposed order, and it became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">A. <em>Denial of Motion to Stay Proceedings or Grant Use Immunity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">In her first assignment of error, petitioner contends that the ALJ erred in denying her motion to stay the proceedings or, in the alternative, to grant use immunity to her in light of the criminal charges pending against her in federal court for conduct that, she contends, was \u201cfactually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>related\u201d to the allegations in the administrative action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We consider each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">1. Denial of Motion to Stay-</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">In support of her argument that the ALJ erred in denying her motion for a stay, petitioner contends that she</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">\u201cwas entitled to a stay under both Article I, section 12, of the Oregon Constitution and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The ALJ\u2019s denial of a stay constituted a \u2018material error in procedure\u2019 that undermined the \u2018fairness of the proceedings\u2019 [quoting ORS 183.482(7)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] that warrants setting aside the [agency\u2019s] Final Order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">However, she does not explain how those sources of law\u2014 <em>viz., </em>ORS 183.482(7); Article I, section 12; and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments \u2014 operate to support her contention that the ALJ erred by not staying the administrative proceedings. Instead, she cites a string of federal cases indicating that a trial court has discretion \u2014 as a matter of federal constitutional law \u2014 to stay civil proceedings in light of a pending criminal action concerning the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>conduct.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, we focus our analysis on that theory and do not consider petitioner\u2019s undeveloped arguments under ORS 183.482(7) or the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Redwine v. Starboard, LLC, </em>240 Or App 673, 682, 251 P3d 192 (2011) (considering privilege against self-incrimination only under Fifth Amendment where parties did not develop a separate analysis under Article I, section 12).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Petitioner relies primarily on <em>Securities &amp; Exchange Com\u2019n v. Dresser Indus., </em>628 F2d 1368 (DC Cir), <em>cert den, </em>449 US 993 (1980) <em>(Dresser), </em>as support for her argument. In that case, the Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit explained that, although \u201c[t]he Constitution *** does not ordinarily require a stay of civil proceedings pending the outcome of criminal proceedings, * * * a court may decide, in its discretion, to stay civil proceedings * * * \u2018when the interests of justice\u2019\u201d seem to require it. <em>Id. </em>at 1375 (quoting <em>United States v. Kordel, </em>397 US 1, 12 n 27, 90 S Ct 763, 25 L Ed 2d 1 (1970)); <em>accord Keating v. Office of Thrift Supervision, 45 F3d </em>322, 324 (9th Cir), <em>cert den, </em>516 US 827 (1995). The D. C. Circuit further commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-5\">\u201cOther than where there is specific evidence of agency bad faith or malicious governmental tactics, the strongest case for deferring civil proceedings until after completion of criminal proceedings is where a party under indictment for a serious offense is required to defend a civil or administrative action involving the same matter. The noncriminal proceeding, if not deferred, might undermine the party\u2019s Fifth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, expand rights of criminal discovery beyond the limits of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(b), expose the basis of the defense to the prosecution in advance of criminal trial, or otherwise prejudice the case. If delay of the noncriminal proceeding would not seriously injure the public interest, a court may be justified in deferring it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1375-76 (footnotes and citations omitted). Citing two federal district court memorandum opinions, <em>Nowaczyk v. Matingas, </em>146 FRD 169, 174 (ND Ill 1993), and <em>White v. Mapco Gas Products, Inc., </em>116 FRD 498, 502 (ED Ark 1987) <em>(Mapco Gas), </em>petitioner contends that the factors a court is to consider in deciding whether to grant a stay under <em>Dresser </em>are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-5\">\u201c(1) whether the two actions involve the same subject matter; (2) whether the two actions are brought by the government; (3) the posture of the criminal proceeding: (4) the effect on the public interests at stake if a stay were to be issued; (5) the interest of the plaintiffs in proceeding expeditiously with this litigation and the potential prejudice to plaintiffs of a delay; and (6) the burden that any particular aspect of the proceedings may impose on defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Beyond that, however, petitioner, in her opening brief, simply contends that she was \u201cawaiting trial in federal court on allegations overlapping with those in the Notice of Intent to Revoke License\u201d and that \u201c[e]ach of the six factors favoring a stay identified in <em>Nowaczyk </em>and <em>Mapco Gas </em>were present.\u201d She provides no explanation as to <em>how </em>the allegations \u201coverlap\u201d such that they \u201cinvolve the same subject matter\u201d; nor does she provide any analysis of the other enumerated factors and how they apply in this case. That is insufficient to compel the conclusion that the AL J was required to exercise his discretion to stay the administrative proceeding as petitioner asserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">In other words, even assuming that the factors petitioner cites are dispositive in this context,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> petitioner has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>not provided sufficient grounds from which we can conclude that the AL J abused his discretion in denying a stay. It is not up to this court, for example, to scour the indictment in the federal criminal case to determine whether the two actions, indeed, involve the same subject matter. As the agency points out, \u201c[t]he federal criminal charges were not related to either transaction [for which the agency sought to revoke petitioner\u2019s real estate license] but, rather, to petitioner\u2019s use of two companies \u2014 Starboard LLC and Starboard Indiana LLC \u2014 to defraud investors of more than $4.4 million\u201d; thus, the overlap, if any, \u201cis only that, before his death, Thomas Middleton had invested in petitioner\u2019s ventures, and petitioner used funds from the sale of the Middleton residence to pay debts incurred by those companies.\u201d That could well be the case; petitioner does not give us any reason to think otherwise. In short, it is not clear, without more, that even the first of the six factors on which petitioner relies weighs in favor of granting a stay in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">It is not until her reply brief that petitioner \u2014 for the first time \u2014 attempts any explanation as to the application of those factors to the circumstances of this case. Although, even then, she still does not articulate why the two proceedings are factually related in a legally significant way, she contends that, because of \u201cone particular <em>circumstance\u201d </em>\u2014 viz., the fact \u201cthat Petitioner\u2019s [real estate] license had lapsed\u201d \u2014 there was no need for the agency to proceed expeditiously, nor would the granting of a stay adversely affect the interests of nonparties or the public. Conversely, she contends, proceeding with the administrative action \u201cimposed an enormous burden on Petitioner \u2014 it precluded her from presenting her side of the story \u2014 and resulted in an extremely inefficient use of judicial resources.\u201d However, even if we were to consider petitioner\u2019s argument, raised for the first time in reply, <em>but see, e.g., Clayton v. DAS, </em>258 Or App 689, 691 n 2, 313 P3d 296 (2013) (\u201cTo the extent that plaintiffs argument was developed for the first time in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>reply brief, it is not properly before us on appeal.\u201d), it would not change our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">\u201c\u2018In the absence of substantial prejudice to the rights of the parties involved, [simultaneous] parallel [civil and criminal] proceedings are unobjectionable under our jurisprudence.\u2019\u201d <em>Keating, </em>45 F3d at 324 (quoting <em>Dresser, </em>628 F2d at 1374; brackets in <em>Keating). </em>\u201cIn deciding whether to proceed with the hearing, the extent to which the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights are implicated is a significant factor for the ALJ to consider, but it is only one consideration to be weighed against others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 326 (citation omitted). Here, the ALJ assessed the circumstances and concluded that a stay would not be in the public interest. The ALJ commented that \u201cthe federal courts move at a very glacial pace,\u201d and petitioner did not provide any potential timeline for resolution of the criminal proceedings. As the agency points out, it \u201chas an interest in ensuring the timely resolution of charges against licensees, either to protect the public against unscrupulous licensees or to absolve innocent licensees of unfounded accusations.\u201d Moreover, there was no evidence that the civil proceedings were being used to circumvent the discovery rules in the criminal proceeding, <em>see Dresser, </em>628 F2d at 1376, \u201cwould expose the basis of the defense to the prosecution in advance of the criminal trial,\u201d <em>id., </em>or would otherwise prejudice petitioner\u2019s case. Finally, petitioner\u2019s right to a full and fair disciplinary hearing did not <em>depend </em>on her testimony. <em>See State v. Graf, </em>316 Or 544, 550-52, 853 P2d 277 (1993) (recognizing that a party may obtain a full and fair hearing in a disciplinary proceeding without testifying). Petitioner\u2019s attorney was present at the hearing to make objections, cross-examine the agency\u2019s witnesses, and offer evidentiary exhibits on petitioner\u2019s behalf. In short, even considering petitioner\u2019s late-raised argument, petitioner has not demonstrated \u201csubstantial prejudice\u201d to her rights by going forward with the administrative proceeding; accordingly, we cannot say that the ALJ abused his discretion by denying petitioner\u2019s motion to stay the proceedings. <em>See Keating, </em>45 F3d at 326 (\u201cA defendant has no absolute right not to be forced to choose between testifying in a civil matter and asserting his Fifth Amendment privilege.\u201d (Citing <em>Baxter v. Palmigiano, </em>425 US 308, 318, 96 S Ct 1551, 47 L Ed 2d 810 (1976).)).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>2. <em>Refusal to Grant Petitioner Use Immunity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Petitioner argues, alternatively, that, if we reject her argument regarding the stay, we \u201cshould hold that [the ALJ] erred in denying her request for use immunity,\u201d relying entirely on <em>Dept. of Human Services v. K. L. R., </em>235 Or App 1, 230 P3d 49 (2010). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">In <em>K. L. R, </em>a juvenile dependency case, the mother appealed a dispositional order of the juvenile court requiring her and the child\u2019s father to complete polygraph examinations in an effort to determine if they had caused their child\u2019s unexplained injuries or if they knew the cause. 235 Or App at 3. The mother contended, as she had below, that the polygraph requirement violated her rights against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 5. Drawing on case law from other jurisdictions, we observed that, \u201c[generally speaking, if a person is granted properly framed use immunity from criminal prosecution, he or she may be compelled to provide evidence in a dependency proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9 (citations omitted). We held that the court in <em>K. L. R. </em>had erred in ordering the polygraph, in part, because it did not also provide the mother with immunity from criminal prosecution as a condition of her completing it. <em>Id. </em>at 10. Petitioner asserts that, similarly here, we should hold that the ALJ erred in \u201cproceeding with the hearing without granting Petitioner properly framed use immunity.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The agency responds, first, that the ALJ had no authority to grant petitioner immunity because that authority derives solely from statute, citing <em>State v. White, </em>96 Or App 713, 716, 773 P2d 824, <em>rev den, </em>308 Or 382 (1989), and, to the extent <em>K. L. R. </em>can be read to suggest otherwise, it was wrongly decided. We need not address that issue because we agree with the agency\u2019s second argument, which is that petitioner\u2019s argument fails for the simple reason that, here, unlike in <em>K. L. R., </em>petitioner was not <em>compelled </em>to testify within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. <em>See Graf, </em>316 Or at 550-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">In <em>Graf, </em>the Supreme Court reversed our conclusion that the defendant \u2014 whose acts of misconduct formed the basis for termination of his employment as well as criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>charges \u2014 was compelled to testify within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment at his pre-termination hearing, and thus was entitled to use immunity, because his \u201c\u2018failure to appear and testify at the pre-termination hearing would have resulted in defendant\u2019s being denied his right to a full due process post-termination hearing at which he could refute the charges and offer matters in mitigation.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 550 (quoting <em>State v. Graf, </em>114 Or App 275, 280, 835 P2d 934, <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>316 Or 544, 853 P2d 277 (1993)). The Supreme Court concluded that the applicable administrative rule \u201cexerted no compulsion on defendant to testify at the pre-termination hearing.\u201d <em>Graf, </em>316 Or at 552. The court reasoned that the pre-termination hearing procedure was noncoercive, in part, because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-4\">\u201cthe employee need not testify personally to preserve any claims or defenses. The employee or the employee\u2019s lawyer or representative can attend, offer testimony, and make legal or equitable arguments. Co-workers or supervisors or others who have pertinent information can be called as witnesses. Other evidence can be offered. In many situations a strong case for the employee can be made without having the employee testify personally. *** Because the employee is not required to testify, and because the rule specifies that silence shall not constitute any admission of the charges, there is no compulsion to testify.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Petitioner essentially ignores the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Graf, </em>and, without argument to the contrary, we are not persuaded that the circumstances here are meaningfully distinguishable. As noted, petitioner\u2019s attorney was able to \u2014 and did \u2014 make arguments and offer evidence on petitioner\u2019s behalf. Moreover, the agency had the burden to prove the allegations against petitioner by a preponderance of the evidence, <em>see </em>ORS 183.450(2); <em>Sobel v. Board of Pharmacy, </em>130 Or App 374, 379, 882 P2d 606 (1994), <em>rev den, </em>320 Or 588 (1995); as in <em>Graf, </em>there is no indication that petitioner\u2019s silence would constitute admission of the allegations. In short, although to be sure, <em>Graf </em>is not entirely on all-fours \u2014 after all, <em>Graf </em>involved a pre-termination hearing \u2014 petitioner has not persuaded us that she was compelled to testify within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>because, without use immunity, she was \u201cdenied a meaningful opportunity to defend against the [agency\u2019s] allegations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">B. <em>Revocation of Real Estate License</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">As noted, in her fourth assignment of error,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> petitioner contends that the agency erred in revoking her real estate license, which had expired between the time that the notice issued and when the revocation hearing occurred. The agency reasoned that, because ORS 696.775 \u201cspecifically extends the Agency\u2019s jurisdiction to discipline a licensee whose license has expired[,] * * * the agency has jurisdiction to impose discipline in this case.\u201d And, because discipline under ORS 696.301 includes \u201crevocation, suspension, reprimand, or the denial of the issuance or renewal of a license,\u201d the agency concluded that \u201crevocation of the license that existed at the time the Notice was issued is an appropriate sanction and is within the Agency\u2019s discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">On review, petitioner challenges the agency\u2019s reasoning, contending that, \u201cwhile ORS 696.775 authorizes the [agency] to proceed with a disciplinary proceeding [after a license has expired], it does not authorize the revocation of an expired license.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> She contends that we should adopt the ALJ\u2019s analysis instead and \u201cvacate\u201d the agency\u2019s order revoking her license. Referencing <em>Schurman v. Bureau of Labor, </em>36 Or App 841, 844, 585 P2d 758 (1978), and ORS 696.301, the ALJ reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>\u201cThere is no evidence that [petitioner] applied to renew her license or that the license was valid after April 2010. Thus, there is no evidence that she holds a license which can be suspended or revoked. Furthermore, in the absence of an application, the Agency may not deny the issuance or renewal of a license. While the Agency established that [petitioner] committed serious violations that would support revocation, it may not revoke a license that does not exist. The only available form of discipline available under the circumstances of this case is a reprimand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The agency responds that petitioner\u2019s reliance on the ALJ\u2019s analysis, and \u201cby extension,\u201d <em>Schurman, </em>is misplaced. Rather, according to the agency, this case is closer to <em>Grobovsky v. Board of Medical Examiners, </em>213 Or App 136, 159 P3d 1245 (2007), in which the operative statute authorized the Board of Medical Examiners to suspend the petitioner\u2019s medical license, although the petitioner had allowed the license to expire. We conclude that the agency has the better argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">ORS 696.775 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">\u201cThe lapsing, expiration, revocation or suspension of a real estate license, whether by operation of law, order of the Real Estate Commissioner or decision of a court of law, or the inactive status of the license or voluntary surrender of the license by the real estate licensee, does not deprive the commissioner of jurisdiction to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">\u201c(1) Proceed with an investigation of the licensee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-9\">\u201c(2) <em>Conduct disciplinary proceedings relating to the licensee',</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-10\">\u201c(3) <em>Take action against a licensee, </em>including assessment of a civil penalty against the licensee for a violation of ORS 696.020(2); or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-11\">\u201c(4) Revise or render null and void an order suspending or revoking a license.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-13\">As noted, petitioner acknowledges that ORS 696.775 authorizes the agency to continue disciplinary proceedings against her notwithstanding that her license has expired; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>however, petitioner disputes that it authorizes the agency to <em>revoke </em>her license as a result of that disciplinary proceeding, because her license no longer exists. Essentially, petitioner concludes \u2014 as did the AL J \u2014 that revoking an expired license is logically impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">That position, of course, has some appeal. That is, how is it possible to revoke a person\u2019s license when the person no longer holds a license? However, by the same token, the legislature has authorized the agency to \u201cinvestigate],\u201d \u201c[c] onduct disciplinary proceedings relating to,\u201d and \u201c[t] ake action against\u201d a \u201clicensee\u201d whose license has lapsed, expired, or been revoked or suspended, ORS 696.775(1), (2), (3) (emphasis added), which, under petitioner\u2019s theory, would be equally illogical. That is, if a \u201clicensee\u2019s\u201d license has expired, how can there be a \u201clicensee\u201d?<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> And, from the plain text of the statute, there can be no mistaking the legislature\u2019s intention to grant the agency jurisdiction to continue disciplinary proceedings against a person notwithstanding the \u201clapsing, expiration, revocation or suspension of\u2019 the person\u2019s license; the legislature took pains to delineate all of the means by which that might occur \u2014 operation of law, agency order, court decision, inactive status of the licensee, or voluntary surrender of the license. Thus, petitioner\u2019s argument is sensible but not dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Nor does <em>Schurman </em>assist petitioner. There, the Bureau of Labor revoked the petitioner\u2019s business license, and, as in this case, between the time of the notice of intent to revoke the petitioner\u2019s license and the revocation hearing, the petitioner\u2019s license had expired by operation of law. 36 Or App at 843-44. We held that the Bureau lacked authority to take such action with respect to a \u201cnon-existent license.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 844. We stated, flatly, \u201cWhere no license exists, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Bureau is without jurisdiction to act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, in <em>Schurman, </em>the statute under which the Bureau purported to act, ORS 658.115 (1977), did not, like ORS 696.775, grant the administrative body <em>any </em>continuing jurisdiction in the circumstance of an expired license.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">In <em>Grobovsky, </em>we made clear that <em>Schurman </em>does not control where there is a statute authorizing the agency to impose discipline on a licensee or a former licensee. 213 Or App at 147-48. There, the operative statute, ORS 677.175(3), provided that \u201c[t]he surrender, retirement or other forfeiture, expiration or cancellation of a license issued by the board shall not deprive the board of its authority to institute or continue a disciplinary action against the licensee <em>upon any ground provided by law\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) To be sure, ORS 696.775 is not as explicit as ORS 677.175(3); nonetheless, as we explain below, it leads to a conclusion similar to the one that we reached in <em>Grobovsky </em>\u2014 that is, that the board was not prohibited from suspending the petitioner\u2019s license, even though that license had expired.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> 213 Or App at 147-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">ORS 696.775 plainly allows the agency to \u201c[c]onduct disciplinary proceedings\u201d and \u201c [t] ake action\u201d against a licensee whose license has expired. Moreover, the legislature did not limit the \u201caction\u201d authorized by ORS 696.775 in any way. In context, \u201caction\u201d must be understood to mean disciplinary action, which necessarily leads us to ORS 696.301, the statute describing the disciplinary actions that the agency is authorized to take. And, ORS 696.301 expressly includes revocation among the list of authorized actions. As set out earlier, it provides that \u201cthe Real Estate Commissioner may suspend or <em>revoke the real estate license </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number><em>of any real estate licensee, </em>reprimand any licensee or deny the issuance of renewal of a license to an applicant who has done any of [an enumerated list of violations](Emphasis added.) It follows that the agency did not err in revoking petitioner\u2019s license \u201cthat existed at the time the Notice was issued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">In sum, we conclude that the ALJ did not err in denying petitioner\u2019s motion to stay the proceedings or in failing to grant her use immunity. Nor did the agency err in determining that petitioner\u2019s conduct violated the statutes and rules as specified or in revoking her license. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b61-9\"> The relevant statutes and rule are set out below. 268 Or App at 48 n 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b61-10\"> At the time, petitioner was licensed by the agency to conduct professional real estate activity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b66-5\"> As pertinent here, ORS 696.805(3) provides that a seller\u2019s agent owes the seller involved in a real estate transaction the affirmative duty to \u201cexercise reasonable care and diligence\u201d; \u201caccount in a timely manner for money and property received from or on behalf of the seller\u201d; \u201cbe loyal to the seller by not taking action that is adverse or detrimental to the seller\u2019s interest in a transaction\u201d; and \u201cdisclose in a timely manner to the seller any conflict of interest, existing or contemplated.\u201d ORS. 696.805(3)(a), (b), (c), (d). Similarly, ORS 696.810(3) provides that a buyer\u2019s agent owes the buyer involved in a real estate transaction the affirmative duty to \u201cexercise reasonable care and diligence\u201d and to \u201caccount in a timely manner for money and property received from or on behalf of the buyer.\u201d ORS 696.810(3)(a), (b).

It reasons that, \u201c [b] ecause there is no longer a pending federal prosecution, a reversal of the ALJ\u2019s rulings regarding petitioner\u2019s request for a stay or use immunity would have no practical effect on the parties.\u201d We fail to see how the assignment of error is moot; if the ALJ erred in failing to stay the administrative proceedings or to grant petitioner use immunity, as petitioner contends, then that error would result in a reversal of the final order revoking petitioner\u2019s license and a remand for a new hearing. Thus, our decision in the matter certainly \u201cwill have some practical effect on the rights of the parties.\u201d <em>Brumnett v. PSRB, </em>315 Or 402, 405, 848 P2d 1194 (1993). If we decide in petitioner\u2019s favor, the fact that, <em>on remand, </em>petitioner may no longer need a stay or immunity does not obviate the ALJ\u2019s error, if any, in denying petitioner\u2019s motion to stay the proceedings or grant her immunity in the first place.

To the extent petitioner is thus arguing that ORS 183.417(8) provides an independent source for concluding that a stay was <em>required </em>as a matter of law in this case, the cases petitioner cites in support of the proposition are unavailing, and, in any event, the argument comes too late. <em>Clayton v.

Suffice it to say that we agree with the agency that it is at least questionable whether the lawyer actually made such a concession, and, in any event, the principle of judicial admission relates to the establishment of facts, not legal conclusions. <em>See Great Seneca Financial Corp. v.
