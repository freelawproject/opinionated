Youth, who was 13 years and eight months old at the time of the alleged offense, was made eligible for adult prosecution by ORS 419C.352, which allows for discretionary waiver for 12- to 14-year-olds accused of certain crimes if the juvenile court \u201cmakes the findings required under ORS 419C.349(3) and (4).\u201d The juvenile court in this case, after a hearing, found that youth \u201cat the time of the alleged offense was of sufficient sophistication and maturity to appreciate the nature and quality of the conduct involved\u201d under ORS 4190.349(3) and, after reviewing the additional criteria set out in ORS 419C.349(4), found \u201cthat retaining jurisdiction [would] not serve the best interests of the youth and of society and therefore [was] not justified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">On appeal, youth\u2019s sole contention is that the juvenile court misinterpreted ORS 4190.349(3) and therefore erred in finding that youth satisfied that criterion. He argues that the text, context, and legislative history of ORS 4190.349(3) demonstrate that the legislature intended to require \u201ca showing of more sophistication and maturity than is possessed by the twelve to fourteen year-old, with normally developed intellectual and emotional capacities.\u201d As explained in detail below, we conclude that the text, context, and legislative history of ORS 4190.349(3) do not support that view. The legislature intended ORS 4190.349(3) to be a predicate threshold finding of mental capacity before the juvenile court weighs the additional, and more wide-ranging, criteria in ORS 4190.349(4). Specifically, the legislature intended ORS 4190.349(3) to test whether a youth had enough sophistication and maturity to appreciate the \u201cnature and quality\u201d of his <em>actions </em>\u2014 i.e., whether he could appreciate what he was doing in a physical sense and that those actions were wrong or would likely have criminal consequences. Because the evidence supports the juvenile court\u2019s finding that youth met that standard, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>I. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Youth requests that we exercise our discretion to review certain factual findings <em>de novo, </em>arguing that this is an \u201cexceptional\u201d case. <em>See </em>ORS 19.415(3)(b) (Court of Appeals has discretion to \u201cmake one or more factual findings anew upon the record\u201d); ORAP 5.40(8)(c) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals will exercise its discretion * * * to make one or more factual findings anew on the record only in exceptional cases.\u201d). We decline that request. Youth challenges a particular determination of the juvenile court \u2014 that youth, at the time of the offense, was of sufficient sophistication and maturity to appreciate the nature and quality of the conduct involved. But youth\u2019s primary contention is a legal one \u2014 that the juvenile court made an \u201cerroneous assumption [] about what the statutory term[s] mean[]\u201d by \u201cequating \u2018average\u2019 13 year-old sophistication and maturity with the higher degree of sophistication and maturity intended by the legislature.\u201d Put another way, the success of youth\u2019s argument on appeal turns on the proper interpretation of ORS 419C.349(3), not on whether we take a fresh look at the evidence in this case. <em>Cf. Dept. of Human Services v. A. R. S., </em>256 Or App 653, 656, 303 P3d 963, <em>rev den, </em>354 Or 386 (2013) (declining to exercise <em>de novo </em>review because the court could resolve the \u201cappeal based on a purely legal question \u2014 one that [was] not dependent on any disputed factual findings of the trial court\u201d). Beyond that, our review of the juvenile court\u2019s findings that relate to the disputed legal issue shows that those findings comport with the evidence in the record, and those findings are consistent with the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">For those reasons, we conclude that this is not a case that warrants <em>de novo </em>review of the evidentiary record. Accordingly, we review the record to determine whether any evidence, and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn from the evidence, supports the juvenile court\u2019s findings. <em>State v. S. T. S., </em>236 Or App 646, 655, 238 P3d 53 (2010). We review the juvenile court\u2019s legal conclusions, including its interpretation of ORS 419C.349(3), for errors of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>II. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">In accordance with our standard of review, we set out the procedural and historical facts necessary to give context to our discussion of the parties\u2019 dispute about the meaning of ORS 419C.349(3). The state alleged that youth and the older brother of youth\u2019s girlfriend, Alejandro Aguilar-Mandujano, beat, stabbed, and robbed the victim on October 2, 2009. The victim died as a result of his injuries. The state charged youth by juvenile court petition with offenses that, if committed by an adult, would constitute the crimes of aggravated murder, first-degree robbery, and unlawful use of a weapon. The state petitioned to waive youth into circuit court for prosecution as an adult on the aggravated murder charge under ORS 419C.349 and ORS 419C.352.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">ORS 419C.352 sets forth the conditions for waiver for youths who are 12, 13, or 14 years of age:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">\u201cThe juvenile court, after a hearing * * * may waive a youth under 15 years of age at the time the act was committed to circuit court for prosecution as an adult if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">\u201c(1) The youth is represented by counsel during the waiver proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">\u201c(2) The juvenile court makes the findings required under ORS 419C.349(3) and (4); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-9\">\u201c(3) The youth is alleged to have committed an act or acts that if committed by an adult would constitute [aggravated murder or other crimes].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">Subsections (3) and (4) of ORS 419C.349 set forth specific criteria by which the court assesses the youth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-11\">\u201c(3) The youth at the time of the alleged offense was of sufficient sophistication and maturity to appreciate the nature and quality of the conduct involved; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-12\">\u201c(4) The juvenile court, after considering the following criteria, determines by a preponderance of the evidence that retaining jurisdiction will not serve the best interests of the youth and of society and therefore is not justified:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-13\">\u201c(a) The amenability of the youth to treatment and rehabilitation given the techniques, facilities and personnel for rehabilitation available to the juvenile court and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>to the criminal court which would have jurisdiction after transfer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-4\">\u201c(b) The protection required by the community, given the seriousness of the offense alleged;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-5\">\u201c(c) The aggressive, violent, premeditated or willful manner in which the offense was alleged to have been committed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">\u201c(d) The previous history of the youth, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">\u201c(A) Prior treatment efforts and out-of-home placements; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\">\u201c(B) The physical, emotional and mental health of the youth;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-9\">\u201c(e) The youth\u2019s prior record of acts which would be crimes if committed by an adult;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-10\">\u201c(f) The gravity of the loss, damage or injury caused or attempted during the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-11\">\u201c(g) The prosecutive merit of the case against the youth; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-12\">\u201c(h) The desirability of disposing of all cases in one trial if there were adult co-offenders.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">Here, the juvenile court heard evidence that, at the time the victim was killed in early October 2009, youth was 13 years old and Aguilar-Mandujano was 20 years old. Aguilar-Mandujano gave a statement to police, describing how he had planned to rob and murder the victim and explaining that he and youth carried out the plan at a park near the Tualatin River. Youth waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and, after being confronted with Aguilar-Mandujano\u2019s statement, admitted that he had participated in the robbery and murder. Youth stated that, on the day of the murder, Aguilar-Mandujano told him that he planned to kill the victim, and youth agreed to \u201chave his back.\u201d Youth told police that he drove with Aguilar-Mandujano to the park and, after they arrived, he hit the victim on the head several times with a tire iron while Aguilar-Mandujano stabbed him. After being handed the knife, youth then stabbed the victim. At Aguilar-Mandujano\u2019s direction, youth kicked the victim\u2019s body into the river.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Three expert witnesses provided testimony related to whether \u201cyouth at the time of the alleged offense was of sufficient sophistication and maturity to appreciate the nature and quality of the conduct involved.\u201d ORS 419C.349(3). On behalf of the state, Dr. Sebastian interviewed and tested youth on three dates in November 2010. In her report, which the state introduced and relied upon in its waiver petition, Sebastian explained that youth was \u201cbright,\u201d he \u201cknew that he would be in legal trouble from his encounter with [the victim],\u201d and he could \u201carticulate that what he did was wrong and understands the consequences.\u201d At the same time, Sebastian stated that youth \u201chas not yet developed an internal locus of control, is influenced and led by older youth [s],\u201d and \u201chas a hard time delaying gratification, favoring a more immediate payoff.\u201d Ultimately, Sebastian summarized her conclusions regarding youth\u2019s sophistication and maturity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-4\">\u201cBy structured interview, testing and collateral data, it is this examiner\u2019s opinion that [youth] is as sophisticated and mature as one might expect of a thirteen/fourteen-year old. In other words, he is average in sophistication and maturity for his age.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">\u201cUsing records, testing and interview it is clear this young man has the ability to: 1) think independently, 2) understand behavioral norms and expectations of adolescents in the larger picture, 3) weigh the risks and benefits of his actions, 4) demonstrate age appropriate social skills, 5) anticipate the consequences of his actions, 6) discern which of his behaviors are antisocial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">\u201cWhen compared to his age mates, he is just as effective or more effective (because of his strong cognitive ability) in understanding that his crime was wrong and identifying alternatives to his actions. He is less able than his peers at understanding his emotions, resolving conflicts effectively and resisting the influence of other youth [s].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Youth presented the testimony of Dr. Nagel, who did not examine youth, but testified about the science of adolescent brain development. Nagel testified that the brain\u2019s prefrontal cortex is late to develop as adolescents age, yet \u201cis most heavily involved in * * * executive functions,\u201d which includes \u201cplanning, problem solving, higher level attention, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>the ability to dual-task, the ability to appreciate long-term consequences; all of those very high level thinking type things.\u201d Nagel explained that the \u201ccrux\u201d of an adolescent\u2019s \u201cvulnerability and immaturity\u201d was that the \u201cconnections between the pre-frontal cortex that allow you in a cold situation to say, \u2018Oh yes, I know right from wrong,\u2019 are not mature. *** [T]hey don\u2019t kick in fast enough to rein in the emotional or reward based systems of the brain.\u201d When asked if a 13-year-old\u2019s brain could be developed enough to make reasoned decisions \u201cin heated, emotional situations,\u201d she explained that \u201c[t]here has been no evidence to suggest that a 13-year-old anywhere in the world would be the same as a mature adult.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Youth also presented a written evaluation from Dr. Bolstad, who evaluated youth six months after his arrest and then twice thereafter. With respect to youth\u2019s sophistication and maturity, Bolstad \u201cdid not find consistent evidence to indicate that [youth] is any less mature than most 13 year olds. In some respects, he appears to be more mature; in others, less mature.\u201d Bolstad pointed to research showing \u201cthat young adolescents are more vulnerable to impulsive decision making and risky behaviors than their older, adult counterparts.\u201d \u201cIt would be contrary to [that research],\u201d Bolstad stressed, \u201cto assume that [youth] possessed the same rational faculties as an adult in his decision making to participate in this alleged crime.\u201d In Bolstad\u2019s view, \u201c[o]ne of the central aspects pertaining to the issue of sophistication and maturity * * * is the discrepancy in ages between [AguilarMandujano] and [youth].\u201d Bolstad explained that \u201c[y]oung adolescents are vulnerable to turning over their decision making responsibilities to their peers or leaders among their peer group.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Bolstad also testified at the waiver hearing, reiterating his concerns about youth\u2019s susceptibility to peer pressure and his poor judgment. On cross-examination, Bolstad agreed that a normal 13-year-old brain can \u201cappreciate the idea of [assaultive] behavior,\u201d can \u201cappreciate or understand the property rights of others,\u201d and can understand that assaultive behavior is wrong. The prosecutor also asked about youth\u2019s appreciation of his actions at the point when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>youth drove to the park with Aguilar-Mandujano and the victim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-4\">\u201cQ. Alright, so again let\u2019s just accept that assumption, that he knew they were going to kill [the victim], he was asked to participate. Could he appreciate what he was about to do at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-5\">\u201cA. In terms of appreciating that what he was about to do was against the law? Yes. In terms of appreciating that what he was doing was potentially going to harm someone? Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">\u201cQ. So, the nature of the crime he could appreciate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\">\u201cA. The nature of the crime, yes. I\u2019m not so sure he could appreciate it at a level of having empathy because I think that\u2019s a much more challenging task for a 13 year old with an immature brain, but in those other regards I would answer yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">After considering that evidence, along with numerous exhibits and testimony from several witnesses as to the criteria in ORS 419C.349(4), the court issued written findings in support of its decision to waive youth into circuit court to be tried as an adult. At the outset, the court found that \u201c[t]he evidence supporting Youth\u2019s involvement in the alleged offenses is reliable and convincing.\u201d The court characterized youth\u2019s participation as \u201cpurposeful and intimate\u201d and described youth\u2019s \u201creaction\u201d following his participation in the offense as \u201csimilarly purposeful,\u201d given youth\u2019s efforts to hide his involvement and his ability to \u201cmaintain confidentiality of his participation in the alleged events until confronted by police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">In accord with the testimony of the expert witnesses, the court found that youth\u2019s behavior \u201cdemonstrate [d] a degree of maturity consistent with Youth\u2019s biological age at the time of the event, and in several respects a degree of maturity consistent with an older youth.\u201d Citing testimony from Nagel, the court acknowledged that \u201cadolescents are particularly susceptible to poor judgment in emotional or peer driven situations.\u201d But, in the court\u2019s view, \u201c[a]lthough Youth\u2019s decisions were tragically flawed, his statements to police demonstrate awareness regarding the nature of the criminal act, the degree of his participation in the criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>act, and an awareness of the consequences of the criminal act if apprehended by authorities.\u201d Further, the court found that youth \u201cdemonstrated sophisticated behavior and a high degree of maturity in commission of the offenses, through the purposeful and goal oriented conduct before, during and after the event.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Ultimately, the court found, under ORS 419C.349 (3), that youth \u201cwas of sufficient sophistication and the maturity to appreciate the nature and quality of the conduct of the alleged offense of Aggravated Murder.\u201d The court also found that waiver was in the best interest of society and youth after reviewing the criteria in ORS 4190.349(4):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">\u201cBecause of the seriousness of the alleged crime, Youth\u2019s prior record of assaultive and violent behavior, and the inability of previous community interventions to successfully address Youth\u2019s behavioral and emotional health, the amenability of the Youth to rehabilitation and treatment is best served through waiver to the adult court for prosecution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The court granted the state\u2019s petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As noted, on appeal, youth\u2019s sole contention is that the court erred in finding that youth, at the time of the alleged offense, was of sufficient sophistication and maturity to appreciate the nature and quality of the conduct involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">Youth\u2019s challenge to the juvenile court\u2019s waiver decision, which is focused entirely on the court\u2019s finding under ORS 419C.349(3), turns on what the legislature intended that statute to mean. In youth\u2019s view, \u201cthe statute requires a showing of more sophistication and maturity than is possessed by the twelve to fourteen year-old, with normally developed intellectual and emotional capacities.\u201d And, youth argues, the court\u2019s assessment of a youth\u2019s ability to \u201cappreciate the nature and quality of the conduct\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>is a wide-ranging inquiry, taking into account the youth\u2019s ability to \u201cexercise mature judgment\u201d and his \u201cvulnerability to peer pressure.\u201d Youth contends that the court erred by \u201cdiscounting the scientific evidence about young adolescents\u2019 (and this young adolescent\u2019s, in particular) abilities, to exercise mature judgment, because of the co-occurrence of the onset of puberty\u201d and the ongoing development of the brain. The state counters that a review of the text, context, and legislative history of ORS 419C.349 and ORS 419C.352 reveals no evidence that \u201cthe criterion in what is now ORS 419C.349(3) was intended as anything more than a predicate threshold finding of mental capacity the state must satisfy before the juvenile court weighs the additional criteria in ORS 4190.349(4).\u201d According to the state, \u201cthe legislature intended that [criterion] to exclude from adult prosecution, those juveniles who did not comprehend, because of mental or emotional defect or marked immaturity, the nature and quality of their criminal conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">Our task is to ascertain the meaning of the legislature\u2019s intent by examining the statute\u2019s text in context, along with relevant legislative history. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-73, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). We start with the statute\u2019s text, which serves as the \u201cbest evidence of the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). In the absence of evidence to the contrary, we assume that the legislature intended that the wording of an enactment to be given its ordinary meaning. <em>State v. Murray, </em>340 Or 599, 604, 136 P3d 10 (2006). As a \u201cuseful starting point\u201d to determine that meaning, we look to the definitions of the terms used in ORS 419C.349(3) found in dictionaries of common usage. <em>State v. Holloway, </em>138 Or App 260, 265, 908 P2d 324 (1995). We are mindful, however, that the meaning of the statute does not \u201cturn only on the dictionary definition of one of its words\u201d; we must examine how each word is used in context. <em>Elk Creek Management Co. v. Gilbert, </em>353 Or 565, 574, 303 P3d 929 (2013). That is especially true where, as here, the parties dispute not just the meaning of a single term, but the meaning of an entire statutory phrase \u2014 \u201csufficient sophistication and maturity to appreciate the nature and quality of the conduct involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>With those principles in mind, we start with the dictionary definitions of the terms in ORS 419C.349(3). \u201cSophistication\u201d means \u201cthe quality or state of being sophisticated\u201d and \u201cthe quality or the character of being intellectually sophisticated (as through cultivation, experience, or disillusionment).\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>2174 (unabridged ed 2002). \u201cSophisticated,\u201d in turn, means \u201c2 : deprived of native or original simplicity: as * * * b : WORLDLY-WISE, KNOWING &lt;a ~ adolescents\u201d <em>Id. </em>The dictionary defines \u201cmaturity\u201d as \u201cthe quality or state of being mature,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1395, and \u201cmature\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-4\">\u201c2 a : having attained the normal peak of natural growth and development: fully grown and developed * * * c : having or expressing the mental and emotional qualities that are considered normal to an adult socially adjusted human being &lt;a ~ outlook&gt; &lt;parents were willing to be ~, to take responsibility -H.S.Canbyx\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1394. As youth suggests, those definitions of sophistication and maturity \u2014 viewed in isolation \u2014 describe qualities that are associated with a normal, well-adjusted adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">But the statute, of course, does not use those terms in isolation. It requires <em>\u201csufficient </em>sophistication and maturity.\u201d ORS 419C.349(3) (emphasis added). \u201cSufficient\u201d means \u201cmarked by quantity, scope, power, or quality to meet with the demands, wants, or needs of a situation or of a proposed use or end.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 2284. That term, as its definition suggests, is largely dependent on the words it modifies. Here, where we are concerned with \u201csufficient sophistication and maturity,\u201d we ask whether the youth has some amount of those qualities to meet the demands of a \u201cparticular situation\u201d or \u201cproposed * * * end.\u201d And the \u201cparticular situation\u201d we are concerned with is the youth\u2019s ability \u201cto appreciate the nature and quality of the conduct involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">\u201cAppreciate\u201d means \u201c1 a * * * (2) : to judge or evaluate the worth, merit, quality, or significance of: comprehend with knowledge, judgment, and discrimination cincapable of appreciating the difference between right and wrong -B.N.Cardozo&gt;.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105. As the dictionary\u2019s verbal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>illustration<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from Justice Cardozo suggests, however, the word \u201cappreciate\u201d has a recognized use in the law related to criminal capacity. Indeed, youth acknowledges that the legislature incorporated an \u201celement of capacity\u201d into the juvenile court\u2019s evaluation of the youth\u2019s sophistication and maturity. And youth specifically asserts that \u201cappreciate,\u201d as used in ORS 419C.349(3), has the same meaning as \u201cappreciate\u201d in Oregon\u2019s statute describing the insanity defense, ORS 161.295(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-3\">\u201cA person is guilty except for insanity if, as a result of mental disease or defect at the time of engaging in criminal conduct, the person lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality of the conduct or to conform the conduct to the requirements of the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">As used in that statute, the term \u201cappreciate\u201d has a meaning that encompasses an \u201cemotional as well as intellectual cognition of the act.\u201d <em>State v. Dyer, </em>16 Or App 247, 258, 518 P2d 184 (1974) (comparing the <em>M\u2019Naghten </em>rule\u2019s use of the term \u201cknow\u201d in defining the insanity defense, the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s use of the term \u201cunderstand\u201d in its formulation of the <em>M\u2019Naghten </em>rule, and the use of the term \u201cappreciate\u201d in ORS 161.295, and explaining that the term appreciate, like the term understand, \u201callow [s] a full range of testimony as to emotional as well as intellectual cognition of the act\u201d). We agree with youth that the formulation of criminal capacity described in the insanity statute, enacted in 1971, is helpful context in construing the meaning of the sophistication and maturity criterion, enacted in 1985 as <em>former </em>ORS 419.533(1)(c) (1985), <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 419C.349(3) (1993). <em>See, e.g., Gaston v. Parsons, </em>318 Or 247, 253, 864 P2d 1319 (1994) (\u201c[W]ords in a statute that have a well-defined legal meaning are to be given that meaning in construing the statute.\u201d); <em>State v. Carr, </em>319 Or 408, 411-12, 877 P2d 1192 (1994) (\u201cContext includes other related statutes.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">We look, finally, to the definitions of \u201cnature\u201d and \u201cquality.\u201d The definition of \u201cnature\u201d most applicable here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>is \u201cthe essential character or constitution of something.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 1507. \u201cQuality\u201d is similarly defined as \u201ca peculiar and essential character : NATURE, KIND * * * &lt;the offender knew the nature and ~ of the act -B.N.Cardozo&gt;.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1858. Those definitions provide limited guidance\u2014 they overlap, both referencing the \u201cessential character\u201d of something, and it is unclear whether the legislature, when describing the ability to appreciate the \u201cessential character\u201d of conduct, intended to include a youth\u2019s ability to understand the wrongful or criminal character of that conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">As with the term \u201cappreciate,\u201d however, the phrase \u201cnature and quality of the act\u201d (or \u201cof conduct\u201d) has a well-worn legal meaning in the context of criminal capacity. Indeed, the common-law test \u201cfor determining legal responsibility\u201d in Oregon, used at least since 1884, specifically referenced a defendant\u2019s capacity to know or understand \u201cthe nature and quality of the act\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">\u201cEver since 1884, when the case of <em>State v. Murray, </em>[11 Or 413, 5 P 55], was decided, to and including <em>State v. Wallace, </em>[170 Or 60, 131 P2d 222], decided in 1942, the test for determining legal responsibility in Oregon has been announced substantially as follows: If at the time of committing an act, the party was laboring under such a defect of reason from disease of the mind as not to know <em>the nature and quality of the act he was doing, </em>or if he did know the nature and quality thereof that he did not know that he was doing what was wrong, he should not be held responsible under the criminal law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-6\"><em>State v. Layton, </em>174 Or 217, 226, 148 P2d 522 (1944) (brackets in original; emphasis added); <em>see also Dyer, </em>16 Or App at 258 (explaining that the Oregon Supreme Court later \u201cliberalized its version of the <em>M\u2019Naghten </em>rule\u201d by substituting \u201cunderstand\u201d for \u201cknow\u201d). The legislature drew from that common-law test for criminal capacity when, in 1971, it enacted ORS 161.295(1), the insanity defense statute, which allows a person to be found \u201cguilty except for insanity\u201d if \u201cthe person lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality of the conduct or to conform the conduct to the requirements of the law.\u201d Although that statute does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>explicitly reference the \u201cnature and quality\u201d of an act or conduct,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the first element of that statute \u2014 a lack of substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of one\u2019s conduct, ORS 161.295(1) \u2014 is, \u201cin different words,\u201d the \u201cformer test\u201d in Oregon for criminal responsibility \u2014 the ability to appreciate the \u201cnature and quality\u201d of conduct and to distinguish between right from wrong. <em>See Dyer, </em>16 Or App at 257-59 (relying on statements in the Commentary to Criminal Law Revision Commission Proposed Oregon Criminal Code, Final Draft and Report \u00a7 36, 36-37 (July 1970)). Given the longstanding use of the phrase \u201cnature and quality\u201d of conduct in the common-law test for criminal capacity \u2014 and the legislature\u2019s incorporation of that phrase into more modern descriptions of capacity, like that found in the insanity defense statute \u2014 we look to the acquired meaning of that phrase in those sources in determining the meaning of that phrase in ORS 419C.349(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">The question, then, is what precisely it means to appreciate \u201cthe nature and quality\u201d of one\u2019s actions. In the context of the insanity defense, at least, the Supreme Court has described that concept simply, as an understanding of what one is doing. <em>See State v. Trapp, </em>56 Or 588, 591, 109 P 1094 (1910) (describing insanity as a person\u2019s inability \u201cto know what he was doing\u201d and \u201cto distinguish between right and wrong\u201d). More specifically, Professor LaFave explains that, as used in the description of the insanity defense in <em>M\u2019Naghten\u2019s Case, </em>8 Eng Rep 718 (1843), from which Oregon\u2019s formulation evolved, \u201cthe entire phrase has been typically held to mean that the defendant must have understood the physical nature and consequences of the act. Thus, an accused must have known that holding a flame to a building would cause it to burn, or that holding a person\u2019s head <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>under water would cause him to die.\u201d Wayne R. LaFave, 1 <em>Substantive Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 7.2(b)(3) (2d ed 2003).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Unlike <em>M\u2019Naghten </em>and other criminal capacity tests using the phrase \u201cnature and quality of the act,\u201d ORS 4190.349(3) speaks to an appreciation of \u201cthe nature and quality of the conduct\u201d without a corresponding reference to an appreciation for the wrongfulness of that conduct. And given the breadth of the other words used in ORS 4190.349(3), the phrase \u201cnature and quality of the conduct\u201d has a slightly broader meaning than an appreciation of the physical nature of the act. The word \u201cappreciate\u201d is a broad term reflecting an \u201cemotional as well as intellectual cognition of the act,\u201d <em>Dyer, </em>16 Or App at 258, which signifies that the legislature had more in mind than just an appreciation of the physical nature and physical consequences of the act. <em>See, e.g., </em>LaFave, 1 <em>Substantive Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 7.2(b)(3) (\u201c\u2018To know the quality of an act, with all its social and emotional implications, requires more than an abstract, purely intellectual knowledge. Likewise, to talk of appreciating the full significance of an act means that \u201cnature and quality\u201d must be understood as including more than the physical nature of the act.\u2019\u201d (quoting A. Goldstein, <em>The Insanity Defense </em>51 (1967))). Further, ORS 419C.349(3) does not simply require a finding that the youth \u201cappreciate [d] the nature and quality of the conduct involved\u201d; the court must make that determination in connection with the youth\u2019s \u201csophistication and maturity.\u201d By connecting the capacity determination with those qualities \u2014 specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>\u201csophistication,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>a worldly-wise character, <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 2174 \u2014 ORS 419C.349(3) suggests an appreciation of one\u2019s acts and their consequences that is broad enough to include appreciation that the actions are wrongful or will have criminal consequences. We therefore conclude that the phrase \u201cappreciate the nature and quality of the conduct,\u201d as used in ORS 419C.349(3), describes an appreciation of the physical nature and consequences of one\u2019s conduct, along with the wrongful or criminal quality of that conduct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">The text of ORS 419C.349(3) is not so broad, however, to require that a youth have the ability to conform the youth\u2019s conduct to the requirements of the law. The legislature has distinguished that ability from an ability to appreciate the criminality of conduct. <em>See </em>ORS 161.295(1) (insanity involves mental disease or defect that impairs \u201csubstantial capacity <em>either </em>to appreciate the criminality of the conduct <em>or </em>to conform the conduct to the requirements of the law\u201d (emphasis added)). Since the enactment of the sophistication and maturity criterion in 1985, the legislature has similarly distinguished between conforming one\u2019s conduct to the law and \u201cappreciating] the nature and quality\u201d of an act, when, in 2005, it amended ORS 419C.411(2) to describe the insanity defense available to youths in juvenile proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">\u201cThe court shall find a youth responsible except for insanity if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">\u201c(a) The youth asserted mental disease or defect as a defense ***; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">\u201c(b) The court determined by a preponderance of the evidence that, as a result of mental disease or defect at the time the youth committed the act alleged in the petition, the youth lacked substantial capacity either <em>to appreciate the nature and quality of the act or to conform the youth\u2019s conduct to the requirements of law?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Halperin v. Pitts, </em>352 Or 482, 490, 287 P3d 1069 (2012) (stating that later-enacted, related statutes may be helpful \u201cfor the purpose of demonstrating consistency (or inconsistency) in word usage as indirect evidence of what the enacting legislature most likely intended\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">As our review thus far shows, the text of ORS 4190.349(3) in context is plainly inconsistent with youth\u2019s reading of the statute. Youth\u2019s primary argument \u2014 that the legislature meant above-average sophistication and maturity \u2014 relies entirely on the definitions of sophistication and maturity, which, in youth\u2019s view, \u201cinvolve behavior, intellect and emotions beyond those of an average thirteen-year-old.\u201d However, as we have explained, ORS 4190.349(3) is satisfied if the youth possesses sufficient sophistication and maturity \u2014 enough of that <em>quality </em>\u2014 to <em>appreciate the nature and quality of the conduct involved. </em>The level of maturity and sophistication that is \u201csufficient\u201d is not determined by comparing the youth to others; it is determined by the youth\u2019s capacity to appreciate the essential character of his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Likewise, youth\u2019s related contention \u2014 that the court, in making that finding, should evaluate the youth\u2019s sophistication and maturity in a more holistic sense, taking into account his \u201cvulnerability to peer pressure\u201d and inability to \u201cresist [] the influence of other youth [s],\u201d among other things \u2014 cannot be squared with the text of ORS 419C.349(3). Although the ability \u201cto appreciate the nature and quality of the conduct involved\u201d is broad enough to include an appreciation of the criminality or wrongfulness of one\u2019s actions, that phrase\u2019s text is not so broad that it encompasses an ability to make responsible decisions, resist peer pressure, and control impulses. Those considerations may relate to a youth\u2019s ability to conform his conduct to the law, but the legislature did not speak so broadly in creating a threshold capacity determination for waiver in ORS 419C.349(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Our discussion thus far also highlights our disagreement with the dissent\u2019s very broad formulation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>ability \u201cto appreciate the nature and quality of the conduct involved,\u201d which includes an understanding of \u201cthe effect on the victim and other consequences of the conduct\u201d; \u201cthe youth\u2019s empathetic capacity\u201d; the \u201cyouth\u2019s judgment-making ability\u201d; and \u201cthe youth\u2019s capacity to think independently in light of outside influences.\u201d 268 Or App at 552-53 (Egan, J., dissenting). That broad formulation of ORS 4190.349(3) is untethered from the dictionary definitions on which it is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">For example, working from the term \u201cappreciate\u201d\u2014 defined as the ability \u201cto judge or evaluate the worth, merit, quality, or significance of\u2019 and to \u201ccomprehend with knowledge, judgment, and discrimination,\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 105\u2014 the dissent concludes that a youth must \u201cbe able to make judgments\u201d about the consequences of the conduct. 268 Or App at 551 (Egan, J., dissenting). But that definition is stretched beyond the ability to evaluate to include the ability to resist peer pressure and control impulses; the dissent later explains that a youth\u2019s \u201cjudgment-making ability\u201d necessarily includes a consideration of \u201cthe youth\u2019s capacity to think independently in light of outside influences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 552 (Egan, J., dissenting). Likewise, from the definitions of \u201cnature\u201d and \u201cquality\u201d \u2014 the \u201cessential character\u201d of something, <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 1507, 1858 \u2014 the dissent interprets \u201cessential character\u201d to include not just the wrongfulness of the act, but \u201cthe effect on the victim,\u201d along with unspecified \u201cother consequences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Egan, J., dissenting). Given the qualitative nature of all the terms used in ORS 419C.349(3) and the Rorschach-like nature of definitions like \u201cessential character,\u201d we think the better approach\u2014 and the one dictated by the longstanding use of the terms in ORS 419C.349(3) with respect to criminal capacity \u2014 is to rely on the terms\u2019 more limited meaning in the context of descriptions of criminal capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Yet the dissent rejects any reference to common-law or statutory formulations for criminal incapacity as context for understanding ORS 419C.349(3).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The dissent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>rejects those sources as that context for three reasons: (1) the current description of the insanity defense in ORS 161.295(1) does not use the phrase \u201cnature and quality\u201d of the conduct; (2) the general purpose of the criminal code (punishment) \u2014 where the insanity defense statute is found \u2014 is different from the general purpose of the juvenile code (rehabilitation) \u2014 where the waiver statute is found; and (3) \u201cthe adult insanity defense addresses <em>impaired </em>adult minds, while the waiver statute deals with <em>undeveloped </em>juvenile minds.\u201d 268 Or App at 543 (Egan, J., dissenting) (emphasis in original). None of those arguments convinces us that we should disregard the more narrow use of \u201cnature and quality,\u201d as is often used in the context of criminal capacity, in favor of the expansive formulation that the dissent adopts.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">First, although the dissent focuses on the absence of the phrase \u201cnature and quality\u201d of conduct in the insanity defense statute, as noted earlier, that phrase has been used to describe criminal capacity at common law in Oregon (and across the country) since the nineteenth century. It is that developed legal meaning \u2014 one that the legislature took notice of and incorporated into the insanity defense statute, ORS 161.295(1) \u2014 that is important context for ORS 4190.349(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Second, the fact that those common-law tests for criminal responsibility have been incorporated into <em>the criminal code, </em>as with Oregon\u2019s insanity defense statute, does not mean that they should be treated as irrelevant because the criminal code has a different purpose than the juvenile code. After all, the waiver statute serves as a bridge between the juvenile system and the criminal system, carving out an exception (adult prosecution) for youths who are ordinarily under the jurisdiction of the juvenile system. Like the insanity defense statute in the criminal code, the waiver statute is intended to determine whether a person should be subject to criminal prosecution. And, in any event, the insanity defense found in the criminal code is markedly similar to ORS 419C.411(2), the insanity provision found <em>in the juvenile code </em>(which specifically references \u201cthe nature and quality of the act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Third, although the dissent is correct that \u201cthe adult insanity defense addresses <em>impaired </em>adult minds, while the waiver statute deals with <em>undeveloped </em>juvenile minds,\u201d 268 Or App at 543 (Egan, J., dissenting) (emphasis in original), it does not follow that the test for incapacity due to insanity sheds no light on the test for incapacity that the legislature adopted in ORS 419C.349(3). Indeed, the judicial and legislative tests for criminal incapacity due to insanity resemble formulations used to describe incapacity due to age. <em>See </em>LaFave, 2 <em>Substantive Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 9.6(a) (noting that \u201c[v]arious phrases have been used to describe what is required\u201d to rebut the presumption of incapacity due to age \u2014 including \u201cguilty knowledge of wrongdoing, a mischievous inclination, an intelligent design and malice in the execution of the act, a consciousness of the wrongfulness of the act, and knowledge of good from evil\u201d \u2014 and explaining that \u201cthe most modern definition of the test is simply that the surrounding circumstances must demonstrate * * * that the individual knew what he was doing and that it was wrong\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted; omission in LaFave)).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although one test is concerned with lack of capacity due to mental defect while the other is concerned with lack of capacity caused by naturally occurring developmental delay, both tests use mental capacity to determine when it is appropriate for a person to be tried in criminal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">We turn to youth\u2019s separate contextual argument that the structure of the waiver statutes and changes to those statutes over time \u2014 specifically amendments made in 1995 \u2014 support his view of ORS 419C.349(3). To better understand that argument, we briefly review the development of ORS 419C.349 and ORS 419C.352.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Those statutes were originally part of <em>former </em>ORS 419.533, which allowed for discretionary waiver (then called \u201cremand\u201d) of 15-, 16-, and 17-year-olds. Or Laws 1985, ch 631, \u00a7 1. <em>Former </em>ORS 419.533(l)(c) and (d) set out the waiver criteria as they now exist, apart from minor changes in terminology. <em>Former </em>ORS 419.533(3) operated as a limitation on subsection (1) by specifying that 15-year-olds must be represented by counsel and could only be waived for one of six crimes, whereas 16- and 17-year-olds were subject to waiver for various felonies. In 1993, as part of a renumbering, <em>former </em>ORS 419.533(1) became ORS 419C.349 and <em>former </em>ORS 419.533(3) became ORS 419C.352. Or Laws 1993, ch 33, \u00a7\u00a7 213-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">In 1995, without making any changes to the waiver criteria in ORS 4190.349(3) and (4), the legislature made several changes to which youths would be subject to those criteria. First, as a reflection of the voters\u2019 intent in approving Ballot Measure 11 (1994), the legislature made 15- to 17-year-olds automatically subject to prosecution as adults for Measure 11 crimes (and for aggravated murder). Or Laws 1995, ch 422, \u00a7 49.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Second, by amending ORS 419C.352 and lowering the minimum age of criminal responsibility to 12, the legislature made ORS 419C.352 applicable to 12- to 14-year-olds who committed murder or any aggravated form thereof, first-degree rape, first-degree sodomy, and first-degree unlawful sexual penetration. Or Laws 1995, ch 422, \u00a7 78 (amending ORS 419C.352 to allow for waiver of a \u201cyouth under 15 years of age\u201d if, <em>inter alia, </em>the \u201c[t] he juvenile court makes the findings required under ORS 419C.349(3) and (4)\u201d); Or Laws 1995, ch 422, \u00a7 58 (amending ORS 161.290 to lower the minimum age of criminal responsibility to 12). As noted, ORS 419C.349 was unchanged, and that statute continued to make 15- to 17-year-olds who committed certain non-Measure 11 felonies subject to discretionary waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Youth\u2019s argument based on those 1995 amendments proceeds as follows. First, youth argues that the legislature\u2019s placement of 15- to 17-year-olds charged with aggravated murder and Measure 11 crimes in adult court reflects a legislative presumption that those youths are \u201csophisticated and mature enough to stand trial as adults.\u201d Second, by making that presumption, the legislature intended to set the benchmark for sophistication and maturity that a youth subject to discretionary waiver should be compared against. As a result, a 12- to 14-year-old must have sophistication and maturity similar to a 15- to 17-year-old to satisfy ORS 419C.349(3); \u201caverage\u201d sophistication and maturity for one\u2019s age group is not enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">We are not persuaded by that structural reading of the waiver statutes. Youth\u2019s proposed interpretation of ORS 419C.349(3) \u2014 based entirely on changes, made in 1995, to other waiver statutes \u2014 is at odds with the text of ORS 419C.349(3), which has remained substantially unchanged since its enactment in 1985 as <em>former </em>ORS 419.533(l)(c). We recognize that \u201c[l]ater amendments that materially change the text <em>or context </em>of an earlier statute can change the meaning of the earlier statute when the changed meaning is either \u2018expressly declared or necessarily implied.\u2019\u201d <em>Dept. of Human Services v. S. M., </em>355 Or 241, 250, 323 P3d 947 (2014) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>State v. Ofodrinwa, </em>353 Or 507, 529-30, 300 P3d 154 (2013)). But here, nothing about the contextual changes that youth identifies \u2014 changes to <em>who </em>ORS 4190.349(3) and (4) apply to \u2014 necessarily implies a change to the meaning of ORS 4190.349(3). In other words, the legislature\u2019s decision to make certain older youths charged with Measure 11 crimes subject to adult court prosecution did not implicitly reset the \u201csophistication and maturity\u201d standard by which younger youths should be judged.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>In sum, the text and context of ORS 419C.349(3) reflect the legislature\u2019s recognition that some youths, because of lack of maturity and sophistication, will not have the mental and emotional facility to understand their actions in a physical sense and that those actions are wrong and will likely have criminal consequences. For those youths, ORS 419C.349(3) serves as a bar to waiver into adult court. And for youths who meet that criterion, the juvenile court may then proceed to ORS 4190.349(4) to determine if retaining jurisdiction is in the best interest of the youth and society. The wide-ranging criteria in subsection (4) allow for a more thorough-going evaluation of the youth\u2019s circumstances\u2014 including the \u201cthe previous history of the youth\u201d and the youth\u2019s \u201cphysical, emotional and mental health\u201d \u2014 as well as the manner in which the offense was alleged to have been committed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although those criteria may account for some considerations related to those that youth <em>highlights </em>\u2014 e.g., the degree to which a 20-year-old influenced youth\u2019s involvement in the crime \u2014 the text and context of ORS 4190.349(3) show that that provision functions as a more narrow, focused, and preliminary inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">The legislative history confirms our understanding of ORS 4190.349(3). Specifically, the legislative history shows that the legislature, when it adopted the sophistication and maturity criterion in 1985, viewed it as requiring a specific, threshold finding of mental capacity before the court engaged in a more holistic evaluation of the youth\u2019s circumstances. The history of the amendments to related statutes in 1995 does not show that the legislature intended to alter that criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The sophistication and maturity criterion was first included in the discretionary waiver criteria in 1985 along with several amendments to <em>former </em>ORS 419.533. Those amendments began in 1983 with House Bill (HB) 2955 as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>part of an effort, led by Senator Nancy Ryles, to reform the waiver process (then called \u201cremand\u201d). Senator Ryles explained that one of the \u201cmajor components\u201d of the bill was to lower the age of remand from 16 to 14 \u201cin the case of violent crimes only.\u201d Testimony, House Committee on Judiciary, Subcommittee 1, HB 2955, May 18, 1983, Ex A (statement of Sen Nancy Ryles) (underscoring omitted). According to Senator Ryles, the legislature had made \u201cexceptions\u201d to the \u201cgeneral philosophy that juveniles may be lacking in understanding or information and therefore may not be fully responsible for the crime they have committed\u201d by allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to be tried as adults, but the legislature had \u201cnot yet come to terms with those exceptional cases where a younger teenager commits a violent crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Senator Ryles viewed the existing remand framework as inadequate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-4\">\u201cIt is not realistic to say that a 14 or 15-year-old is not sufficiently mature to understand the gravity of a violent crime, while a 16-year-old is. We cannot persist in totally defining juveniles by an arbitrary age limit, ignoring the fact that maturation is a gradual process and that some 14 and 15-year-olds may well understand the serious nature of the violent crime they have committed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Senator Ryles further explained that HB 2955 created a framework for a discretionary remand procedure for all youths subject to remand \u2014 those 14 to 17 \u2014 by setting out criteria that \u201cmust be weighed whenever the remand of any juvenile is being considered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(underscoring omitted).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Those criteria became the focus of representatives from the American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon (ACLU) and the Juvenile Rights Project (JRP). Along with substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>amendments to several other criteria,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the ACLU proposed an amendment to remove the bill\u2019s criterion of \u201csufficient sophistication and maturity to appreciate the nature and quality of the conduct involved\u201d from its present position. The ACLU proposed that it be replaced with a criterion identical to the wording in <em>Kent v. United States, </em>383 US 541, 86 S Ct 1045, 16 L Ed 84 (1966) \u2014 \u201c[t]he sophistication and maturity of the child as determined by consideration of the child\u2019s home, environmental situation, emotional attitude and pattern of living\u201d \u2014 and moved into the list of \u201cbest interests\u201d criteria. Exhibit E, House Committee on Judiciary, Subcommittee 1, HB 2955, May 18, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Eventually, Senator Ryles reached a compromise with the ACLU and JRP regarding the criteria, including the \u201csufficient sophistication and maturity\u201d criterion appearing in the original bill:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">\u201cThe only other question was in the original bill we had set the first one up \u2014 \u2018the child at the time of the alleged offense was of sufficient sophistication [and] maturity to appreciate the nature and quality of the conduct involved.\u2019 We had set that outside the criteria because we felt that was just the first step one had to do. <em>If you had a child that didn\u2019t know what they had done and couldn\u2019t understand what they had done, one really didn\u2019t even need to move to any other criteria. </em>Right away that child should not be remanded. But if * * * the subcommittee did X that out and decided they wanted to list that under the criteria, that\u2019s fine with me. That\u2019s really just a writing style.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-7\">\u201cBut I still think it should be the number one criteria and the number one thing that we have in there because <em>in case there is a case of a mentally retarded child or someone that is extremely emotionally disturbed or something like that, *** that\u2019s the criteria the court first looks at </em>and then you begin to measure all these other things to see if remand is the appropriate policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Tape Recording, House Committee on Judiciary, HB 2955, June 6, 1983, Tape 408, Side A (statement of Sen Nancy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Ryles) (emphasis added). Senator Ryles further noted that the \u201csufficient sophistication\u201d criterion set forth in the original bill was \u201csimilar to\u201d the amendment proposed by the ACLU, but explained that she viewed its placement in the original bill as \u201ca much stronger protection for juveniles in this position rather than being listed with the criteria.\u201d Exhibit P, House Committee on Judiciary, HB 2955, June 6, 1983. The original version, Senator Ryles reiterated, \u201cwould have the effect of eliminating any consideration of remand if, for example, the juvenile was retarded, too immature to understand the nature of the act, etc.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(underscoring omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">The committee ultimately voted to adopt the wording and placement of the \u201csufficient sophistication and maturity\u201d criterion, as originally proposed by Senator Ryles. Just before that vote, Senator Ryles again explained that that criterion would ensure \u201cthat you are dealing with a person that the judge can determine is responsible for what they did and they know what they did.\u201d Tape Recording, House Committee on Judiciary, HB 2955, June 6, 1983, Tape 408, Side A (statement of Sen Nancy Ryles).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The bill, as amended, was approved in the House but remained in the Senate without a hearing when the 1983 legislature adjourned.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">A bill identical to the final version of HB 2955, Senate Bill (SB) 414, was introduced in 1985, with Senator Ryles again shepherding the bill through the legislature. Although there were no changes to the \u201csufficient sophistication and maturity\u201d criterion (and few changes to the other criteria), Senator Ryles again explained that criterion to a subcommittee of the House Committee on Judiciary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">\u201c[T]he main thing I think you really want to look at is on page 1 of the bill, the judge has [to] look very carefully to say that a person charged with [a] crime was of sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>sophistication and maturity to appreciate the nature and quality of the conduct involved. <em>So you\u2019re really saying yes, the person knew what they did, they knew the consequences of what they did and they were of sufficient maturity to understand that at the time.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Tape Recording, House Committee on Judiciary, Subcommittee 1, SB 414, May 30, 1985, Tape 692 (statement of Sen Nancy Ryles) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The ACLU and JRP generally voiced support for some parts of the bill, including the criteria that had been extensively discussed in 1983, and they did not propose any changes to the \u201csufficient sophistication and maturity\u201d criterion. Those groups did, however, oppose making 14- and 15-year-olds subject to adult prosecution. Tape Recording, Senate Committee on Judiciary, SB 414, May 7, 1985, Tape 123, Side A (statement of Claudia Burton for ACLU; statement of Margaret Nightingale, Staff Attorney for JRP). They argued that the test of criminal responsibility for youths should \u201cinvolve!] both a capacity to distinguish right from wrong and an ability to conform one\u2019s actions to that understanding\u201d because youths \u201care impulsive (and may have great difficulty controlling [their] impulses), they may have poor judgment, and they are likely to be influenced by their peers.\u201d Testimony, House Committee on Judiciary, Subcommittee 1, SB 414, May 30,1985, Ex D (statement of Claudia Burton).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>In response to some of those concerns, Senator Ryles reiterated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-4\">\u201cthe reason for lowering the age of remand and giving the judge the discretion is the relationship to chronological age * * * isn\u2019t a very good measurement, and the other * * * reason for doing it is so therefore even though they\u2019ll serve their sentence in time in a juvenile facility they will not be subject to release at age 21 and they will not be subject to having their record expunged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Tape Recording, Senate Committee on Judiciary, SB 414, May 7, 1985, Tape 124, Side A (statement of Sen Nancy Ryles). Ultimately, the subcommittee agreed to amend the bill to eliminate the remand option for 14-year-olds, but kept the remand option for 15-year-olds. Tape Recording, House Committee on Judiciary, Subcommittee 1, SB 414, June 10, 1985, Tape 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Our review of the legislative history leading to the adoption of the sophistication and maturity criterion confirms our understanding of that provision, as informed by the text in context, and contradicts the competing view that the dissent and youth propose. That criterion was described by the legislation\u2019s chief sponsor as testing the ability of youths to \u201cknow what they ha[d] done,\u201d \u201cunderstand what they had done,\u201d and to understand \u201cthe consequences of what they [had done].\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In describing those youths who would not meet that criterion, Senator Ryles did not give examples of exceptionally mature youths, but those who generally would be thought of as being less mature or sophisticated than their peers, like those youths who are \u201cmentally retarded,\u201d \u201cextremely emotionally disturbed,\u201d or \u201ctoo immature to understand the nature of the act.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Those specific, repeated descriptions of the sophistication and maturity criterion cannot be overcome by the single contrary statement by a nonlegislator witness that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>youth relies upon. <em>See </em>Testimony, House Committee on Judiciary, Subcommittee 1, SB 414, May 30, 1985, Ex F (statement of Keith Meisenheimer, Multnomah County District Attorney\u2019s Office) (stating that remand would be appropriate for youths with \u201cadvanced maturity, sociopathic character, past record of failure in juvenile court programs, established history of criminal conduct, large size, independence of parental or other adult authority or influence, etc.\u201d). Indeed, the same witness, when speaking directly to the remand criteria, explained that the criteria were meant to prevent remand for \u201cthose who technically would commit one of these crimes, but do so under circumstances that suggest impulsivity, immaturity.\u201d Tape Recording, House Committee on Judiciary, Subcommittee 1, SB 414, May 30, 1985, Tape 694 (statement of Keith Meisenheimer). In any event, we give more weight to the specific statements of the bill sponsor \u2014 directed specifically at the sophistication and maturity criterion \u2014 as opposed to statements that serve as a general gloss on the entire bill. <em>See State v. Kelly, </em>229 Or App 461, 467, 211 P3d 932, <em>rev den, </em>347 Or 446 (2009) (\u201c[T]he more clearly the history speaks to the meaning of the disputed terms in issue, the more weight the history will be accorded.\u201d).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Youth\u2019s view of the statute is also difficult to reconcile with the specific concerns raised by the ACLU and JRP as to lowering the remand age. If, as youth argues, the criterion was meant as a holistic measurement of a youth\u2019s sophistication and maturity that prevented remand unless the youth possessed those qualities beyond his or her age, then that would likely address \u2014 or at least be relevant to\u2014 the ACLU\u2019s and JRP\u2019s concern that remand was inappropriate for 14- and 15-year-olds because they were impulsive, had poor judgment, and were more susceptible to peer pressure. But we can infer that those groups felt that the criteria, taken together, did not adequately address that concern. Indeed, the broad view of capacity that those groups <em>referenced </em>\u2014 i.e., considering not just the \u201ccapacity to understand the nature and consequences of his acts and to distinguish right from wrong in reference to the charged offense,\u201d but also the ability to \u201cconform [one\u2019s] behavior to the requirement of the law\u201d \u2014 stands in contrast to the more restricted test of capacity that the legislature adopted as an initial hurdle before the court considers the youth\u2019s and society\u2019s best interests in deciding whether to retain jurisdiction. Testimony, House Committee on Judiciary, Subcommittee 1, SB 414, May 30, 1985, Ex D (statement of Claudia Burton).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">We turn, finally, to the legislative history surrounding the changes to the waiver statutes in Senate Bill (SB) 1 (1995). Those changes were largely based on the recommendations of then-Attorney General Kulongoski\u2019s Juvenile Justice Task Force, which proposed an overhaul of the juvenile justice system. As part of that effort, the task force reviewed the implementation of Measure 11 with respect to juvenile crime and \u201cdeveloped recommendations for legislative action to fill in the measure\u2019s substantive and procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>gaps.\u201d Exhibit C, Senate Committee on Judiciary, SB 1, Jan 26, 1995. To remedy one of those perceived substantive gaps, the task force recommended that 12- to 14-year-olds be made eligible for waiver for murder, rape, and other serious felonies. The task force noted that youths under 15 years of age were committing \u201cserious violent crimes,\u201d which Measure 11 did not address:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\">\u201cUnder existing law, a 14-year-old murderer-rapist cannot be tried as an adult or confined in juvenile facilities beyond his or her 21st birthday, whether or not the youth is a threat to the community and likely to re-offend. With an increasing number of serious violent crimes committed by individuals under 15, this glaring omission from Measure 11 represents a continuing threat to public safety.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-5\"><em>Id. </em>Craig Campbell, task force coordinator, spoke to the task force\u2019s reasons for including those youths in SB 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">\u201cThe conversation * * * occurred [in the task force] relative to 12, 13 and 14 year olds *** as things were getting close to election on Ballot Measure 11, so it was certainly taken into consideration reflecting what Ballot Measure 11 would mean. <em>The belief of the task force was there are certain very violent offenses that younger people are committing and for that reason they felt that it was important to make sure that those juveniles would fit into the Measure 11 consideration. </em>Of course they were also making that consideration based on the fact that for these violent offenses they still wanted to make sure that those 12, 13 and 14 year olds who were treated under Measure 11 would be subject to the second look. So they were not two separate considerations but were in fact the same thing. They wanted to make sure that if there was a very violent act from a 12 or 13 year old or 14 year old that they be given a sentence of more duration than they currently would get but also wanted to make sure that we gave them this second look in case they were reformable.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Tape Recording, Senate Committee on Judiciary, Subcommittee on Juvenile Justice, SB 1, Mar 6, 1995, Tape 38, Side A (statement of Craig Campbell) (emphasis added). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>The task force observed \u201ca growing number of incidences of [12- to 14-year-olds] committing very violent crimes,\u201d and SB 1 sought \u201c[t]o deal with these youths *** by add[ing] provisions allowing these youths to serve longer sentences.\u201d Exhibit A, Senate Committee on Judiciary, SB 1, Mar 16, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">Apart from a technical amendment that changed the text and structure of ORS 419C.352,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> SB 1 changed that statute to make youths under 15 subject to discretionary waiver criteria for the crimes of murder or aggravated murder, first-degree rape, first-degree sodomy, and first-degree unlawful sexual penetration. The legislative history does not show that the legislature focused on the meaning of those specific criteria, though one witness noted that those criteria were already part of the framework for discretionary waiver. <em>See </em>Tape Recording, Senate Committee on Judiciary, Subcommittee on Juvenile Justice, SB 1, Feb 24, 1995, Tape 26, Side B (statement of Michael Livingston, Department of Justice) (explaining that the findings referenced in ORS 419C.352, as amended by SB 1, were the same that the juvenile court currently had to make for discretionary waiver under ORS 419C.349).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">There were, however, discussions about two issues peripheral to that change: whether 14-year-olds charged with those crimes should be automatically placed in adult court rather than be subjected to discretionary waiver (in effect extending Measure ll\u2019s requirement that 15- to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>17-year-olds be tried as adults to 14-year-olds); and whether SB 1 should eliminate all provisions as to waiver for 12- to 14-year-olds so that the bill would be limited, as Measure 11 was, to 15- to 17-year-olds. Those proposals were discussed throughout the passage of the bill,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and various committees made changes as SB 1 wound through the legislature.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Ultimately, the House Committee on Judiciary, Subcommittee on Juvenile Justice, amended the bill to delete the section that automatically placed 14-year-olds accused of murder and other specified crimes in adult court. Minutes, House Committee on Judiciary, Subcommittee on Juvenile Justice, SB 1, May 4, 1995, 2. The legislature instead made 14-year-olds, along with 12- and 13-year-olds, who were accused of those crimes, subject to discretionary waiver, as ORS 419C.352 now reflects.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Nothing in the history of SB 1 shows that the legislature rethought or refashioned the discretionary waiver criteria in ORS 419C.349. Nor does any of that history reflect an intent that the juvenile court should evaluate a youth\u2019s sophistication and maturity in comparison to those older youths who are automatically subject to adult court. The legislature, concerned with younger youths who were committing violent crimes, expanded the age bracket for waiver of youths to adult court so that those could be subject to longer sentences. In doing so, the legislature left the criteria that guide the waiver decision unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The text, context, and legislative history of ORS 419C.349(3) reflect the legislature\u2019s intent to allow waiver for those youths who, by nature of their sophistication and maturity, understand what they are doing in a physical sense and understand that their actions are wrong or will likely have criminal consequences. In this case, the court found that youth demonstrated an \u201cawareness regarding the nature of the criminal act, the degree of his participation in the criminal act, and an awareness of the consequences of the criminal act if apprehended by authorities.\u201d The evidence supports those findings.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The state\u2019s expert, for example, stated that youth \u201cknew that he would be in legal trouble from his encounter with [the victim]\u201d; he could \u201carticulate that what he did was wrong and understands the consequences\u201d; and he was \u201cjust as effective or more effective (because of his strong cognitive ability) in understanding that his crime was wrong and identifying alternatives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>to his actions.\u201d Youth\u2019s expert, Bolstad, agreed that, if youth had been asked by Aguilar-Mandujano to aid in the robbery and murder of the victim, as youth told police, youth could appreciate that what he was about to do was against the law and that what he was doing was potentially going to harm someone. The court did not err in finding that youth satisfied ORS 4190.349(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b532-9\"> The court considered only the aggravated murder charge in its waiver decision, but the court ultimately ordered that youth be waived to adult court on the charges for robbery and unlawful use of a weapon, as well. <em>See </em>ORS 419C.358 (requiring that \u201c[a]ny nonwaivable charges arising out of the same act or transaction as the waivable offense shall be consolidated with the waivable charge for purposes of conducting the adjudicatory hearing on the nonwaivable charges\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b535-6\"> The \u201cverbal illustrations\u201d in <em>Webster\u2019s </em>provide \u201cappropriate uses of [a defined term] in context.\u201d <em>Dewsnup v.

He argues that, as between the two statutes, \u201cthat which the actor needs to \u2018appreciate\u2019 is entirely different.\u201d That is, in youth\u2019s view, appreciating \u201cthe criminality\u201d of conduct is very different than appreciating the \u201cnature and quality\u201d of conduct. Youth does not, however, explain what it means to \u201cappreciate the nature and quality of the conduct involved,\u201d apart from arguing that it does <em>not </em>mean \u201can intellectual appreciation, after the fact, that the conduct was unlawful.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b538-5\"> <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law </em>provides a similar description of what it means to appreciate the \u201cnature and quality\u201d of one\u2019s actions, at least in contrast to appreciating the wrongfulness of those actions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">\u201cThe <em>M\u2019Naghten </em>test consists of two elements which logically can be separated.

The majority reaches this extremely low-threshold interpretation of ORS 4190.349(3) through a mistaken analogy to the adult criminal insanity defense statute. Because the long-recognized and legislatively dictated goals of the juvenile code are not comparable to those of the adult criminal code, the majority\u2019s analogy is inapt. Moreover, an interpretive gloss pulled from the adult insanity defense statute is not needed to give meaning to the words of the juvenile waiver statute or to effectuate the intent of the legislature because ORS 419C.349(3) has a logical meaning that follows from the text and context of that statute.

IMMATURITY IS PROFOUNDLY DIFFERENT FROM A MENTAL DEFECT IN ADULTS</p>\n<p id=\"b559-15\">The majority draws a false analogy between the waiver statute and the adult criminal insanity defense statute. That analogy is based on the words \u201cnature and quality.\u201d 268 Or App at 518-19. Those words are present in the waiver statute but absent from the adult criminal insanity defense statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-16\">ORS 161.295(1), the adult criminal insanity defense statute, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>\u201cA person is guilty except for insanity if, as a result of mental disease or defect at the time of engaging in criminal conduct, the person lacks substantial capacity either to <em>appreciate the criminality </em>of the conduct or to <em>conform the conduct </em>to the requirements of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Given that the words \u201cnature and quality\u201d are absent from that statute, to create a connection between the adult insanity defense statute and the waiver statute, the majority relies on <em>State v. Dyer, </em>16 Or App 247, 518 P2d 184 (1974). In <em>Dyer, </em>the majority reversed its prior interpretation of the insanity defense statute on reconsideration and held, over a dissent,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the condition required to find a person guilty except for insanity under ORS 161.295(1)\u2014 that a person \u201clacks substantial capacity * * * to appreciate the criminality of the conduct\u201d \u2014 was the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of the former test in Oregon. 16 Or App at 257. The Oregon Supreme Court articulated that former test in <em>State v.

The use of two words does not persuade me that the adult insanity defense statute ought to be used as a template for the juvenile waiver statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This is especially so because, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>as explained below, the juvenile code is <em>sui generis </em>and contains legislatively mandated policies that starkly diverge from those of the criminal code. Moreover, the words \u201cnature and quality\u201d in the waiver statute have a logical meaning, independent of any analogy to the adult criminal code, that follows from the text and context of that statute. As we have long recognized, the statute\u2019s text is \u201cthe best evidence of the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>PGE v.

The adult insanity defense statute is concerned with the effects of a \u201cdisease or defect\u201d on a person\u2019s \u201ccapacity,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> whereas the waiver statute is concerned with \u201csophistication and maturity.\u201d To say it another way, the adult insanity defense addresses <em>impaired </em>adult minds, while the waiver statute deals with <em>undeveloped </em>juvenile minds. The majority\u2019s definition of \u201cnature and quality\u201d nullifies that distinction. It is only after nullifying that critical distinction that the majority can reach the conclusion that the youth waiver statute is analogous to the adult insanity defense statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">That distinction is crucial. A youth\u2019s ability to know that something is wrong or criminal bears little relationship to the adult-like qualities denoted by the words \u201csophistication and maturity.\u201d 268 Or App at 516 (concluding that the words \u201csophistication and maturity,\u201d in isolation, \u201cdescribe qualities that are associated with a normal well-adjusted adult\u201d). Put another way, if a 13-year-old did not know that murder was wrong or criminal, we would not think that the youth\u2019s problem was one of \u201csophistication and maturity.\u201d We might, of course, think that the youth\u2019s problem related to a \u201cdisease or defect,\u201d but the waiver statute does not use that language. The majority\u2019s reduction of \u201cnature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>and quality\u201d to wrongfulness and physicality<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is inconsistent with the meaning of the other words used in the statute \u2014 that is to say, the majority\u2019s proffered interpretation of ORS 419C.349(3) does not make sense in the context of that statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We must interpret the meaning of the words in a statute as used in context. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Turning to examine ORS 4190.349(3) within the context of the remainder of the waiver statute, it is apparent that subsection (3), relating to a youth\u2019s \u201csophistication and maturity,\u201d is intended to combine with subsection (4), which contains a list of best-interest factors, to form a two-part test. Likewise, it is apparent that the best-interest factors in subsection (4) do not address development and, therefore, subsection (3) is the only portion of the waiver statute that allows courts to inquire into a youth\u2019s developmental capacity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s interpretation of ORS 419C.349(3) sets the bar so low that this inquiry loses nearly all significance. Such an interpretation of ORS 419C.349(3) is inconsistent with the context of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The legislature isolated the developmental capacity inquiry in subsection (3) from the best-interest factors inquiry in subsection (4). This is significant because a factor test requires a court to consider a combination of criteria and weigh each criterion against the others. By removing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>the developmental capacity inquiry from the factor test, the legislature confirmed that a youth\u2019s developmental capacity is of primary importance to the waiver statute and requires a court\u2019s exclusive consideration. In other words, a court must confront the developmental capacity inquiry squarely on its own terms, before balancing the best-interest factors.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s interpretation of ORS 419C.349(3), which downplays the significance of the developmental capacity inquiry, belies the primary role that the inquiry plays in the structure of the waiver statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">B. <em>The waiver statute within the context of juvenile law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The legislature\u2019s decision to make the developmental capacity inquiry primary in the waiver statute is in conformity with the long-recognized distinction between the juvenile code and the criminal code in Oregon law. The Oregon Supreme Court thoroughly analyzed the history of the treatment of juvenile offenders under Oregon law in <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Reynolds, </em>317 Or 560, 857 P2d 842 (1993).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Aside from restating that the juvenile code is civil, not criminal, <em>id. </em>at 567 n 6, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\">\u201cWithout exception, this court\u2019s cases support the conclusion that the Oregon juvenile justice system always has been focused on the rehabilitation of delinquent youth. <em>See, e.g., State v.

Then, despite the apparent \u201ctrend in the United States * * * toward the \u2018crime control\u2019 model of juvenile justice, especially for children who are involved with drugs, gang activity, or physical violence,\u201d the court recognized that Oregon remained faithful to its emphasis on rehabilitation and cited to the predecessor waiver statute as an example of that faithfulness. <em>Id. </em>at 568 n 7 (citing <em>former </em>ORS 419.533 (1985), <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 419C.349 (1993), the predecessor of the current waiver statute). The current text of ORS 419C.349(3) mirrors that of the predecessor statute. <em>Compare </em>ORS 449.533 (1985) <em>and </em>ORS 4190.349(3). Given the divergent goals of the juvenile code and the adult criminal code, the majority\u2019s analogy to the adult criminal insanity defense statute is a questionable source of meaning at best, and it is a particularly inapt analog to the waiver statute, which embodies the rehabilitative policy of the juvenile code. <em>Reynolds, </em>317 Or at 568 n 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">The distinction in Oregon law between the juvenile and adult criminal code aligns with, and has been informed by, a similar distinction in federal constitutional law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>is particularly the case with regards to ORS 419C.349(3), which quotes language approved by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Kent v. United States, </em>383 US 541, 86 S Ct 1045, 16 L Ed 2d 84 (1966).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Kent </em>is the beginning of a string of United States-Supreme Court cases interpreting the limits of the state\u2019s ability to prosecute and sentence youths. A more recent case in this line, <em>Roper v. Simmons, </em>543 US 551, 125 S Ct 1183, 161 L Ed 2d 1 (2011), echoes the concerns expressed in <em>Kent, </em>and reasons that, because juveniles have lessened culpability due to their youth, they are less deserving of the most severe punishments. As compared to adults, the court noted that juveniles have a \u201c\u2018lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility\u2019\u201d; they \u201care more vulnerable or susceptible to negative influences and outside pressures, including peer pressure\u201d; and their characters are \u201cnot as well formed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at US 569-70. In <em>Graham v. Florida, </em>560 US 48, 68, 130 S Ct 2011, 176 L Ed 2d 825 (2010), the court reached a similar conclusion based, in part, on the fundamental differences between adolescent and adult brains. (Citing the brief for the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry as <em>Amici Curiae.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"AP6\">Similar to federal law, Oregon law distinguishes between youths and adults who engage in criminal conduct, because juveniles do not have the same developmental capacity as adults. <em>See Reynolds, </em>317 Or at 566 (discussing early notions of youths\u2019 criminal capacity in Oregon); <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Fitch, </em>192 Or App 56, 64, 84 P3d 190 (2004) (concluding that, under the juvenile code, youths are not \u201ccriminally responsible for their conduct\u201d). Similarly, because youths are not culpable in the same sense as adults and are considered amenable to rehabilitation, the juvenile code focuses on rehabilitation and not punishment. <em>See generally Reynolds, </em>317 Or at 367-70 (tracing the history and policy of the juvenile code); ORS 419C.001 (outlining the rehabilitative policy of the juvenile code).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Oregon law and federal constitutional law have long been in conformity with the conclusions that science has only more recently reached through the development of brain imaging technology. According to the American Medical Association\u2019s summary of recent research into brain development, adolescent \u201cbrains are physiologically underdeveloped in the areas that control impulses, foresee consequences, and temper emotions. They handle information processing and the management of emotions differently from adults.\u201d Brief of the American Medical Association <em>et al. </em>as <em>Amici Curiae </em>at 5, <em>Roper, </em>543 US 551. Because of the particularities of an adolescent\u2019s brain development, \u201cstress, emotions, and peer pressure * * * operate on the adolescent mind differently and with special force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7-8. In terms of decision making, adolescents rely on the amygdala, \u201cthe area of the brain associated with primitive impulses of aggression, anger, and fear,\u201d whereas adults \u201ctend to process similar information through the frontal cortex, a cerebral area associated with impulse control and good judgment,\u201d and, moreover, \u201cthe regions of the brain associated with impulse control, risk assessment, and moral reasoning develop last, after late adolescence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11. Thus, according to the American Medical Association, \u201cadolescents are not simply miniature adults, with less experience or wisdom. They are also not as equipped as adults to engage in moral reasoning and adjust their conduct accordingly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Science confirms the fact that adolescents are fundamentally different from adults when it comes to criminal capacity \u2014 a fact that Oregon law has recognized for over 100 years, and a fact that our courts have repeatedly reconfirmed throughout the history of the juvenile code and earlier laws related to youthful offenders. <em>See Reynolds, </em>317 Or at 567-70 (analyzing pre-1993 cases related to Oregon\u2019s policies regarding youths who engage in criminal conduct); <em>Fitch, </em>192 Or App at 64 (concluding that youths are not \u201ccriminally responsible for their conduct\u201d). Of course, the courts cannot take credit for any premonition concerning the development of scientific data. Rather the legislative assemblies, juvenile authorities, and courts have all understood a deep psychological and spiritual truth: The manner in which we treat children defines us as a people; if we sow the fashionable and tawdry political wind of retribution toward juveniles, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>we reap the whirlwind of inhumanity waged against us all as citizens. There must be a distinction between adults and children. The waiver statute is an embodiment of that distinction. <em>Reynolds, </em>317 Or at 568 n 7. An interpretation of the waiver statute that depends on the adult criminal code is, therefore, fundamentally mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">To summarize, examining ORS 419C.349(3) in the context of the other provisions in the youth waiver statute, the legislature\u2019s intention to make the developmental capacity inquiry contained in that subsection exclusive and primary is clear. Next, examining the waiver statute within the context of the juvenile code as a whole, it is clear that the juvenile code is premised on, and primarily concerned with, the goal of rehabilitation and the distinction between youths and adults \u2014 a distinction which is echoed in federal constitutional law and buttressed by the science of brain development. Under the majority\u2019s interpretation \u2014 with its dependence on the adult criminal insanity defense statute \u2014 we would have to infer that the legislature wished to abrogate the distinction between the juvenile and the criminal code in the case of the waiver statute. Were this the case, the legislature could have easily said so, but it did not. Barring contrary evidence of legislative intent, we do not infer intent from silence. <em>State v. Hess, </em>342 Or 647, 660-61, 159 P3d 309 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">II. INTERPRETING THE TEXT OF THE STATUTE IN THE CASE AT HAND</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">As noted above, the majority depends on the words \u201cnature and quality\u201d for its analogy to the adult insanity defense statute. 268 Or App at 518-19. It is unnecessary to use that mistaken context to interpret those words because the meaning of the words follows logically from their use in the context of the waiver statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">According to their dictionary definitions, both words relate to the \u201cessential character\u201d of a thing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>thing that \u201cnature and quality\u201d relate to in this statute is the \u201cconduct involved\u201d in the commission of the crime. Thus, our task of interpreting the plain meaning of \u201cthe nature and quality of the conduct involved\u201d reduces to the question, what is essential to the criminal conduct at issue? That question may appear to present a vexing problem, but the solution is simple: We ask whether, if we removed an aspect from the conduct, that conduct would still be criminal. If, once an aspect is removed from the calculus, the conduct is no longer criminal, then that aspect must be essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Notably, the legislature instructed courts to consider whether a youth could appreciate the \u201cconduct involved\u201d in the particular crime. Consequently, depending upon the conduct at issue, the essential character of the conduct that the youth must appreciate may differ. Therefore, when applying the test outlined above, we must use a concrete example to determine what is included in the \u201cnature and quality\u201d of a particular type of criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Here, the alleged criminal conduct was murder and the majority identifies youth\u2019s understanding of what he is \u201cdoing in a physical sense\u201d to be part of the \u201cnature and quality\u201d of that conduct. Applying the test for \u201cnature and quality\u201d outlined above, we would ask, if a person killed another but did not understand what he was doing in a physical sense, would the conduct be criminal? Murder requires intent, and a person who does not know what he is doing in a physical sense lacks intent. Therefore, physicality is part of the essential character of that criminal conduct, and thus, part of its \u201cnature and quality.\u201d The same is true for the wrongfulness of the conduct \u2014 also identified by the majority \u2014 because if the conduct was not wrongful, it would not be criminal. Moreover, in person-to-person crimes, the \u201cnature and quality\u201d of the criminal conduct must also include the effect on the victim. This is so because person-to-person crimes necessarily involve victims, and if the victims were not affected, the conduct would not be criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">I agree with the majority that the meaning of \u201cappreciate\u201d \u201cencompasses both an intellectual and emotional component.\u201d <em>Dyer, </em>16 Or App at 258; 268 Or App at 520-21. Consequently, because the effect on the victim, along <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>with wrongfulness and physicality, is part of the nature and quality of the criminal conduct, in order to \u201cappreciate the nature and quality of the conduct involved,\u201d the youth must possess an emotional and intellectual understanding of the effect on the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">That reading of \u201cappreciate\u201d parallels the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201cappreciate\u201d includes an intellectual and emotional understanding of the consequences of one\u2019s actions. <em>Id. </em>However, because the majority depends so heavily on an analogy to the adult insanity defense statute, it subsequently reduces its discussion of an appreciation of the consequences of the youth\u2019s conduct \u2014 here, murder \u2014 to a mere intellectual understanding of the legal consequences of the <em>conduct </em>\u2014 i.e., an understanding that the conduct was wrong or criminal. Put differently, the majority acknowledges that a youth must have an emotional understanding of the consequences of the crime, but drops that requirement from its final analysis, and instead focuses its analysis solely on the consequences of the crime <em>for the murderer. </em>The consequences of murder are greater than the mere legal consequences for the murderer.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Furthermore, the plain meaning of \u201cappreciate\u201d relates to judgment-making. According to the dictionary, \u201cappreciate\u201d means \u201c1 a * * * (2) : to judge or evaluate the worth, merit, quality, or significance of: comprehend with knowledge, judgment, and discrimination.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>105 (unabridged ed 2002); 268 Or App at 516. Consequently, in addition to possessing an emotional and intellectual understanding of the effect on the victim and other consequences of the crime, a youth must also be able to make judgments about that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Turning to sophistication and maturity, I agree with the majority that the plain meaning of \u201csophistication\u201d and \u201cmaturity\u201d \u201cdescribe qualities that are associated with a normal well-adjusted adult.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, I believe that the majority does not sufficiently heed the significance of those terms in relation to the rest of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">\u201c\u2018Sophistication\u2019 means \u2018the quality or state of being sophisticated\u2019 and \u2018the quality or the character of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>being intellectually sophisticated (as through cultivation, experience, or disillusionment)\u2019\u201d and \u201csophisticated\u201d is defined as \u201cdeprived of native or original simplicity: as * * * b : WORLDLY-WISE, KNOWING &lt;a ~ adolescents\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 2174).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Maturity is \u201cthe quality or state of being mature : full development * * * &lt; ~ of judgment&gt; * * <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 1395. Mature is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">\u201c2 a : having attained the normal peak of natural growth and development: fully grown and developed * * * c : <em>having or expressing the mental and emotional qualities that are considered normal to an adult socially adjusted human being </em>&lt;a ~ outlook&gt; &lt;parents were willing to be ~, to take responsibility -H.S.Canby&gt;\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1394 (emphasis added). Thus, under ORS 419C.349(3), the juvenile must possess \u201csufficient\u201d intellectual sophistication derived from experience <em>and </em>be sufficiently able to express the mental and emotional qualities of a normal, fully grown and developed, socially adjusted adult. Because the court must make findings about a youth\u2019s sophistication and maturity, ORS 419C.352(2), those findings must take into account whether the youth possesses enough of the intellectual sophistication derived from experience <em>and </em>the ability to express the mental and emotional qualities of a normal, fully grown and developed, socially adjusted adult to meet the demands of a specific situation, <em>i.e., </em>to appreciate the nature and quality of the conduct involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">In placing all of the above together, I agree with the majority that, when contemplating whether a youth, because of his or her sophistication and maturity, is able to appreciate the nature and quality of his or her conduct, a court must make findings regarding (1) whether the youth understood what her or she was doing in a physical sense and (2) understood that that the conduct was wrong. However, at least in the case of person-to-person crimes, the inquiry does not end there. The court must also make findings regarding the youth\u2019s intellectual and emotional understanding of the effect on the victim and other consequences of the conduct; this inquiry must, therefore, necessarily take into account (3) the youth\u2019s empathetic capacity. Last, (4) a court must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>also make findings about the youth\u2019s judgment-making ability, considering the youth\u2019s capacity to think independently in light of outside influences. Furthermore, by the terms of the statute, these findings must be made regarding \u201c[t]he youth at the time of the alleged offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">Those elements of ORS 419C.349(3) follow from the plain meaning of the text used in the context of the statute; additionally, they also align with the science of brain development, which shows that \u2014 due to the physical structure of adolescent brains \u2014 teenagers and younger juveniles have a limited capacity to make moral judgments and experience empathy, and are particularly susceptible to peer pressure. Given that the science of brain development confirms our commonsense understanding of human development, it is not surprising that Oregon law and federal constitutional law have long been in conformity with the conclusion that researchers have, only more recently, reached through the development of brain-imaging technology.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">III. LEGISLATIVE HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Finally, recognizing that the legislative history of the waiver statute should be given little weight compared with the statute\u2019s text and context, <em>Gaines, </em>346 Or at 172-73, I nonetheless turn to the legislative history to explain the differences between my reading of that history and the majority\u2019s. I agree that the majority correctly focuses on the early history of the sophistication and maturity criteria. That history begins in 1983 with the proposed amendments to <em>former </em>ORS 419.533 that were aimed at reforming the waiver process then known as \u201cremand.\u201d As I explain in more detail below, my review of that history persuades me that the majority\u2019s reading is too reductive and fails to take into account the context of the legislative debate. Specifically, the majority\u2019s reading ignores the fact that the legislature was committed to the rehabilitative policy of the juvenile code and mindful of its distinction from the criminal code and was focused on creating a system for individualized consideration of a youth\u2019s developmental capabilities. Further, the majority\u2019s reading discounts legislators\u2019 statements that waiver is intended to apply only in exceptional cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>The legislative history of <em>former </em>ORS 419.533 confirms that the legislature was acutely aware of the distinction between the juvenile code and the criminal code. The concerns that spurred the 1983 reform efforts led by Senator Ryles grew out of the \u201cgeneral philosophy\u201d of the juvenile system to focus on rehabilitation. As expressed by Senator Ryles, \u201cjuveniles <em>may be lacking in understanding or information and therefore may not be fully responsible for the crime they have committed\u2019, </em>and that they should not be typed by past misdeeds but should have the opportunity to grow and change.\u201d Testimony, House Committee on Judiciary, Subcommittee 1, HB 2955, May 18, 1983, Ex A (statement of Sen Nancy Ryles) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">The legislature was also mindful of the need for individualized consideration of a youth\u2019s developmental capabilities. Senator Ryles discussed the criteria that would ultimately become ORS 419C.349(3) and (4), explaining that the criteria were designed to \u201cprotect [] those who truly are not maturing or are not sophisticated enough to understand the gravity of their act \u2014 regardless of their chronological age.\u201d Testimony, Senate Committee on Judiciary, SB 414, Apr 25,1985, Ex B (statement of Sen Nancy Ryles). She added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-5\">\u201cIt is not realistic to say that a 14 or 15 year-old is not sufficiently mature to understand the gravity of a violent crime, while a 16 year-old is. We cannot persist in totally defining juveniles by an arbitrary age limit, ignoring the fact that <em>maturation is a gradual process </em>and that <em>some 14 and 15 year-olds may well understand the serious nature of the violent crime they have committed, while others may not\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Perhaps most importantly, the legislative history further indicates that legislators were sensitive to the fact that waiver was intended to apply only to \u201cexceptional cases,\u201d and that the bill was the exception to the general rule that the juvenile court would retain exclusive, original jurisdiction over most juveniles. Testimony, House Committee on Judiciary, Subcommittee 1, HB 2955, May 18, 1983, Ex A (statement of Sen Nancy Ryles). Senator Ryles stated that, although \u201cwe have not yet come to terms with those exceptional cases where a younger teenager commits a violent crime,\u201d those \u201cexceptional cases\u201d \u201crepresent a very small percentage of all juvenile arrests,\u201d but they do exist. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">In sum, the legislature considered and crafted language that recognized the need to retain the distinction between the juvenile system and the adult criminal system, which involves an individualized consideration of a youth\u2019s developmental capabilities \u2014 and not just a low-threshold inquiry of the youth\u2019s intellectual ability to \u201cknow\u201d or \u201cunderstand\u201d that he or she committed a criminal act. Further, the legislative history confirms that waiver was intended to apply only to those \u201cexceptional cases\u201d in which the court had considered the youth\u2019s developmental capacity. In contrast to those legislative concerns, the low threshold developed by the majority \u2014 an intellectual understanding of the wrongfulness of the conduct and that the youth physically engaged in the conduct \u2014 will ensure that all but the most developmentally challenged youths will be capable of being waived into the adult criminal system, as long as the youth\u2019s conduct constituted one of the enumerated crimes if charged as an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b573-6\">Ortega, J., joins in the dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-9\"> The dissent rejected the conclusion that the phrase the person \u201clacks substantial capacity * * * to appreciate the criminality of the conduct\u201d was the functional equivalent of the former test. <em>Dyer, </em>16 Or App at 265-66 (Thornton, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b560-10\"> The majority also argues that the words \u201cnature and quality\u201d have been imbued with special meaning by the early history of the common-law insanity defense. 268 Or App at 518-19.

Prior to statehood, this may have been the case. <em>See Reynolds, </em>317 Or at 566 (discussing law in effect before 1859). However, the legislature abrogated those rules in the late 19th century.

The State is <em>parens patriae </em>rather than prosecuting attorney and judge.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b565-6\"> Among previous criteria used by the District of Columbia Juvenile Court cited with approval by the <em>Kent </em>court, is a criterion which instructs courts to consider a youth\u2019s \u201csophistication and maturity.\u201d 383 US at 567.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b567-8\"> Examining the plain meaning of the words \u201cnature and quality,\u201d I agree with the majority that the most applicable definition of \u201cnature\u201d is \u201cthe essential character or constitution of something.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 1507; 268 Or App at 517-18.1 also agree that \u201cquality\u201d is best defined for the purpose of this statute as a \u201cpeculiar and essential character.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 1858; 268 Or App at 517-18. However, I strongly disagree that those definitions are of limited guidance. 268 Or App at 518.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b572-7\"> The majority discounts statements such as this as an \u201cadditional example\u201d of a \u201cnonspecific statement!] that could be stretched to aid youth\u2019s argument in a general way.\u201d 268 Or App at 534-35 n 18. Unlike the majority, I do not discount that and other similar statements, because, when viewing the totality of the legislative history, in light of the particular context in which the statements were made, the statements provide a good indication of the legislature\u2019s views with regard to the discretionary criteria in general, and, more specifically, that, in enacting the bill that lowered the age of waiver, there was an intent to retain the distinction between the juvenile and adult systems, curtail abuse of the waiver option, and provide an even-handed rational basis on which judges could base waiver decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
