Defendant, the personal representative of Cloud\u2019s estate, disallowed OHA\u2019s claim as untimely. <em>See </em>ORS 115.005(2) (setting forth time limitations for presenting claims against the estate of a decedent). OHA initiated this action against defendant, arguing that its claim qualified for an exception to the time limitation under ORS 115.005(3). Defendant moved for summary judgment, arguing that OHA\u2019s claim did not satisfy one of the conditions of the exception \u2014 that the claim must be \u201cpresented by a person who did not receive a notice under ORS 115.003 [.]\u201d ORS 115.005(3)(b). The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed OHA\u2019s complaint with prejudice. We conclude that the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment in favor of defendant for the reason that OHA had failed to satisfy the condition of ORS 115.005 (3)(b). Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">For clarity, we begin with an overview of the procedures and statutes relevant to our consideration of this case. Generally, when a person dies and there is a will that has been proved, upon the filing of a petition, the probate court will appoint a personal representative to administer the decedent\u2019s estate. ORS 113.085. The personal representative\u2019s responsibilities include, among other things, sending specified information to certain persons who might have an interest in the probate proceedings and administration of the decedent\u2019s will. Two statutes that set forth those duties, ORS 113.145 and ORS 115.003, are at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">ORS 113.145 sets forth the personal representative\u2019s responsibility to, among other things, send specific information to certain persons who might have an interest in the estate. First, upon appointment, the personal representative must \u201cdeliver or mail to the devisees, heirs and the persons described in ORS 113.035(8) and (9) who were required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>be named in the petition for appointment of a personal representative,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> information that includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-4\">\u201c(a) The title of the court in which the estate proceeding is pending and the clerk\u2019s file number;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">\u201c(b) The name of the decedent and the place and date of the death of the decedent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">\u201c(c) Whether or not a will of the decedent has been admitted to probate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">\u201c(d) The name and address of the personal representative and the attorney of the personal representative;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">\u201c(e) The date of the appointment of the personal representative;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\">\u201c(f) A statement advising the devisee, heir or other interested person that the rights of the devisee, heir or other interested person may be affected by the proceeding and that additional information may be obtained from the records of the court, the personal representative or the attorney for the personal representative;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-10\">\u201c(g) If information under this section is required to be delivered or mailed to aperson described in ORS 113.035(8), a statement that the rights of the person in the estate may be barred unless the person proceeds as provided in ORS 113.075 within four months of the delivery or mailing of the information; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-11\">\u201c(h) If information under this section is required to be delivered or mailed to a person described in ORS 113.035(9), a statement that the rights of the person in the estate may be barred unless the person proceeds as provided in ORS 112.049 within four months of the delivery or mailing of the information.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>ORS 113.145(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, within 30 days after appointment, the personal representative must send that same information, along with a copy of the death record of the decedent, to the Department of Human Services and OHA. ORS 113.145(6). Third, before the final account is filed, if the personal representative has actual knowledge that the petition did not include the name and address of any person \u201cdescribed in ORS 113.035(4), (5), (7), (8) or (9),\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the personal representative must make reasonable efforts to identify and locate that person, and then send that person the same information described above. ORS 113.145(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">In addition, ORS 115.003 sets forth the personal representative\u2019s responsibility to identify and send information to any person who has or asserts a claim against the estate. During the three months following appointment (or a longer time, if allowed by the probate court), the personal representative must \u201cmake reasonably diligent efforts to investigate the financial records and affairs of the decedent and shall take such further actions as may be reasonably necessary to ascertain the identity and address of each person who has or asserts a claim against the estate.\u201d ORS 115.003(1). Then, within 30 days after that three-month period expires (including any extensions), the personal representative must \u201ccause to be delivered or mailed to each person known by the personal representative during such period to have or assert a claim against the estate a notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>containing the information required in [ORS 115.003(3)],\u201d except that it is not necessary to give notice \u201con account of a claim that has already been presented, accepted or paid in full or on account of a claim that is merely conjectural.\u201d ORS 115.003(2). Pursuant to ORS 115.003(3), the information that must be contained within that notice includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-4\">\u201c(a) The title of the court in which the estate proceeding is pending;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">\u201c(b) The name of the decedent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">\u201c(c) The name of the personal representative and the address at which claims are to be presented;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">\u201c(d) A statement that claims against the estate not presented to the personal representative within 30 days of the date of the notice may be barred; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">\u201c(e) The date of the notice, which shall be the date on which it is delivered or mailed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">ORS 115.005 sets forth the time limitations within which claims against the estate must be presented to the personal representative. ORS 115.005(2) provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-10\">\u201cExcept as provided in subsection (3) of this section, a claim is barred from payment from the estate if not presented within the statute of limitations applicable to the claim and before the later of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-11\">\u201c(a) Four months after the date of first publication of notice to interested persons; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-12\">\u201c(b) If the claim was one with respect to which the personal representative was required to deliver or mail a notice under ORS 115.003(2), 30 days after a notice meeting the requirements of ORS 115.003(3) is delivered or mailed to the last-known address of the person asserting the claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-13\">An exception to the time limitations for claims is set forth in ORS 115.005(3), which provides;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-14\">\u201cA claim against the estate presented after claims are barred under subsection (2) of this section shall be paid from the estate if the claim:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-15\">\u201c(a) Is presented before the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the claim and before the personal representative files the final account;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>\u201c(b) Is presented by a person who did not receive a notice under ORS 115.003 mailed or delivered more than 30 days prior to the date on which the claim is presented and who is not an assignee of a person who received such notice; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-3\">\u201c(c) Would be allowable but for the time at which the claim is presented.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">With that background in mind, we turn to the relevant facts of this case, which are undisputed. Cloud died in August 2011, leaving a will. At a hearing on November 1, 2012, the probate court admitted Cloud\u2019s will to probate and named defendant as personal representative. King, a professional fiduciary who had served as payee of Veterans Affairs benefits for Cloud before his death, had also petitioned for appointment as personal representative and was present at the hearing. During the hearing, King testified that Cloud\u2019s estate owed more than $666,000 to the State of Oregon for care and services that Cloud had received in the state hospital before his death. King was represented by an attorney who represented both King and the State of Oregon.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">On November 16, 2012, defendant, through her attorney, mailed a letter to OHA, which began, \u201cThe following information is given to you as required by ORS 113.145 [.]\u201d The letter included the information set forth under ORS 113.145(1), including a statement that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">\u201cany interested person may contest the probate of the will or the validity of the will or assert an interest in the will for any reason specified in ORS 113.075(1), but such an action must be commenced within four months after the date of delivery or mailing of the information described in ORS 113.145, or four months after the first publication of notice to interested persons, whichever is later. If you contemplate asserting any of the rights described in this paragraph, those rights may be barred unless you proceed as provided in ORS 113.075 within the specified time period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Defendant did not send OHA notice that \u201cclaims against the estate not presented to the personal representative within 30 days of the date of the notice may be barred.\u201d ORS 115.003(3)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>On April 25, 2013 \u2014 more than five months after defendant sent that letter \u2014 OHA submitted its claim to defendant. On or about May 15, 2013, defendant disallowed OHA\u2019s claim as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">As noted, OHA initiated this action to collect on its claim. <em>See </em>ORS 115.145(l)(b) (when a claim is disallowed, the claimant may \u201c [c] ommence a separate action against the personal representative on the claim in any court of competent jurisdiction\u201d and \u201c[t]he action shall proceed and be tried as any other action\u201d). In its complaint, OHA alleged that its claim was timely, not under ORS 113.075, which sets forth procedures for contesting a will, but under ORS 115.005, which sets forth the time limitations for the presentation of claims against an estate. According to OHA, because defendant did not send a notice to OHA with the information required by ORS 115.003, its claim qualified for an exception to the time limitations, as provided in ORS 115.005(3). <em>See </em>ORS 115.005(3) (an untimely claim shall nevertheless be paid if, among other things, it is \u201cpresented by a person who did not receive a notice under ORS 115.003 mailed or delivered more than 30 days prior to the date on which the claim is presented!.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">In response, defendant moved for summary judgment, arguing that OHA\u2019s claim did not qualify for an exception to the time limitations under ORS 115.005(3). Defendant argued that, because OHA had actual notice of the probate proceedings through its participation in the proceedings that resulted in the appointment of defendant as personal representative and through the letter of notice that defendant sent in compliance with ORS 113.145, a second notice under ORS 115.003 was not required. The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding the motion \u201cwell taken,\u201d and dismissed OHA\u2019s complaint. OHA now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. ORCP 47 C. When, as here, there are no disputed material questions of fact, the decisive issue is whether the moving party was entitled to prevail as a matter of law. <em>See Dept. of Human Services v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number><em>Broyles, </em>228 Or App 264, 267, 208 P3d 519 (2009) (applying that standard). In this case, that question is controlled by an interpretation of the relevant statutes. Specifically, we must decide whether defendant was required to send OHA a notice under ORS 115.003, given the undisputed facts that defendant sent OHA a notice under ORS 113.145 and OHA had actual knowledge of the probate proceedings. When construing a statute, our goal is to discern the legislature\u2019s intent by examining the text and context of the statute, and the legislative history, if useful. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">OHA argues that, because defendant knew that OHA had a claim against Cloud\u2019s estate, defendant was required to send a notice to OHA consistent with the requirements of ORS 115.003, including notice that \u201cclaims against the estate not presented to the personal representative within 30 days of the date of the notice may be barred.\u201d ORS 115.003(2), (3)(d). According to OHA, actual notice of the probate proceedings is not sufficient to satisfy defendant\u2019s responsibility to send notice under ORS 115.003.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Defendant responds that OHA\u2019s argument fails to take into account the entire statutory scheme of the probate code. According to defendant, ORS 113.145 requires a personal representative to send notice to all known \u201cinterested parties\u201d \u2014 including persons with claims against the estate \u2014 at the commencement of the probate proceedings, while ORS 115.003 requires the personal representative to identify and send notice to \u201clater-discovered creditors.\u201d In support of that contention, defendant asserts that the legislature added ORS 115.003 to the probate code in response to <em>Tulsa Professional Collection Services v. Pope, </em>485 US 478, 108 S Ct 1340, 99 L Ed 2d 565 (1988) <em>(Tulsa), </em>in which the United States Supreme Court determined that the Due Process clause of the United States Constitution requires that a known or \u201creasonably ascertainable\u201d creditor be given \u201c\u2018[n]otice by mail or other means as certain to ensure actual notice.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 491 (quoting <em>Mennonite Board of Missions v. Adams, </em>462 US 791, 800, 103 S Ct 2706, 77 L Ed 2d 180 (1983)) (brackets in original). Thus, according to defendant, the sending of a notice to OHA under ORS 113.145 at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>commencement of the probate proceedings \u2014 and OHA\u2019s undisputed actual notice of the probate proceedings\u2014 eliminated the need for defendant to send an additional notice to OHA under ORS 115.003.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">The text of ORS 115.003 unambiguously requires a personal representative, within three months of appointment (unless a longer time is allowed by the probate court), to take reasonable actions to identify \u201ceach person who has or asserts a claim against the estate.\u201d ORS 115.003(1); <em>see also </em>ORS 111.005(7) (as used in probate law, a \u201cclaim\u201d includes \u201cliabilities of a decedent, whether arising in contract, in tort or otherwise\u201d). Within 30 days after the expiration of that three-month period (including any extensions approved by the court), the personal representative must provide a notice \u201cto each person known by the personal representative during such period to have or assert a claim against the estate.\u201d ORS 115.003(2). That notice must contain the information set forth in ORS 115.003(3), including \u201c[a] statement that claims against the estate not presented to the personal representative within 30 days of the date of the notice may be barred[.]\u201d ORS 115.003(3)(d). Although ORS 115.003(2) provides that \u201cit shall not be necessary to give notice on account of a claim that has already been presented, accepted or paid in full or on account of a claim that is merely conjectural,\u201d the plain text of the statute does not include an exception for claims held by persons who have actual knowledge of the probate proceedings but have not yet presented their claims to the personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The context and legislative history of ORS 115.003 do not suggest a legislative intent contrary to the unambiguous meaning of the text of the statute, set forth above. First, we do not agree with defendant\u2019s contention that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>upon appointment of a personal representative, all known persons with a claim against the estate would receive a notice as an \u201cinterested party\u201d under ORS 113.145, and that a notice under ORS 115.003 is required only for \u201clater-discovered creditors.\u201d ORS 113.145 requires that a personal representative send certain information to certain persons or entities, within specified time limitations: upon appointment of a personal representative, notice must be sent to \u201cthe devisees, heirs and the persons described in ORS 113.035(8) and (9),\u201d ORS 113.145(1); before the filing of the final account, notice must be sent to \u201cany person described in ORS 113.035(4), (5), (7), (8) or (9),\u201d that was not named in the petition, ORS 113.145(5); and within 30 days after the appointment of the personal representative, notice must be sent to the Department of Human Services and OHA. ORS 113.145(6). Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertions, ORS 113.145 does not require that notice be sent to all persons with claims against the estate. <em>See also </em>Tape Recording, Senate Judiciary Committee, SB 307, Jan 25, 1989, Tape 9, Side B (statement of attorney Warren Deras) (testifying in support of the law that would later be codified as ORS 115.003; stating that, under Oregon law at that time (which included ORS 113.145 (1989)), heirs and devisees were entitled to individual, personal notice, and \u201ccreditors\u201d were not). As such, ORS 113.145 requires notice to be sent to devisees, heirs, and certain specified persons with an interest in the estate, as noted above, while ORS 115.003 separately requires notice to be sent to any person known to have or assert a claim against the estate. Those are different groups of persons, and those receiving notice under ORS 113.145 do not necessarily include those who must receive notice under ORS 115.003.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">Moreover, a notice under ORS 113.145 must contain certain information that is different than the information required under ORS 115.003. ORS 113.145 requires that the notice include, among other things, a statement that the rights of the person in the estate may be barred unless the person proceeds, as specified under the statute, within four months of the delivery or mailing of the information. ORS 113.145(l)(g) (relating to persons described in ORS 113.035(8)); ORS 113.145(l)(h) (relating to persons described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>in ORS 113.035(9)). In contrast, ORS 115.003 requires that the notice include, among other things, \u201c[a] statement that claims against the estate not presented to the personal representative within 30 days of the date of the notice may be barred\u201d and \u201c[t]he date of the notice, which shall be the date on which it is delivered or mailed.\u201d ORS 115.003(3)(d), (e). Because a notice satisfying the requirements of ORS 113.145 is qualitatively different than a notice satisfying the requirements of ORS 115.003 \u2014 most importantly, it need not state that any claim against the estate may be barred if not presented to the personal representative within 30 days of the date of the notice \u2014 such notice does not fulfill the requirements of ORS 115.003.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Second, we do not agree with defendant\u2019s broader contention that, because the purpose of ORS 115.003 is to increase the likelihood that creditors receive actual notice of probate proceedings, the notice described in ORS 115.003 is unnecessary and not required when a creditor has actual knowledge of probate proceedings by another means. As defendant asserts, the legislature added ORS 115.003 to the probate code in response to <em>Tulsa, </em>485 US 478. Tape Recording, Senate Judiciary Committee, SB 307, Jan 25, 1989, Tape 9, Side B (statement of attorney Warren Deras) (stating that the Oregon statutory structure at the time suffered from the \u201csame constitutional problem\u201d addressed in <em>Tulsa). </em>But even though the purpose of ORS 115.003 was to increase the likelihood that persons with claims against estates would receive actual notice of probate proceedings \u2014 as opposed to merely published notice \u2014 nothing in the statute itself suggests that the notice requirement of ORS 115.003 would be excused when such persons receive actual notice of the probate proceedings by some other means. <em>Cf. Lawver v. Beesley, </em>86 Or App 711, 719-20, 740 P2d 1215 (1987) (personal representatives\u2019 failure to send notice to known heirs, as required by ORS 113.145 (1987), was not satisfied by published notice, because the personal representatives \u201cwere under a statutory duty to provide notice by a certain method and failed to do so,\u201d and it was \u201cnot enough that [the heirs] may have actually received notice of the facts which they were entitled to know\u201d); <em>DCBS v. Muliro, </em>267 Or App 526, 534, 341 P3d 131 (2014) (in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation context, the employer\u2019s knowledge of the claimant\u2019s secondary employment did not satisfy the claimant\u2019s duty to provide notice to the employer\u2019s insurer under ORS 656.210(2)(b)). Instead, the statute unambiguously requires the personal representative to send specific information to each person known by the personal representative, during the three months after appointment of the personal representative (unless a longer time is allowed by the court), to have or assert a claim against the estate. ORS 115.003.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">In this case, OHA had a claim against Cloud\u2019s estate for the cost of care and services rendered by the Oregon State Hospital before Cloud\u2019s death. Because defendant knew about OHA\u2019s claim during the three months after her appointment as personal representative, she was required to send OHA notice under ORS 115.003, including information about the probate proceedings and a \u201cstatement that claims against the estate not presented to the personal representative within 30 days of the date of the notice may be barred[.]\u201d ORS 115.003(2), (3).
