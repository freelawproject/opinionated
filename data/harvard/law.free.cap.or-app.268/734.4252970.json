J.</author>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of one count of first-degree rape, ORS 163.375,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> two counts of first-degree sexual abuse, ORS 163.427,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and one count of incest, ORS 163.525. He appeals from the resulting judgment, raising three assignments of error. We reject without discussion defendant\u2019s second and third assignments of error, and write only to address his first assignment in which he asserts that the trial court erred in admitting expert testimony concerning the victim\u2019s ability to consent. As explained below, we reject defendant\u2019s contention and, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">We state the background facts necessary to provide context for the evidence at issue on appeal. The victim in this case is defendant\u2019s adult daughter who suffers from cerebral palsy and severe intellectual disabilities. The victim cannot speak, read, use sign language, walk unassisted, or use a toilet, nor can she feed, groom, dress, or bathe herself. Defendant was the victim\u2019s primary caretaker and, as part of that caretaking, bathed the victim and changed her diapers. On more than one occasion over a number of months, defendant had sexual intercourse with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">After it became apparent to him that the victim was pregnant, defendant told his wife that he had engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>in sexual contact with the victim. Defendant\u2019s wife reported the conduct to the police and, during a subsequent interview with officers, defendant admitted to having engaged in sexual conduct with the victim on more than one occasion. Defendant was charged with two counts of first-degree rape, two counts of first-degree sexual abuse, and two counts of incest. One of the rape counts was based on the allegation that the victim was incapable of consenting to sexual intercourse by reason of mental defect and the other was based on the allegation that the victim was incapable of consent because of physical helplessness. Similarly, one sexual abuse count alleged that the victim had a mental defect and the other alleged that she was physically helpless.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">At trial, it was undisputed that defendant had engaged in sexual conduct with the victim and that she had become pregnant as a result. However, based on the allegations in the indictment, the state was required to prove that the victim was incapable of consent by reason of mental defect or physical helplessness. For the purposes of first-degree rape and sexual abuse, the term [m] entally defective\u2019 means that a person suffers from a mental disease or defect that renders the person incapable of appraising the nature of the conduct of the person.\u201d ORS 163.305(3). \u201cORS 163.305(3) refers to a mental defect that prevents one from appraising the nature of one\u2019s own conduct. The \u2018appraisal\u2019 must constitute an exercise of judgment and the making of choices based on an understanding of the nature of one\u2019s own conduct.\u201d <em>State v. Reed, </em>339 Or 239, 244, 118 P3d 791 (2005). \u201c\u2018Physically helpless\u2019 means that a person is unconscious or for any other reason is physically unable to communicate unwillingness to an act.\u201d ORS 163.305(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Although she could not testify, the state presented a video of the victim. In addition, among other things, the state presented expert testimony from a clinical psychologist, Dr. Elena Balduzzi, that the victim was not competent to consent to sexual activity. After defendant objected to Balduzzi\u2019s conclusions, asserting that the testimony was \u201clacking any foundation in scientific evidence,\u201d the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>held a hearing to determine whether the evidence met the standards articulated in <em>State v. Brown, </em>297 Or 404, 687 P2d 751 (1984), and <em>State v. O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or 285, 899 P2d 663 (1995), for the admission of scientific evidence under OEC 702 and OEC 401.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the hearing, the court heard evidence \u2014 set forth in detail later in this opinion \u2014 relating to Balduzzi\u2019s assessment of the victim and, in particular, her use of the \u201cSexual Consent and Education Assessment\u201d (SCEA).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">The court concluded that the evidence was relevant under OEC 401, and helpful to the jury under OEC 702. In particular, the court evaluated the scientific validity of the evidence under the factors set forth in <em>Brown </em>and <em>O\u2019Key.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The court concluded that the evidence was relevant under OEC 401 and that it was scientifically valid and admissible. Accordingly, the court denied defendant\u2019s motion to exclude Balduzzi\u2019s testimony that, based on her assessment using the SCEA protocol, the victim was incapable of consenting to sexual conduct. The jury ultimately convicted defendant of one count of first-degree rape (based on inability to consent by reason of physical helplessness), two counts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>first-degree sexual abuse (based on inability to consent, one by reason of mental defect and the other by reason of physical helplessness), and one count of incest.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Defendant challenges the rape and sexual abuse convictions on appeal, asserting that the \u201ctrial court erred in admitting Balduzzi\u2019s opinion that [the victim] was not competent to consent to sexual activity and her related testimony sustaining that opinion.\u201d In defendant\u2019s view, Balduzzi\u2019s opinion based on the SCEA did not possess sufficient indicia of scientific reliability and, therefore, was not admissible. The state \u201cagrees with defendant that the testimony was \u2018scientific\u2019 evidence and thus had to satisfy the standards articulated in <em>State v. Brown, </em>* * * and <em>State v. O\u2019Key\u201d </em>for admitting scientific evidence under OEC 702 and OEC 401. It contends that it \u201cdemonstrated that Dr. Balduzzi\u2019s testimony about the SCEA, and about its application to the victim was \u2014 in O\u2019Key\u2019s words, and in light of its seven-factor test \u2014 \u2018based on scientifically valid principles and * * * pertinent to the issue to which it is directed.\u2019\u201d (Ellipses in original.) Thus, according to the state, \u201cthe trial court correctly deemed Dr. Balduzzi\u2019s testimony to be admissible scientific evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Because the \u201cvalidity of scientific evidence presents a legal question, we review the [trial] court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of such evidence for legal error.\u201d <em>State v. Branch, </em>243 Or App 309, 314, 259 P3d 103, <em>rev den, </em>351 Or 216 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The proponent of \u201cscientific\u201d evidence must demonstrate that \u201cthe proposed evidence is based on scientifically valid principles and is pertinent to the issue to which it is directed.\u201d <em>O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or at 303. \u201cUnder <em>Brown </em>and <em>O\u2019Key, </em>scientific evidence is admissible if it is relevant under OEC 401, helpful to the trier of fact under OEC 702, and not subject to exclusion under OEC 403.\u201d <em>State v. Perry, </em>347 Or 110, 121, 218 P3d 95 (2009) (footnotes omitted). To evaluate the relevance and helpfulness of scientific evidence, courts consider a number of factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>\u201c\u2018(1) The technique\u2019s general acceptance in the field;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-4\">\u2018\u201c(2) The expert\u2019s qualification and stature;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-5\">\u201c\u2018(3) The use which has been made of the technique;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-6\">\u2018\u201c(4) The potential rate of error;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-7\">\u201c\u2018(5) The existence of specialized literature;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-8\">\u201c\u2018(6) The novelty of the invention; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-9\">\u201c\u2018(7) The extent to which the technique relies on the subjective interpretation of the expert.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-10\"><em>State v. Sampson, </em>167 Or App 489, 500, 6 P3d 543, <em>rev den, </em>331 Or 361 (2000) (footnotes omitted) (quoting <em>O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or at 299). \u201cIn considering the question of scientific validity * * *, courts must bear in mind the foregoing factors are not exclusive and are not to be used as a mechanical checklist requiring an affirmative finding with respect to each factor.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>347 Or at 122; <em>see also Brown, </em>297 Or at 417-18 (\u201cThe existence or nonexistence of these factors may all enter into the court\u2019s final decision on admissibility of the novel scientific evidence, but need not necessarily do so.

Balduzzi has a doctorate in clinical psychology and has been licensed in Oregon since 2006. Before 2009, when she entered private practice, Balduzzi worked at the Oregon State Hospital with developmentally disabled adult males and men found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>guilty but insane. In private practice, she conducts psycho-sexual evaluations on sex offenders, does prerelease evaluations on inmates, and has a contract with the Department of Human Services (DHS) pursuant to which she conducts evaluations of competence to consent to sexual activity. As part of her education, Balduzzi took courses relating to that assessment. In addition, with relation to the specific assessment of competence to consent to sexual activity, she has conducted an extensive literature review to further educate herself in that particular area.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">To conduct an evaluation of competence to consent, Balduzzi conducts a clinical interview of the person and, in that interview, assesses the person using the SCEA \u2014 a tool \u201cdesigned to assess competence to consent to sexual activity.\u201d As part of that assessment, she also interviews collateral sources such as care providers or others who have had an opportunity to observe the person over an extended period of time and reviews records related to the person, such as police reports and documentation from care providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The SCEA is a structured questionnaire that was developed by a doctor of neuropsychology. The tool was developed with the input of more than 300 doctoral level psychology practitioners with specialties in neuropsychology, developmental disability, brain trauma, and sexuality. The contributions of those specialists were subjected to statistical analysis and from that were taken the items that the majority of specialists agreed were \u201cessential to the notion of competence to consent.\u201d That provides the basis for the SCEA protocol. The SCEA has two components that it assesses \u2014 knowledge (the K-scale) and skills relating to self-protection (the S-scale). The general technique used in the SCEA \u2014 interviewing the person evaluated, as well as interviewing collateral sources and reviewing documentation relating to the person evaluated \u2014 is generally used in psychological evaluations. However, the items assessed are specifically directed to a person\u2019s competence to consent to sexual activity. The questions in the K-scale assess whether the person being evaluated has basic and essential knowledge relating to sex: the difference between males and females in terms of their sexual organs, the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>the sexual organs, what sex is. The K-scale also includes questions that evaluate whether the person understands the potential consequences of sexual activity, such as pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">With respect to the S-scale, to be considered competent, a person must be able to communicate \u201cno,\u201d recognize dangerous situations, make choices based on preferences, plan future actions, and understand that things have logical consequences. In assessing whether an intellectually disabled person has those self-protection skills, an evaluator using the SCEA interviews individuals who observe the person on a daily basis to determine how he or she functions in those areas. The SCEA comes with a lengthy protocol and safeguards, it provides examples, sample responses, and specifies how and when an evaluator should prompt for more information to provide a person being examined ample opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge. If a person does not pass either of the areas evaluated, he or she is not considered competent to consent to sexual activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The SCEA is not commercially available, and Balduzzi obtained it directly from the tool\u2019s author. Balduzzi also discussed the tool\u2019s use with the author, who has continued to make herself available to Balduzzi for consultation. There has been literature published and peer reviewed about the SCEA. In particular, the author of the tool published extensively regarding its development. There was a peer reviewed publication relating to the SCEA in 1993. According to Balduzzi, the SCEA has \u201cbeen subjected to peer review,\u201d and has \u201cbeen field tested for the purposes of establishing its reliability and validity.\u201d In 1999, a research study assessing the tool\u2019s reliability and validity was published in a peer-reviewed journal. That study examined the SCEA\u2019s application to a number of cognitively impaired adults and, in the study, \u201cinternal consistency reliability was measured using statistical analysis, and found to be .89 for the K-scale, and .7 for the S-scale, which are both considered to be high internal consistency reliability.\u201d In addition, in the same study, interrater \u201creliability was also calculated\u201d \u2014 that is, the \u201cdegree to which separate raters agree in their scoring of the tool.\u201d Statistical analysis resulted in a \u201cfinding of .96 for the K-scale, and .92 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>for the S-scale.\u201d The article concluded that interrater \u201creliability for the overall competency determination\u201d using the SCEA \u201cwas 1.0\u201d which equals a \u201c[p]erfect score.\u201d Thus, the results indicated that the SCEA is reliable and valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">In evaluating the victim in particular, Balduzzi followed the SCEA protocol. However, the victim was unable to respond to any question and, after four questions, Balduzzi discontinued the evaluation of the K-scale, as instructed in the SCEA manual. The victim was unable to demonstrate any basic knowledge relating to sex. In addition, with respect to the victim\u2019s self-protection abilities, Balduzzi interviewed the victim\u2019s caretakers and those who saw her on a daily basis and also reviewed documentation relating to the victim. Based on the information they provided, she reached the conclusion that the victim was unable to communicate \u201cno,\u201d she lacks the ability to recognize a dangerous situation, she cannot plan for the future, and she lacks the ability to make a choice. According to Balduzzi, the victim did not pass either the knowledge or self-protection components of the assessment, and is not competent to consent to sexual activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Thus, we turn to whether the question at issue\u2014 whether the SCEA assessment used by Balduzzi is scientifically valid under the <em>Brown/O\u2019Key </em>analysis. In particular, we consider each of seven factors set forth above in determining whether the evidence meets the standard for scientific validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">1. <em>General acceptance in the field</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">The SCEA was developed by incorporating input from hundreds of doctorate level practitioners in the field of psychology. In particular, practitioners with specialties in neuropsychology, developmental disability, brain trauma, and sexuality contributed to its development and the SCEA evaluates the areas that the majority of those agreed were \u201cessential to the notion of competence to consent.\u201d Although the evaluation of individuals for competence to consent is a newer area in psychology and, according to Balduzzi, \u201cmost psychologists are unaware that there is such a tool,\u201d since its development, the SCEA has been deemed valid and reliable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>in peer reviewed literature. All-in-all, we conclude that this factor does not weigh against the admission of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">2. <em>Expert\u2019s qualifications and stature</em></p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Balduzzi has a doctorate in clinical psychology and has been practicing in Oregon since 2006. At the Oregon State Hospital, she worked with adult men with developmental disabilities and, in private practice, she has done psychological evaluations relating to sexuality. As part of her education, she took courses relating to assessment of competency. After she contracted with DHS to conduct evaluations of competence to consent to sexual activity, Balduzzi conducted an extensive literature review to further educate herself on that particular topic and \u201cread a number of articles about [the SCEA] by the authors\u201d of the tool. She began using the SCEA after she obtained the tool from the author and was instructed by the author on the tool\u2019s \u201cmanual and its administration.\u201d The author has made herself available to Balduzzi for consultation on the use of the SCEA as necessary. In our view, this factor weighs in favor of admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">3. <em>Use that has been made of technique</em></p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">As the state notes, there are two potentially pertinent considerations under this factor \u2014 \u201chow widely the protocol has been used\u201d and \u201cthe goal of the protocol.\u201d <em>Sampson, </em>167 Or App at 504 (noting the parties\u2019 disagreement about the meaning of \u201cuse\u201d and evaluating both considerations); <em>see also State v. Lyons, </em>124 Or App 598, 607-08, 863 P2d 1303 (1993), <em>aff'd, </em>324 Or 256, 924 P2d 802 (1996) (evaluating how widely test was used and its suitability for the purpose used). The evidence does not establish that the SCEA is widely used. Rather, the tool is not commercially available and Balduzzi obtained it by contacting the author directly. With respect to the goal of the SCEA, it was developed specifically to evaluate the ability of a person to consent to sexual activity and was used by Balduzzi for that purpose. Furthermore, the evidence was presented in this case, where the victim was unable to testify, and, as Balduzzi observed, the tool is \u201cwell-suited for forensic cases because it addresses the very criteria that\u201d in most places are central for defining competence. In our view, this factor does not weigh against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>the admission of the evidence. <em>See State v. Romero, </em>191 Or App 164, 173, 178, 81 P3d 714 (2003), <em>rev den, </em>337 Or 248 (2004) (concluding that the trial court would have erred if it had excluded evidence of the basis of a lack of scientific reliability where the expert testified that the frequency of the use of the test was \u201cvery narrow\u201d and that he could not \u201cquantify how often it\u2019s used * * * with this specific domain for which it was intended\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">4. <em>Operational standards controlling the technique and the potential rate of error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The SCEA is a lengthy protocol that sets forth questions, and contains safeguards such as examples, sample responses, and specifies how and when an examiner should prompt for more information. According to Balduzzi, she followed the protocol in this case and, after the victim was unable to respond to four questions, she discontinued questioning as instructed in the SCEA manual. Furthermore, the potential rate of error is addressed, to some extent, in the 1999 study assessing the SCEA\u2019s reliability and validity. Again, in that study, \u201cinternal consistency reliability was measured using statistical analysis, and found to be .89 for the K-scale and .7 for the S-scale.\u201d Those results are \u201cconsidered to be high in internal consistency reliability.\u201d The study also calculated \u201cinter-rater reliability,\u201d that is, \u201cthe degree to which separate raters agree in their scoring of a tool.\u201d Statistical analysis \u201cresulted in a finding of .96 for the K-scale, and .92 for the S-scale.\u201d Interrater reliability \u201cfor the overall competency determination was 1.0,\u201d that is, a \u201c[p]erfect score.\u201d Thus, the study concluded that the SCEA \u201cis reliable and valid.\u201d We conclude that this factor favors admissibility. <em>See Lyons, </em>324 Or at 275 (scientific tests need not be infallible to be admissible).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">5. <em>Existence of specialized literature and peer review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">Balduzzi testified that the author of the SCEA published extensively in peer-reviewed journals about its development, with the first publication in 1993. Later, in 1999, a research study assessing the reliability and validity of the SCEA was published in another peer reviewed journal. According to the results of that study, the K-scale and the S-scale were both \u201chigh in internal consistency reliability.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>Furthermore, interrater reliability for the overall competency determination was determined to be perfect. Balduzzi also noted that there were several other articles relating to the SCEA. According to Balduzzi, the SCEA has \u201cbeen field tested for the purposes of establishing its reliability and validity,\u201d it has \u201chad professional eyes laid on it,\u201d and \u201cit has been subjected to peer review.\u201d This factor weighs in favor of admissibility. <em>See Sampson, </em>167 Or App at 508 (noting the defendant\u2019s failure to \u201ccite peer reviewed articles that have effectively discredited the underlying theory\u201d of the scientific evidence in question in concluding that specialized literature existed \u201cto satisfy this <em>Brown/O\u2019Key </em>factor\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">6. <em>Novelty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Although novelty is a factor to be considered, it does not \u201cimply invalidity.\u201d <em>O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or at 302 n 21 (noting that \u201cevery scientific theory must at some point be new\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). The basic technique used in the SCEA \u2014 interview of the person evaluated and those who observe the person on a daily basis as well as a review of the documentation relating to the person \u2014 is not novel. Rather, it is routinely used in psychological evaluation. According to Balduzzi, the question of a person\u2019s competence to consent is not a psychological issue that comes up frequently, and, as noted, it is a newer area of psychology. However, the SCEA itself was published in 1993 and reviewed for reliability and validity in 1999. Thus, the protocol had existed for a number of years and has been reviewed with approval during that time. In our view, this factor does not weigh against the admission of the SCEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">7. <em>Extent to which technique relies on expert\u2019s subjective interpretation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">The SCEA requires the evaluator to ask a series of questions and to base a conclusion regarding capacity to consent on the responses received. It is undisputed that the process of administering the SCEA requires some subjective evaluation of the information and responses obtained. However, because of the nature of the examination and the fact that it is conducted following an extensive protocol, including questions of others who observe the evaluated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>person on a daily basis, the evidence is not wholly based on the expert\u2019s subjective interpretation and can, to an extent, be verified. <em>See </em>O\u2019Key, 321 Or at 318-19 (observing that the scientific test in question \u201cis based on subjective visual observation\u201d and \u201ccannot be duplicated\u201d or \u201cverified,\u201d but concluding that the test \u201cis scientifically valid\u201d). In any event, although the expert must engage in subjective interpretation of the information received in administering the SCEA, this factor does not render the evidence inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Our consideration of those factors leads us to conclude that the SCEA is scientifically valid as required under the <em>Brown!OKey </em>analysis. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in concluding that the evidence in question was admissible and we reject defendant\u2019s contention that Balduzzi\u2019s testimony should have been excluded as scientifically invalid.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-7\"> ORS 163.375(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-8\">\u201cA person who has sexual intercourse with another person commits the crime of rape in the first degree if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-9\">\u201c(a) The victim is subjected to forcible compulsion by the person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-10\">\u201c(b) The victim is under 12 years of age;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-11\">\u201c(c) The victim is under 16 years of age and is the person\u2019s sibling, of whole or half blood, the person\u2019s child or the person\u2019s spouse\u2019s child; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-12\">\u201c(d) The victim is incapable of consent by reason of mental defect, mental incapacitation or physical helplessness.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b753-13\"> Under ORS 163.427(1),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-14\">\u201c[a] person commits the crime of sexual abuse in the first degree when that person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-15\">\u201c(a) Subjects another person to sexual contact and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-16\">\u201c(A) The victim is less than 14 years of age;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-17\">\u201c(B) The victim is subjected to forcible compulsion by the actor; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-18\">\u201c(C) The victim is incapable of consent by reason of being mentally defective, mentally incapacitated or physically helpless!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b755-5\"> Under OEC 401, to be relevant, evidence must have a \u201ctendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">OEC 702 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-7\">\u201cIf scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b755-8\"> As discussed below, read together, <em>Brown </em>and <em>O\u2019Key </em>identify factors to be considered when determining the validity of scientific evidence, although the factors are \u201cnot an exclusive list of considerations to be applied mechanically.\u201d <em>State v.

Instead, before the trial court, defendant asserted only that the evidence did not have an adequate scientific foundation. In particular, he contended that (1) the SCEA was not generally accepted in the field, (2) the potential rate of error did not support admission, (3) there was insufficient specialized literature, and (4) the technique relied extensively on subjective interpretation by the expert. Defendant made no reference to the requirement of OEC 403 that the probative value of the evidence not be outweighed by its potential prejudice and, instead, relied on his contention that the evidence should not be admitted because it was scientifically invalid. <em>See State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000) (to sufficiently preserve an argument, \u201ca party must provide the trial court with an explanation of his or her objection that is specific enough to ensure that the court can identify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted\u201d). Thus, we decline to address defendant\u2019s contention, made for the first time on appeal, that, in addition to being scientifically invalid, the evidence was subject to exclusion under OEC 403 because its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.45(1) (\u201cNo matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claim of error was preserved in the lower court ***.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
