J.</author>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">In this criminal case, a jury found defendant guilty of two counts of first-degree theft for violating two separate paragraphs of the first-degree theft statute, ORS 164.055 (2010), <em>amended by </em>Oregon Laws 2013, chapter 24, section ll.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, the jury found defendant guilty of violating ORS 164.055(l)(a) for committing theft of property worth more than $1,000 and of violating ORS 164.055(l)(d) for theft of a firearm. At sentencing, defendant argued that the trial court was required to merge the two guilty verdicts into a single conviction. The trial court rejected that argument and entered a judgment convicting defendant of, among other crimes, two counts of first-degree theft.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Defendant appeals, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s refusal to merge the two first-degree theft guilty verdicts into a single conviction and to the court\u2019s imposition of restitution. We write only to address defendant\u2019s merger claim; we reject defendant\u2019s restitution claim without written discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">With respect to defendant\u2019s merger claim, the issue on appeal is whether merger of defendant\u2019s two guilty verdicts for first-degree theft is precluded by ORS 161.067(1). That provision, which is set out below, 268 Or App at 560-61, precludes merger of guilty verdicts for violations of separate statutory provisions if \u201ceach provision requires proof of an element that the other does not[.]\u201d ORS 161.067(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Reviewing for errors of law, we conclude that ORS 161.067(1) does not preclude merger of defendant\u2019s two guilty verdicts for first-degree theft. As explained below, ORS 164.055(l)(a) and (d) are not separate statutory provisions for the purposes of ORS 161.067(1). They were not enacted to create different crimes; rather, they were enacted to specify different ways of committing a particular degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>of theft, which the legislature intended to punish more seriously than lesser degrees of theft. As also explained below, the first-degree theft statute, which lists ways that the basic crime of theft can be elevated into first-degree theft, is akin to other statutes that list elevating elements in separate paragraphs or subparagraphs; specifically, the first-degree theft statute is akin to the second-degree robbery statute, ORS 164.405, which the Supreme Court considered in <em>State v. White, </em>346 Or 275, 211 P3d 248 (2009) <em>White II), </em>and to the first-degree sexual abuse statute, ORS 163.427, which the Supreme Court considered in <em>State v. Parkins, </em>346 Or 333, 211 P3d 262 (2009). In <em>White II </em>and <em>Parkins, </em>the court examined the text, context, and legislative history of those statutes and held that the elevating elements in those statutes were not separate statutory provisions for the purposes of ORS 161.067(1). Following the same analytical approach, we reach the same conclusion in this case with respect to ORS 164.055(l)(a) and (d). Accordingly, we reverse and remand for merger of defendant\u2019s two guilty verdicts for first-degree theft and resentencing, and we otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">We begin with a brief statement of the facts, which are few and undisputed. Defendant and two other men took property from a house and, after they were noticed by a person on an adjacent lot, fled the scene by car. Shortly thereafter, police officers stopped the car and arrested defendant and his companions. The officers found property taken from the house in the car and on the road. Specifically, they found a box with antiques in the car and a box with old mail and a collection of buttons on the road. Later, when the officers searched the yard of the house, they found other property that had been taken from the house, including a firearm wrapped in a blanket.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">In addition to other charges, the state charged defendant with two counts of first-degree theft in violation of ORS 164.055. One count alleged that defendant \u201cunlawfully and knowingly commit [ted] theft of stamps, postcards, antiques, and other personal property, of a total value of one thousand dollars or more[.]\u201d The other count alleged that defendant \u201cunlawfully and knowingly commit [ted] theft of a firearm [.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>ORS 164.055 defines first-degree theft. As relevant here, it provides that a person commits first-degree theft if the person commits one of six types of thefts. Specifically, it provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-4\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of theft in the first degree if, by means other than extortion, the person commits theft as defined in ORS 164.015 and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">\u201c(a) The total value of the property in a single or aggregate transaction is $1,000 or more;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">\u201c(b) The theft is committed during a riot, fire, explosion, catastrophe or other emergency in an area affected by the riot, fire, explosion, catastrophe or other emergency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-7\">\u201c(c) The theft is theft by receiving committed by buying, selling, borrowing or lending on the security of the property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\">\u201c(d) The subject of the theft is a firearm or explosive;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-9\">\u201c(e) The subject of the theft is a livestock animal, a companion animal or a wild animal removed from habitat or born of a wild animal removed from habitat, pursuant to ORS 497.308 (2)(c); or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-10\">\u201c(f) The subject of the theft is a precursor substance. \u00edfc H\u00ed \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-12\">\u201c(3) Theft in the first degree is a Class C felony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-13\">In this case, defendant was charged with violating ORS 164.055(l)(a) for theft or property worth more than $1,000 and ORS 164.055(l)(d) for theft of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-14\">A jury found defendant guilty of both counts and, at sentencing, defendant argued that the guilty verdicts should merge. The trial court rejected that argument and entered a judgment convicting defendant of, among other crimes, two counts of first-degree theft. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-15\">As mentioned, on appeal the issue is whether merger is precluded by ORS 161.067(1), which provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-16\">\u201cWhen the same conduct or criminal episode violates two or more statutory provisions and each provision requires proof of an element that the others do not, there are as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>many separately punishable offenses as there are separate statutory violations.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">By its terms, ORS 161.067(1) precludes merger of guilty verdicts based on \u201cthe same conduct or criminal episode,\u201d when the verdicts are for violations of \u201ctwo or more statutory provisions\u201d and each statutory provision \u201crequires proof of an element that the others do not[.]\u201d In this case, the parties do not dispute that defendant\u2019s two first-degree theft guilty verdicts are based on the same conduct or criminal episode; the dispute is whether they are for violations of two or more statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The parties agree that, under <em>White II, </em>when determining whether two different sections, paragraphs, or sub-paragraphs of a statute constitute separate statutory provisions for merger purposes, the \u201cfundamental inquiry\u201d is whether the text, context, and legislative history of the statute demonstrate that the legislature intended to create a single crime or two separate crimes. 346 Or at 285 (citing <em>State v. White, </em>341 Or 624, 638-40, 147 P3d 313 (2006); <em>State v. Kizer, </em>308 Or 238, 242-43, 779 P2d 604 (1989); <em>State v. Barrett, </em>331 Or 27, 35-36, 10 P3d 901 (2000)). But, they disagree about whether the text, context, and legislative history of the first-degree theft statute, ORS 164.055, demonstrate that the legislature intended to create one crime or separate crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Defendant argues that ORS 164.055(1) (a) and (d) are not separate statutory provisions for the purposes of ORS 161.067(1). He contends that \u201cthe theft statutes begin with a basic concept of theft, which is then elevated to first-degree if any of the additional elements in ORS 164.055 are present\u201d and that the additional elements are not separate statutory provisions for the purposes of ORS 161.067(1), rather they are \u201cmerely different theories of proving [first-degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>theft].\u201d In support of his argument, defendant points out that, in <em>White II </em>and <em>Parkins, </em>the Supreme Court \u201cconstrued similar statutes to constitute a single \u2018statutory provision\u2019 even when conduct violates multiple subsections of the statute defining the higher degree of offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">In response, the state argues that ORS 164.055(l)(a) and (d) are separate statutory provisions. In support of its argument, the state also relies on <em>White II </em>and <em>Parkins, </em>and contends that ORS 164.055(l)(a) and (d) are separate statutory provisions because they \u201caddress different legislative concerns and do not fall under a \u2018general,\u2019 \u2018unified legislative\u2019\u201d objective. (Quoting <em>White II, </em>346 Or at 284.)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Because both parties rely on <em>White II </em>and <em>Parkins, </em>we turn to those cases and review them in some detail. The issue in <em>White II </em>was whether two separate paragraphs of the second-degree robbery statute, ORS 164.405, were separate statutory provisions for the purposes of ORS 161.067(1). In other words, the issue was whether, when the legislature enacted the separate paragraphs, it intended to create separate crimes. ORS 164.405 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of robbery in the second degree if the person violates ORS 164.395 [which defines the lesser crime of third-degree robbery] and the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">\u201c(a) Represents by word or conduct that the person is armed with what purports to be a dangerous or deadly weapon; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-8\">\u201c(b) Is aided by another person actually present.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">The defendant in <em>White II </em>was charged with two counts of second-degree robbery. One of the counts alleged that the defendant violated paragraph (l)(a) \u2014 by committing third-degree robbery and representing that he was armed with a dangerous weapon \u2014 and the other alleged that he violated paragraph (l)(b) \u2014 by committing third-degree robbery and being aided by another person actually present. A jury found the defendant guilty of both counts, and, at sentencing, the defendant argued that the guilty verdicts should merge. The trial court rejected that argument and entered convictions on both counts. The defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>On appeal, we affirmed. <em>State v. White, </em>217 Or App 214, 175 P3d 504 (2007) <em>(White I), affd in part, rev\u2019d in part, </em>346 Or 275, 211 P3d 248 (2009). We examined the text, context, and legislative history of the second-degree robbery statute and concluded that ORS 164.405(l)(a) and (b) addressed different legislative concerns. <em>Id. </em>at 223-25. Regarding the legislative history of-the statute, which was enacted as part of the 1971 Criminal Code, we stated that the Commentary to the Proposed Criminal Code</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-4\">\u201cclearly demonstrates that ORS 164.405(l)(a) and (b) were enacted to address separate and distinct legislative concerns. The commentary confirms that paragraph (l)(a) was enacted to address only the risk of psychological harm to victims who have the subjective belief that they are confronted with an armed robber. By comparison, paragraph (l)(b) was enacted to address concerns about the physical safety of a victim when more than one robber is present.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-5\"><em>White I, </em>217 Or App at 224-25 (citing Commentary to Criminal Law Revision Commission Proposed Oregon Criminal Code, Final Draft and Report \u00a7 149, 155 (July 1970) (hereinafter Commentary)). Based on our conclusion that the paragraphs addressed different legislative concerns, we further concluded that, when it enacted the paragraphs, the legislature intended to create separate crimes, and, therefore, the paragraphs were separate statutory provisions for merger purposes. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">On review, the Supreme Court reversed and, in doing so, criticized our reasoning. <em>White II, </em>346 Or at 289-91. The court explained that, when determining whether two paragraphs of a statute are separate statutory provisions for merger purposes, the fundamental question is not why the legislature enacted the paragraphs, but rather, whether, when it enacted the paragraphs, it intended to create one or two crimes. <em>Id. </em>at 280. Thus, whether the paragraphs address different legislative concerns is not dispositive; any time the legislature enacts a statute that defines a crime and contains paragraphs that describe different conduct that constitutes the crime, each paragraph can be said to address a different legislative concern, but that does not mean that the legislature intended to create multiple crimes. <em>Id. </em>at 283-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>In support of that point, the Supreme Court cited its decision in <em>Barrett, </em>331 Or 27. <em>White II, </em>346 Or at 283-84. In <em>Barrett, </em>the defendant had been found guilty of three counts of aggravated murder, each based on a different paragraph of the aggravated murder statute, ORS 163.095 (2000), <em>amended by </em>Oregon Laws 2005, chapter 264, section 17, and Oregon Laws 2012, chapter 54, section 26, and the issue was whether the guilty verdicts merged.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ORS 163.095 provides that aggravated murder is \u201cmurder as defined in ORS 163.115 which is committed under, or accompanied by, any of\u2019 19 different aggravating circumstances set out in separate sections, paragraphs, and subparagraphs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>the time <em>Barrett </em>was decided, ORS 163.095 listed 18 aggravating circumstances.) The aggravating circumstances are varied; they relate to the method of the murder, ORS 163.095(l)(a) - (b), (e), (2)(c) - (e); the defendant\u2019s criminal history and custody status, ORS 163.095(l)(c), (2)(b), (f); the number of victims, ORS 163.095(l)(d); and the type of victim, ORS 163.095(l)(f), (2)(a). Although the aggravating circumstances address different legislative concerns, the <em>Barrett </em>court concluded that the legislature had not intended to create 18 different crimes; rather, it had intended to create a single crime \u201cto punish more severely certain murders that [it] deem[ed] to be particularly heinous.\u201d 331 Or at 35-36. Thus, the paragraphs did not create different crimes and, therefore, were not separate statutory provisions for the purposes of ORS 161.067(1). Accordingly, the <em>Barrett </em>court held, the defendant\u2019s three guilty verdicts merged into a single conviction for aggravated murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">Relying on <em>Barrett, </em>the <em>White II </em>court expressly rejected the view that whenever a statute addresses two distinct legislative concerns, the legislature has created two different crimes and, therefore, has created two statutory provisions for merger purposes. The court explained that that view \u201cis incorrect for two reasons\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\">\u201cFirst, * * * the appropriate inquiry is whether the legislature intended to create a single crime or two crimes; the fact that a statute addresses two legislative concerns may be a useful guide when analyzing the legislature\u2019s intent, but it is not dispositive. Second, every statutory section that \u2018requires proof of an element that the others do not,\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>ORS 161.067(1), necessarily involves a distinct legislative concern \u2014 otherwise there would be no need for the additional element. And, we know from <em>[State v. Crotsley, </em>308 Or 272, 278, 779 P2d 600 (1989)] and <em>Barrett, </em>331 Or at 32, that whether an additional element must be proved and whether there are \u2018two or more statutory provisions\u2019 are separate inquiries under ORS 161.067(1). <em>As a result, we cannot focus solely on the fact that the legislature may have had separate reasons for enacting each section of a statute. Instead, we view the statute as a whole, looking to the text, context, and, when appropriate, legislative history of the statute. That analysis includes consideration of whether the sections, although addressing different concerns, also may address, on a more general level, one unified legislative </em>objective.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><em>White II, </em>346 Or at 283-84 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Given the requirement to \u201cview the statute as a whole, looking to the text, context, and when appropriate, legislative history of the statute,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 283, the <em>White II </em>court criticized our decision in <em>White I, </em>stating that our analysis</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">\u201cfocused too narrowly on the Commentary\u2019s distinctions between the two ways in which a third-degree robbery could be elevated to second-degree robbery. The Commentary, of course, was intended to explain the origins of the various provisions of the revised criminal code, the elements of each crime, and the distinctions between different crimes. In this case, the Commentary usefully describes the legislative intent behind the two different \u2018aggravating factors\u2019 in ORS 164.405(1). <em>However, the Commentary sheds no particular light on whether the legislature intended that statute \u2018to define a single crime or two separate crimes.\u2019\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 289 (quoting <em>White, </em>341 Or at 638-39) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">According to the <em>White II </em>court, as a result of our narrow focus, we \u201cmiss[ed] the more general thrust of the [robbery] statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the court\u2019s view, the general thrust of the scheme was that the legislature had \u201cdistinguish [ed] between the different degrees of robbery, creating an ascending scale of <em>different </em>degrees of one crime, each of which it classified as a different level of felony and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>enacted as a different statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 289 n 13 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">Having identified the appropriate analysis, the <em>White II </em>court applied that analysis to the second-degree robbery statute before it. The court looked first to the text and context of the statute, noting that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-5\">\u201cORS 164.405 is one of three statutes that, together, make up the statutory scheme respecting robbery. <em>In those statutes, the legislature has provided an incrementally graded set of standards for determining the seriousness of different forms of robbery and has divided those standards into three groups </em>\u2014 third-degree <em>robbery, second-degree robbery, and first-degree robbery. </em>Third-degree robbery is the least serious and describes the basic crime of robbery: taking or attempting to take property from another, while preventing or overcoming the victim\u2019s resistance to giving up the property by using or threatening to use physical force. ORS 164.395. <em>The crimes of second- and first-degree robbery then use third-degree robbery as a foundation and build on its elements by identifying additional elements that, if present, make the crime a more serious one.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 285-86 (footnote omitted; emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The court then turned to the legislative history of the robbery statutes. In doing so, the court looked to the Commentary and found it helpful that the paragraphs were described as \u201c\u2018aggravating factors.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 289 (quoting Commentary \u00a7 150 at 154).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">The robbery statutory scheme and legislative history suggested to the court that the different degrees of robbery reflect the legislature\u2019s assessment of the seriousness of different types of robberies; that is, they \u201creflect the legislature\u2019s judgment regarding the aggravating elements that elevate third-degree robbery to second- or first-degree robbery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 290. The court concluded that \u201cthe legislature created a single crime of second-degree robbery\u201d and that \u201c[t]he fact that the alternative circumstances that elevate third-degree robbery * * * appear in two different paragraphs in ORS 164.405(1) does not make them (or the crime of second-degree robbery) \u2018two * * * statutory provisions\u2019\u201d for the purposes of ORS 161.067(1). <em>Id. </em>at 291. Therefore, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>court held, ORS 161.067(1) did not preclude merger of the defendant\u2019s two guilty verdicts for second-degree robbery, even though the verdicts were for conduct that violated two different paragraphs of the second-degree robbery statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Following <em>White II, </em>in <em>Parkins, </em>the court applied a similar analysis to two subparagraphs of the sexual abuse in the first degree statute, ORS 163.427(l)(a)(A) and (B), to determine whether the subparagraphs were separate statutory provisions for the purposes of ORS 161.067(1). 346 Or at 350-55. ORS 163.427 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of sexual abuse in the first degree when that person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">\u201c(a) Subjects another person to sexual contact and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">\u201c(A) The victim is less than 14 years of age;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-8\">\u201c(B) The victim is subjected to forcible compulsion by the actor; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-9\">\u201c(C) The victim is incapable of consent by reason of being mentally defective, mentally incapacitated or physically helpless.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">The defendant argued that the subparagraphs were not separate statutory provisions, but rather identified different legal theories for proving the single crime of first-degree sexual abuse. <em>Parkins, </em>346 Or at 335. As in <em>White II, </em>the court looked at the text, context, and legislative history of the statute. After reviewing the legislative history, the court concluded that the legislature \u201cintended to create a basic offense \u2014 second-degree sexual abuse \u2014 and that the basic offense could be raised to first-degree\u201d if the circumstances described in the subparagraphs were present. <em>Id. </em>at 352 (citing Commentary \u00a7 116 at 122-23). The court also compared the first-degree sexual abuse statute to ORS 163.095, the aggravated murder statute at issue in <em>Barrett, </em>and concluded that, like the paragraphs in the aggravated murder statute, the subparagraphs of the first-degree sexual abuse statute \u201cconstitute no more than different theories under which the \u2018basic offense\u2019 *** becomes the more serious offense ***.\u201d <em>Parkins, </em>346 Or at 353. Given the text, context, and legislative history of the first-degree sexual abuse statute, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>court held that the subparagraphs are not separate provisions for the purposes of ORS 161.067(1). <em>Id. </em>at 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">In sum, in <em>White II, </em>the Supreme Court relied upon the text, context, and legislative history of the robbery statutes to conclude that the \u201caggravating elements\u201d listed in different paragraphs in the second-degree robbery statute were not separate statutory provisions for the purposes of ORS 161.067(1). 346 Or at 290-91. Likewise, in <em>Parkins, </em>the court applied the same analysis and concluded that the \u201celevating elements\u201d were not separate statutory provisions. 346 Or at 355. Accordingly, in this case, we must examine the text, context, and legislative history of the theft statutes to determine if ORS 164.055(l)(a) and (d) are separate statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">We first look to the text and context of the first-degree theft statute. As set out above, ORS 164.055 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of theft in the first degree if, by means other than extortion, the person commits theft as defined in ORS 164.015 and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">\u201c(a) The total value of the property in a single or aggregate transaction is $1,000 or more;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-8\">\u201c(b) The theft is committed during a riot, fire, explosion, catastrophe or other emergency in an area affected by the riot, fire, explosion, catastrophe or other emergency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-9\">\u201c(c) The theft is theft by receiving committed by buying, selling, borrowing or lending on the security of the property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-10\">\u201c(d) The subject of the theft is a firearm or explosive;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-11\">\u201c(e) The subject of the theft is a livestock animal, a companion animal or a wild animal removed from habitat or born of a wild animal removed from habitat, pursuant to ORS 497.308(2)(c); or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-12\">\u201c(f) The subject of the theft is a precursor substance. \u2021 \u2021 <em>%</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-14\">\u201c(3) Theft in the first degree is a Class C felony:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>As is apparent from its text, ORS 164.055 defines a single crime: first-degree theft. Subsection (1) of ORS 164.055 lists six ways in which a person may commit the crime. That subsection requires that, at a minimum, a person must commit theft as defined in ORS 164.015, and then lists the six alternative ways that the theft can be elevated to first-degree theft in six separate paragraphs. As for its context, ORS 164.055 is part of an incrementally graded scheme of related theft statutes. <em>See </em>ORS 164.043 (theft in the third degree); ORS 164.045 (theft in the second degree).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Thus, as is apparent from the text and statutory context of ORS 164.055, the paragraphs at issue here \u2014 ORS 164.055(l)(a) and (d) \u2014 are parts of a single statute, that defines one degree of theft, which is punishable as a particular class of felony. <em>Cf. Crotsley, </em>308 Or at 279-80 (concluding that the court did not err in refusing to merge convictions for third-degree rape and first-degree rape or convictions for third-degree sodomy and first-degree sodomy). The text and context of ORS 164.055 suggest that, like the statutes at issue in <em>Barrett, White II, </em>and <em>Parkins, </em>ORS 164.055(l)(a) and (d) \u201cconstitute no more than different theories under which the \u2018basic offense\u2019 * * * becomes the more serious offense * * * \u201d <em>Parkins, </em>346 Or at 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The legislative history of the theft statutes supports that conclusion. Like the second-degree robbery statute in <em>White II </em>and the first-degree sexual abuse statute in <em>Parkins, </em>the first-degree theft statute at issue here was enacted as part of the 1971 Oregon Criminal Code. Prior to the enactment of the code, there had been several independent theft statutes. To simplify matters, the Criminal Law Revision Commission (Commission) drafted a broad definition of theft, found in Article 14, section 123, and codified at ORS 164.015. <em>See </em>Tape Recording, Senate Committee on Criminal Law and Procedure, SB 40, Mar 2, 1971, Tape 4, Side 1 (statement of Donald Paillette). The Commission\u2019s goal was to define a single crime that could be committed in a variety of ways. The new definition of theft incorporated not only theft by taking, but also theft of lost or mislaid property, theft by extortion, theft by deception, and theft by receiving. <em>Id.', see also </em>Commentary \u00a7 123 at 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>After the Commission incorporated the different types of theft into a single definition, the Commission\u2019s Subcommittee on Grading and Sentencing (Subcommittee) was tasked with determining a scheme of punishment \u201cwith the intention that the penalty section would become a part of the basic section on theft and there would not be a different [penalty] section on theft by deception, theft by extortion, or theft by receiving so far as the dollar amount was concerned * * * \u201d Minutes, Criminal Law Revision Commission, Subcommittee on Grading and Sentencing, Apr 5, 1970, 46. The Subcommittee settled upon a grading of the offense of theft into the classifications of a Class C felony for property stolen with a value of $250 or more and a Class A misdemeanor for property stolen with a value of less than $250. <em>Id. </em>at 48. The only other distinction drawn by the Subcommittee was for theft by extortion, which was classified as a Class B felony. <em>Id. </em>Eventually, instead of including the penalty provisions in the basic definition of theft, found in section 123, the Commission set out the penalty provisions in separate statutory sections labeled \u201cTheft in the first degree\u201d and \u201cTheft in the second degree.\u201d <em>See </em>Commentary \u00a7\u00a7 124-25 at 132-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">The Commentary reiterated that the purpose of the element regarding the value of the property stolen in the Commission\u2019s proposed second-degree and first-degree theft statutes was to establish a \u201ccriterion for determining the penalty for the crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 124-25, 133. The paragraph relating to the value of the property stolen listed under each degree of theft in the statutes served \u201cas the basis for distinguishing between a misdemeanor and a felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the Commentary suggests that the Commission intended to set out the basic elements of theft in section 123, and that, once those basic elements had been proved, the offense could be categorized for punishment purposes depending on proof of an additional element relating to the value of the stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The Commission\u2019s proposed first-degree theft statute was amended by the Senate Criminal Law and Procedure Committee (Senate committee) to expand the conduct that would be punishable by a felony. Among other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>things, the Senate committee reduced the threshold amount for a felony and added language so that a theft would be a first-degree theft if the total value of property taken in an aggregate transaction was more than the threshold amount. Minutes, Senate Criminal Law and Procedure Committee, Mar 5,1971, 9-12. It also added paragraphs relating to theft during a riot and theft by receiving.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">The aggregation concept addressed a legislative concern for items stolen as part of a common scheme over a longer period of time. Aggregation made it more likely that professional thieves, serial shoplifters, and retail employees who stole small amounts of property over time would be subject to elevated punishment as felons. <em>See </em>Tape Recording, Senate Criminal Law and Procedure Committee, SB 40, Mar 2, 1971, Tape 4, Side 1 (statement of John Christman). The paragraph relating to thefts that occur during a riot sought to address the problem of looting during instances of mass disturbance and major catastrophe. <em>Id. </em>(statement of Richard Barton). In response to looting that apparently followed an earthquake in Los Angeles and other public unrest in Portland during the summer of 1970, the legislature deemed it appropriate to subject looters to elevated punishment as felons. <em>Id. </em>Finally, the paragraph relating to theft by receiving sought to ensure that no value requirement attached to the kinds of theft by receiving commonly practiced by \u201cprofessional fences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The goal was to make \u201cprofessional fences\u201d also more easily subject to punishment as felons. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">In the House Judiciary Committee, a number of additional amendments were proposed and considered, including an amendment that added theft of a firearm to the first-degree theft provision, which was approved. <em>See </em>Tape Recording, House Judiciary Committee, SB 40, May 17, 1971, Tape 32, Side 2 (discussion of amendments submitted by Richard Goffena).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Thus, the legislative history of the theft statutes establishes that the legislature intended to create a single crime of theft, which it later divided into different degrees for the purposes of classification and punishment. The legislature sought to classify certain thefts as felonies because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>regarded them as more serious than other thefts. Because, as the legislative history shows, the elements that transform the basic crime of theft into first-degree theft are \u201ccriteria] for determining the penalty for the crime [,]\u201d they are akin to the elements at issue in <em>Barrett, White II, </em>and <em>Parkins. </em>They merely set out particular circumstances surrounding theft that warrant elevated punishment; they do not to create separate crimes and, therefore, do not constitute separate statutory provisions for the purposes of ORS 161.067(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">The state argues that, because ORS 164.055(l)(a) and (d) address different legislative concerns, they constitute separate statutory provisions. In doing so, the state makes the same analytical error we made in <em>White I, </em>which the Supreme Court criticized in <em>White II. See </em>268 Or App at 566-67. Specifically, the state focuses too narrowly on the fact that the paragraphs describe different types of thefts and, therefore, can be said \u2014 at some level \u2014 to address different legislative concerns. But, as the Supreme Court said in <em>White II, </em>the view that whenever a statute\u2019s sections, paragraphs, or subparagraphs address different legislative concerns they constitute separate statutory provisions \u201cis incorrect[.]\u201d 346 Or at 283. As we erroneously did in <em>White I, </em>the state\u2019s argument in this case \u201cgives insufficient weight to the fact that the legislature did, in fact, distinguish between the different degrees\u201d of theft, \u201ccreating an ascending scale of <em>different </em>degrees of one crime, each of which it classified as a different level\u201d and \u201cenacted as a different statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 289 n 13 (emphasis in original). Although ORS 164.055(l)(a) and (d) address different legislative concerns at one level, they share a common purpose: to elevate a basic crime to a higher level crime for punishment purposes. Thus, contrary to the state\u2019s argument, the paragraphs have a general, unifying theme.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The result that would follow from the state\u2019s argument is that, if a defendant commits theft of a firearm worth more than $1,000, the defendant can be found guilty of two counts of first-degree theft and the verdicts will not merge; in other words, for that one act, the defendant can receive two convictions. Or, if a defendant commits theft by receiving of a firearm worth more than $1,000 during a riot, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>the defendant can receive four convictions for that one act (because his conduct would violate ORS 164.055(l)(a), (b), (c) and (d)). The text, context, and legislative history, considered together, do not support such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">As a final matter, we note that our conclusion is consistent with Justice Kistler\u2019s concurrence in <em>White II. </em>After examining the legislative intent of the term \u201cstatutory provision\u201d in ORS 161.067, the concurrence concluded that, under the anti-merger statute, \u201ceach crime identified as such in the criminal code constitutes a separate statutory provision and the fact that there are alternative means of committing those crimes does not make each alternative means a separate provision within the meaning of ORS 161.067(1).\u201d <em>White II, </em>346 Or at 292-93 (Kistler, J., concurring). In support of its interpretation of \u201cstatutory provision,\u201d the concurrence relied on the text and context of ORS 161.067, as well as its legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">In its analysis of the statute\u2019s text, the concurrence relied, in part, upon an exception in ORS 161.067(3) to reach its conclusion regarding the meaning of \u201cstatutory provision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 293-94. ORS 161.067(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">\u201cWhen the same conduct or criminal episode violates only one statutory provision and involves only one victim, but nevertheless involves repeated violations of the same statutory provision against the same victim, there are as many separately punishable offenses as there are violations, except that each violation, to be separately punishable under this subsection, must be separated from other such violations by a sufficient pause in the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct to afford the defendant an opportunity to renounce the criminal intent. Each method of engaging in deviate sexual intercourse as defined in ORS 163.305, and each method of engaging in unlawful sexual penetration as defined in ORS 163.408 and 163.411 shall constitute separate violations of their respective statutory provisions for purposes of determining the number of statutory violations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">As the <em>White II </em>concurrence explained, the exception suggests that ORS 163.408 (second-degree unlawful sexual penetration) and ORS 163.411 (first-degree unlawful sexual penetration) are each statutory provisions and that a general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>rule exists that when there are alternative methods of committing each of those crimes, the methods are not separate statutory provisions. <em>White II, </em>346 Or at 294 (Kistler, J., concurring). \u201cWere the general rule otherwise, there would have been no need to add a caveat to ORS 161.067(3) and state that each method of committing unlawful sexual penetration \u2018shall constitute separate violations of their respective statutory provisions for purposes of determining the number of statutory violations.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>Expanding upon that general rule, the concurrence in <em>White II </em>also concluded that \u201cwhen the legislature creates two crimes with different degrees of seriousness * * *, each statutorily designated degree of a crime is a separate statutory provision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-3\">The concurrence also relied upon two cases which preceded the first enactment of ORS 161.067 in 1985, <em>State v. Woolard, </em>259 Or 232, 484 P2d 314, <em>on reh\u2019g, </em>485 P2d 1194 (1971), and <em>State v. Cloutier, </em>286 Or 579, 596 P2d 1278 (1979), to provide additional context regarding the meaning of \u201cstatutory provision.\u201d <em>White II, </em>346 Or at 296 (Kistler, J., concurring). In those cases the court held that \u201ca defendant who committed burglary and theft (when theft was the intended crime on entry into the house) could be punished for only one offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The holding in those cases appeared contrary to the rule, set forth in ORS 161.067, that when the same conduct or criminal episode violated two or more statutory provisions, there were as many separately punishable offenses as there were statutory violations, but, as the concurrence in <em>White II </em>explained, the 1985 statute preserved those holdings with the following exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-4\">\u201cHowever, when one of the statutory provisions violated is burglary in any degree, and the other statutory provision violated is theft or criminal mischief in any degree, and the theft or criminal mischief was pleaded as the intended crime of the burglary, the burglary and the theft or criminal mischief shall constitute only one punishable offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 297 (internal citation omitted; emphases added). While a ballot initiative that reenacted ORS 167.067 in 1986 did not include the exception, \u201cthe exception makes clear that the 1985 legislature understood that each degree of burglary, theft, and criminal mischief constituted a separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>statutory provision, in much the same way that the exception to ORS 161.067(3) makes that same understanding clear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, when the 1985 legislature drafted ORS 167.067, it specifically understood ORS 164.055 to constitute a single statutory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Lastly, the concurrence in <em>White II </em>identified <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 US 299, 52 S Ct 180, 76 L Ed 306 (1932), as the apparent source of what is now ORS 161.067(1) based upon the testimony from a spokesperson for the Oregon District Attorney\u2019s Association to the 1985 legislature. <em>White II, </em>346 Or at 298 (Kistler, J., concurring). As the United States Supreme Court used the phrase \u201cstatutory provision\u201d in <em>Blockburger, </em>\u201cthat phrase means nothing more or less than what the legislature has defined as a crime.\u201d <em>White II, </em>346 Or at 298 (Kistler, J., concurring) <em>{citing Blockburger, </em>284 US at 304). The meaning of \u201cstatutory provision\u201d is simply that, \u201c[w]hen the legislature makes it a crime to commit certain acts, each statutorily defined crime is a separate statutory provision, and each degree of that crime is a statutory provision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 299. Applying that meaning to the present case, it is clear that first-degree theft would be considered a single statutory provision, and that the alternative ways to commit the crime set out in ORS 164.055(l)(a) and (d) do not constitute separate statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">In sum, we conclude that under <em>Barrett, White II, </em>and <em>Parkins, </em>as well as under the alternative analysis posited by the concurrence in <em>White II, </em>ORS 164.055(l)(a) and (d) are not separate statutory provisions for merger purposes. Accordingly, the trial court erred in failing to merge the two guilty verdicts on the first-degree theft counts into a single conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Reversed and remanded with instructions to merge defendant\u2019s convictions for first-degree theft and for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-8\"> All statutory citations to ORS 164.055 that follow are to the current version.
