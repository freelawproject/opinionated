The Court of Appeals affirmed, but for a different reason. It held that the operation of a \u201cfamily day care home\u201d is not precluded by such covenants. It concluded that, because the operation of a \u201cfamily day care home\u201d is a residential use, it could not also be a commercial or business use because the two uses are mutually exclusive. 238 Mich App 412; 605 NW2d 681 (1999). We respectfully disagree with both lower courts. A covenant barring any commercial or business enterprises is broader in scope than a covenant permitting only residential uses. Furthermore, covenants such as these do not violate Michigan public policy and are enforceable. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the circuit court for entry of an order granting summary disposition in favor of plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">All parties in this case Own homes within the Spring Valley Estates subdivision in Fruitland Township.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendants each operate licensed \u201cfamily day care homes\u201d pursuant to MCL 722.111 <em>et seq. </em>in their homes within the subdivision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The subdivision is subject to the following covenants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-7\">1. No part of any of the premises above described may or shall be used for other than private residential purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-5\">3. No lot shall be used except for residential purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-6\">:]-. * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-7\">14. No part or parcel of the above-described premises shall be used for any commercial, industrial, or business enterprises nor the storing of any equipment used in any commercial or industrial enterprise.<footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">Plaintiffs sought an injunction prohibiting the continued operation of defendants\u2019 \u201cfamily day care homes.\u201d The parties agreed to file cross-motions for summary disposition before engaging in discovery. Plaintiffs moved for partial summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(9), and defendants moved for summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(8) and (10). The circuit court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion and granted defendants\u2019 motion, finding that a \u201ccovenant precluding the operation of a family day care home in a residential setting is contrary to the public policy of the State of Michigan.\u201d The Court of Appeals affirmed this decision. However, instead of invalidating the covenants as being against public policy, the Court concluded that defendants\u2019 operation of \u201cfamily day care homes\u201d did not violate the covenants. This Court granted plaintiffs\u2019 application for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">Because the parties have stipulated the essential facts, our concern here is only with the law: specifically, whether covenants permitting only residential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>uses, and expressly prohibiting commercial, industrial, or business uses, preclude the operation of a \u201cfamily day care home,\u201d and, if so, whether such a restriction is unenforceable as against \u201cpublic policy.\u201d These are questions of law that are reviewed de novo, <em>Kelly v Builders Square, Inc, </em>465 Mich 29, 34; 632 NW2d 912 (2001), which standard is identical to the standard of review for grants or denials of summary disposition. <em>MacDonald v PKT, Inc, </em>464 Mich 322, 332; 628 NW2d 33 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">m. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"A8\">A. COVENANTS</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">We granted leave in this case to consider whether the operation of a \u201cfamily day care home\u201d violates covenants permitting only residential uses and prohibiting commercial, industrial, or business uses. Further, assuming arguendo that such activities do violate the covenant, the question becomes whether the covenant is unenforceable because it violates some \u201cpublic policy\u201d in favor of day care facilities. In <em>Beverly Island Ass\u2019n v Zinger, </em>113 Mich App 322; 317 NW2d 611 (1982), the Court of Appeals addressed a somewhat similar issue. There, the Court, faced with a narrower covenant that permitted only residential uses, concluded that the operation of a \u201cfamily day care home\u201d did not violate that covenant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Stressing the relatively small scale of the particular day care operation and that \u201c[t]he only observable factor which would indicate to an observer that defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>do not simply have a large family is the vehicular traffic in the morning and afternoon when the children arrive and depart,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 328, the Court found this sort of day care use to be residential in nature, and thus not a use in violation of the covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\"><em>Beverly Island </em>was relied upon by the Court of Appeals in the instant matter to conclude that the day care use here was not violative of the covenants at issue. However, such reliance was misplaced, in our judgment, because, the covenant at issue in <em>Beverly Island </em>merely prohibited nonresidential uses, whereas the covenants at issue here prohibit not only nonresidential uses, but also any commercial, industrial, or business uses as well. There is a significant distinction between such restrictions, as more is prohibited in our case then was prohibited in <em>Beverly Island. </em>Not only did defendants in this case covenant not to use their property for nonresidential uses, but they also covenanted not to use their property for commercial, industrial, or business uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Interestingly, the <em>Beverly Island </em>Court itself recognized the distinction between a covenant permitting only residential uses and one that also expressly prohibits commercial, industrial, or business uses. Before it even began its analysis, the <em>Beverly Island </em>Court noted that the covenant at issue \u201cpermits residential uses rather than prohibiting business or commercial uses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 326. It further recognized that a \u201crestriction allowing residential uses permits a wider variety of uses than a restriction prohibiting commercial or business uses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While the former proscribes activities that are nonresidential in nature, the latter proscribes activities that, although perhaps residential in nature, are also commercial, industrial, or business in nature as well. The distinction between the covenants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>at issue here and the one at issue in <em>Beverly Island </em>was not viewed as persuasive by the Court of Appeals in this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The Court of Appeals in this case reasoned that, because the operation of a \u201cfamily day care home\u201d does not violate a covenant permitting only residential uses,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the operation of a \u201cfamily day care home\u201d also does not violate a covenant prohibiting commercial, industrial, or business uses. We disagree with such reasoning. Because these are separate and distinct covenants, that an activity complies with one does not necessarily mean that the same activity complies with the other. In other words, an activity may be both residential in nature and commercial, industrial, or business in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Therefore, <em>Beverly Island </em>simply does not answer the question raised here. We must determine whether the operation of a \u201cfamily day care home\u201d violates covenants prohibiting both nonresidentia! uses and commercial, industrial, or business uses. We find that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">The operation of a \u201cfamily day care home\u201d for profit is a commercial or business use of one\u2019s property. We find this to be in accord with both the common and the legal meanings of the terms \u201ccommercial\u201d and \u201cbusiness.\u201d \u201cCommercial\u201d is commonly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>defined as \u201cable or likely to yield a profit.\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1991). \u201cCommercial use\u201d is defined in legal parlance as \u201cuse in connection with or for furtherance of a profit-making enterprise.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed). \u201cCommercial activity\u201d is defined in legal parlance as \u201cany type of business or activity which is carried on for a profit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cBusiness\u201d is commonly defined as \u201ca person . . . engaged in ... a service.\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1991). \u201cBusiness\u201d is defined in legal parlance as an \u201c[a]ctivity or enterprise for gain, benefit, advantage or livelihood.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">This Court has previously discussed the meaning of \u201ccommercial\u201d activity in a related context. In <em>Lanski v Montealegre, </em>361 Mich 44; 104 NW2d 772 (1960), this Court addressed whether the operation of a nursing home was in violation of a reciprocal negative easement prohibiting commercial activity upon certain property. We determined that it was, observing that the circumstances were indicative of a \u201cgeneral plan for a <em>private resort area\u201d </em>and that this suggested that a broad definition of \u201ccommercial\u201d activity was intended. <em>Id. </em>at 49 (emphasis in the original). Therefore, \u201c[i]n its broad sense commercial activity includes any type of business or activity which is carried on for a profit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We concluded that the operation of a nursing home was a commercial use because a fee was charged, a profit was made, the services were open to the public, and such an operation subtracted from the \u201cgeneral plan of the private, noncommercial resort area originally intended.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The facts here indicate that a similar definition of commercial activity was intended. Not only does the covenant here prohibit commercial or business activi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>ties, it also prohibits the mere \u201cstoring of any equipment\u201d used in such activities. This is a strong and emphatic statement of the restrictions\u2019 intent to prohibit any type of commercial or business use of the properties. Defendants here, through the operation of \u201cfamily day care homes\u201d are providing a service to the public in which they are making a profit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Clearly, such use of their properties is a commercial or business use, as those terms are commonly and legally understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">It is of no moment that, as defendants assert, the \u201cfamily day care homes\u201d cause no more disruption than would a large family or that harm to the neighbors may not be tangible. As we noted in <em>Austin v Van Horn, </em>245 Mich 344, 347; 222 NW 721 (1929), \u201cthe plaintiffs right to maintain the restrictions is not affected by the extent of the damages he might suffer for their violation.\u201d This all comes down to the well-understood proposition that a breach of a covenant, no matter how minor and no matter how <em>de minimis </em>the damages, can be the subject of enforcement. As this Court said in <em>Oosterhouse v Brummel, </em>343 Mich 283, 289; 72 NW2d 6 (1955), \u201c \u2018If the construction of the instrument be clear and the breach clear, then it is not a question of damage, but the mere circumstance of the breach of the covenant affords sufficient ground for the Court to interfere by injunction.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">B. PUBLIC POLICY</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Defendants further contend that, even if the covenant here <em>does </em>prohibit the operation of these day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>care facilities, such a restriction should be unenforceable as against \u201cpublic policy.\u201d The circuit court agreed, while the Court of Appeals did not find it necessary to reach this issue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">To determine whether the covenant at issue runs afoul of the public policy of the state,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it is first necessary to discuss how a court ascertains the public policy of the state. In defining \u201cpublic policy,\u201d it is clear to us that this term must be more than a different nomenclature for describing the personal preferences of individual judges, for the proper exercise of the judicial power is to determine from objective legal sources what public policy <em>is, </em>and not to simply assert what such policy <em>ought </em>to be on the basis of the subjective views of individual judges. This is grounded in Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s famous injunction to the bench in <em>Marbury v Madison, </em>5 US (1 Cranch) 137, 177; 2 L Ed 60 (1803), that the duty of the judiciary is to assert what the law \u201cis,\u201d not what it \u201cought\u201d to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">In identifying the boundaries of public policy, we believe that the focus of the judiciary must ultimately be upon the policies that, in fact, have been adopted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>by the public through our various legal processes, and are reflected in our state and federal constitutions, our statutes, and the common law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Twin City Pipe Line Co v Harding Glass Co, </em>283 US 353, 357; 51 S Ct 476; 75 L Ed 1112 (1931). The public policy of Michigan is <em>not </em>merely the equivalent of the personal preferences of a majority of this Court; rather, such a policy must ultimately be clearly rooted in the law. There is no other proper means of ascertaining what constitutes our public policy.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As this Court has said previously:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-5\">\u201cAs a general rule, making social policy is a job for the Legislature, not the courts. This is especially true when the determination or resolution requires placing a premium on one societal interest at the expense of another: \u2018The responsibility for drawing lines in a society as complex as ours\u2014 of identifying priorities, weighing the relevant considerations and choosing between competing alternatives \u2014 is the Legislature\u2019s, not the judiciary\u2019s.\u2019 \u201d <em>[Van v Zahorik, </em>460 Mich 320, 327; 597 NW2d 15 (1999) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Instructive to the inquiry regarding when courts should refrain from enforcing a covenant on the basis of public policy <em>is W R Grace &amp; Co v Local Union 759, </em>461 US 757, 766; 103 S Ct 2177; 76 L Ed 2d 298 (1983), in which the United States Supreme Court said that such a public policy must not only be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>\u201cexplicit,\u201d but that it also \u201cmust be well defined and dominant. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As the United States Supreme Court has further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-6\">Public policy is to be ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interests. As the term \u201cpublic policy\u201d is vague, there must be found definite indications in the law of the sovereign to justify the invalidation of a contract as contrary to that policy. <em>[Muschany v United States, </em>324 US 49, 66; 65 S Ct 442; 89 L Ed 744 (1945).<footnotemark>[13]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">This Court has found no \u201cdefinite indications in the law\u201d of Michigan to justify the invalidation of a covenant precluding the operation of \u201cfamily day care homes.\u201d Indeed, nothing has been cited, nor does our research yield anything, in our constitutions, statutes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>or common law that supports defendants\u2019 view that a covenant prohibiting \u201cfamily day care homes\u201d is contrary to the public policy of Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Defendants contend that \u201cfamily day care homes\u201d are a \u201cfavored use\u201d of property, and a restriction against such a use, therefore, violates public policy.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Amoiphous as that claim may be, even if it is true that \u201cfamily day care homes\u201d may be permitted or even encouraged by law, it does not follow that such use is a favored one. Additionally, that \u201cfamily day care homes\u201d are <em>permitted </em>by law does not indicate that private covenants barring such business activity are contrary to public policy.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> What is missing from defendants\u2019 argument is some \u201cdefinitive indication\u201d that to exclude \u201cfamily day care homes\u201d from an area by contract is incompatible with the law.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> There is a significant distinction between something being permitted or even encouraged by law and something being required or prohibited by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">To fail to recognize this distinction would accord the judiciary the power to examine the wisdom of pri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>vate contracts in order to enforce only those contracts it deems prudent. However, it is not \u201cthe function of the courts to strike down private property agreements and to readjust those property rights in accordance with what seems reasonable upon a detached judicial view.\u201d <em>Oosterhouse, supra </em>at 289-290. Rather, absent some specific basis for finding them unlawful, courts cannot disregard private contracts and covenants in order to advance a particular social good. See <em>Johnstone v Detroit, G H &amp; M R Co, </em>245 Mich 65, 73-74; 222 NW 325 (1928).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As we said in <em>Oosterhouse, supra </em>at 288, \u201c[w]e do not substitute our judgment for that of the parties, particularly where, as in the instant case, restrictive covenants are the means adopted by them to secure unto themselves the development of a uniform and desirable residential area.\u201d Instead, we conclude that, if covenants that prohibit \u201cfamily day care homes\u201d should not be enforced on public policy grounds, such a decision should come from the Legislature, not the judiciary.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Legislature may think that it is wise to bar such covenants, but until it does so, we cannot say that they are contrary to public policy. See <em>Muschany, supra </em>at 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Further, although the circuit court and the Court of Appeals in this case considered what they viewed as the public policy in favor of \u201cfamily day care homes,\u201d they neglected to even mention the strong competing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>public policy, which <em>is </em>well-grounded in the common law of Michigan, supporting the right of property owners to create and enforce covenants affecting their own property.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Wood v Blancke, </em>304 Mich 283, 287-288; 8 NW2d 67 (1943). It is a fundamental principle, both with regard to our citizens\u2019 expectations and in our jurisprudence, that property holders are free to improve their property. We have said that property owners are free to attempt to enhance the value of their \u201cproperty in any lawful way, by physical improvement, psychological inducement, <em>contract, </em>or otherwise.\u201d <em>Johnstone, supra </em>at 74-75 (emphasis added). Covenants running with the land are legal instruments utilized to assist in that enhancement. A covenant is a contract created with the intention of enhancing the value of property, and, as such, it is a \u201cvaluable property right.\u201d <em>City of Livonia v Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>423 Mich 466, 525; 378 NW2d 402 (1985).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u201cThe general rule [of contracts] is that competent persons shall have the utmost liberty of contracting and that their agreements voluntarily and fairly made shall be held valid and enforced in the courts.\u201d <em>Twin City, supra </em>at 356; see also <em>Port Huron </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number><em>Ed Ass\u2019n v Port Huron Area School Dist, </em>452 Mich 309, 319; 550 NW2d 228 (1996), quoting <em>Dep\u2019t of Navy v Federal Labor Relations Auth, </em>295 US App DC 239, 248; 962 F2d 48 (1992) (discussing the \u201cfundamental policy of freedom of contract\u201d under which \u201cparties are generally free to agree to whatever specific rules they like\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Moreover, \u201c[restrictions for residence purposes, if clearly established by proper instruments, are favored by definite public policy. The courts have long and vigorously enforced them by specific mandate.\u201d <em>Johnstone, supra </em>at 74. The covenants at issue here are of this sort. They expressly prohibit nonresidential uses, as well as commercial, industrial, or business uses. Clearly, the intention was to limit the use of the property in order to maintain a residential neighborhood of a specific character. As we said in <em>Signaigo v Begun, </em>234 Mich 246, 250; 207 NW 799 (1926), \u201c[t]he right, if it has been acquired, to live in a district uninvaded by stores, garages, business and apartment houses is a valuable right.\u201d Further, this Court \u201chas not hesitated in proper cases to restrain by injunction the invasion of these valuable property rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 251. Moreover, the \u201cnullification of [such] restrictions [would be] a great injustice to the owners of property,\u201d <em>Wood, supra </em>at 287, because \u201cthe right of privacy for homes is a valuable right.\u201d <em>Johnstone, supra </em>at 74. It is the function of the courts to protect such rights through the enforcement of covenants. <em>Wood, supra </em>at 287-288.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Here, we conclude that a covenant precluding the operation of a \u201cfamily day care home\u201d is not violative of the public policy of our state because there are no \u201cdefinite indications\u201d in our law of any public policy against such a covenant. Indeed, there is considerable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>public policy regarding the freedom of contract that affirmatively supports the enforcement of such a covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">IV. RESPONSE TO DISSENTS</p>\n<p id=\"AHp\">A. JUSTICE KELLYS DISSENT</p>\n<p id=\"AGz\">1. COVENANTS</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Justice Kelly\u2019s dissent first concludes that \u201cfamily day care homes\u201d are \u201cresidential in nature.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 83. However, as we have already pointed out, the issue here is not whether the operation of a \u201cfamily day care home\u201d is a residential use. Rather, the issue is whether such an operation is a commercial or business use. As we explained above, residential and commercial or business uses of property are not mutually exclusive; an activity may be both residential in nature and commercial or business in nature. Therefore, the dissent\u2019s assertion that \u201cfamily day care homes\u201d are residential in nature simply is irrelevant here, where the issue is whether the operation of a \u201cfamily day care home\u201d violates a covenant prohibiting <em>commercial or business </em>uses.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">The dissent next concludes that \u201cfamily day care homes\u201d \u201cdo not violate restrictive covenants prohibiting commercial and business use.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 83. Inherent in this conclusion is that the operation of a \u201cfamily day care home\u201d is not a commercial or business</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>use.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> As discussed above, we disagree. The dissent criticizes us for placing \u201cgreat weight on compensation,\u201d <em>post </em>at 84, in determining that the operation of a \u201cfamily day care home\u201d <em>is </em>a commercial or business use. However, it provides no explanation as to why this is an inappropriate consideration. In <em>Lanski, supra </em>at 49, in determining that the operation of a nursing home was a commercial use, this Court observed that \u201c[a] fee is charged and a profit is made.\u201d The same is true here. The intent to make a profit is quite obviously an important element in identifying what constitutes a commercial or business enterprise.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">The dissent next asserts that \u201cland use should be characterized according to how the activity involved there affects the general plan of the area\u201d rather than \u201cthe narrow approach of the majority.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 84, 85. However, the approach that this majority has adopted is simply that, when parties enter into contracts to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>prohibit commercial or business uses on their properties, commercial or business uses on their properties will be prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Further, lest the dissent obscure this issue, we point out once more that the covenant before this Court states that the parties\u2019 properties are not to \u201cbe used for any commercial, or business enterprises.\u201d It does not state, as the dissent would have us understand, that the parties\u2019 properties are not to be used for any commercial, or business enterprises that affect the general plan of the area or has a visible adverse effect on the residential character of the neighborhood. See <em>post </em>at 84, 87. Under the plain language of the covenant before this Court, not the covenant apparently preferred by the dissent, the parties\u2019 properties may not be used to operate a commercial or business enterprise. Period.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In an effort apparently to \u201cimprove\u201d upon the actual contract created by the parties, the dissent reads words into the covenant that simply are not there.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The dissent justifies its amending from the bench by asserting that \u201c[t]he absence of a definition in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>restrictive covenants\u201d of the terms \u201ccommercial, industrial, or business enterprises\u201d leaves these terms ambiguous, and thus \u201copens the terms to judicial interpretation.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 87. We find this to be a remarkable proposition of law, namely, that the lack of an explicit internal definition of a term somehow equates to ambiguity \u2014 an ambiguity that apparently, in this case, allows a court free rein to conclude that a contract means whatever the court wants it to mean. Under the dissent\u2019s approach, any word that is not specifically defined within a contract becomes magically ambiguous.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> If that were the test for determining whether a term is ambiguous, then virtually all contracts would be rife with ambiguity and, therefore, subject to what the dissent in \u201cwords mean whatever I say they mean\u201d fashion describes as \u201cjudicial interpretation.\u201d However, fortunately for the ability of millions of Michigan citizens to structure their own personal and business affairs, this is not the test. As this Court has repeatedly stated, the fact that a contract does not define a relevant term does not render the contract ambiguous. <em>Henderson v State Farm Fire &amp; Cas Co, </em>460 Mich 348, 354; 596 NW2d 190 (1999).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Rather, if a term is not defined in a contract, we will interpret such term in accordance with its \u201ccommonly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>used meaning.\u201d <em>Id.] Frankenmuth Mut Ins Co v Masters, </em>460 Mich 105, 113-114; 595 NW2d 832 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The contract in this case clearly prohibits commercial or business uses on the covered properties. Equally clearly, the operation of a \u201cfamily day care home\u201d that makes a profit by providing a service to the public is a commercial or business use. That these interpretations should appear to the dissent to be overly \u201cconclusory\u201d is only, perhaps, because they involve such simple and unremarkable propositions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">2. PUBLIC POLICY</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">The dissent also concludes that, even if the covenant here <em>does </em>preclude the operation of \u201cfamily day care homes,\u201d such a preclusion is contrary to public policy, and thus unenforceable. <em>Post </em>at 88. As we have already made clear, we respectfully disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">The dissent suggests that we unnecessarily limit our understanding of public policy to \u201cexpress statutory mandates.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 90. However, as we have already explained, our view, as well as that of the United States Supreme Court, is simply that public policy must be derived from \u201cdefinite indications\u201d in the law. While the dissent would refuse to enforce the instant covenant absent any \u201cdefinite indication\u201d in the law, much less any \u201cexpress statutory mandate,\u201d that such a covenant contravenes any public policy, we view it as our obligation to enforce a covenant under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">As the dissent itself acknowledges, public policy is the \u201cfoundation\u201d of our constitutions, statutes, and common law. <em>Post </em>at 89. It is precisely because of this truth that a contract that <em>does </em>violate public policy is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>unenforceable. However, it is also because of this truth that, where an <em>actual </em>public policy exists, rather than simply a personal policy preference of a judge, \u201cdefinite indications\u201d of an actual public policy .will be found in our laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The dissent asserts that the majority\u2019s opinion \u201ceviscerates the public policy doctrine\u201d and is \u201ccontrary to this Court\u2019s long established practice.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 83, 92. Once more, we disagree. This opinion merely sets forth the unexceptional proposition that an assertion of public policy as a basis for nullifying a contract must, in fact, be grounded in a public policy. If not grounded in the constitution, the statutes, or the common law of this state, we are curious as to the dissent\u2019s basis for asserting that a policy is truly a \u201cpublic\u201d policy as opposed to merely a judge\u2019s own preferred policy. It is hard to think of a proposition less compatible with the \u201crule of law\u201d and more compatible with the \u201crule of men\u201d than that a judge may concoct \u201cpublic policies\u201d from whole cloth, rather than from actual sources of the law.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Finally, the dissent concludes that \u201crestrictive covenants prohibiting family day-care homes are contrary to our state\u2019s public policy and are unenforceable.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 90. However, the only evidence that the dissent points to establishes, at most, that \u201cfamily day care homes\u201d are supported, or even encouraged, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>public policy,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> not that covenants which limit \u201cfamily day care homes\u201d upon private properties are contrary to public policy. Such evidence certainly does not provide any \u201cdefinite indication\u201d that a covenant, freely entered into by private parties, prohibiting the operation of \u201cfamily day care homes\u201d on their properties, violates public policy.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">In summary, in the name of \u201cpublic policy\u201d \u2014 a \u201cpublic policy\u201d nowhere to be found in the actual laws of Michigan \u2014 the dissent would impose its own preferences for how a contract ought to read in place of the preferences of the parties themselves.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>B. JUSTICE WEAVER\u2019S DISSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Justice Weaver\u2019s dissent sets forth two arguments that have not elsewhere been addressed in this opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">First, the dissent suggests that, in order to determine whether an activity is commercial or business in nature, this Court must inquire into the <em>type </em>of neighborhood to which the covenant applies. We do not understand the relevance of this inquiry. The covenant here prohibits commercial or business uses. This language could not be more direct or straightforward. We do not understand how, for example, a commercial dry cleaner is transformed from a \u201cbusiness\u201d into a non-\u201cbusiness\u201d because the surrounding neighborhood is middle-income or lower middle-income, because its lots are larger or smaller, because its residents are predominantly younger or older, or because its shrubbery is or is not well-tended. Rather, a business is a business, quite without reference to the type of neighborhood in which it is situated. If there is, in fact, some relevance to be derived from all these things that comprise a neighborhood in defining \u201cbusiness,\u201d the dissent does not tell us what this might be. The dissent offers no factors or criteria for a court to evaluate, it offers no guidance as to the particular circumstances that should be reviewed by a court in its analysis, and it offers no direction regarding when a court should conclude that a 7-11 store, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>beauty shop, or an auto body facility has been transformed into a non-\u201cbusiness\u201d because of its location.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Indeed, the irrelevance of the dissent\u2019s inquiry is underscored by the obvious fact that the covenant here was only applied specifically to a <em>single </em>\u201cneighborhood\u201d \u2014 what was within the scope of the covenant. There are not one hundred different neighborhoods here in which \u201cbusiness,\u201d at least in the dissent\u2019s view, might mean something different in each instance. Rather, there is a <em>one </em>neighborhood to which the covenant applies, and there is not the slightest indication in the covenant that this altogether ordinary term, \u201cbusiness,\u201d was intended to mean anything other than what every person in Fruit-land Township, or anywhere else in the state of Michigan, would understand it to mean. One would suppose that, had the type of neighborhood been relevant to an understanding of \u201cbusiness,\u201d the parties who joined into this covenant might have offered some guidance in this regard, since there is only one \u201ctype of neighborhood\u201d to which such guidance would have been required. However, no evidence exists that these parties intended <em>any </em>of their words to have secret meanings, or to communicate something other than their ordinary meanings.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Further, we are not persuaded by the case cited by the dissent in support of its proposition that whether an activity constitutes a \u201cbusiness\u201d depends on the type of neighborhood to which the covenant applies. The dissent cites <em>Brown v Hojnacki, </em>270 Mich 557, 561; 259 NW 152 (1935), in which this Court concluded that it was \u201ctoo plain for argument\u201d that the activity at issue there, a massage parlor, constituted a \u201cbusiness house of any kind,\u201d and thereby violated a covenant prohibiting the latter. In reaching this con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>elusion, the Court nonetheless asserted that it was appropriate to consider the \u201c location and character of the entire tract of land.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 560-561. In light of the fact that the Court did not actually rely upon any such factor in its opinion, this statement must be viewed as dictum \u2014 dictum that apparently has not been reasserted since in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Second, the dissent contends that our opinion will \u201cprohibit a stockbroker from working from home on his computer, an author from writing at his home office, an attorney from writing on billable time at home, or even a neighborhood child from mowing his family\u2019s and neighbors\u2019 lawns for pay.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 94. Needless to say, we have not been presented with any of these cases, and will await their appeals before deciding them. However, where agreements that have been freely reached prove flawed, they can be undone or modified through the same process.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Regardless of whether this Court can \u201cimprove upon\u201d such agreements, we are unprepared to do so by construing words to mean what they plainly do not mean.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">The essential issue in this case is simply this: \u201cIs a for-profit day-care center a \u2018business?\u2019 \u201d In our judgment, it is. In our judgment, the parties to the contract in' this case intended that \u201cbusiness\u201d would mean \u201cbusiness.\u201d The approach of the dissent would undermine the stability of property law as well as contract law in Michigan by construing the words of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>real estate contract to mean something other than what they clearly mean.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">We conclude that the operation of a \u201cfamily day care home\u201d violates a covenant prohibiting commercial or business uses, and that such a covenant is enforceable.

Justice Kelly\u2019s dissenting opinion relies upon this definition of public policy in concluding that the covenant here is unenforceable. However, we disagree with such a nebulous definition because it would effectively allow individual judges discretion to substitute their own personal preferences for those of the public expressed through the regular processes of the law.

The Court in <em>City of Livonia </em>concluded that the operation of an adult foster care home was not a nonresidential use, despite the fact that its patients were required to pay for goods and services obtained there. We agree that the receipt of compensation does not necessarily make an activity nonresidential in nature.

Further, as we have explained, plaintiffs\u2019 right to enforce the covenant, as written, does not depend on whether defendants\u2019 violations of the covenant have harmed plaintiffs, although the fact that plaintiffs have initiated this lawsuit and pursued it to this Court suggests that the impact of defendants\u2019 activities upon plaintiffs are not viewed as benignly by the latter as they are by the dissent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b747-8\"> The dissent characterizes the effect of our decision as imposing an \u201cabsolute prohibition\u201d upon \u201cfamily day care homes\u201d on the parties\u2019 properties, and further characterizes this as the \u201cmajority\u2019s absolute prohibition.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 87.

The analysis characterizing the operation of family day-care homes as a commercial use is conclusory, providing an unworkable standard for determining whether future uses are residential or commercial. Additionally, the opinion all but eviscerates the public policy doctrine long recognized in this state\u2019s case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">I would hold that the family day-care homes involved here are residential in nature and do not violate restrictive covenants prohibiting commercial and business use. I would hold also that the covenants prohibiting the operation of family day-care homes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>are contrary to public policy and, therefore, are unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">I. RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">In determining that a family day-care home is a commercial or business use of real property, the majority places great weight on compensation. It relies on a single sentence contained in <em>Lanski v Montealegre</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that broadly defines commercial activity as any activity motivated by profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">However, as evidenced in the majority\u2019s discussion of that case, profit was not the determinative factor in concluding that the defendant\u2019s nursing home was a commercial activity. Instead, the Court also considered the effect of the home\u2019s activity on the general plan of the area, which was originally intended as a private resort area. <em>Id. </em>at 49-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">The Court used a similar approach with respect to adult foster homes in <em>City of Livonia v Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>423 Mich 466; 378 NW2d 402 (1985). There it held that such homes do not violate restrictive covenants limiting land use to residential purposes and prohibiting noxious or offensive trade, manufacturing, secondhand merchandising, and wrecking businesses. The mere fact that adults living there made payments for certain items and services did not transform residential activities to commercial activities. <em>Id. </em>at 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">These cases illustrate that land use should be characterized according to how the activity involved there affects the general plan of the area. This approach is prevalent in cases involving residential use covenants. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>See, e.g., <em>Wood v Blancke, </em>304 Mich 283; 8 NW2d 67 (1943); <em>O\u2019Connor v Resort Custom Builders, Inc, </em>459 Mich 335; 591 NW2d 216 (1999); <em>Beverly Island Ass\u2019n v Zinger, </em>113 Mich App 322; 317 NW2d 611 (1982). While usual, ordinary, and incidental use of property as a residence does not violate a residential use restriction, unusual and extraordinary use might. The determination focuses on the particular facts of the case. <em>Wood, supra </em>at 289. No logical reason has been shown why a similar approach should not be employed in cases involving commercial and business use restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">This approach also honors the intent of the parties by considering use restrictions in their entirety and in light of the particular facts of the case. It produces the proper standard for characterizing property use, not the narrow approach of the majority, which focuses on a single consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Applying that analysis here, no showing has been made that the operation of defendants\u2019 family daycare homes had any effect on the overall residential character of their neighborhood. Nor is there any evidence other than compensation that supports a conclusion that the family day-care homes were commercial or business activities. It is important to note that this case was decided on stipulated facts. As a result, the record contains limited information about the operation of the family day-care homes. It includes the parties\u2019 stipulations to the deed restrictions, defendants\u2019 operation of a family day-care home in their private residences, and the parties\u2019 ownership of land within the subdivision. There is no evidence regarding the pedestrian and vehicular traffic associated with the day-care homes or its effect on the subdivision. Thus, it is impossible to conclude from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>record that the family day-care homes do not conform to the ordinary and common meaning of \u201cuse for residential purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">In light of these facts, the restrictive covenants do not compel a ruling for plaintiffs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They address the residential nature of the neighborhood. To protect it, they prohibit activity that might become an annoyance to the neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">The restriction prohibiting commercial and business enterprises echoes the intent to prevent such activity. It also prohibits the storing of equipment used in a commercial or industrial enterprise, an activity that visibly changes a neighborhood. It is this visible adverse effect on the residential character of the neighborhood that the restrictions seek to prevent, not a discrete activity such as that involved here. I would conclude that the restriction prohibiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>commercial and business enterprises limits those activities visibly affecting the residential nature of the neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">It is apparent from the interpretations of the terms \u201ccommercial, industrial, or business enterprises\u201d that have been advanced by this Court that there is considerable disagreement about their meanings. The absence of a definition in the restrictive covenants leaves the ambiguity unresolved and opens the terms to judicial interpretation. See <em>Craig v Bossenbery, </em>134 Mich App 543, 548; 351 NW2d 596 (1984). Restrictive covenants must be reasonably construed. <em>Boston-Edison Protective Ass\u2019n v Paulist Fathers, Inc, </em>306 Mich 253, 257; 10 NW2d 847 (1943).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And they are strictly construed against the party seeking to enforce them, all doubts regarding the restrictions being resolved in favor of the free use of property. <em>City of Livonia, supra </em>at 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Applying these rules of construction, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the restrictive covenants prohibit family day-care homes. The majority\u2019s absolute prohibition of all forms of activity generating compensation would preclude activities that normally have no visible effect on a community, such as babysitting services and freelance writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">The effect of the activity is relevant where the meaning of the restrictive covenants and the question of breach is uncertain. See <em>Oosterhouse v Brummel, </em>343 Mich 283, 289; 72 NW2d 6 (1955). When considered in the context of the other restrictions, it is unlikely that the majority\u2019s broad interpretation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>covenants is what was intended. Accordingly, the effect on the neighborhood is relevant to a decision whether the operation of a family day-care home violates a covenant prohibiting commercial or business use. The majority\u2019s is an extreme construction and one that unnecessarily constrains the use of residential property.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Therefore, I would hold that the defendants\u2019 family day-care homes do not violate the restrictive covenants prohibiting commercial or business uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">H. PUBLIC POLICY</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">Even if the operation of family day-care homes were violative of plaintiffs\u2019 restrictive covenants, the covenants are contrary to public policy and cannot be enforced. Public policy was defined by this Court in <em>Skutt v Grand Rapids</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Sipes v McGhee, </em>316 Mich 614, 623-624; 25 NW2d 638 (1947):<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-9\">\u201c \u2018What is the meaning of \u201cpublic policy?\u201d A correct definition, at once concise and comprehensive, of the words \u201cpublic policy,\u201d has not yet been formulated by our courts. Indeed, the term is as difficult to define with accuracy as the word \u201cfraud\u201d or the term \u201cpublic welfare.\u201d In substance, it may be said to be the community common sense and common conscience, extended and applied throughout the State to matters of public morals, public health, public safety, public welfare, and the like. It is that general and well-settled public opinion relating to man\u2019s plain, palpable duty to his fellow men, having due regard to all the circumstances of each particular relation and situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-10\">\u201c \u2018Sometimes such public policy is declared by Constitution; sometimes by statute; sometimes by judicial decision. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>More often, however, it abides only in the customs and conventions of the people, \u2014 in their clear consciousness and conviction of what is naturally and inherently just and right between man and man. It regards the primary principles of equity and justice and is sometimes expressed under the title of social and industrial justice, as it is conceived by our body politic. When a course of conduct is cruel or shocking to the average man\u2019s conception of justice, such course of conduct must be held to be obviously contrary to public policy, though such policy has never been so written in the bond, whether it be Constitution, statute or decree of court. It has frequently been said that such public policy is a composite of constitutional provisions, statutes and judicial decisions, and some courts have gone so far as to hold that it is limited to these. The obvious fallacy of such a conclusion is quite apparent from the most superficial examination. When a contract is contrary to some provision of the Constitution, we say it is prohibited by the Constitution, not by public policy. When a contract is contrary to statute, we say it is prohibited by a statute, not by public policy. When a contract is contrary to a settled line of judicial decisions, we say it is prohibited by the law of the land, but we do not say it is contrary to public policy. Public policy is the cornerstone \u2014 the foundation \u2014 of all constitutions, statutes, and judicial decisions, and its latitude and longitude, its height and its depth, greater than any or all of them. If this be not true, whence came the first judicial decision on matter of public policy? There was no precedent for it, else it would not have been the first.\u2019 \u201d <em>[Skutt, supra </em>at 264, quoting <em>Pittsburgh, C, C &amp; St L Ry Co v Kinney, </em>95 Ohio St 64; 115 NE 505 (1916).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Public policy is what is just, right, reasonable, and equitable for society as a whole. McNeal, <em>Judicially determined public policy: Is \u201cthe unruly horse\u201d loose in Michigan?, </em>13 TM Cooley L R 143, 149 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s conclusion, the public policy of this state supports family day-care homes. This fact is evidenced by the actions over time of various state entities. The Legislature has defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>family day-care homes as residential uses in zoning statutes. See MCL 125.216g and 125.286g.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It has seen fit to regulate family day-care homes in the context of the child care licensing act for the protection of children. See MCL 722.111 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The executive branch has addressed the issue of child care. Michigan Executive Order No. 1995-21 established an advisory committee on day care for children. The committee later issued recommendations intended to strengthen the child care system of this state. See DSS <em>Child Care: Making It Work, </em>Pub No. 714 (February, 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Finally, the judiciary in case law has proclaimed that Michigan public policy favors family day-care homes. For example, in <em>Beverly Island, supra </em>at 330-331, the Court of Appeals articulated that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">In light of these express indications, it follows that restrictive covenants prohibiting family day-care homes are contrary to our state\u2019s public policy and are unenforceable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s dismissal of these strong indications of public policy is baffling and disturbing. Its narrow approach to determining public policy constrains the judiciary by prohibiting it from invalidating covenants absent express statutory mandates.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>But judicial decisions are an important component of public policy because they fill gaps occurring in constitutions and statutes. Constitutions, which are necessarily broad in scope, are not intended to resolve every controversy that might arise. Statutes are narrower in scope, providing rules governing society. But it is clear that the Legislature cannot foresee every situation likely to result in controversy. McNeal, <em>supra </em>at 143-144.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">When controversy arises, it is the role of the judiciary to determine the law as it applies to the facts of the particular case. This sometimes requires the judiciary to make public policy determinations. Thus, if the courts are to decide issues presented in novel factual situations not contemplated by statute, they must necessarily have the power to determine existing public policy. <em>Id, </em>at 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">As early as 1888, this Court acknowledged the significance of public policy. See <em>McNamara v Gargett, </em>68 Mich 454; 36 NW 218 (1888). <em>McNamara </em>adopted a definition of public policy that considered the morals of the time and the established interest of society. <em>Id. </em>at 460. It held that a promissory note was not enforceable, reasoning that the interests of the individual must be subservient to public welfare. <em>Id. </em>at 461-462. Public policy was also considered by this Court in decisions as old as <em>Fetters v Wittmer Oil &amp; Gas </em>Properties,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Brown v Union Banking Co,</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Sellars v Lamb.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">Hence, the majority\u2019s refusal to weigh, as is appropriate here, public policy not codified in the law of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>the state is sharply contrary to this Court\u2019s long established practice. The majority fails to provide a persuasive reason for so doing. Instead, it engrafts its own version of what the law should be, discarding the knowledge and wisdom of those who came before the current Court. This is the embodiment of judge-made law.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">in. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">The majority\u2019s reasoning contravenes established principles of law. It unreasonably characterizes land use employing only one criterion, whether monetary compensation is involved, without any consideration of the restrictions as a whole or the effect of the use on the community. This creates an unworkable standard with far-reaching negative implications regarding the free use of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">Additionally, the majority turns its back on public policy that was developed and has been applied by this Court for decades. This too has extensive adverse implications for the jurisprudence of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">The operation of family day-care homes is residential in nature and does not violate restrictive covenants prohibiting commercial or business use. Additionally, restrictive covenants barring their operation are contrary to public policy and, therefore, are unenforceable.

All doubts will be resolved in favor of the free use of property. <em>James v Irvine, </em>141 Mich 376, 380; 104 NW 631 (1905). Deed restrictions are property rights.

I disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis, because it fails to consider the covenant as a whole and the neighborhood to which it applies. See <em>Lanski v Montealegre, </em>361 Mich 44; 104 NW2d 772 (1960). The majority conclusion would prohibit a stockbroker from working from home on his computer, an author from writing at his home office, an attorney from writing on billable time at home, or even a neighborhood child from mowing his family\u2019s and the neighbors\u2019 lawns for pay. I do not believe that this was the intent of the parties when they entered into the covenant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">This Court should consider more than whether the activity is designed to produce a profit. As this Court has previously said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-8\">[T]he rights of the parties are not to be determined by a literal interpretation of the restriction. It is to be construed in connection with the surrounding circumstances, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>the parties are supposed to have had in mind at the time they made it, the location and character of the entire tract of land, the purpose of the restriction, whether it was for the sole benefit of the grantor or for the benefit of the grantee and subsequent purchasers, and whether it was in pursuance of a general building plan for the development and improvement of the property. <em>[Brown v Hojnacki, </em>270 Mich 557, 560-561; 259 NW 152 (1935) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">Thus, the Court should consider other factors, such as the purpose of the restriction and the effect on the neighborhood, in determining whether the disputed activities violated the restrictive covenant at issue. See <em>Lanski v Montealegre, supra</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In determining the effect on the neighborhood, the court should consider whether the covenant applies only to one individual tract of land, or to an entire neighborhood or subdivision. It is also necessary to consider the character of the surrounding neighborhood \u2014 for example, whether it is a private resort area, a single-family neighborhood, a neighborhood containing one or more apartment houses, or a mixed-use neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Here the covenant was designed to preserve the residential nature of the subdivision and to avoid the disruption to the neighborhood that \u201ccommercial, industrial, or business enterprises\u201d would cause. Family day-care homes, absent some special feature such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>as signs or intrusive lighting, do not cause such a disruption. Family day-care homes are limited to seven or fewer children, which limits the effect on neighborhoods. MCL 722.111(f)(iii). Their essential characteristics are compatible with a residential neighborhood, and they do not necessarily have any more effect on a neighborhood than any large family. Further, the Legislature has concluded that family day-care homes within neighborhoods are favored, as evidenced by the county zoning act and the township zoning act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The majority fails to give this point sufficient consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">I conclude that operating a family day-care home does not inherently affect the residential character of the neighborhood that the covenant was designed to protect. This case was submitted on stipulated facts, and there is no indication of signs, lights, or other effects on the neighborhood that would cause the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>family day-care homes to be in violation of the restrictive covenant. Accordingly, I would affirm the grant of summary disposition in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b765-13\"> MCL 722.111(f)(iii) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-14\">\u201cFamily day care home\u201d means a private home in which 1 but fewer than 7 minor children are received for care and supervision for periods of less than 24 hours a day, unattended by a parent or legal guardian, except children related to an adult member of the family by blood, marriage, or adoption. Family day care home includes a home that gives care to an unrelated minor child for more than 4 weeks during a calendar year.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b766-9\"> The majority asserts that \u201cwhere agreements that have been freely reached prove flawed, they can be undone or modified through the same process.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 82. It is indeed the case that if all the interested parties-in this case the entire subdivision-agree to modify or revoke the covenant, that could be done. See 21 CJS, Covenants, \u00a7 33, pp 322-323. Nevertheless, it is not relevant to the key issue, determining whether the defendants\u2019 family day-care homes are prohibited by the restrictive covenant at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b767-6\"> In <em>Lanski v Montealegre </em>the Court considered a covenant providing that owners \u201cshall not use said premises for any commercial enterprise or engage in any commercial undertaking thereon ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 46. Defendants established a convalescent home in a building formerly used as a residence. The Court said that the general plan for a private resort area indicated that a broad definition of \u201ccommerce\u201d was intended. \u201cIn its broad sense commercial activity includes any type of business or activity which is carried on for a profit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49. Nevertheless, the Court went on to examine the effect of the home on the neighborhood: \u201cThe patients, the visitors, the nurses, and the over-all atmosphere detract from the general plan of the private, noncommercial resort area originally intended.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49-50.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b768-7\"> In both zoning acts, it is specified that family day-care homes shall be considered a residential use of property, and a permitted use in all residential zones.
