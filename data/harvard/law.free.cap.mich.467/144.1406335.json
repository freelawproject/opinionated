The Court of Appeals effectively concluded that under \u00a7 301(4)\u2019s definition of disability as interpreted in <em>Haske v Transport Leasing, Inc, </em>455 Mich 628; 566 NW2d 896 (1997), plaintiff was disabled and entitled to wage loss benefits. We conclude that the <em>Haske </em>definition of disability is erroneous and should be overruled. Accordingly, we vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the wcac for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">A review of the relationship in the worker\u2019s compensation statute between \u201cdisability\u201d and \u201cfavored work\u201d (or as it is now formally called in the wdca, \u201creasonable employment\u201d) is helpful in understanding what is at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">There are circumstances in which a work-related injury might prevent an employee from continuing to perform one or even more of the complex of tasks in the job he was performing at the time of the injury, but in which, even with such a limitation, that employee may still be able to perform the job suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>ciently so that his wage earning capacity is not affected in that job. For example, such an injury might render an employee unable to perform a job that requires continuous standing, but nevertheless leaves the employee able to perform a job suitable to his qualifications and training in which the employee can sit while performing most or all his job duties to the degree that his ability to earn equivalent wages is not different than before the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Historically, such a situation posed a dilemma for the worker\u2019s compensation system. As the courts dealt with difficult cases in which an employee could suffer a work-related injury and be limited, to one degree or another, in his ability to perform work, but not rendered altogether unable to work, judges developed the common-law mitigation doctrine of \u201cfavored work.\u201d Under the favored-work doctrine, an employer could generally require an injured employee, eligible for worker\u2019s compensation benefits, to do other work that the employee was reasonably capable of performing. The wages earned in the \u201ceasier\u201d job could be used by the employer as a setoff, or mitigation, against the employer\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation liability. If the employee unreasonably refused to participate in the favored work, i.e., the \u201ceasier job,\u201d the penalty was loss of worker\u2019s compensation benefits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>There were also common-law protections that the courts developed to protect the employee from being exploited during the period he was engaged in favored work.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This approach to favored work, with its emphasis on mitigation, was felt to advance the interests of the employee by encouraging his reentry into the workplace, as well as the interests of the employer in limiting its ongoing worker\u2019s compensation liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">In 1982, the Legislature effectively displaced the common-law doctrine with the enactment of a statutory approach that drew heavily upon the favored-work doctrine<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (now called \u201creasonable employment\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Importantly, the legislation stated that, as a prerequisite to being considered a participant in rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>sonable employment (MCL 418.301 [5])<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> an employee must first suffer a \u201cdisability,\u201d as defined in MCL 418.301(4).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because an employee engaged in reasonable employment is afforded significant statutory pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>tections<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> once the reasonable employment commences, it is critical to employers and employees alike that it be clear which workers are considered disabled under \u00a7 301(4). It is this condition precedent to \u201creasonable employment\u201d \u2014 disability\u2014that is the central issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Plaintiff, Charles Sington, was employed by defendant, Chiysler Corporation, from July 1971 until March 1997. During his last fifteen years, he performed various production-related jobs as a \u201cfloater.\u201d Until he was injured, plaintiff\u2019s physical activities in the course of his employment included reaching and stretching out above head level, and bending and picking up parts weighing up to thirty pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">In June 1994, plaintiff slipped and fell at work, injuring his left shoulder. It is undisputed that the 1994 injury arose in the course of his employment and that defendant voluntarily paid wage loss benefits following that injury. Plaintiff underwent surgery on his left shoulder. Upon returning to work in January 1995, he was restricted from performing work requiring him to reach above the left shoulder. He continued working as a floater with this work restriction until his right shoulder was injured outside his employment. Plaintiff underwent surgery on his right shoulder in August 1996 for a non-work-related injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>and was off work until November 1996 when he returned to work as a floater. Defendant then honored plaintiff\u2019s expanded work restrictions that precluded him from lifting, pushing, or pulling over twenty pounds. It is uncontested that plaintiff\u2019s average weekly wage was the same before and after both the shoulder injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Plaintiff continued as a floater until March 1997 when he suffered a non-work-related stroke. After the stroke, plaintiff received sickness and accident benefits and was then granted a permanent and total disability pension by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Thereafter, plaintiff sought worker\u2019s compensation benefits related to his inability to work. Plaintiff asserted that he was working in \u201creasonable employment\u201d under the WDCA when he performed his job with a work restriction after the left shoulder injury, and that he became entitled to worker\u2019s compensation benefits when he lost this reasonable employment because of the stroke. This claim is grounded in the interaction between \u00a7 301(4) and \u00a7 301(5). As mentioned earlier, note 5, if an employee is disabled under \u00a7 301(4) and then is afforded reasonable employment under \u00a7 301(5), should that employment be terminated before one hundred weeks pass, the employee receives worker\u2019s compensation benefits on the basis of the wage at the date of injury under \u00a7 301(5)(e). If, on the other hand, one hundred or more weeks have passed and the worker loses the employment through no fault of his own, eligibility for benefits is determined under \u00a7 301(5)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">While, in this case, no one disagrees with the rules of reasonable employment, there <em>is </em>dispute over whether plaintiff was \u201cdisabled\u201d under \u00a7 301(4). Plaintiff asserts he was disabled because his left shoulder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>injury precluded him from performing all the tasks he performed as a \u201cfloater\u201d before that injury. Defendant\u2019s position is that, before the stroke, plaintiff was not disabled because the left shoulder injury had not reduced his \u201cwage earning capacity\u201d as that is understood in \u00a7 301(4), and, thus, once returned to work, plaintiff was not engaged in reasonable employment, with all its attendant benefits, at the time of the stroke. Accordingly, defendant asserts that, as with any other employee who became unable to work because of a non-job-related injury, plaintiff has no remedy in the worker\u2019s compensation system.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Faced with the question whether plaintiff was disabled under \u00a7 301(4), the worker\u2019s compensation magistrate ruled that plaintiff was not engaged in reasonable employment under \u00a7 301(5). The magistrate opined that plaintiff had been \u201cperforming a regular plant job\u201d after his left shoulder injury and that he was convinced that plaintiff \u201cdid not experience any wage loss, whatsoever\u201d because of that injury. The magistrate further concluded that plaintiff was disabled because of his non-work-related stroke and that, but for the stroke, plaintiff \u201cwould have continued at his regular job, a job which was conveniently within his recommended restrictions.\u201d Because plaintiff\u2019s wage loss was attributable to his stroke rather than his shoulder injury, \u201chis partial disability, based on his . . . workplace injury, [was] not compensable</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">The WCAC affirmed the magistrate\u2019s decision. It concluded that the factual record supported the magistrate\u2019s determination that plaintiff was performing his \u201cregular job\u201d when he returned to work after the left shoulder injury. Thus, the WCAC stated, the job \u201cdid not constitute an accommodation of [plaintiff\u2019s] in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>jury, so as to be \u2018reasonable employment\u2019 under Section 301(5).\u201d Accordingly, the wcac further stated that plaintiff did not have a compensable disability when he continued to \u201cperform his regular job\u201d for defendant after his left shoulder injury because \u201cit was the stroke which clearly and directly was the reason for his subsequent wage loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">The Court of Appeals reversed the wcac. 245 Mich App 535; 630 NW2d 337 (2001). The panel held \u201cas a matter of law that defendant offered plaintiff \u2018reasonable employment\u2019 within the meaning of\u201d MCL 418.301(9). <em>Id. </em>at 552. It further concluded that, once an injured employee is engaged in reasonable employment, the specific provisions pertaining to reasonable employment found in \u00a7 301(5)(e) take precedence over the general requirement of <em>Haske </em>that, to be compensable, wage loss must be causally linked to work-related injury. Thus, the Court concluded that plaintiff was engaged in reasonable employment at the time of the stroke. Thereafter, we granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Critical to the proper resolution of this appeal is how \u201cdisability\u201d is defined in the WDCA, MCL 418.301(4). In <em>Haske, </em>this Court adopted an interpretation of \u201cdisability\u201d that encompassed any work-related injury that renders an employee unable to do one or more particular jobs within the employee\u2019s qualifications and training. Because plaintiff in this case had to be accommodated to some degree in his \u201cfloater\u201d position, it can be argued that, under the <em>Haske </em>definition, plaintiff was working at \u2014 and \u201cdisabled\u201d from \u2014 a different job <em>before </em>his left shoulder injury than the reconfigured \u201cfloater\u201d job to which he returned after his injury. Thus, when he suffered the stroke, as an employee entitled to reasonable employ-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>merit status, plaintiff could claim the benefits that flow to an employee performing reasonable employment who, through no fault of his own, loses his ability to continue to perform reasonable employment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">An alternative view of disability advanced by defendant requires a reduction in an employee\u2019s actual wage earning capacity in all work suitable to his qualifications and training. Under this approach, an employee would not be disabled if a work-related injury rendered him unable to perform a particular job, but where that limitation did not affect the wages that he could earn. In particular, with regard to plaintiff, defendant argues that, if one examines overall wage earning capacity, plaintiff was not disabled because his postinjury work as a floater caused him no reduction in wage earning capacity. Thus, he was not entitled to be considered a participant in reasonable employment at the time of the stroke and, because the stroke was not work related, he is not entitled to benefits under \u00a7 301(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">We review questions of law in final orders from the WCAC de novo. <em>DiBenedetto v West Shore Hosp, </em>461 Mich 394, 401; 605 NW2d 300 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>in</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">We begin our analysis with the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d in the WDCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-6\">As used in this chapter, \u201cdisability\u201d means a limitation of an employee\u2019s wage earning capacity in work suitable to his or her qualifications and training resulting from a personal injury or work related disease. The establishment of disability does not create a presumption of wage loss. [MCL 418.301(4).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">As this language plainly expresses, a \u201cdisability\u201d is, in relevant part, a limitation in \u201cwage earning capacity\u201d in work suitable to an employee\u2019s qualifications and training. The pertinent definition of \u201ccapacity\u201d in a common dictionary is \u201cmaximum output or producing ability.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary </em>(3d College ed). Accordingly, the plain language of MCL 418.301(4) indicates that a person suffers a disability if an injury covered under the WDCA results in a reduction of that person\u2019s maximum reasonable wage earning ability in work suitable to that person\u2019s qualifications and training.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">So understood, a condition that rendered an employee unable to perform a job paying the maximum salary, given the employee\u2019s qualifications and training, but leaving the employee free to perform an equally well-paying position suitable to his qualifications and training would not constitute a disability.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Our analysis in this regard is consistent with the following conclusion of this Court in <em>Rea v Regency Olds/Mazda/Volvo, </em>450 Mich 1201; 536 NW2d 542 (1995):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-6\">A majority of the Court is of the opinion that the 1987 definition of disability in the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act<footnotemark>[10]</footnotemark> requires a claimant to demonstrate how a physical limitation affects wage-earning capacity in work suitable to the claimant\u2019s qualifications and training. It is not enough for the claimant claiming partial disability to show an inability to return to the same or similar work. If the claimant\u2019s physical limitation does not affect the ability to earn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>wages in work in which the claimant is qualified and trained, the claimant is not disabled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The <em>Rea </em>formulation implicitly drew upon an earlier articulation on this topic in <em>Pulley v Detroit Engineering &amp; Machine Co, </em>378 Mich 418, 423; 145 NW2d 40 (1966), in which this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-6\">[T]he method of determining the employee\u2019s earning capacity, as that term is used in the act, is a complex of fact issues which are concerned with the nature of the work performed and the continuing availability of work of that kind, and the nature and extent of the disability and the wages earned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">While we recognize that <em>Pulley </em>was decided before the adoption of the current definition of \u201cdisability\u201d in \u00a7 301(4) and, thus, some particulars of that opinion may not be controlling with regard to the current statutory scheme, we believe that this language is instructive in indicating that worker\u2019s compensation magistrates and the WCAC may have to consider various factual matters in determining whether an employee is disabled. Such matters could include the particular work that an employee is both trained and qualified to perform, whether there continues to be a substantial job market for such work, and the wages typically earned for such employment in comparison to the employee\u2019s wage at the time of the work-related injury. If the employee is no longer able to perform any of the jobs that pay the maximum wages, given the employee\u2019s training and qualifications, a disability has been established under \u00a7 301(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">Under the <em>Pulley </em>and <em>Rea </em>approach, rather than concluding that any employee who is unable to perform a single job because of a work-related injury has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>a \u201cdisability\u201d under \u00a7 301(4), a worker\u2019s compensation magistrate or the wcac should consider whether the injury has actually resulted in a loss of wage earning capacity in work suitable to the employee\u2019s training and qualifications in the ordinary job market.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">In sum, we conclude, as did the <em>Rea </em>Court before us, that \u201cdisability\u201d as defined in MCL 418.301(4) cannot plausibly be read as describing an employee who is unable to perform one particular job because of a work-related injury, but who suffers no reduction in wage earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">This conclusion stands in contrast to the one the <em>Haske </em>majority reached. In <em>Haske, supra </em>at 634, this Court concluded that \u00a7 301(4) defined disability as \u201ca personal injury or work-related disease that prevents an employee from performing any work, even a single job, within his qualifications and training . . . .\u201d Because of the words the Legislature used in \u00a7 301(4), the <em>Haske </em>definition of disability is untenable. The plain meaning of the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d in \u00a7 301(4) as \u201ca limitation of an employee\u2019s wage earning capacity in work suitable to his qualifications and training\u201d precludes regarding a person as disabled when an inability to perform one particular job does not, in fact, reduce that person\u2019s wage earning capacity in other, equally well-paying work suitable to his qualifications and training. Section 301(4) specifically directs the reader to a consideration of whether there is a limitation in wage earning capacity, not of whether a person is merely limited in performing one (or more) particular jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>In this regard, Justice Weaver astutely observed in her partial dissent in <em>Haske:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-4\">I believe that the most basic interpretation of \u201cwage earning capacity\u201d is that it describes an employee\u2019s ability to earn wages. Perhaps because an employee is theoretically able to earn wages in a great variety of ways, the Legislature restricted consideration to \u201cwork suitable to [an employee\u2019s] qualifications and training.\u201d Where an employee is qualified and trained in more than one job, then his wage-earning capacity includes consideration of all those jobs under the plain meaning of subsection 301(4). Whether \u201ca limitation\u201d exists in an individual\u2019s \u201cwage earning capacity\u201d where that individual is qualified and trained in more than one job therefore requires consideration of the effect of the work-related disease or injury on earning capacity in <em>all those jobs </em>in which the individual is qualified and trained. The statute does not state or imply that inability to perform one job within the individual\u2019s qualifications and training necessarily results in \u201ca limitation [in] wage earning capacity.\u201d Thus, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201can employee is disabled if there is at least a single job within his qualifications and training that he can no longer perform.\u201d I believe the majority\u2019s conclusion fails to consider whether the <em>overall </em>wage-earning capacity of the individual was actually limited and, therefore, is not true to the plain language of subsection 301(4). <em>[Haske, supra </em>at 668 (Weaver, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (first emphasis in original, second emphasis added; citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">We agree with Justice Weaver that the language of \u00a7 301(4) requires a determination of overall, or in other words, maximum, wage earning capacity in all jobs suitable to an injured employee\u2019s qualifications and training.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">We recognize that the <em>Haske </em>majority placed substantial reliance on the second sentence of \u00a7 301(4), which states that \u201c[t]he establishment of disability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>does not create a presumption of wage loss.\u201d The <em>Haske </em>majority stated that this sentence \u201celiminates the possibility that disability and wage loss are defined the same way . . . .\u201d <em>Haske, supra </em>at 654-655. Apparently, the concern of the <em>Haske </em>majority was that there would be no distinction between \u201cwage loss\u201d and \u201cdisability\u201d if a showing of disability required an overall limitation in \u201cwage earning capacity\u201d in all work suitable to an employee\u2019s qualifications and training. That is, the <em>Haske </em>majority was concerned that reading the first sentence in accordance with its plain meaning would render the second sentence nugatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">However, we do not believe that this concern was justified. As an initial matter, the focus of the inquiry is not on every single job suitable to an employee\u2019s qualifications and training \u2014 only those that produce the maximum income. Further, the second sentence reflects an understanding that there may be circumstances in which an employee, despite suffering a work-related injury that reduces wage earning capacity, does not suffer wage loss.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> For example, an employee might suffer a serious work-related injury on the last day before the employee was scheduled to retire with a firm intention to never work again. In such a circumstance, the employee would have suffered a disability, i.e., a reduction in wage earning capacity, but no wage loss because, even if the injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>had not occurred, the employee would not have earned any further wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">In light of the inconsistency of <em>Haske </em>with the plain language of \u00a7 301(4), we overrule it and return to the rule established in <em>Rea, </em>which was harmonious with the language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">In overruling the <em>Haske </em>interpretation of disability, we return to the proper understanding of disability in case law that preceded <em>Haske </em>and that, in our judgment, was more faithful to the wdca\u2019s statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">We recognize that following prior decisions of this Court under the doctrine of stare decisis is generally the preferred course of action \u201c \u2018because it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Robinson v Detroit, </em>462 Mich 439, 463; 613 NW2d 307 (2000), quoting <em>Hohn v United States, </em>524 US 236, 251; 118 S Ct 1969; 141 L Ed 2d 242 (1998). Nevertheless, stare decisis is \u201cnot to be applied mechanically to forever prevent the Court from overruling earlier erroneous decisions determining the meaning of statutes.\u201d <em>Robinson, supra </em>at 463. Rather, it is \u201c \u2018our duty to re-examine a precedent where its reasoning ... is fairly called into question.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 464, quoting <em>Mitchell v WT Grant Co, </em>416 US 600, 627-628; 94 S Ct 1895; 40 L Ed 2d 406 (1974) (Powell, J., concurring). In the present case, the treatment of the term \u201cdisability\u201d as used in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>\u00a7 301(4) of the WDCA has been fairly called into question.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">In considering whether to overrule a prior decision of this Court, the first inquiry, of course, is whether that prior decision was wrongly decided. <em>Robertson v DaimlerChrysler Corp, </em>465 Mich 732, 757; 641 NW2d 567 (2002); <em>Robinson, supra </em>at 464. For the reasons we have previously discussed, <em>Haske </em>was wrongly decided because it is clearly inconsistent with the plain language of the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d in \u00a7 301(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Nevertheless, as we recognized in <em>Robinson, </em>that a prior case was wrongly decided \u201cdoes not mean overruling it is invariably appropriate.\u201d <em>Robinson, supra </em>at 465. We must consider whether overruling a prior erroneous decision would work an undue hardship because of reliance interests or expectations and, conversely, whether the prior decision defies \u201cpractical workability.\u201d <em>Robertson, supra </em>at 757; <em>Robinson, supra </em>at 466. In particular,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-6\">the Court must ask whether the previous decision has become so embedded, so accepted, so fundamental, to everyone\u2019s expectations that to change it would produce not just readjustments, but practical real-world dislocations. It is in practice a prudential judgment for a court. <em>[Id,.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">In the present case, we see no significant reliance interest or expectation that will be disrupted by overruling <em>Haske. </em>Obviously, a work-related injury potentially compensable under the worker\u2019s compensation system is an unexpected event, so it is difficult to imagine actions that an employee would take in reliance on <em>Haske. </em>Moreover, it is doubtful that there could be a legitimate expectation interest in receiving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>worker\u2019s compensation <em>wage loss </em>benefits on the basis of an earlier work-related injury that did not, in fact, result in any overall reduction in wage earning capacity in work suitable to one\u2019s qualifications and training. Also, while a less significant factor, we see reason for concern about the \u201cpractical workability\u201d of <em>Haske, </em>particularly in terms of deciding what constitutes a single job for the purpose of applying that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Further, it is particularly appropriate to overrule a prior erroneous decision of this Court that has failed to apply the plain language of a statute. As we observed in <em>Robinson, supra </em>at 467, \u201cit is to the words of the statute itself that a citizen first looks for guidance in directing his actions.\u201d Indeed, when a court confounds the legitimate expectations of a citizen by misreading a statute, \u201cit is that court itself that has disrupted the reliance interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As we observed in <em>Robertson, supra </em>at 756, the values underlying general respect for stare decisis are also enhanced \u201cby a legal regime in which the public may read the plain words of its law and have confidence that such words mean what they say and are not the exclusive province of lawyers.\u201d Because <em>Haske </em>failed to apply the plain language of the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d in \u00a7 301(4), and in light of the lack of a significant reliance interest in the <em>Haske </em>decision, we are impelled to overrule it.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">In our order granting leave to appeal in this case, we further directed the parties to address \u201cwhether <em>Haske . . . </em>and <em>Powell v Casco Nelmor Corp, </em>406 Mich 332[; 279 NW2d 769] (1979), are reconcilable.\u201d 465 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Mich 943 (2002). However, in light of our determination that the <em>Haske </em>definition of disability is erroneous and should be overruled, it is no longer necessary to consider whether <em>Haske </em>and <em>Powell </em>may be reconciled.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Moreover, <em>Powell </em>was decided under the old common-law \u201cfavored work\u201d doctrine, before that doctrine was effectively codified by the Legislature in the wdca in its \u201creasonable employment\u201d provisions. Codification of common-law rules makes those rules of no consequence if they are inconsistent with the codification. In <em>Perez v Keeler Brass Co, </em>461 Mich 602, 606; 608 NW2d 45 (2000), we discussed the effect of codification on common-law rules regarding favored work:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-7\">Subsection (5) [of the wdca, related to reasonable employment] was added to the statute in 1982. Before that time, the statute did not address \u201creasonable employment,\u201d and this issue was governed by an area of the common law known as the \u201cfavored-work doctrine.\u201d Now, however, the quoted statutory provisions establish the law in this area. The Legislature chose the words of the statute, and we are bound by them. Any cases decided under the common law before subsection (5) was enacted are essentially irrelevant; to the extent that the common-law favored work doctrine is inconsistent with the plain language of the statute, the Legislature has changed the common law. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">Accordingly, in considering whether a person who has ceased working in a \u201creasonable employment\u201d position is entitled to worker\u2019s compensation wage loss benefits, worker\u2019s compensation magistrates and the wcac should examine the provisions of MCL 418.301(5)(d) and (e), rather than decisions under the old common-law favored work doctrine such as <em>Pow</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number><em>ell. </em>In short, as <em>Perez </em>indicates, <em>Powell </em>is now \u201cessentially irrelevant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">We now turn to the circumstances of this case. Plaintiff was qualified and trained as a \u201cfloater,\u201d although there is no indication in the record regarding whether plaintiff was qualified and trained in any other jobs. To illustrate the application of our analysis, we will assume for the moment that plaintiffs job as a floater produced the maximum wages in work suitable to plaintiffs qualifications and training, although the wcac on remand may find otherwise. Plaintiff was evidently able to. perform a variety of production-related tasks as a \u201cfloater.\u201d His physical restriction after his left shoulder injury that precluded him from lifting above shoulder level is the only relevant restriction because the right shoulder injury was not work-related. In order to establish that he had a \u201cdisability\u201d because of the left shoulder injury, plaintiff had to show that that injury resulted in a limitation in his wage earning capacity in work suitable to his qualifications and training.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">The magistrate and wcac did not apply this test. Rather, they focused, pursuant to <em>Haske, </em>on the fact that plaintiff was working in a \u201cregular job\u201d after his left shoulder injury. While that may be a strong indication that the left shoulder injury did not amount to a disability, it is not, standing alone, dispositive. An inquiry must be made regarding whether the \u201cregular job\u201d was suitable to plaintiffs qualifications and training at the time of the injury. Also, if plaintiffs injuries only enabled him to perform that \u201cregular job\u201d because of accommodations provided by defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Ms wage earning capacity might be less than Ms actual wages.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that this case should be remanded to the wcac for reconsideration in accordance with tMs opimon.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">Justice Kelly\u2019s dissent merits a response. As Justice Kelly has pointed out, in the last three and a half years, there have been cases overruling past precedent of tMs Court. She cites sixteen.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> These should be seen in the context of the overall number of dispositions by tMs Court during the same period. From January 1, 1999 to June 30, 2002, there were 8,198 dispositions by tMs Court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, it is rare (in fact, a frequency of under one-fifth of one percent) when precedent is overturned, but it does sometimes happen. During tMs period, the issue of treatment of prece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>dent has arisen primarily in review of earlier Supreme Court cases interpreting statutes. In fact, of the cases that Justice Kelly has cited where precedent has been overruled, eleven are within this category.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As the dissents to these actions have been forceful, so as to inform as to the doctrine of stare decisis and its limits, this Court in <em>Robinson </em>chose to discuss the doctrine in depth as well as its proper application.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Repeatedly, since Robinson was decided, the rules established in that case, which it should be noted are themselves entitled to respect as precedents of this Court, have been disregarded in dissents authored by Justice Kelly without any indication of what part of the rules set forth in <em>Robinson </em>she would alter.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Even more consequentially, she has failed to make clear what rules, if any, she would follow in determining when to affirm or reject precedents. What is it, for example, that distinguishes <em>Lesner v Liquid Disposal, Inc </em>466 Mich 95; 643 NW2d 553 (2002), in which Justice Kelly would overrule an interpretation of a statute, from those cases in which she would not? Today, however, she has apparently set down her rules, and that is to be welcomed. She appears to approve the <em>Robinson </em>standard that stare decisis should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>applied mechanically to forever prevent the Court from overruling earlier erroneous decisions determining the meaning of statutes. As to implementing this approach, the <em>Robinson </em>test asserts that it is a supreme court\u2019s duty to reexamine a precedent where its reasoning is fairly called into question or, to put it more simply, when it is wrong. Justice Kelly differs in this regard, however, because, as we understand her position, she would not reexamine a precedent unless the prior decision was \u201cutterly nonsensical,\u201d <em>post </em>at 184, n 9, or reflected a \u201cdrastic error,\u201d <em>post </em>at 184. Otherwise, she would allow that which even she would concede to be erroneous interpretations of the law to prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Further, under Robinson, if the prior Court decided wrongly, that was not the end of the stare decisis inquiry, because the Court must also consider whether there are reliance interests such that, to overrule the prior case, would produce real world dislocations. <em>Id. </em>at 466. If that were so, then even though a case had been decided incorrectly, stare decisis should be respected and the case should not be overruled. As to this point, Justice Kelly would seem to agree, more or less, as she states in her dissent that she would determine if customs had changed or there were unforeseen practices. <em>Post </em>at 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">These, then, are the differences between the <em>Robinson </em>approach and Justice Kelly\u2019s approach. <em>Robinson </em>would allow the overruling of a prior case interpreting a statute if it was wrong unless there were reliance interests so great that overruling the prior decision would produce real world dislocations. Justice Kelly, on the other hand, would not overrule such a decision unless the earlier Court was not merely in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>error, but \u201cdrastically\u201d in error, or had rendered a decision that was nonsensical. If so, then Justice Kelly would examine customs and unforeseen practices to determine if overruling was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">She claims, correctly we acknowledge, that her approach, as contrasted with the <em>Robinson </em>approach, would likely produce fewer cases overruling precedent. Yet, is that the proper measure of the merits of these two approaches? We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">We think not because the proper measure of tests of stare decisis is not whether one approach overrules more than another, but rather which approach is more consistent with American constitutionalism. We believe the constitutional arrangement in our state and nation reposes in the legislative body the role of making public policy. That arrangement is distorted when the judiciary misconstrues statutes. The majority\u2019s view is that its approach to stare decisis, in overruling our prior erroneous interpretations of statutes, respects the democratic process by yielding to the constitutional authority of the Legislature its right to establish the state\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Justice Kelly\u2019s approach is flawed because it gives the earlier Court and its judges far too much power\u2014 power beyond that which the constitution gave them. Nothing is clearer under our constitution than that the Legislature, when it has enacted a statute within its constitutional authority and, thus, has established public policy, must be obeyed even by the courts. Said more plainly, the difference in these approaches is that Justice Kelly feels less obligation to adhere to the direction of the people\u2019s representatives in the Legislature, and more obligation to defend past judges\u2019 errors. We respectfully believe that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>approach of Justice Kelly misunderstands who governs in a republic. It is not judges; rather, it is the people. In this case, we have restored the law to what was enacted by the people\u2019s representatives. It is our duty to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">As to Justice Cavanagh\u2019s criticism of our response to Justice Kelly, it is important that the reader understand that, in the ordinary course of things on an appellate court, majority opinions are written and then dissents follow. The majority then responds to the dissent. In the instant case, this was the pattern of things. To fully argue the approaches of <em>Robinson </em>and Justice Kelly is not unseemly nor does it indicate a \u201cmanic sensitivity to criticism.\u201d Rather, to respond fully to a dissent indicates that the majority is sufficiently respectful of the dissent, and those who could be persuaded by it, to want to ensure that the issue is fully understood. Justice Cavanagh, on the occasions when he writes for the majority in the face of dissent, does no less \u2014 nor should he.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We claim the same prerogative when he is not in the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">On the merits of this case, that is whether <em>Haske </em>was wrong, we consider Justice Kelly\u2019s critique of the majority opinion to be highly unconvincing. Contrary to the dissent\u2019s position, there obviously is a distinction between \u201cwages earned\u201d and \u201cwage earning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>capacity.\u201d See <em>post </em>at 181. It is simply inaccurate to state that \u201ccapacity to earn wages and wages earned will rarely differ.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 181. On the contrary, it can clearly be the case that an individual might earn wages below his wage earning capacity. With regard to the second sentence of \u00a7 301(4), which establishes that disability does not create a presumption of wage loss, one likely explanation for this sentence is the provision of reasonable employment with full wages to an injured employee despite a reduction in wage earning capacity. That is, a person might suffer a disability under \u00a7 301(4), i.e., a reduction in wage earning capacity in work suitable to his qualifications and training, because of an inability to actually earn wages in the ordinary job market, but be paid full wages by an employer for the performance of reasonable employment. In such a situation, the employee would be \u201cdisabled,\u201d but not suffer wage loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">We are frankly at a loss to understand the distinction that Justice Kelly would draw between \u201cwage earning capacity\u201d and \u201cearning capacity.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 182. An employee earns wages for his work. We cannot see any sensible distinction between \u201cwage earning\u201d and \u201cearning\u201d in the present context, let alone what difference such a distinction makes to the practical application of the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d in \u00a7 301(4). Similarly, we do not see the point of somehow attempting to equate the phraise \u201cwage earner,\u201d which refers to a person, with the phrase \u201cwage earning,\u201d which is used in \u00a7 301(4) as an adjectival phrase to modify the term \u201ccapacity\u201d for the purpose of effectively concluding that disability requires a showing of only an inability to perform one particular job suitable to a person\u2019s qualifications and training. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>We emphatically disagree with Justice Kelly\u2019s statement that \u201cthe proper definition of disability focuses on a limitation in the capacity to perform the work, not on a limitation in the capacity to earn wages . . . <em>Post </em>at 183 (emphases removed). While that might be a definition she would prefer, the plain language of \u00a7 301(4) defines \u201cdisability\u201d as, in pertinent part, \u201ca limitation of an employee\u2019s <em>wage earning capacity </em>in work suitable to his or her qualifications and training\u201d (emphasis added). Thus, a judicial \u201cdefinition\u201d of disability, such as the one in <em>Haske, </em>that does not focus on the employee\u2019s capacity to earn wages, i.e., the employee\u2019s wage earning capacity, is simply inconsistent with the plain language of the controlling statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">vn</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">For these reasons, we overrule the <em>Haske </em>definition of \u201cdisability\u201d as that term is used in MCL 418.301(4). Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the WCAC for reconsideration consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b844-7\">Corrigan, C.J., and Young and Markman, JJ., concurred with Taylor, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b819-6\"> This Court described the former favored-work doctrine as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-7\">The favored-work doctrine is a purely judicial creation.

If one hundred or more weeks have passed, determination of eligibility for worker\u2019s compensation benefits if an employee loses reasonable employment \u201cthrough no fault of the employee\u201d is based on the more complex factors set forth in \u00a7 301(5)(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b827-9\"> We recognize that pre-1987 Michigan case law once drew a distinction with regard to wage earning capacity between \u201cskilled\u201d and \u201cunskilled\u201d workers. A skilled worker was considered to have an impairment of earning capacity, and thus would be entitled to compensation, if a work-related injury rendered the employee unable to continue earning the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>level of wages in his particular skilled employment, even if the same wages could be earned at another type of employment. See, e.g., <em>Kaarto v Calumet &amp; Hecla, Inc, </em>367 Mich 128, 131; 116 NW2d 225 (1962); <em>Geis v Packard Motor Car Co, </em>214 Mich 646, 648-649; 183 NW 916 (1921). Similarly, an unskilled or \u201ccommon\u201d laborer had to show a limitation in wage earning capacity in the entire field of \u201cunskilled\u201d labor. See <em>Leitz v Labadie Ice Co, </em>229 Mich 381; 201 NW 485 (1924); <em>Kling v Nat\u2019l Candy Co, </em>212 Mich 159; 180 NW 431 (1920). This dichotomy between skilled and unskilled labor led to some anomalous results. In <em>Geis, </em>the plaintiff was held to have a compensable disability because of an injury that precluded him from performing the skilled employment he was performing at the time of his injury even though he worked for <em>higher </em>wages in somewhat related employment. See <em>Kaarto, supra </em>at 131 (discussing <em>Geis). </em>Conversely, in <em>Leitz, </em>the plaintiff was held entitled to continuation of a disability award on the basis of being disabled from common labor even though he was earning higher wages as a bookkeeper and accountant.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">However, when the present definition of disability was adopted in 1987, the Legislature replaced its prior reference to a limitation in wage earning capacity in \u201cthe employee\u2019s general field of employment\u201d with \u201cwork suitable to his or her qualifications and training.\u201d This means that the inquiry is now focused on an employee\u2019s qualifications and training, not merely the general field of employment in which the employee happened to work at the time of a work-related injury. Thus, the prior common-law skilled/unskilled dichotomy has no significance under the current statutory language. Because there is no textual basis in the statute for the selection and application of <em>either </em>historical definition of \u201cwage earning capacity,\u201d we examine the plain meaning of the words found in the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[10]\">\n<p id=\"b828-9\">10 That is the current definition of disability in the wdca, MCL 418.301(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b832-6\"> We note that, once it is found that an employee is disabled under \u00a7 301(4), the employee must then establish wage loss in order to compute wage loss benefits under MCL 418.361. The clear language of the second sentence of \u00a7 301(4) militates against any holding that the terms \u201cwage earning capacity\u201d and \u201cwage loss\u201d are synonymous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b838-8\"> However, a work-related injury that has a de minimus effect on an employee\u2019s job-related duties might not amount to a disability. This is because many employers might disregard such minor limitations in hiring applicants generally, meaning that such minor conditions would not effect an employee\u2019s ability to perform his top paying job and would therefore not limit his wage earning capacity. A useful perspective for the wcac in considering this case on remand might be considering whether plaintiffs injuries would prevent him from competing in the marketplace with other workers for the \u201cregular job.\u201d The wcac might also consider whether defendant would have continued plaintiff in the \u201cregular job\u201d at the same rate of pay if he was injured in a non-work-related incident. If plaintiff would have been hired or retained despite his ir\\jury, this would indicate that plaintiff did not suffer a disability because the pertinent injury did not impair his wage earning capacity Conversely, if defendant would not have hired plaintiff or would not have accommodated plaintiffs injury except for it being work related, that would be indicative of a limitation in wage earning capacity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b838-9\"> See <em>post </em>at 177, n 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b838-10\"> The Supreme Court Clerk\u2019s data reflects that there were 2,571 dispositions in 1999, 2,302 in 2000, 2,359 in 2001, and 966 from January 1 to June 30, 2002.

The establishment of disability does not create a presumption of wage loss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Addressing this language for the first time at this level, the <em>Rea </em>Court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-6\">A majority of the Court is of the opinion that the 1987 definition of disability in the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act requires a claimant to demonstrate how a physical limitation affects wage-earning capacity in work suitable to the claimant\u2019s qualifications and training. It is not enough for the claimant claiming partial disability to show an inability to return to the same or similar work. If the claimant\u2019s physical limitation does not affect the ability to earn wages in work in which the claimant is qualified and trained, the claimant is not disabled. <em>[Id. </em>at 1201.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Addressing the same language as it appears at MCL 418.401(1),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the <em>Michales </em>decision noted the language\u2019s focus is on wage-earning capacity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-5\">The relevant inquiry is not whether there is a theoretical job in the employee\u2019s general field of employment that the employee is no longer able to perform. Instead, the question is whether the employee\u2019s wage-earning capacity, i.e., ability to earn wages, has been limited, considering the employee\u2019s qualifications and training. <em>[Id. </em>at 493, n 19.]<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">The majority decision in <em>Haske </em>abruptly broke from these prior interpretations of the wdca definitions of disability.

See, e.g., <em>Powell v Casco Nelmor Corp, </em>406 Mich 332, 350; 279 NW2d 769 (1979) (holding that disability is the inability to perform work the claimant was doing when injured), and <em>Pigue v Gen Motors Corp, </em>317 Mich 311, 315; 26 NW2d 900 (1947) (finding total disability where an employee was unable to do the same work after the injury).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-7\"> The <em>Haske </em>decision was decided by a four to two to one split.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b845-8\"> I joined the dissent in <em>Rea </em>because I agreed with Justice Riley that the <em>Rea </em>majority unnecessarily remanded in that case for further factfinding.

I farther agree with the majority that the Court of Appeals erroneously substituted MCL 418.301(9)\u2019s reasonable employment definition for MCL 418.301(4)\u2019s disability requirement. However, I write separately because I disagree with the majority\u2019s decision to overrule <em>Haske v Transport Leasing, Inc, </em>455 Mich 628; 566 NW2d 896 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">The <em>Haske </em>Court found that the first sentence of MCL 418.301(4) was ambiguous, and examined the law and the Legislature\u2019s changes to resolve this ambiguity. <em>Haske </em>at 643-653. After such examination, the Court determined that the Legislature must have intended to adopt the definition of disability that \u201can employee is disabled whenever he can no longer perform a job suitable to his qualifications and training as a result of his injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 655. The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-5\">Subsection 301(4) . . . requires the employee to prove a disability, i.e., that he is eligible for compensation, and then prove wage loss, i.e., that he is entitled to an award. This language codifies the prior approach in Michigan that injury is not compensable without wage loss. If the employee establishes a disability, he must further prove a wage loss because wage loss will not be presumed. See subsection 301(4). However, <em>in order to prove a wage loss, </em>under the language of the statute and on the basis of our longstanding interpretation of related precedent, most recently confirmed in <em>Sobotka [v Chrysler Corp (After Remand), </em>447 Mich 1, 17; 523 NW2d 454 (1994) (Boyle, J., lead opinion)], the employee must establish <em>a reduction in earning capacity.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-7\">With this conclusion, the definition of disability in subsection 301(4) cannot then be logically interpreted as a reduction of wage-earning capacity as long as wage loss is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>also measured by a reduction in wage-earning capacity. See <em>Lawrence v Toys R Us, </em>453 Mich 112, 121; 551 NW2d 155 (1996) (Levin, J., plurality opinion). Subsection 301(4)\u2019s second sentence eliminates the possibility that disability and wage loss are defined the same way when it provides that proof of a \u201cdisability does not create [a] presumption of wage loss.\u201d <em>[Haske </em>at 654-655 (emphasis in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Because I remain committed to the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Haske, </em>I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to overrule <em>Haske.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">I also must express my disappointment with the majority\u2019s lengthy response to Justice Kelly\u2019s dissenting opinion. I appreciate that my colleagues feel the need to defend and substantiate their respective positions, after all, that is our duty as justices. However, I am uncomfortable with the majority\u2019s overzealous attack of Justice Kelly\u2019s discussion of stare decisis. It is completely unnecessary to add numerous pages defending the majority\u2019s decision to overrule precedent and attacking Justice Kelly\u2019s positions in previous cases. These lengthy sections have nothing to do with the merits of this case and do not add anything to the resolution of the question at hand. They do, however, speak volumes about the majority\u2019s manic sensitivity to criticism.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b848-7\">Kelly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Are\">(dissenting).

THE MAJORITY AGAIN DISDAINS PRECEDENT</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Today the majority once again discards a prior decision and replaces it with its preferred interpretation of the law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In announcing its new vision of disability law, it refers to its recent pronouncements about the value of precedent in <em>Robinson v Detroit, </em>462 Mich 439; 613 NW2d 307 (2000), and <em>Robertson v DaimlerChrysler Corp, </em>465 Mich 732; 641 NW2d 567 (2002). However, the sheer volume of this majority\u2019s decisions overturning precedent in the past four years raises serious questions about the degree to which the majority values the principle of stare decisis. Time after time, established law has been discarded on the basis that it was \u201cwrongly decided.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is an amazement to me how frequently the members of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>majority have found that esteemed justices who came before them simply misunderstood the law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">In the five-year period from 1993 through 1997, there were approximately twelve cases in which precedent was overturned by this Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the five-year period from 1998 through 2002, at least twenty-two cases were overturned.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, the number of dispositions went down.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">The test for overturning precedent articulated in <em>Robinson, </em>and again in <em>Robertson </em>includes two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>prongs: The first is whether the earlier decision was wrongly decided. The majority has ruled <em>Haske </em>was wrongly decided.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">The second <em>Robinson </em>prong is whether overruling the precedent of this Court would work an undue hardship on the basis of reliance interests. In considering that question, the majority labels a worker\u2019s reliance on a disability determination under <em>Haske </em>an illegitimate and insignificant expectation. <em>Ante </em>at 162-163. It has apparently decided that the <em>Haske </em>decision strayed so far into error that no one should ever have relied on it. It seems to assume that even those having no legal education can and do distinguish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>between which court precedent should be followed and which should not.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertions, I do not consider stare decisis a conclusive barrier to change. The majority\u2019s effort challenging me to explain some disagreement with <em>Robinson </em>would be better spent explaining the facility with which it excuses itself from exercising the judicial restraint <em>Robinson </em>embraces.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Stare decisis has long been venerated in the law and with good reason. Adherence to this doctrine promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles and contributes to the integrity of the judicial process, both actual and perceived. <em>Robinson, supra </em>at 463, n 21, citing <em>Hohn v United States, 524 </em>US 236, 251; 118 S Ct 1969; 141 L Ed 2d 242 (1998). It is a bedrock principle. When a Court pays no more than lip service to it, the basic integrity of the legal system itself is shaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">II. <em>HASKE </em>WAS NOT WRONGLY DECIDED</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\"><em>Haske </em>was correctly decided. The definition of disability that it adopted is supported by the fact that the statute treats \u201cdisability\u201d and \u201cwage loss\u201d as separate concepts. Examining the language of MCL 418.301(4), one finds that the first sentence defines disability. The second makes clear that it cannot be presumed that one has suffered a wage loss merely because one has become disabled. Of course, that is because one may be disabled but not suffer a wage loss, hence, not be qualified for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">The majority\u2019s new definition of disability is: an incapacity after work-related injury or illness to earn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>maximum wages in work for which the claimant is qualified and trained. As a practical matter, this definition means disability is an incapacity after work-related injury or illness <em>to earn the same or greater wages </em>in work for which the claimant is qualified and trained.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The starting point in analyzing this is the statutory expression \u201cwage earning capacity.\u201d The majority attempts to convince that a distinction exists between \u201cwages earned\u201d and \u201cwage earning capacity.\u201d In truth, capacity to earn wages and wages earned will rarely differ. This is illustrated by the fact that, when applying its definition to Charles Sington, the majority assumes they are the same. <em>Ante </em>at 165. Also, it cites with approval Justice Weaver\u2019s words: \u201cthe most basic interpretation of \u2018wage earning capacity\u2019 is that it describes an employee\u2019s ability to earn wages.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">The majority provides no persuasive examples how it could be that an employee would be earning at under capacity if not disabled. By definition, normally, what the employee earns is what the job will pay at any given time. Hence, \u201cwage earning capacity\u201d and \u201cwages earned\u201d are, practically speaking, synonymous. It follows, then that, as the majority reads it, the first sentence in \u00a7 301(4) contradicts the second. It reads: \u201cThe establishment of disability does not create a presumption of wage loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">If one must prove a wage loss to make out a disability,. the second sentence of \u00a7 301(4) is rendered nugatory. If one cannot be disabled absent a wage loss, the establishment of a disability relies on a wage loss. The majority confirms this by quoting with approval from <em>Pulley </em>to the effect that \u201cthe wages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>earned\u201d are one of the \u201ccomplex of fact issues\u201d used to determine wage earning capacity. <em>Ante </em>at 157. <em>Pulley v Detroit Engineering &amp; Machine Co, </em>378 Mich 418, 423; 145 NW2d 40 (1966). Of course, <em>Haske </em>disagreed with <em>Pulley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">The <em>Haske </em>decision is based on the proposition that \u00a7 301(4), properly defined, treats \u201cdisability\u201d and \u201cwage loss\u201d as distinct concepts. Defining a disability as the majority does, as a loss of capacity to earn maximum wages in one\u2019s field, when there can be no presumption of a wage loss in the definition, is nonsense.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The majority has defined \u201cearning capacity\u201d using a rigid textualist approach to statutory interpretation (and, as I have pointed out, it makes no meaningful distinction from \u201cwages earned\u201d). However, the statutory expression is not \u201cearning capacity.\u201d Rather, it is \u201cwage earning capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">A plain meaning interpretation of that expression is that \u201cwage earning\u201d is an expression akin to \u201cwage earner,\u201d which is defined as \u201ca person who works for wages.\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1995). Hence \u201cwage earning capacity\u201d means \u201cthe capacity of a person who works for wages.\u201d Using that, the proper interpretation of the first sentence of \u00a7 301(4) becomes \u201cdisability is a limitation after work-related injury or illness in the capacity of a person who works for wages in work for which the person is qualified and trained.\u201d Then, the second sentence of \u00a7301(4), \u201c[t]he establishment of disability does not create a presumption of wage loss,\u201d is not rendered nugatory or contradictory. Also, the holding in <em>Haske </em>is shown to be correct. See <em>Haske </em>at 653-654 and <em>ante </em>at 176 (Cavanagh, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Even if \u201cwage earning capacity\u201d were defined as if it read \u201cearning capacity,\u201d the majority\u2019s definition is off the mark. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed) defines \u201cearning capacity,\u201d inter alia, as the \u201cFitness, readiness and willingness to work, considered in connection with opportunity to work.\u201d The emphasis is on capacity to perform the work. Using that, the proper interpretation of the first sentence of \u00a7 301(4) becomes \u201cdisability is a limitation after work-related injury or illness in the fitness of an employee to work for wages in work for which the person is qualified and trained.\u201d As with my earlier analysis, the proper definition of disability focuses on <em>a limitation in the capacity to perform the work, </em>not on <em>a limitation in the capacity to earn wages, </em>as the majority insists.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">The majority\u2019s opinion is a study in confusion in other respects, in addition to its reading of \u00a7 301(4). For example, it correctly recognizes that a prerequisite to being considered a participant in reasonable employment under MCL 418.301(5) is a determination that the employee has suffered a disability under \u00a7 301(4). <em>Ante </em>at 148-149. However, later it states that, in order to determine whether plaintiff was disabled after his left shoulder injury and before his stroke, the WCAC must inquire whether the work he was doing then was reasonable employment. <em>Ante </em>at 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">It concludes, \u201cif defendant . . . would not have accommodated plaintiff\u2019s injury, except for it being work related, that would be indicative of a limitation in wage earning capacity.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 166, n 12. Hence, the fact that the employee obtained reasonable employment under \u00a7 301(5) is a factor to be used to determine if the employee was disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>m. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The majority\u2019s reading of MCL 418.301(4) is incorrect. It creates contradictions between the definition of disability and other parts of the statute. Also, the majority opinion is internally contradictory.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\"><em>Haske </em>accurately interpreted the statute. The majority\u2019s rationale for overturning it gives no deference to precedent. It simply replaces its interpretation of the first sentence of \u00a7 301(4) with the interpretation of a different group of justices.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">Appellate courts, in the normal course of their work, are called upon continuously to reevaluate the lasting vigor of prior courts\u2019 binding opinions. Of necessity, some must be found to be no longer valid because of subsequent legislative alterations of the law or changing customs and practices unforeseen by an earlier court. Very occasionally, a prior decision is found to work unexpected hardship. And rarely, a drastic error may be shown to have been made by a prior court in its reasoning or reading of a statute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">So it is that, in the history of this and of the vast majority of supreme courts across the land, overrulings of precedent are infrequent.

It appears that the majority believes itself gifted with prodigious and unprecedented insight into the mind of the Legislature. The recent sharp increase in reversals of precedent is alarming because it suggests that this majority believes that only it, not present dissenters nor many past majorities of this Court, can discern the true intent of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">It is not, as the majority alleges here, a matter of my not understanding \u201cwho governs in a republic.\u201d Nor is it a matter of defending \u201cpast judges\u2019 errors\u201d or feeling less obligation than they to \u201cadhere to the direction of the people\u2019s representatives .. . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 169-170. Rather, it is a matter of exercising judicial restraint and of avoiding concluding too easily that other experienced justices wrongly interpreted legislation. It is a matter of not falling prey to a zealot\u2019s conviction that what has been done in the past by others has been simply wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">Stare decisis is not an argument intended to resuscitate the dead hand of the judiciary. Adherence to it contributes to, not detracts from, the integrity of our constitutional system. As Justice Marshall once pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-10\">That doctrine permits society to presume that bedrock principles are founded in the law rather than in the proclivities of individuals, and thereby contributes to the integrity of our constitutional system of government, both in appearance and in fact. <em>[Vasques v Hillery, </em>474 US 254, 265-266; 106 S Ct 617; 88 L Ed 2d 598 (1986).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b856-9\"> For instance, in <em>Lesner v Liquid Disposal, Inc, </em>466 Mich 95; 643 NW2d 553 (2002), I found, as did the majority, that it was necessary to overrule <em>Weems v Chrysler Coop, </em>448 Mich 679; 533 NW2d 287 (1995). This is because <em>Weems </em>provided a formula for the calculation of death benefits that was utterly nonsensical when multiple partial dependents were considered.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
