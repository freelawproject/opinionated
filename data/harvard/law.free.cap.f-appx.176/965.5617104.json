For the reasons that follow, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of his motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-11\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b994-12\">In 2002, Donaldson was indicted for drug offenses under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846. The government notified Donaldson that he faced enhanced penalties under \u00a7 841 based on a 1997 felony drug conviction. Donaldson had also been convicted in 1997 for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), but this offense did not form the basis for the \u00a7 841 enhancement. Donaldson pleaded guilty to two counts and received the \u00a7 841 enhancement. The plea agreement contained a waiver of appeal provision that prohibited Donaldson from appealing the manner in which his sentence was imposed even if it resulted from an incorrect application of the guidelines, unless the sentence exceeded the statutory maximum. In 2003, Donaldson was sentenced to 175 months\u2019 imprisonment. He did not file a direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-17\">In 2005, Donaldson filed a <em>pro se </em>\u201cmotion pursuant to Fed. R. Cr. P. \u00a7\u00a7 32(b)(4)(B) and (d)(1) for misclassification of offenses.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Donaldson claimed that the court improperly enhanced his sentence because: (1) the judgment and commitment order from the 1997 case charged him with a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 842(a)(1), which cannot form the basis for an enhancement under \u00a7 841; and (2) the \u00a7 922(g) conviction from 1997 could not form the basis for an enhancement as he did not receive a sentence in excess of one year. According to Donaldson, if the district court had not improperly applied the enhancements, he would have faced 97-121 months\u2019 imprisonment, which would have been reduced to 60-70 months\u2019 imprisonment based on his acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-18\">On August 12, 2005, the district court summarily denied Donaldson\u2019s motion. On August 19, 2005, Donaldson filed a motion for a more definite statement under Fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>eral Rule of Civil Procedure 7, which the district court summarily denied on September 22, 2005.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Donaldson filed a notice of appeal, stamped by the district court on October 3, 2005, but dated by Donaldson on September 29, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">As an initial matter, the government contends that we lack jurisdiction because Donaldson\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely. Further, the government asserts that the motion for a more definite statement did not toll the time in which to file a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">We have an obligation to review <em>sua sponte </em>whether we have jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Cartwright, </em>413 F.3d 1295, 1299 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe timely filing of a notice of appeal is a mandatory prerequisite to exercise of appellate jurisdiction.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>425 F.3d 987, 989 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cIn a criminal case, a defendant\u2019s notice of appeal must be filed in the district court within 10 days after ... (i) the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed....\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(l)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">Donaldson filed his notice of appeal on September 29 or October 3, both of which are considerably more than ten days after the district court\u2019s denial of his initial motion on August 12. Yet, construing liberally Donaldson\u2019s motion for a more definite statement, we construe the motion as a motion for reconsideration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cAlthough a motion for reconsideration of a district court order in a criminal action is not expressly authorized by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Supreme Court has held that the timely filing of such a motion in a criminal action tolls the time for filing a notice of appeal____\u201d <em>United States v. Vicaria, </em>963 F.2d 1412, 1413 (11th Cir.1992) (citing <em>United States v. Dieter, </em>429 U.S. 6, 8-9, 97 S.Ct. 18, 50 L.Ed.2d 8 (1976)). Therefore, because both September 29 and October 3 are within ten days of the district court\u2019s September 22 denial of Donaldson\u2019s motion for more definite statement, we have jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-15\">Nevertheless, on the merits, we conclude that Donaldson\u2019s motion for misclassification must fail.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although, Donaldson challenges his sentence because the district court improperly used his prior \u00a7 922(g) conviction to enhance his sentence, the record shows that the \u00a7 922(g) conviction did not form the basis of the enhancement. Furthermore, Donaldson\u2019s claim that the 1997 drug conviction could not be used to enhance his sentence because the 1997 court mistakenly listed the conviction as under \u00a7 842 rather than as under \u00a7 841 also fails as Donaldson concedes that he pleaded guilty to the \u00a7 841 offense. A mere scrivener\u2019s error listing the 1997 conviction as under \u00a7 842 does not negate the use of the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>Finally, because the district court properly denied the motion for misclassification, the district court properly denied the motion for a more definite statement. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b994-13\">. Federal Rule of Criminal of Procedure 32(b)(4)(B) does not exist. Subsection (d)(1) addresses the application of the sentencing guidelines and the PSI report. Fed.RCrim.P. 32(d)(1) (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b995-9\">. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(e), not Rule 7, addresses motions for a more definite statement. Notably, the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure are inapplicable in criminal proceedings. Fed.R.Civ.P. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b995-10\">. <em>See Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972) (holding that <em>pro se </em>petitioner\u2019s petition should be read liberally).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b995-16\">. We proceed to the merits even though Donaldson\u2019s initial motion for reclassification is likely untimely under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35, which allows a district court to correct a sentence if the motion is brought within seven days from entry of the judgment, and likely was prohibited by the appeal waiver in Donaldson\u2019s plea agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
