As part of his plea agreement Panozzo agreed to have his sentence determined using the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory. The district court sentenced Panozzo to concurrent terms of 56 months\u2019 imprisonment on all three counts, the middle of the mandatory Guideline range. Despite his plea agreement Panozzo attacks his sentence under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-14\">In 2004, a grand jury indicted Panozzo on three counts of stealing a firearm from a licensed dealer and three counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Panozzo pleaded guilty to the three theft charges pursuant to a written plea agreement. At the time Panozzo entered into his plea agreement the Supreme Court had granted certiorari for review of this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>375 F.3d 508 (7th Cir.2004). Panozzo\u2019s attorney explained to him the potential ramifications of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and in the plea agreement Panozzo acknowledged \u201cthat he may be entitled to have any disputed sentencing fact which could increase his sentence determined at a jury trial under a proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard.\u201d Nonetheless Panozzo agreed \u201c[t]o have his sentence determined under the Sentencing Guidelines,\u201d and to have the district court determine his sentencing facts. At the change of plea hearing, the district court confirmed that Panozzo understood that he agreed to be sentenced under the Guidelines \u201cas mandatory\u201d and that the court would determine the sentencing factors. On appeal Panozzo does not challenge the district court\u2019s calculation of the Guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-15\">Panozzo argues in his opening brief that the district court impermissibly sentenced him using the mandatory Guidelines and asks for a full remand for resentencing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>citing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker. </em>After his opening brief was filed, we decided <em>United States v. Berheide, </em>421 F.3d 538 (7th Cir.2005), holding that a defendant is bound by the concessions made in his plea agreement and has waived any right to benefit from subsequent changes in the law. In his reply brief, Panozzo recognizes that <em>Berheide </em>appears to control his case but argues that <em>Berheide </em>was wrongly decided. In the alternative he argues that his case can be distinguished from <em>Berheide </em>because Panozzo retained the right to appeal an incorrect application of the mandatory Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Panozzo contends that no one could have anticipated that the Guidelines would become advisory and therefore, contrary to the holding in <em>Berheide, </em>it was not possible for individuals to knowingly waive the right to be sentenced under an advisory Guidelines system. The risk of the unknowable is inherent in all contracts and a plea agreement is no different. <em>See United States v. Bownes, </em>405 F.3d 634, 636 (7th Cir.2005). Panozzo agreed in his plea agreement that the Guidelines would determine his sentence based on the district court\u2019s determination of the sentencing factors. Panozzo is bound by this promise and has waived the right to any benefit from subsequent changes in the law whether or not they could be foreseen. <em>See Berheide, </em>421 F.3d at 542; <em>Bownes, </em>405 F.3d at 636-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Panozzo attempts to distinguish between a constitutional <em>Booker </em>error and a statutory error in applying the Guidelines as mandatory. He argues that, even if he has waived his constitutional <em>Booker </em>claim, he has not waived his statutory right to be sentenced under an advisory Guideline system. But at the time Panozzo agreed to be sentenced under the Guidelines they were applied as mandatory, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1), and the plain language of his plea agreement makes no distinction between constitutional and statutory errors. He agreed in the plea agreement that he would \u201chave his sentence determined under the Sentencing Guidelines\u201d and he confirmed at the change of plea hearing that he understood the district court would use \u201cthe guidelines as mandatory by agreement of the lawyers.\u201d His situation is not different than Berheide\u2019s or Bownes\u2019 simply because he preserved the right to appeal an incorrect application of the Guidelines. He is not asking us to correct an error in calculating his Guideline range; he is asking us to allow him the benefit of <em>Booker. </em>But Panozzo explicitly waived his right to that benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM Panozzo\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
