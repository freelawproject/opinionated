We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 &amp; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-15\">The defendant argues that the Sixth Amendment requires that a jury find beyond a reasonable doubt whether he suffered a 2001 California drug conviction. He argues that <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) does not control because he did not admit the conviction during his guilty plea and that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is no longer good law after the <em>Apprendi </em>line of cases. We already have rejected these arguments. <em>See United States v. Weiland, </em>420 F.3d 1062, 1079-80 <em>&amp; </em>n. 16 (9th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1911, 164 L.Ed.2d 667 (2006); <em>United States v. Moreno-Hernandez, </em>419 F.3d 906, 914 n. 8 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 636, 163 L.Ed.2d 515 (2005); <em>United States v. Arellano-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d 1119, 1127 (9th Cir.2001); <em>see also United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 244, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-20\">The defendant also argues that a jury must find whether the conviction qualifies as an \u201caggravated felon/\u2019 pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) and a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). However, we have held that this is not a jury question, but a question of law for the court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Brown, </em>417 F.3d 1077, 1079 (9th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Benitez-Perez, </em>367 F.3d 1200, 1203 (9th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Arellano-Torres, </em>303 F.3d 1173, 1177 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>The defendant also argues that the district court erroneously increased the statutory maximum sentence pursuant to \u00a7 1326(b)(2) and increased his base offense level 16 levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) because the subsequent removals were accomplished with reinstatement of prior removal orders. This claim is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Luna-Madellaga, </em>315 F.3d 1224, 1226 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b929-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b929-14\">. The defendant did not argue to the district court and does not argue on appeal that his state drug conviction was not an aggravated felony or drug trafficking offense. In any event, any error would be harmless. Because the district court sentenced the defendant to fewer than 10 years incarceration, it only needed to find under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) that the conviction was a felony, which it did.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
