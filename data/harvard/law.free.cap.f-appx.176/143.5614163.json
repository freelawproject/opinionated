Isasi v. Herbert, </em>Nos. 01-CV-1804, 03-CV-2912, 2004 WL 1727325 (E.D.N.Y. June 16, 2004). In support of his petition, Isasi claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>that a highly inculpatory oral statement that he made to the police was taken in violation of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), and that this violation tainted his subsequent written confession. <em>Isasi </em>2004 WL 1727325, at *6. We assume familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and scope of the issues on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court judgment denying <em>habeas </em>relief. <em>See, e.g., Sanchez v. Duncan, </em>282 F.3d 78, 81 (2d Cir.2002). We overturn a state court determination on the merits only if the state court reached \u201ca decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law ... [or] a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\"><em>Miranda </em>warnings are not required unless law enforcement agents interrogate a person who is in custody. <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602; <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>966 F.2d 92, 98 (2d Cir.1992). Even if a suspect is in custody, the police are required to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings only when the police engage in interrogation or its \u201cfunctional equivalent,\u201d i.e., \u201cexpress questioning, [as well as] ... any words or actions on the part of the police ... that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980)(footnote omitted). Further, when a defendant has made a statement without having been given prior <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and <em>Miranda </em>warnings are then administered, \u201cthe admissibility of any subsequent statement would turn ... solely on whether it is knowingly and voluntarily made.\u201d <em>Oregon v. Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298, 309, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 84 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">As to Isasi\u2019s initial statements to Detective Jorge Sanchez, Isasi argues that they were obtained in violation of <em>Miranda, </em>because he was handcuffed, in custody, and surrounded by law enforcement personnel in a Mexican police office. The state court credited the testimony of Detective Sanchez that he did not ask Isasi any questions during this time and only informed Isasi that he was there to talk to him about an incident that occurred in College Point, New York, in January 1995. Such \u201cdetermination[s] of ... factual issued] ... shall be presumed to be correct.\u201d \u00a7 2254(d). The mere fact of police presence in a police office is not the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of express questioning. <em>See Arizona v. Mauro, </em>481 U.S. 520, 528, 107 S.Ct. 1931, 95 L.Ed.2d 458 (1987). Moreover, the fact that Detective Sanchez stated that he knew what had happened in College Point and Isasi\u2019s real name does not mean that Isasi\u2019s statements were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>voluntary. <em>See Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 291, 100 S.Ct. 1682. Significantly, the state court found as a matter of fact that Isasi \u201cblurted\u201d out his statement to the detective and that his statement was \u201cspontaneous\u201d and not \u201ctriggered by police conduct which should reasonably have been anticipated to evoke a declaration from the defendant.\u201d <em>People v. Isasi, </em>265 A.D.2d 426, 697 N.Y.S.2d 297 (1999). We see no basis for concluding that these factual determinations were unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Isasi also contends that his second statement, taken after he had been given <em>Miranda </em>warnings, should not have been admitted into evidence on the ground that it was the fruit of the prior, allegedly unlawful, interrogation. The Supreme Court has expressly rejected this theory under which, once an incriminating statement has been made, no subsequent confession can be truly voluntary. <em>Oregon v. Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298, 311-314, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 84 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">The relevant inquiry is whether, in fact, the second statement was also voluntarily made.... No further purpose is served by imputing \u201ctaint\u201d to subsequent statements obtained pursuant to a voluntary and knowing waiver. We hold today that a suspect who has once responded to unwarned yet uneoercive questioning is not thereby disabled from waiving his rights and confessing after he has been given the requisite <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 318, 105 S.Ct. 1285 (footnote omitted). Here, no evidence has been presented to indicate that the questioning of Isasi was coercive or that his statements were otherwise involuntary. Therefore, we see no reason not to defer to the state court\u2019s determination that, after the administration of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, Isasi knowingly and intelligently waived his rights and made a voluntary written statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">Furthermore, in light of the overwhelming evidence of guilt and the fact that Isasi made a complete, detailed written confession after the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, the admission of his pre-warning statement, even if inappropriate, was harmless error. <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 637-38, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (on collateral habeas review, \u201cconstitutional error of the trial type\u201d is harmless unless it had \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict\u201d); <em>Nova v. Bartlett, </em>211 F.3d 705, 709 (2d Cir.2000)(admission of statement given in violation of <em>Miranda </em>harmless error where statement is cumulative of properly admitted evidence). Thus, the state court\u2019s decision to not suppress this statement was a reasonable application of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">We have considered the petitioner\u2019s remaining contentions and have found them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court denying Isasi\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b172-7\">. The District Court granted a certificate of appealability only with respect to whether the detective's introduction of himself to petitioner while petitioner was in Mexico constituted an interrogation, and, if so, whether it tainted petitioner\u2019s subsequent statements made after he was given <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
