Wood, Bogga, Wood &amp; Associates, LLP, Birmingham, AL, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b29-13\">Before ANDERSON, BIRCH and HILL, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b29-14\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b29-15\">Christopher Edward Persall appeals his seventy (70) month sentence for possession of child pornography, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B), receipt of child pornography, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(2)(A), and possession of child pornography under Section 2252A(a)(5)(B)(as amended).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The sole issue raised on appeal by Persall is a <em>Booker </em>issue, i.e., that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence in excess of the guidelines range for his crime by using facts not admitted to by him and not found by a jury. <em>U.S. v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-19\">This issue is entirely without merit as Persall was sentenced on April 21, 2005, under the <em>post-Booker </em>advisory guidelines and not the <em>pre-Booker </em>mandatory guidelines system.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After <em>Booker, </em>\u201cthe use of extra-verdict enhancements in an advisory guidelines system is not unconstitutional.\u201d <em>United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1323 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-20\">Therefore, Persall\u2019s argument fails under the precedent of this circuit. <em>See also United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1304-05 (11th Cir.2005). Finding no error, the sentencing judgment of the district court as to Persall is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b29-16\">. Although counts one and two addressed the same crime under Section 2252A(a)(5)(B), Persall\u2019s possession occurred both before and after a statutory amendment that lengthened the maximum statutory penalty for the crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Ayk\">. In sentencing him, the district court expressly stated that sentence was imposed under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, as modified by the Supreme Court decision in <em>Booker. </em>R6-16.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
