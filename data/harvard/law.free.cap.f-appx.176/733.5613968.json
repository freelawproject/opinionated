We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence an adverse credibility finding and will uphold the IJ\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 992-93 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-20\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of Singh\u2019s claims on the basis of an adverse credibility finding. Singh\u2019s documentary evidence was inconsistent with his testimony regarding several significant aspects of his claim. <em>See Pal v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 935, 938 (9th Cir.2000) (stating that documents submitted by petitioner which contradict petitioner\u2019s testimony may form the basis for an adverse credibility finding). Moreover, the IJ cited specific, cogent reasons for doubting Singh\u2019s Sikh identity, which Singh claims to be the motivation for his past and probable future persecution, and thus also supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-21\">Because Singh failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b761-22\">Because Singh\u2019s claim under the CAT is based on the same testimony that the IJ found not credible, and he points to no other evidence that he could claim the IJ should have considered in making its determination under CAT, his CAT claim also fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"A7_\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
