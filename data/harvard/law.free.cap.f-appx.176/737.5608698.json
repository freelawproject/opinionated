We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Mitchell v. Dupnik, </em>75 F.3d 517, 521 (9th Cir.1996), and we may affirm on any basis supported by the record, <em>United States v. Washington, </em>969 F.2d 752, 755 (9th Cir. 1992). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">The district court did not err when it granted summary judgment in favor of defendants because Cardenas did not present evidence that any of the named defendants made the determination to send him to disciplinary segregation without a hearing on December 22,1998. <em>See Redman v. County of San Diego, </em>942 F.2d 1435, 1446, 1449 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">Regarding the December 25, 1998 incident, Cardenas did not name the correctional officers involved in the incident and did not make a sufficient showing under <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994), to demonstrate that the members of the Jail\u2019s classification board could be hable.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-14\">Regarding the December 30, 1998 incident and the January 6, 1999 proceeding, Cardenas did not offer evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the Jail hearing officials refused to permit him to call witnesses. <em>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Cardenas also contends that he was improperly placed in disciplinary segregation prior to the January 6, 1999 hearing, but he did not name the officer who made the determination to segregate him without a hearing. <em>See Redman, </em>942 F.2d at 1446.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-15\">Regarding the January 30 and August 9, 1999 proceedings, we are not persuaded by Cardenas\u2019 contention that officials violated his rights when they refused to tape record the proceedings. <em>See Mitchell, </em>75 F.3d at 526 (finding no violation when prison officials refused to record a disciplinary hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-16\">Regarding the August 9, 1999 proceeding, Cardenas did not offer evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the officials at the hearing refused to consider his five-page statement. <em>See Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-17\">Cardenas\u2019 remaining contentions, including those regarding failure to train and supervise, and judicial bias, are also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b767-12\">This disposition, is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
