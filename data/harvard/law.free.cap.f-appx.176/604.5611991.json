Osorio was sentenced to a 71-month term of imprisonment and to a three-year period of supervised release. Osorio gave timely notice of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-18\">Osorio challenges the constitutionality of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The Government argues that the waiver provision in Osorio\u2019s plea agreement precludes his attack on the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b). The Government argues that as a result of the waiver Osorio lacks standing to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-23\">The waiver-of-appeal provision is construed against the Government as the drafter of the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Somner, </em>127 F.3d 405, 408 (5th Cir.1997). Because Osorio\u2019s plea agreement does not specifically waive the right to attack the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b), we conclude that the waiver provision does not preclude this appeal. <em>See id. </em>Because Osorio would be entitled to a lesser sentence if his constitutional challenge were successful, he has standing. <em>See Henderson v. Stalder, </em>287 F.3d 374, 380 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-24\">Osorio\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), in which the Supreme Court held that treatment of prior convictions as sentencing factors in \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) was constitutional. Although Osorio contends that a majority of the Supreme Court would now consider <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>to be incorrectly decided in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>\u201c[tjhis court has repeatedly rejected arguments like the one made by [Osorio] and has held that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding despite <em>Apprendi.\u201d United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Osorio concedes as much, but he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>raises the argument to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b632-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
