Jordan appeals the decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board, which dismissed his appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Jordan v. Dep\u2019t of the Air Force, </em>SF3443040747-I-1 (MSPB Aug. 29, 2005). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">This court may only reverse a board\u2019s decision if it was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or unlawful; procedurally deficient; or unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c). Whether the board has jurisdiction over an appeal is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>See Herman v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>193 F.3d 1375, 1378 (Fed.Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Jordan had the burden to establish the board\u2019s jurisdiction by presenting evidence that he was an eligible civilian federal employee entitled to appeal to the board under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (codified as amended at 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4301-4333) (\u201cUSERRA\u201d). Although aware his status as a \u201ccivilian employee\u201d was at issue, Jordan failed to present any evidence that he was a civilian employee of the Air Force. His military medical history was not relevant to that question. We find no error in the board\u2019s factual determinations and conclude that the board lacked jurisdiction over the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
