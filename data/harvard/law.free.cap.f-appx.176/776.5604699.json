Siler, Jr., Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b805-11\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-12\">Petitioner Rudolfo Garcia seeks habeas relief from his conviction of four counts of child molestation and sentence of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. The facts and procedural history are known the parties, and we do not recount them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-13\">First, we reject Garcia\u2019s claim that the trial court\u2019s admission of prior videotaped testimony by Garcia\u2019s two stepdaughters violated his Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause rights, because it was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). In <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 59 n. 9, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), the Supreme Court concluded that \u201cwhen the declarant appears for cross-examination at trial, the Confrontation Clause places no constraints at all on the use of his prior testimonial statements.\u201d Here, both declarants testified at trial and were subject to cross-examination by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-17\">Second, we reject Garcia\u2019s claim that trial counsel\u2019s failure to present character testimony was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), and its progeny. The state trial court concluded that counsel\u2019s decision was a strategic choice, which is entitled to a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d of reasonable professional assistance. <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Counsel faced an inherent risk of unfavorable character evidence being offered in rebuttal against the presentment of a favorable character witness. <em>See Brodit v. Cambra, </em>350 F.3d 985, 992-93 (9th Cir.2003) (concluding that state court determination that failure to present expert testimony on defendant\u2019s personality was a strategic decision to avoid damaging character rebuttal evidence was not objectively unreasonable). Accordingly, Garcia has failed to demonstrate that counsel\u2019s conduct was objectively unreasonable. The district court\u2019s denial of Garcia\u2019s petition is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"ADES\"> disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
