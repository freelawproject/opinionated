Jimmerson appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The district court held that the California Court of Appeals\u2019 determination that Jimmerson\u2019s confession was voluntary was not an unreasonable application of federal law. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-23\">Under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Jimmerson cannot prevail unless he shows that the state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented at the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), (2). This Jimmerson cannot do.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">The California Court of Appeal reasonably determined that Inspector Hendrix made no improper threats or promises and that, considering the totality of the circumstances, Jimmerson\u2019s confession was voluntary. <em>See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 225-26, 98 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973). Hendrix\u2019s \u201cguarantee\u201d that confessing would make a difference in Jimmerson\u2019s case was not \u201csufficiently compelling to overbear [Jimmerson\u2019s] will in light of all attendant circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Leon Guerrero, </em>847 F.2d 1363, 1366 (9th Cir.1988). After carefully considering the interrogation in its entirety, including Jimmerson\u2019s repeated statements that he wanted to talk to Hendrix about the shooting, we hold that the state court\u2019s decision was not an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent. Therefore, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b872-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
