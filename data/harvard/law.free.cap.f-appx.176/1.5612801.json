On appeal, Haque argues that the district court erred by denying his motion for continuance after he filed a labor certification with the DOL, which was pending at the time of the removal proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Haque urges us to re-examine our decision in <em>Zafar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>426 F.3d 1330 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>(llth Cir.2005), which he recognizes is identical in all material respects to his case. More specifically, he suggests error in our <em>Zafar </em>opinion because we did not address <em>Subhan v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 591 (7th Cir.2004), in which the Seventh Circuit reversed the IJ\u2019s removal order after the IJ denied the petitioners\u2019 motion for a third continuance. We decline his invitation since, pursuant to our prior-precedent rule, we must follow <em>Zafar </em>and deny his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">\u201cThe grant of a continuance is within the immigration judges\u2019 broad discretion,\u201d and, therefore, we review denials of continuance for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Zafar, </em>426 F.3d at 1335. As we explained in <em>Zafar:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-6\">Section 245(i) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(l), permits a certain class of aliens who were otherwise <em>ineligible </em>to adjust their temporary resident status in the United States to pay a penalty fee for adjusting their status to that of a \u2018permanent resident\u2019 and be considered \u2018grandfathered\u2019 into the United States, if he is the \u2018beneficiary\u2019 of an application for labor certification that was properly filed by April 30, 2001, and was \u2018approvable when filed.\u2019 INA \u00a7 245(i)(l), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.10(a)(l)(i)(B). \u2018Approvable when filed means that, as of the date of the filing,\u2019 the application for labor certification was \u2018properly filed, meritorious in fact, and non-frivolous ... \u2019 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.10(a)(3). Once the Attorney General receives the application for adjustment of status and the appropriate fee, he \u2018may\u2019 adjust the status if the alien \u2018is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible,\u2019 and \u2018an immigrant visa is immediately available to the alien at the time the application is filed.\u2019 INA 245(i)(2), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(2). An immigrant visa cannot, however, be issued to the alien until the labor certification is approved. INA \u00a7 203(b)(3)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(5).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 1335-36 (emphasis in the original). We further held that because the petitioners were not certain to receive a labor certification, they could not demonstrate \u201cthat they had a visa petition immediately available to them,\u201d and, therefore, the IJ did not abuse his discretion in denying their motions to continue their removal proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 1336.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">Here, like the petitioner in <em>Zafar, </em>Haque was not certain to receive a labor certificate at the time of his request for a continuance. According to our well-established prior-precedent rule, \u201c[o]nly the Supreme Court or this Court sitting <em>en bane </em>can judicially override a prior panel decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Wright, </em>392 F.3d 1269, 1280 (11th Cir.2004) (internal quotations and citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 968, 125 S.Ct. 1751, 161 L.Ed.2d 615 (2005); <em>Walker v. Southern Co. Serv., Inc., </em>279 F.3d 1289, 1293-94 (11th Cir.2002) (stating \u201cthe law of this circuit is \u2018emphatic\u2019 that only the Supreme Court or this court sitting <em>en banc </em>can judicially overrule a prior panel decision.\u201d (citation omitted)). Thus, pursuant to <em>Zafar, </em>we find no abuse of discretion in the IJ\u2019s denial of Haque\u2019s motion for a continuance, pending the issuance of a labor certification.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b30-12\">. Haque asks us to reinstate his period for voluntary departure, which expired on July 24, 2005, pursuant to the BIA's decision granting a 30-day extension running from the date of its decision. We cannot grant his request because we lack jurisdiction to do so. Haque did not file a motion to <em>stay </em>prior to expiration of his time for voluntary departure. <em>See Bocova v. Gonzales, </em>412 F.3d 257, 267-68 (1st Cir.2005) (holding that \"petitioners must file a motion for a stay <em>before </em>the expiration of the period of voluntary departure allotted by the BIA\u201d (emphasis added)). And we have held that we lack jurisdictional authority to grant an <em>extension </em>of the voluntary-departure period. <em>See Nkacoang v. I.N.S., </em>83 F.3d 353, 357 (11th Cir.1996). <em>Nkacoang </em>was decided prior to the effective date of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), but the amendments did not provide us with appellate authority to grant or extend voluntary departure. <em>See generally, </em>INA \u00a7\u00a7 240B(f), 242(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229c\u00ae, 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae; <em>see also Bocova, </em>412 F.3d at 266 (post-IIRIRA) (\"Reinstating an expired voluntary departure period is functionally equivalent to fashioning a new voluntary departure period; doing so would require the court to dictate both the length of the period and the time when it would begin to run (thus effectively overriding the Attorney General\u2019s decision). That would be an impermissible circumvention of Congress\u2019s will.\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b31-7\">. Moreover, even if we could reconsider <em>Zafar, </em>which it is plain we cannot, Haque's reliance on the <em>Subhan </em>decision is misplaced as that case is readily distinguishable. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number><em>Snbhan, </em>the IJ granted the petitioners two continuances in an attempt to allow the pending certification to be processed by the Department of Labor, but after the second continuance expired, the IJ summarily denied a third. <em>Subhan, </em>383 F.3d at 593. The Seventh Circuit held that because the IJ gave absolutely no reason for his denial, it was erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 595. We observe that in Haque's case, the IJ <em>did </em>explain his reasoning for the denial, choosing to follow the \"general rule ... that you do not continue cases to allow forms of relief which are not presently mature to become so.\u201d The IJ's ruling was entirely consistent with our <em>Zafar </em>decision, which we are bound to follow.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
