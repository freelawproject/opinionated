We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review constitutional and legal questions de novo. <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-26\">The BIA properly determined that Tarango-Rojero knowingly and intelligently waived his statutory right to be represented by counsel of his choice, where the IJ informed Tarango-Rojero of his right to counsel, asked him whether he wanted a continuance, and Tarango-Rojero responded that he wanted to represent himself. <em>See Tawadrus v. Ashcroft, 364 </em>F.3d 1099, 1103 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-27\">Even if the IJ gave Tarango-Rojero insufficient time to seek relief from his crim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>inal conviction, Tarango-Rojero\u2019s due process contention fails because he has not demonstrated he was prejudiced by the IJ\u2019s actions. <em>See Halaim v. INS, </em>358 F.3d 1128, 1136 (9th Cir.2004) (holding petitioner must show prejudice to prevail on due process claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b923-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9 th Cir.
