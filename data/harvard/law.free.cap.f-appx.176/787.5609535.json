We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing due process claims de novo, <em>Vasquez-Zavala v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 1105, 1107 (9th Cir.2003), and the agency\u2019s factual findings for substantial evidence, <em>Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 971 n. 16 (9th Cir.1998), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">We have jurisdiction to review whether the agency violated Ahmed\u2019s due process rights in denying her asylum application as untimely. <em>See Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>427 F.3d 1218, 1221 (9th Cir. 2005). Ahmed\u2019s due process claim is unavailing because she did not show how the agency\u2019s alleged failure to allow her to explain why her application was untimely affected the outcome of her case, and thus failed to establish prejudice. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Ahmed failed to establish that the Australian government is unable or unwilling to control those who threatened her or may threaten her in Australia. As such, Ahmed has failed to meet her burden of establishing eligibility for withholding of removal to Australia. <em>See Reyes-Reyes v. Ashcroft, </em>384 F.3d 782, 788 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b816-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
