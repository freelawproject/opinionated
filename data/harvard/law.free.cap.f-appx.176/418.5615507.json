See Local Rule 86(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b447-8\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">James Lester Penniegraft pled guilty to conspiracy to commit loan, mail, wire, and bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (2000). He was sentenced to sixty months in prison. He now appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">Penniegraft claims that his sixty month sentence violates the rule announced in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because Penniegraft raised this Sixth Amendment claim below, our review is de novo. <em>See United States v. Mackins, </em>315 F.3d 399, 405 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">Penniegraft\u2019s base offense level was six. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2Bl.l(a)(2) (2004). At sentencing, the parties stipulated that: the amount of loss was more than $200,000 and not more than $400,000, for a twelve-level increase in Penniegraft\u2019s offense level, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(G); the offense involved ten or more victims, for an increase of two levels, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(A); and Penniegraft was an organizer or leader of the conspiracy, for a four-level increase, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). The court determined that Penniegraft had abused a position of trust and increased the offense level by two levels, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 3B1.3. Penniegraft\u2019s adjusted offense level therefore was 26. He received a three-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 3El.l(b), for a total offense level of 23. Penniegraft\u2019s criminal history category was III. His resulting guideline range was 57-71 months. Because of the statutory maximum penalty of five years, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, the range became 57-60 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">Penniegraft claims that the enhancement for abuse of position of trust violates the Sixth Amendment under <em>Booker. </em>Without the enhancement, Penniegraft\u2019s adjusted offense level would have been 24, and his guideline range would have been 63-78 months in prison. Because Penniegraft\u2019s sixty-month sentence does not exceed the maximum penalty authorized by the facts to which he stipulated, there was no Sixth Amendment violation requiring resentencing. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>416 F.3d 298, 300 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-14\">We accordingly affirm Penniegraft\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
