On March 27, 2005, we vacated Giraldo\u2019s sentence after concluding that the government had not met its burden to show that the district court\u2019s Booker<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> non-constitutional error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Giraldo, </em>132 Fed. App\u2019x 800 (11th Cir. 2005) <em>(\"Giraldo </em>/\u201d). Pursuant to our remand instructions in <em>Giraldo I, </em>the district court conducted a resentencing hearing at which the parties presented arguments on the applicability and effect of the sentencing factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Based on Giraldo\u2019s adjusted base offense level of 25 and his criminal history category I, he faced an advisory Guidelines range of 57 to 71 months\u2019 imprisonment, which, in <em>Giraldo I, </em>we noted the district court correctly determined. <em>Id. </em>at 806 n. 6. At the resentencing hearing, Giraldo argued that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors supported a three-year sentence because: (1) he was involved in the transportation of heroin, rather than its distribution, and therefore, he was less culpable; (2) he had no prior criminal history; (3) he had strong family ties and his children had been forced to discontinue their education as a result of his incarceration; (4) upon release from prison, he likely would face deportation to Colombia; and (5) a 3-year sentence would be sufficient to promote respect for the law given that he has never been imprisoned before. In addition to hearing these arguments, the district court reviewed a letter written by Giraldo\u2019s son and heard Giraldo\u2019s statement expressing his repentance and asking for forgiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">The government argued that a 57-month sentence was reasonable, in light of <em>Booker </em>and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, because the sentence was at the low end of the Guidelines range and Giraldo transported nearly one kilogram of heroin into the United States. The government also highlighted the importance of consistency among sentences for similar types of crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-13\">After hearing the parties\u2019 arguments and expressly acknowledging that the Guidelines were advisory in nature, the district court again sentenced Giraldo to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by three years\u2019 supervised release. The court indicated that it had considered the parties\u2019 statements, the PSI, and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). This appeal, <em>Giraldo II, </em>followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-14\">Based on our careful review of the record, and in particular the transcript of the resentencing hearing, we conclude that Giraldo\u2019s sentence was reasonable, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the advisory Guidelines range. The district court explicitly stated that it considered Giraldo\u2019s arguments from the resentencing hearing and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Contrary to Giraldo\u2019s argument on appeal, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>court was not required to enumerate or discuss, as part of its sentencing scheme, every \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir. 2005) (holding that although the district court must be guided by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d). \u201c[A]n acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker.\u201d United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Moreover, the district court sentenced Giraldo to the lowest end of the Guidelines range. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 878-88 (observing that although a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable). On this record, Giraldo has not met his burden to establish that his sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b112-10\">. <em>United States v.
