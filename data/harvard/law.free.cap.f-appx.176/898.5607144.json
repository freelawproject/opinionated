The action arose out of a search of her house on January 29, 2002. On January 1, 2003\u2014after Dela Torre had filed her claim but before the one-year statute of limitations on the claim had run\u2014the California legislature changed the statute of limitations to two years. After the expiration of the one-year period but before the expiration of the two-year period, Dela Torre sought to amend the complaint to add new claims against new officials. The magistrate judge denied the motion, holding that the two-year statute of limitations did not apply so the claims were time-barred. We agreed to hear this interlocutory appeal, and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-21\">Finding no state authority, the magistrate judge relied on <em>Abreu v. Ramirez,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a decision of the Central District of Califor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>n\u00eda. That decision holds that the controlling limitations period is the one \u201cin effect at the time a claim accrues.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After the magistrate decided this case, however, the California Court of Appeals expressly rejected <em>Abreu </em>in <em>Andonagui v. May Department Stores.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Instead, the <em>Andonagui </em>court held that state Supreme Court precedent required that \u201ca new statute that enlarges a statutory limitations period applies to actions that are not already barred by the original limitations period <em>at the time the new statute goes into effect.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Dela Torre still had 28 days left on her original one-year limitations period when the new statute went into effect. Thus, the magistrate judge abused his discretion in denying the motion to amend, even though his reliance on <em>Abreu </em>was reasonable at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b927-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
