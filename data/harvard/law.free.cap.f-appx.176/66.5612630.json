Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We previously affirmed Appellant\u2019s 60-month sentence for conspiracy to commit bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371 and 1344. <em>See United States v. Singer, </em>152 Fed.Appx. 869 (11th Cir.2005) (Table) (unpublished). We asked for, and have received, supplemental briefs from the parties on the effect of <em>Booker </em>on this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-18\">In his initial brief, Singer argued the district court erred by (1) denying his motion for judgment of acquittal because the government presented insufficient evidence to show that federally-insured banks, as opposed to non-bank entities, were the actual or intended victims of the criminal scheme; (2) miscalculating the fraud-loss amount under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(l); (3) assessing a four-level leadership-role enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a); (4) applying a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(5)(C) for the use of a means of identification to unlawfully produce other means of identification; and (5) ordering that restitution be paid to the defrauded merchants. Notably, Singer raised no error based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or any other case extending or applying the <em>Apprendi </em>principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-19\">In <em>United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>533 U.S. 962, 121 S.Ct. 2621, 150 L.Ed.2d 774 (2001), after the Supreme Court\u2019s remand with instructions to reconsider our opinion in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we observed the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUN\">Nothing in the <em>Apprendi </em>opinion requires or suggests that we are obligated to consider an issue not raised in any of the briefs that appellant has filed with us. Nor is there anything in the Supreme Court\u2019s remand order, which is cast in the usual language, requiring that we treat the case as though the <em>Apprendi </em>issue had been timely raised in this Court. In the absence of any requirement to the contrary in either <em>Apprendi </em>or in the order remanding this case to us, we apply our well-established rule that issues and contentions not timely raised in the briefs are deemed abandoned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 990 (citations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Nealy, </em>282 F.3d 825, 830 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201cDefendant abandoned the <em>[Apprendi </em>] indictment issue by not raising the issue in his initial brief.\u201d). We have extended the foregoing rule to preclude untimely challenges based on <em>Booker. See United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261, 1263 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">In his initial brief in this case, Singer asserted no such <em>Apprendi </em>(or its progeny) challenge to his sentence. Moreover, he points to no authority, and we have found none, that would allow us not to follow our \u201cwell-established rule that issues and contentions not timely raised in the briefs are deemed abandoned\u201d in the instant case. <em>See Ardley, </em>242 F.3d at 990. Accordingly, we reinstate our October 14, 2005 opinion in this case and affirm, once again, Singer\u2019s conviction and sentence after our reconsideration in light of <em>Booker, </em>pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\"><em>OPINION </em>REINSTATED; SENTENCE AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
