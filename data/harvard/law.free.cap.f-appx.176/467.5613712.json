Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), a claim that his sentence exceeds the applicable statutory-maximum. Further, he argues that because <em>Blakely </em>was not applicable at the time of his waiver, it was impossible for him to make a valid waiver of his rights under <em>Blakely. </em>The Government disagrees and seeks to enforce the appellate-waiver provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">The record reflects that Hurtado-Aguilar knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his sentence. <em>See United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746 (5th Cir.2005). Hurtado-Aguilar\u2019s sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum. <em>See United States v. Cortez, </em>413 F.3d 502, 503 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 502, 163 L.Ed.2d 365 (2005); <em>United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 545-46 (5th Cir.2005). Further, the fact that <em>Blakely </em>and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), were decided after Hurtado-Aguilar entered his guilty plea does not invalidate the otherwise valid plea. <em>See United States v. Burns, </em>433 F.3d 442, 450-51 (5th Cir.2005). Therefore, Hurtado-Aguilar\u2019s claims are barred by the appellate-waiver provision in his plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b495-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
