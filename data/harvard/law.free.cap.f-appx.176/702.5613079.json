We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-18\">While on supervised release, Zimmerman admittedly tested positive for methamphetamine on five different occasions. Noting the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g)(4) (if defendant, as part of drug testing, tests positive for illegal controlled substance more than 3 times over course of 1 year, court shall revoke supervised release and require defendant to serve term of imprisonment), the district court revoked Zimmerman\u2019s supervised release and sentenced him to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment and 18 months\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-19\">On appeal, Zimmerman argues that the district court failed to consider whether he qualified for a substance-abuse treatment option as an exception to mandatory revocation. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d) (court shall consider whether availability of appropriate substance-abuse treatment programs, or individual\u2019s current or past participation in such programs, warrants exception in accordance with Guidelines from rule of \u00a7 3583(g) when considering any action against defendant who fails drug test). We reject this argument. At sentencing, the district court asked the parties for their views as to whether they would dispute the application of the mandatory revocation provision. Based on their responses, which revealed that Zimmerman\u2019s drug problem took a turn for the worse while he was at a low-security facility and during his supervised release, and that he failed to benefit from the treatment that was provided to him, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>court imposed an 18-month prison sentence which would allow him to participate in a long-term residential drug-treatment program while confined. We conclude the court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See United States v. Hammonds, 370 </em>F.3d 1032, 1038-39 (10th Cir.2004) (standard of review; finding no abuse of discretion where court did not make specific ruling rejecting application of \u00a7 3583(d), because there was no indication court did not recognize its power to grant exception: at sentencing defendant requested order directing treatment rather than revocation, government noted defendant\u2019s poor record in treatment programs, and court ordered revocation with in-prison treatment); <em>cf. United States v. Pierce, </em>132 F.3d 1207, 1207-09 (8th Cir.1997) (remanding where district court\u2019s statements at revocation hearing cast doubt on whether it realized it could order drug treatment as alternative to revocation).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-14\">. The Honorable Linda R. Reade, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
