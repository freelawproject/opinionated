(\u201cPetitioner\u201d), appeals the decision of the United States Tax Court, upholding Respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue\u2019s determination that Robert E. Kovacevich was an \u201cemployee\u201d of Petitioner and, thus, that certain amounts paid to Kovacevich were \u201cwages\u201d subject to taxation under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (\u201cFICA\u201d) and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (\u201cFUTA\u201d), as well as income tax withholding under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3402(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">Based on the record before us, we conclude as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">1. The Tax Court did not clearly err in finding that Mr. Kovacevich was a \u201cstatutory employee\u201d of Petitioner under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3121(d)(1). The services that Mr. Kovacevich performed for Petitioner are virtually analogous to those performed by the attorney/offieer in <em>Van Camp &amp; Bennion v. United States, </em>251 F.3d 862, 866 (9th Cir.2001), in that Kovacevich \u201cexercised sole authority to make major corporate decisions\u201d such as paying creditors, signing checks, signing the corporation\u2019s Federal tax returns and drawing money from corporate accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-16\">2. Mr. Kovacevich is not exempt from classification as an \u201cemployee\u201d of Petitioner by virtue of the operation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3121(c). As the Tax Court noted, that Section prevents an employee\u2019s services (and wages derived therefrom) from triggering tax liability under the FICA if more than half of the services performed do not constitute \u201cemployment.\u201d \u201cEmployment\u201d is broadly defined by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3121(b)(1) as \u201cany service, of whatever nature, performed ... by an employee for the person employing him.\u201d Clearly, the services performed by Mr. Kovacevich on behalf of Petitioner fell within this definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-17\">3. The mere fact that Mr. Kovacevich \u201chad a substantial investment in the facilities used\u201d in the performance of his services on behalf of Petitioner\u2014i.e., that he personally owned all of the tangible assets of the law office\u2014does not remove him from the statutory definition of \u201cemployee.\u201d Based on the plain language of the statute, an individual\u2019s \u201csubstantial investment\u201d in the facilities used for the performance of services operates to remove that individual from the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d <em>only </em>if he or she is classified as an \u201cemployee\u201d under subsection (d)(3) of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3121, not subsection (d)(1), as the Tax Court found and we uphold.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-18\">4. The payments made to Kovacevich by Petitioner were clearly payments for \u201cservices rendered\u201d and, thus, indisputably constituted \u201cwages\u201d for the purposes of both the FICA and the FUTA. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401(a). Petitioner wrote checks to Mr. Kovacevich, his wife (Yvonne Ko<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>vacevich), and their creditors directly from its corporate account, the monies in which were derived entirely from Mr. Kovacevich\u2019s provision of legal services. Most significantly, Petitioner deducted these payments on its tax returns as \u201cofficer compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">5. Petitioner has waived, for the purposes of this appeal, the issue of whether Petitioner was otherwise relieved from tax liability (under both the FICA and FUTA) pursuant to Section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978, Pub.L. 95-600, 92 Stat. 2885 (1978), as its briefs contain no mention of Section 530 or the relief it provides. <em>See, e.g., Indep. Towers of Wash. v. Washington, </em>350 F.3d 925, 929 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201c[W]e review only issues which are argued specifically and distinctly in a party\u2019s opening brief.\u201d) (internal citation and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">6. The Tax Court did not err in adopting Respondent\u2019s Rule 155 Calculations regarding the amount of \u201cSocial Security\u201d (OASDI) tax assessed, as they were not in excess of the permissible wage base under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">7. The Tax Court did not err in adopting Respondent\u2019s Rule 155 Calculations regarding the amount of FICA taxes owed, regardless of whether Kovacevichs paid self-employment taxes equivalent to the amounts owed. Congress has provided a separate procedure by which an individual subsequently determined to be an \u201cemployee\u201d of an outside entity may seek a credit or refund of self-employment taxes already paid. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6511(d)(7). Under this provision, the employer (i.e., Petitioner) remains the liable party.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">8. The Tax Court did not err in adopting Respondent\u2019s Rule 155 Calculations regarding the amount of FUTA taxes owed. While 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6201(b)(2) prohibits the Commissioner from assessing unpaid FUTA taxes on a <em>quarterly </em>basis, such an assessment is proper once the taxpayer has filed its annual return.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">9. The Tax Court did not err in reopening the record subsequent to the passage of the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000 (\u201cCRTRA\u201d), Pub.L. 106-554 sec. 314(f), 114 Stat. 2763A-643 (2000). The Court\u2019s October 14, 1999 order dismissing Petitioner\u2019s petition \u201cinsofar as it pertains to <em>amounts </em>of employment taxes and related additions to the tax\u201d was not a \u201cfinal\u201d decision, because it was not dispositive of the entire ease. Thus, the statute of limitations did not bar the Tax Court <em>from </em>reopening the record to determine the exact amount of taxes owed, pursuant to the retroactive conferral of jurisdiction under the CRTRA</p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">10. The Tax Court\u2019s denial of Petitioner\u2019s June 21, 2001 discovery motion was clearly within its discretion, as the information sought to be discovered thereby\u2014i.e., Tax Court members\u2019 participation in the legislative process leading up to the passage of the CRTRA\u2014was not relevant to any of the issues before it. <em>Accord River City Ranches #1 Ltd. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>401 F.3d 1136, 1139 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201cWe will hold an order denying discovery to be an abuse of discretion only \u2018upon the clearest showing that denial of discovery results in actual and substantial prejudice to the complaining litigant.\u2019\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">11. The Tax Court did not err in granting Respondent\u2019s motion, made at the 2002 trial, to incorporate the record from the trial of Robert E. and Yvonne Kovacevich in the related case of <em>Kovacevich v. Comm\u2019r, </em>Tax Ct. No. 99-12815, into the record in this case. Petitioner cites no authority in support of its argument and, as the Tax Court noted, it did not timely object below.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-13\">12. The Tax Court did not err in failing to shift the burden of proof on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>issue of substantiation of the amount of the deficiencies owed from Petitioner to Respondent, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7491(a)(1). That Section only applies to taxes imposed under subtitles A and B of the I.R.C.; the employment taxes at issue here are imposed under subtitle C.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">13. The Tax Court did not err in failing to dismiss the case due to the inadequacy of the Notice of Determination itself. Pursuant to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Scar v. Comm\u2019r, </em>814 F.2d 1363 (9th Cir. 1987), a deficiency notice will generally be valid if it considers \u201cinformation that relates to a particular taxpayer,\u201d including information reported on the taxpayer\u2019s returns. <em>Scar, </em>814 F.2d at 1368. In this case, the Commissioner determined Petitioner\u2019s employment tax deficiencies by referring to the amounts that Petitioner deducted as \u201cofficer compensation\u201d on its 1994 and 1995 returns. Thus, consistent with <em>Scar, </em>the notice was adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">14. The final issue before the Court is whether, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3402(d), Petitioner should not be held hable for income tax withholding, to the extent that the Kovacevichs paid personal income tax with respect to the wages at issue for the years in question. Respondent concedes that, to the extent that the Kovacevichs indeed paid income tax on the wages at issue, it cannot, under \u00a7 3402(d), collect withholding taxes on those same wages from Petitioner. However, the record contains no findings from the Tax Court concerning the applicability of \u00a7 3402(d), such that we cannot determine whether the Tax Court properly considered the issue in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the decision of the Tax Court in all respects except with regard to its calculations of the amount of income tax withholding owed under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3402(a). We remand to the Tax Court for consideration of the narrow issue of whether 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3402(d) provides Petitioner with any relief from the collection of those taxes and, if so, for recalculation of the amounts owed. <em>Cf. Estate of Cartwright v. Comm\u2019r, </em>183 F.3d 1034, 1038 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">AFFIRMED in part; REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b808-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b810-11\">RAWLINSON, Circuit Judge, concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"b810-12\">I concur in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
