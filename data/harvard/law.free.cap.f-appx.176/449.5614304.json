He argues that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by imposing a sentence based on the court\u2019s findings that the offense involved more marijuana than he admitted in his factual basis and that he was a leader or organizer in the offense. He argues that his sentence should be vacated in view of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court granted a certificate of appealability on the issue \u201c[wjhether the holding in <em>Booker </em>applies retroactively to a \u00a7 2255 collateral attack of a sentence.\u201d We have now held that <em>Booker </em>is not retroactively applicable to an initial \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>United States v. Gentry, </em>432 F.3d 600, 604-05 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b477-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
