Mr. Garcia was convicted after a guilty plea of unlawfully reentering the United States after a conviction of an aggravated felony, a violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a)(1), (2), and (b)(2). The district court sentenced him to 46 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-15\">Mr. Garcia now argues that the district court\u2019s reliance on a prior conviction to enhance his sentence violated his Sixth Amendment rights under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because the government did not allege the prior conviction in the indictment and did not submit to the jury the issue of existence of the prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-16\">In order to obtain a COA, Mr. Garcia must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). He may make this showing by demonstrating that \u201c \u2018reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-17\">Mr. Garcia has not made the necessary showing. As the district court observed, in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 246-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that a prior conviction is not an element of a \u00a7 1326 unlawful entry offense, and that, as a result, a prior conviction need not be alleged in the indictment. The Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Booker, Blakely, </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>have not altered this principle. Indeed, this circuit had held <em>post-Booker </em>that the existence and classification of prior convictions used to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>be charged in the indictment and submitted to a jury. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>401 F.3d 1220, 1224 (10th Cir.2005) (\u201c[W]e are bound by existing precedent to hold that the <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>exception to the rule announced in <em>Apprendi </em>and extended to the Guidelines in <em>Booker </em>remains good law____We therefore conclude that the government need not charge the \u2018fact\u2019 of a prior conviction in an indictment and submit it to a jury.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">Moreover, Mr. Garcia did not file a direct appeal and he may therefore not pursue this claim in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding. <em>See United States v. Cox, </em>83 F.3d 336, 341 (10th Cir.1996) (stating that, when a petitioner \u201cfails to raise an issue on direct appeal, he is barred from raising the issue in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding, unless he establishes either cause excusing the procedural default and prejudice resulting from the error, or a fundamental miscarriage of justice if the claim is not considered\u201d). Additionally, to the extent that his claim is based on <em>Booker, </em>we note that that case was decided after Mr. Garcia\u2019s conviction became final and that <em>\u201cBooker </em>does not apply retroactively on collateral review.\u201d <em>United States v. Bellamy, </em>411 F.3d 1182, 1188 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">Accordingly, we DENY Mr. Garcia\u2019s application for a COA and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
