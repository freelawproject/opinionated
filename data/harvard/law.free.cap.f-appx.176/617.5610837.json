The district court sentenced Jarman to 120 months of imprisonment on Count One and 60 months of imprisonment on Count Two, to be served consecutively. Jarman was also sentenced to concurrent three-year terms of supervised release. Despite Jarman\u2019s request \u201cthat no fine be imposed,\u201d the district court imposed a $50,000 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">The sole issue raised by Jarman on appeal is that the district court erred in imposing a fine. The Government agrees that the district court erred in imposing a fine. The Government requests that we vacate the fine, modify the judgment, and otherwise affirm Jarman\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Where, as in this case, the district court adopts a presentence report (PSR) showing limited or no ability to pay a fine, the Government must come forward with evidence showing that a defendant can, in fact, pay a fine before one can be imposed. <em>See United States v. Fair, </em>979 F.2d 1037, 1041 (5th Cir.1992). No such evidence was adduced in this case, and the district court did not make specific findings regarding Jarman\u2019s ability to pay a fine. Consequently, this court cannot uphold the district court\u2019s imposition of the fine. <em>See United States v. Hodges, </em>110 F.3d 250, 251 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Given our determination that the fine cannot be upheld, and in view of the Government\u2019s request that we modify the judgment rather than remand the issue of the fine to the district court, we hereby VACATE the $50,000 fine imposed on Jar-man and MODIFY the district court\u2019s judgment accordingly. As modified herein, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b645-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
