Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Ramirez-Perez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 1001 (9th Cir.2003). Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss this petition for review for lack of jurisdiction is granted. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 892 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Montero-Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>277 F.3d 1137, 1144 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-20\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal and voluntary departure confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) and <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-21\">DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b937-22\">PREGERSON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ak9\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-23\">I dissent. This case, and the sixty-four others like it filed today, will have an adverse effect on children born in the United States whose parent/parents are illegal immigrants. When a parent is de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>nied cancellation of removal, the government effectively deports the United States-born children of that parent. This unconscionable result violates due process because circumstances will force children to suffer de facto expulsion from the country of their birth or forego their constitutionally protected right to remain in this country with their family intact. <em>See, e.g., Moore v. City of E. Cleveland, </em>431 U.S. 494, 503-05, 97 S.Ct. 1932, 52 L.Ed.2d 531 (1977) (plurality opinion) (\u201cOur decisions establish that the Constitution protects the sanctity of the family precisely because the institution of the family is deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition.\u201d); <em>Stanley v. Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 (1972) (recognizing that \u201c[t]he integrity of the family unit has found protection in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">Furthermore, as a nation we should recognize that many children born of illegal immigrants serve and have served with honor and distinction in our military forces, and many have laid down their lives on the altar of freedom.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
