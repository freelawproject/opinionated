R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b787-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-23\">California state prisoner Terry Ty Griffey appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition challenging his jury-trial convictions and 10-year sentence for rape and assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We reverse the district court\u2019s judgment and remand with instructions to conditionally grant the writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-24\">Griffey contends that California Jury Instructions Nos. 2.50.01 and 2.50.1, as given in his case, violate due process because they impermissibly lower the government\u2019s burden of proof by permitting conviction under a preponderance of evidence standard. In light of our decision in <em>Gibson v. Ortiz, </em>387 F.3d 812 (9th Cir.2004), we agree. We conclude that the California Court of Appeal\u2019s decision affirming Griffey\u2019s convictions for rape and assault with force was contrary to clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Gibson, </em>387 F.3d at 822-25 (holding that a state court decision which found the same combination of jury in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>stractions to be constitutional was contrary to <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970), and <em>Sullivan v. Louisiana, </em>508 U.S. 275, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 124 L.Ed.2d 182 (1993)). We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief and remand to the district court for the court to grant a conditional writ of habeas corpus instructing the State that it may either retry Griffey within an appropriate period to be determined by the district court, or release him from custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">Griffey\u2019s motion to broaden the Certif\u00edcate of Appealability is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b787-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
