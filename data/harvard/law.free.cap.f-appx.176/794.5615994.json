INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1258 (9th Cir.1996). Accordingly we dismiss this part of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 to review the petitioners\u2019 contention regarding the motion to reopen. This court reviews a denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 965-66 (9th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion when it denied the petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen to reapply for asylum and withholding of removal based on changed circumstances in Armenia. The articles submitted by petitioners constituted only general background material on problems for political opposition parties, and the death certificates of Levon Arakelyan\u2019s brother and mother did not establish that their deaths were related to petitioners\u2019 underlying claim for relief. Thus, the evidence they submitted was not probative of their claim, did not show changed circumstances, and did not establish prima facie eligibility for relief. <em>See Konstantinova v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 528, 530 (9th Cir.1999) (upholding denial of motion to reopen where petitioner introduced evidence that was too general in nature to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part, and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b822-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
