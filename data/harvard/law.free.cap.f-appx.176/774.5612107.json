We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for substantial evidence, <em>Sangha v. INS, </em>103 F.3d 1482, 1487 (9th Cir.1997), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-13\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Estrada Suchite did not establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground where he received only anonymous, ambiguous threats and where the only evidence as to the source and reason for the threats was Estrada Suchite\u2019s speculative testimony that ex-guerillas may have targeted him because of his past military service. <em>See Nahrvani v. Gonzales, </em>399 F.3d 1148, 1153-54 (9th Cir.2005); <em>see also Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1094-95 (9th Cir.2002) (concluding that petitioner had not established a nexus to a protected ground based on his father\u2019s past military involvement). Accordingly, Estrada Suchite failed to establish eligibility for asylum, and we need not reach his contentions regarding the one-year deadline for filing his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-16\">Because Estrada Suchite failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Cruz-Navarro v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 1024, 1031 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-17\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b803-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
