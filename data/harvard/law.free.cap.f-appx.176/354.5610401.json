An Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) awarded benefits to Ms. Wiles, and the Benefits Review Board (the \u201cBoard\u201d) upheld the award. Eastern Associated Coal Corporation (\u201cEastern\u201d), Mr. Wiles\u2019 former employer, now petitions for review of the Board\u2019s decision. For the following reasons, we grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-16\">Mr. Wiles was a coal miner for thirty-three years and had a history of heavy smoking. In 1987, an ALJ awarded benefits to Mr. Wiles after finding that he was totally disabled by pneumoconiosis arising from his coal mine employment. The Board later affirmed this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-17\">Shortly after Mr. Wiles\u2019 death in 2000, Ms. Wiles filed her claim for survivor\u2019s benefits. After the Department of Labor notified Eastern of its belief that Ms. Wiles was entitled to benefits, the claim proceeded to an ALJ, and the parties agreed to have a decision made on the record. The record before the ALJ included the medical opinions of Drs. Emory Robinette and Ben Branscomb. Dr. Robinette was Mr. Wiles\u2019 treating physician from 1985 through November 1999. Dr. Branscomb, an expert retained by Eastern, reviewed Mr. Wiles\u2019 medical records from 1973 through the date of death. Although the experts agreed that Mr. Wiles suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (\u201cCOPD\u201d), they disagreed as to whether this condition was pneumoconiosis resulting from his coal dust exposure or an impairment deriving from his history of heavy smoking. The ALJ gave greater weight to Dr. Robinette\u2019s records suggesting that Mr. Wiles suffered from pneumoconiosis with associated obstructive lung disease caused by coal dust exposure than to Dr. Branscomb\u2019s opinion that Mr. Wiles\u2019 lung disease was the result of his smoking history and possible prior exposure to tuberculosis. In making this determination, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>the ALJ noted that although Dr. Branscomb\u2019s credentials were superior to those of Dr. Robinette\u2019s (whose credentials were not in the record), \u201cDr. Robinette followed Mr. Wiles for approximately ten years, seeing him frequently for treatment of his severe pulmonary problems.\u201d J.A. 15. Further, the ALJ discredited Dr. Branscomb for failing to cite any publications that discuss tobacco use as the sole or typical cause of the specific symptoms of COPD exhibited by Mr. Wiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The Board affirmed these determinations and upheld the grant of survivor\u2019s benefits to Ms. Wiles. Eastern petitioned for review of the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">We review decisions of the Board to determine whether it properly found that the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence and was in accordance with law. <em>See Doss v. Director, OWCP, </em>53 F.3d 654, 658 (4th Cir.1995). In making this determination, we conduct an independent review of the record to decide whether the ALJ\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Dehue Coal Co. v. Ballard, </em>65 F.3d 1189, 1193 (4th Cir.1995). Substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla of evidence, but only such evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Lane v. Union Carbide Corp., </em>105 F.3d 166, 170 (4th Cir.1997). Subject to the substantial evidence requirement, the ALJ has the sole authority to make credibility determinations and resolve inconsistencies or conflicts in the evidence. <em>Grizzle v. Pickands Mather &amp; Co., </em>994 F.2d 1093, 1096 (4th Cir.1993). The ALJ, however, may rely only on a medical opinion that constitutes a reasoned medical judgment. <em>See Freeman United Coal Mining Co. v. Cooper, </em>965 F.2d 443, 448 (7th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">To establish entitlement to black lung benefits as a qualifying surviving spouse, a claimant must prove that (1) the miner suffered from pneumoconiosis, (2) the miner\u2019s pneumoconiosis arose at least in part out of coal mine employment, and (3) that the miner\u2019s death was due to pneumoconiosis. <em>U.S. Steel Mining Co. v. Director, OWCP, </em>187 F.3d 384, 388 (4th Cir.1999) (citing relevant regulations). A coal miner\u2019s death is considered \u201cdue to\u201d pneumoconiosis if pneumoconiosis was a \u201csubstantially contributing cause\u201d of the miner\u2019s death. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.205(c) (2004). We have interpreted this standard to permit a finding of causation if a claimant proves that pneumoconiosis \u201cactually hastened the miner\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Shuff v. Cedar Coal Co., </em>967 F.2d 977, 979 (4th Cir.1992). A claimant may establish the existence of pneumoconiosis by means of (1) chest x-rays; (2) biopsy or autopsy evidence; (3) invocation of the presumptions at 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 718.304\u2014718.306; or (4) medical opinion evidence. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">The ALJ determined that Ms. Wiles failed to establish the existence of pneumoconiosis by x-ray evidence and that there was no biopsy or autopsy evidence. Because the presumptions of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 718.304\u2014718.306 are inapplicable, it is undisputed that the only basis upon which Ms. Wiles may establish that her husband suffered from pneumoconiosis is medical opinion evidence pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a)(4). On appeal, Eastern contends that the ALJ erred in her consideration of the medical evidence because she relied on an impermissible preference for the opinion of a treating physician and erroneously discredited the opinion of Eastern\u2019s expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">Eastern first argues that the ALJ erred by invoking a presumption that Dr. Robinette\u2019s opinion as treating physician be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>given greater weight than the opinion of Dr. Branscomb. While we have stated \u201cthat as a general matter the opinions of treating and examining physicians deserve especial consideration,\u201d we have also clearly stated that \u201c[n]either this circuit nor the Benefits Review Board has ever fashioned either a requirement or a presumption that treating or examining physicians\u2019 opinions be given greater weight than opinions of other expert physicians.\u201d <em>Grizzle, </em>994 F.2d at 1097; <em>see also Island Creek Coal Co. v. Compton, </em>211 F.3d 203, 212 (4th Cir.2000) (\u201cAn ALJ may not discredit a physician\u2019s opinion solely because the physician did not examine the claimant.\u201d). The Supreme Court has since held as much, albeit in the context of a case involving an ERISA benefits plan. <em>Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan v. Nord, </em>538 U.S. 822, 834, 123 S.Ct. 1965, 155 L.Ed.2d 1034 (2003) (\u201cBut, we hold, courts have no warrant to require administrators automatically to accord special weight to the opinions of a claimant\u2019s physician; nor may courts impose on plan administrators a discrete burden of explanation when they credit reliable evidence that conflicts with a treating physician\u2019s evaluation.\u201d). Because we are unable to discern from the record whether the ALJ did, in fact, invoke a presumption that the treating physician\u2019s opinion be given greater weight than other expert opinions, we remand for a reweighing of the evidence based on the proper legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Eastern also argues that the ALJ erred in discrediting Dr. Branscomb\u2019s opinion for failing to cite published material. We require that the ALJ give sufficient reasons for crediting or discrediting an expert opinion. <em>Milburn Colliery Co. v. Hicks, </em>138 F.3d 524, 533 (4th Cir.1998). Although the ALJ discredited Dr. Branscomb for failing to cite any publications that discuss tobacco use as the sole or typical cause of the specific symptoms of COPD exhibited by Mr. Wiles, the ALJ did not require any published materials to support Dr. Robinette\u2019s conclusions. Considering the vast experience and extensive credentials of Dr. Branscomb compared to the complete absence of any credentials for Dr. Robinette, we find this appraisal wholly unsatisfactory. <em>See id. </em>at 536 (stating that \u201cexperts\u2019 respective qualifications are important indicators of the reliability of their opinions\u201d); <em>Adkins v. Director, OWCP, </em>958 F.2d 49, 52 (4th Cir.1992) (stating that \u201ca primary method of evaluating the reliability of an expert\u2019s opinion is of course his expertise\u201d). Thus, we remand for a reweighing of the conflicting medical opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">Finding the ALJ made these errors of law, we conclude that review of this claim requires a fresh look at the evidence. Accordingly, we grant the petition for review and direct the Board to remand to a new ALJ with instructions to review the record for a determination of whether Ms. Wiles has established entitlement to survivor\u2019s benefits. <em>See Milburn, </em>138 F.3d at 537. To determine whether Ms. Wiles meets her burden, the new ALJ has discretion to reopen the record.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">\n<em>PETITION GRANTED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-7\"> Because of our disposition, we need not address Eastern\u2019s contention that the ALJ relied upon an inappropriate preference for the treating physician\u2019s unexplained conclusion that Mr. Wiles\u2019 death was actually hastened by pneumoconiosis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
