Hunt argues that the district court erred by not reducing his offense level in accordance with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 for a mitigating role in the offense. Because Hunt did not raise this argument in the district court, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>324 F.3d 375, 381 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-17\">As Hunt correctly asserts, the conspiracy involved two other individuals and distributed more than 50 grams of cocaine base, and he was involved in only a small part of the overall conspiracy. Had Hunt been sentenced based on the entire conspiracy, his argument for minor participant status would have some force. As Hunt admits, his base offense level was not based on the entire conspiracy. Hunt\u2019s offense level was based only on the possession of cocaine base in which he actively participated. A reduction under \u00a7 3B1.2 is not required when the defendant\u2019s sentence is based on his own conduct rather than the larger conspiracy. <em>United States v. Atanda, </em>60 F.3d 196, 199 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-18\">To the extent that Hunt argues that the sentence was not reasonable, the argument is not persuasive. The district court noted that the testimony of the tragic facts of Hunt\u2019s life had persuaded the court not to impose a sentence at the high end of the applicable range. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 553 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b506-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
