We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-25\">Alvarado is not removable under INA section 237(a)(2)(C) based on his conviction for unlawful possession of a firearm with a prior conviction in violation of California Penal Code section 12021(c)(1). His firearm conviction does not qualify as a basis for removal under the categorical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>approach as laid out in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), because INA section 237(a)(2)(C) excludes antique firearms while the broader California statute does not. <em>Compare </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(3) (defining \u201cfirearm\u201d as excluding antique firearms) <em>with </em>Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 12001(b) (not excluding antique firearms from definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d). Alvarado\u2019s firearm conviction also does not qualify as a basis for removal under the modified categorical approach because the record of conviction does not indicate whether or not the firearm was an antique. <em>See Tokatly v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 613, 620 (9th Cir.2004). Accordingly, the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s decision that Alvarado was removable under INA section 237(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">However, Alvarado is removable under INA section 237(a)(2)(E)\u00a9 for having been convicted of a \u201ccrime of domestic violence\u201d based on his domestic battery conviction in violation of California Penal Code section 243(e). In order to determine that Alvarado was convicted of a \u201ccrime of domestic violence,\u201d we must conclude under the categorical or modified categorical approach that his conviction was both a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and also \u201cdomestic\u201d under INA section 237(a)(2)(E)\u00a9. <em>See Tokatly, </em>371 F.3d at 619-20, 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">We need not decide whether Alvarado\u2019s conviction was for a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because he failed to raise that issue before the BIA or in his brief for this appeal. <em>See Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1228, 1232 n. 4 (9th Cir.2004) (stating that the petitioner had waived the issue of whether his prior conviction under Oregon\u2019s harassment statute was a \u201cdomestic\u201d offense because he did not raise the issue before the agency and did not argue the issue in his briefs filed in the appellate court); <em>Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that this court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over legal claims not presented in administrative proceedings below).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">Under the modified categorical approach, it is clear that Alvarado\u2019s conviction was \u201cdomestic\u201d because the record of conviction indicates that the victim was a former spouse. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(E)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)\u00a9 (including violence against a former spouse as \u201cdomestic\u201d violence). The docket states that Alvarado was convicted of a violation of California Penal Code section \u201c242-243(e) PC misd\u2014violnee [sic] used against former sp.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">Accordingly, we conclude that Alvarado\u2019s conviction for domestic battery constitutes a \u201ccrime of domestic violence\u201d under INA section 237(a)(2)(E)\u00ae and he is therefore removable.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that Alvarado did not warrant cancellation of removal due to his numerous criminal convictions. See INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B) (\u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law ... no court shall have jurisdiction to review\u2014\u00ae any judgment regarding the granting of relief under ... [INA \u00a7 ] 240A[, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b, which concerns cancellation of removal].... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b916-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
