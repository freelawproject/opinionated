We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">This Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision where, as here, the BIA summarily adopted or affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion. <em>See Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Jin Hui Gao v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>400 F.3d 963, 964 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. U.S. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 177 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 306-07 (2d Cir.2003); <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 287 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-13\">In this case, Skudrinja presented no evidence other than his own testimony, his wife\u2019s testimony, and his asylum application, filed in 1992, to support his claim. Although an applicant\u2019s testimony alone sometimes can be sufficient to meet the burden of proof <em>(see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a)), corroboration should be provided when it is reasonable to expect it. <em>In re S-M-J-</em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 722, 725-26, 1997 WL 80984 (BIA 1997). Here, despite being given a list of documents to procure, explicit warnings about the importance of corroboration, and ample time to produce it, Skudrinja produced no documentary evidence. The IJ was justified in holding Skudrinja\u2019s testimony to a strict standard of consistency and persuasiveness in the absence of such proof. <em>See Diallo, </em>232 F.3d at 287-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-14\">The IJ was also justified in finding that Skudrinja\u2019s testimony did not meet that standard. His testimony was inconsistent with his asylum application with respect to each allegation of past persecution. He mentioned his brother\u2019s arrest twice in his application, stating that it took place in June 1987 and listing the duration, alternately, as \u201c3 1/4 months\u201d and \u201c105 days.\u201d In court, however, he stated that his brother was arrested in May 1985 and kept in jail for six months. Skudrinja made this allegation central to his claim by stating that his brother\u2019s arrest inspired him to leave Yugoslavia in 1987. He also testified that the police searched his house, interrogated him frequently about his acquaintances and activities, and caused some of his friends to disappear. However, in his application, he indicated that he had never been detained or interrogated, and added that he always avoided the police. To date, he has failed to provide a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>explanation for this inconsistency. Likewise, he has failed to explain why he wrote in his application (and his wife confirmed) that he was fired and replaced by a Macedonian, yet he testified that he was replaced by an Albanian agent for the secret police. These inconsistencies all go to the heart of his claim of past persecution based on his Albanian ethnicity, and therefore they were a proper basis for finding him incredible.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The record also supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding with respect to Skudrinja\u2019s fear of future persecution in Macedonia. In his application, he implied that he feared the authorities would punish him if they found out about his advocacy activities with the Democratic League of Kosovo in the United States. However, he did not mention these activities in his testimony, and implied that his only concerns about returning to Macedonia related to limited employment and housing opportunities. This factor provided additional probative evidence supporting the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding and subsequent denial of asylum and withholding.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
