He contends for the first time on appeal that his sentence violates <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because it was imposed pursuant to a mandatory guidelines scheme, and that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-17\">The Government seeks to enforce the waiver-of-appeal provision in Guevara\u2019s plea agreement. Due to a difference between the written terms of the waiver-of-appeal provision and statements by the district court regarding the scope of this waiver, we decline to enforce it and proceed to the merits of Guevara\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-18\">Because Guevara did not preserve his claims before the district court, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Guevara\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim fails because he has not shown that any error affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Pennell, </em>409 F.3d 240, 245 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 521. The fact that Guevara was sentenced at the lowest end of the guidelines range does not indicate that his sentence would likely have been different under advisory Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Bringier, </em>405 F.3d 310, 317-18 &amp; n. 4. (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 264, 163 L.Ed.2d 238 (2005). Additionally, his contention that the district court\u2019s error is structural and that prejudice should be presumed is without merit. <em>See United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 561 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 194, 163 L.Ed.2d 209 (2005). Because he has not established plain error, Guevara\u2019s sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Guevara\u2019s constitutional challenge to the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Guevara contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Guevara properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here <em>to </em>preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b486-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
