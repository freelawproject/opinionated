Perillo\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction after denying his motion to substitute himself as the party in a previous decision of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (Board). <em>Perillo v. Nicholson, </em>No. 05-0230, 2005 WL 1545174 (Vet-App. June 14, 2005) <em>{Order). </em>Because this court lacks jurisdiction to consider the appeal, this court <em>dismisses.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-25\">On October 13, 2004, the Board issued a decision in the case of claim for dependency and indemnification compensation (DIC) filed by Maria G. Intendencia. Ms. Intendencia\u2019s DIC claim was based on her sta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>tus as the widow of Eusebio A. Intendencia, a military veteran. Ms. Intendencia died on October 4, 2004, approximately one week before the Board issued its decision on her claim. Ms. Intendencia was Mr. Perillo\u2019s mother-in-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">On January 31, 2005, Mr. Perillo filed an appeal with the Veterans Court from the October 13 decision of the Board. In that filing, Mr. Perillo identified himself as \u201cthe substitute party,\u201d while identifying Ms. Intendencia as his \u201cward.\u201d The Veterans Court explained that a Board decision issued after a claimant\u2019s death is made without jurisdiction and is therefore not a final Board decision. <em>Order, </em>slip op. at 1. The Veterans Court further explained that its jurisdiction required a final Board decision involving the purported appellant. <em>Id., </em>slip op. at 2. Because the Board had not issued a final decision regarding any claim filed by Mr. Perillo, the Veterans Court dismissed Mr. Perillo\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Finally, the Veterans Court treated Mr. Perillo\u2019s self-identification as a \u201csubstitute party\u201d as a request to substitute himself for Ms. Intendencia and then denied that request. <em>Id., </em>slip op. at 2. Mr. Perillo appeals from the Veterans Court decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">This court\u2019s jurisdiction in the case of appeals from the Veterans Court is limited by 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292. <em>See Forshey v. Principi, </em>284 F.3d 1335, 1338 (Fed.Cir.2002) (en banc). Section 7292 supplies this court only with \u201cexclusive jurisdiction to review and decide any challenge to the validity of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof brought under [section 7292], and to interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, to the extent presented and necessary to a decision.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(c). This court may not review findings of fact or the application of law to the facts, except to the extent that an appeal presents a constitutional issue. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(1); <em>Bustos v. West, </em>179 F.3d 1378, 1380 (Fed.Cir.1999). That prohibition on this court\u2019s review of factual determinations, as well as the application of law to facts, applies with equal force where the ultimate legal determination is a jurisdictional decision by Veterans Court. <em>See Cook v. Principi, </em>353 F.3d 937, 940 (Fed. Cir.2003) (\u201c[T]his court does not have jurisdiction to review an alleged abuse of discretion under [the Veterans Court\u2019s jurisdictional statute] premised on.the misapplication of the law to facts, or an erroneous factual determination.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">The Government argues that this court lacks jurisdiction to consider Mr. Perillo\u2019s appeal because he challenges nothing more than the application of law to facts. Both Mr. Perillo\u2019s arguments and the Veterans Court\u2019s decision confirm that the Government is correct. Mr. Perillo fails to take issue with the Veterans Court\u2019s statement of the law, i.e., that only a claimant who has lost at the Board can appeal to the Veterans Court. The Veterans Court decision amounts simply to the application of that law to the facts of this case, in which Mr. Perillo has not lost at the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">While Mr. Perillo asserts that he should be substituted for his deceased mother-in-law, he has presented no argument either to the Veterans Court or to this court that would support that substitution. In making his substitution argument, Mr. Perillo merely cites to Rule 43 of the Veterans Court which provides a procedural mechanism for substitution of a party \u201cby any person permitted by law to do so.\u201d Vet. App. R. 43(a)(1). As the Government points out, this court has explained that the rule does not confer a right of substitution, but merely a mechanism for substitution where the right already exists. <em>See Richard v. West, </em>161 F.3d 719, 722 (Fed. Cir.1998) (in the case of an individual seeking to be substituted for his deceased brother, explaining that the existence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Rule 43 does not resolve the question of whether substitution is proper). There is another reason why Rule 43 does not help Mr. Perillo: by its language, Rule 43 applies, if at all, to situations where a party entitled to appeal dies. <em>See </em>Vet.App. R. 43(a)(1) (\u201cIf a party entitled to appeal dies.... \u201d). Here, Ms. Intendencia died <em>before </em>the Board issued its decision. As explained by the Veterans Court, in such a circumstance, the Board decision is made without jurisdiction and so is not a final Board decision from which a party can appeal. <em>Order, </em>slip op. at 1. Thus, Rule 43 does not seem to apply to Mr. Perillo at least because Ms. Intendencia was never \u201ca party entitled to appeal,\u201d having died before the Board issued its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Because Mr. Perillo does not challenge the validity of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof by the Veterans Court, this court lacks jurisdiction. The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
