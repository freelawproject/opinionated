Bright, Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b686-22\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b686-23\">Plaintiff-appellant Bezark was employed by defendant-appellee Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., as a supervisor at a store in Tennessee for about eight years beginning in 1994. It is undisputed that Bezark suffered from diagnosed multiple sclerosis (\u201cMS\u201d) and that Wal-Mart was aware of this condition when it fired him. It is also undisputed that on June 20, 2002, during a conversation with a male manager, during work hours and on store premises, Bezark referred to a female manager as a \u201cwhore,\u201d which Bezark admits was meant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>to be insulting. Citing this incident, WalMart terminated Bezark\u2019s employment the next day. Bezark sued Wal-Mart in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, claiming that Wal-Mart terminated him due to his MS in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et seq., </em>as amended (\u201cADA\u201d). Wal-Mart moved for summary judgment, and the district court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The district court held that Bezark could not make out a prima facie case of wrongful termination under the ADA because, by his own admission at deposition, he was able to perform, and was performing, the essential functions of his job at the time of his termination. Also by Bezark\u2019s own admission, he was able to perform, and was performing, the functions of basic everyday living, such as caring for himself and driving to and from work. Thus, as a matter of law, the district court held that Bezark could not show that his MS was an ADA disability, i.e., \u201ca physical or mental impairment that substantially limit[ed] one or more of [his] major life activities....\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">After reviewing the record, the parties\u2019 briefs, and the applicable law, we conclude that a panel opinion further addressing the issues raised would serve no jurisprudential purpose. Therefore, we affirm for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AoQ\">. We do not consider Wal-Mart\u2019s alternative contention that Bezark cannot make out a prima facie case of disability discrimination because he was not qualified for the position.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
