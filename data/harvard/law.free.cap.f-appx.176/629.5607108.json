He contends that the district court erred in applying the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(6)(C) enhancement to his sentence for creating a substantial risk of harm to the life of a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-18\">Section 2Dl.l(b)(6)(C) provides that if an offense involved the manufacture of methamphetamine and created a substantial risk of harm to the life of a minor or incompetent, the offense level should be increased by six levels. The guideline\u2019s commentary instructs that in determining whether the offense created a substantial risk of harm to human life or the environment, the district court shall consider the following factors: (1) the quantity of any chemicals or hazardous substances found at the laboratory and the manner in which they were stored; (2) the manner of disposal of the hazardous or toxic substances and the likelihood of their release into the environment; (3) the offense\u2019s duration and the size of manufacturing operation; and (4) the laboratory\u2019s location <em>{e.g., </em>whether it was located in a residential versus a remote area) and the number of human lives enduring a substantial risk of harm. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(6)(C), comment (n.20(A)). A \u201cminor\u201d is defined as a person who has not yet attained the age of 18. <em>Id. </em>at n. 20(B); \u00a7 2A3.1, comment (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-23\">Contrary to Hargraves\u2019s assertions, the presentence report (PSR) and the factual basis, which the district court relied on in applying the enhancement, clearly reflect that a minor was present in the residence while Hargraves was manufacturing methamphetamine. Hargraves\u2019s own argument at the sentencing hearing, that the minor was not present \u201cduring all the cooks,\u201d implies that the minor was present \u201cduring some of the cooks.\u201d The PSR further reflects that chemical materials were found inside the residence and also in close proximity to the residence. In light of the evidence before the district court, it cannot be said that the district court clearly erred in applying the \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(6)(C) enhancement. <em>Cf. United States v. Simpson, </em>334 F.3d 453, 457-59 (5th Cir.2003) (court did not uphold enhancement because there was no evidence that a minor was present during the time the defendant was involved in the manufacturing process). Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>cordingly, Hargraves\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b657-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
