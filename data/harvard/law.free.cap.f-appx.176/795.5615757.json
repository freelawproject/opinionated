We have jurisdiction pursuant 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>de Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>374 F.3d 759, 761 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Singh offered evidence with his motion that he had filed an application for a labor certification, but he did not show that an immigrant visa was immediately available to him. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a) (immediately available immigrant visa is required for adjustment of status application). Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Singh\u2019s motion to reopen for failure to establish prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status. <em>See INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 105, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988) (holding that BIA may deny an alien\u2019s motion to reopen if alien is not prima facie eligible for relief sought).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Singh\u2019s motion to reopen based on changed country conditions in India because Singh did not provide any new country conditions evidence. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (a motion to reopen shall state new facts to be proven at new hearing and be supported by evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">To the extent Singh challenges the BIA\u2019s April 14, 2003 order, we lack jurisdiction because Singh did not petition for review of that order. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1258 (9th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b823-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
