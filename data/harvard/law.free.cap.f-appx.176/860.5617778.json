VelazquezRubio also appeals the district court\u2019s finding that he had been previously deported following a felony conviction and its application of the sentencing enhancement codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-15\">Velazquez-Rubio claims the May 3, 2004 and September 3, 2004 statement reports were admitted in violation of the hearsay rule and that the May 3, 2004 statement report was admitted in violation of the Confrontation Clause. Regardless of whether the statements were admitted in error, reversal is appropriate only if the error is not harmless\u2014that is, if it is \u201cmore probable than not that the erroneous admission of the evidence did not affect the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Vizcarra-Martinez, </em>66 F.3d 1006, 1017 (9th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). Without deciding whether the statement reports were erroneously admitted, we conclude any error is harmless because Appellant\u2019s guilt was supported by overwhelming evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-19\">Velazquez-Rubio\u2019s second argument asks us to overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), based on speculation concerning its validity in light of subsequent Supreme Court decisions. We have previously held that speculation about the demise of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is immaterial and that until <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>is overruled by the Supreme Court, it controls. <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 414 (9th Cir.2000). Therefore, Velazquez-Rubio\u2019s prior conviction was properly considered at sentencing even though it was neither admitted nor found by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-20\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AfeV\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
