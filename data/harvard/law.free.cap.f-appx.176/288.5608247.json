Linares of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. For the reasons given below, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">In or about 2002, Xhengiz Zaku, an adult male, conspired with a friend of his, Neat Osmani, an adult male, to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine and smuggle the cocaine into Macedonia. The government conceded that the \u201ckingpin of the drug importation scheme\u201d was Lado Istrefi, Osmani\u2019s uncle, who lived in Macedonia. The government agreed that Istrefi recruited his nephew Osmani and that Osmani, in turn, recruited Zaku. In April 2002, Zaku and Osmani together \u201capproach[ed]\u201d B.I.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a male then fifteen years old, and Sedat Sulejmani, an adult male, and \u201cask[ed]\u201d them to assist in the drug smuggling operation. Zaku later \u201cretrieve[d]\u201d the airline tickets for B.I.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> delivered the tickets to B.I., and \u201chelpfed] drive\u201d B.I. to the airport, where B.I. was supposed to fly from Newark to Aruba, where he and Sulejmani would procure the cocaine, and from Aruba to Norway, where they would deliver the cocaine to Istrefi or one of his associates (whereby the cocaine would then be smuggled into Macedonia). As part of the plan, Zaku also took B.I. to a department store to purchase clothing for B.I. to be used during and for the smuggling operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">After B.I. and Sulejmani arrived in Aruba, they were arrested. B.I. cooperated with police to effect the arrest of Zaku. On October 18, 2004, Zaku pled guilty to a \u201cconspiracy to distribute [a] controlled substance (cocaine).\u201d This resulted in a base sentencing level of 33 and a reduction to level 29 for other factors, according to the sentencing guidelines.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, Zaku offered substantial assistance to the government that led to the arrest of Osmani.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">Because of Zaku\u2019s substantial assistance, the government moved for a downward departure of 3 levels to level 26. The district court granted the government\u2019s motion based on its analysis and weighing of the five factors outlined in section 5kl.l of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. During the sentencing hearing, the court recited all five 5kl.l factors, stated that it considered and weighed the factors, discussed its analysis of the five factors, and explained why it granted the government\u2019s motion based on the factors. In her Presentence Investigation Report, the Probation Officer calculated the total offense level with a 2-level increase because Zaku used a minor in the conspiracy. This 2-level increase was included in the base sentencing level of 33. In a letter to the Probation Officer, Zaku objected to the enhancement, asserting that he did not use a minor. The trial court denied the \u201cmotion\u201d because it found that Zaku did use a minor. Thus, after the downward departure, the trial court set Zaku\u2019s sentencing level at 26, which carries a sentence range of 63 to 78 months. On April 21, 2005, the trial court sentenced Zaku to the lowest time in that range, 63 months. On May 25, 2005, Zaku surrendered to commence serving his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">On appeal, Zaku argues that the trial court erred because it \u201cmisapplied the [sentencing] guidelines, misunderstood the legal standard for departures, and failed to consider properly the relevant factors regarding substantial assistance.\u201d He also argues that the trial court erred by finding that he used a minor in the conspiracy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>We conclude that the trial court did not err in interpreting and applying the law and considering all of the factors. We also hold that the trial court did not err in finding that Zaku used a minor in the conspiracy. Thus, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">As a preliminary matter, the government asserts that this Court does not have jurisdiction over one aspect of this appeal, namely, the downward departure for substantial assistance, because a defendant may not appeal the extent of a downward departure, which is given at the discretion of the judge. Thus, the government asserts, Zaku\u2019s appeal on this issue is dismissible for lack of jurisdiction. Zaku responds that he is not merely appealing the extent of the downward departure and, thus, his appeal falls within the jurisdiction of this Court. <em>United States v. Khalil, </em>132 F.3d 897, 898 (3d Cir.1997). Zaku is correct that a defendant may appeal a sentence that \u201cwas imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(2). Because Zaku is challenging the application of the guidelines and the consideration of all guideline factors, we believe that this Court has jurisdiction under (a)(2) and we will analyze this appeal on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">Zaku asserts that the trial court erred as a matter of law because it misunderstood and misapplied the law. Yet, other than these general allegations, he fails to explain how the guidelines were misapplied. Indeed, he quotes the trial court\u2019s analysis and application of the five factors during the sentencing hearing and recites what the trial court <em>did </em>state as to each factor, showing that the trial court <em>did </em>consider the factors. Thus, while he claims that the court misunderstood and misapplied the law, he actually is merely contesting the weighing of the factors and the result that the offense level was reduced \u201cby only three levels.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">The government responds that the trial court did correctly apply the guidelines and consider each factor in its analysis, as shown by the trial court\u2019s specific discussion of the five factors in the sentencing transcript. We agree with the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">Regarding the second factor (the \u201ctruthfulness, completeness, and reliability\u201d of Zaku\u2019s information), although the trial court did not explicitly discuss this factor, it implicitly found Zaku\u2019s information truthful, complete, and rehable. Otherwise it would not have considered it and granted the downward departure based on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-14\">As to the fourth factor, any \u201cdanger or risk of injury to the defendant or his family,\u201d Zaku states that \u201cthere is literally no mention of the danger or risk to not only the defendant, but to his family, as well.\u201d Yet Zaku did not present any supporting evidence prior to or at the sentencing hearing. For the first time on appeal, he now submits supplemental evidence alleging that \u201c[tjhreats to the defendant were made telephonically,\u201d that Zaku himself was \u201cphysically assaulted on one occasion,\u201d and that Zaku\u2019s car \u201cwas vandalized.\u201d The trial court could not have erred regarding this 5kl.l factor because no such evidence was before the trial court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Zaku also alleges that the trial court erred in finding that he \u201cused\u201d a minor in the conspiracy because he did not \u201cdecide\u201d to use B.I., the minor. Rather, he states, Istrefi and Osmani \u201cdecided\u201d to use the minor and Zaku merely \u201caccepted\u201d their decision. The government counters that Zaku\u2019s sworn admission during his plea hearing that he \u201capproach[ed]\u201d and \u201cask[ed]\u201d B.I. to join the conspiracy, \u201cretrieve[d]\u201d airline tickets for B.I., and \u201chelp[ed] drive\u201d B.I. to the airport so that B.I. could pick up the cocaine in Aruba and \u201cdeliver\u201d it in Norway proved \u201cuse\u201d of a minor within its statutory meaning. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The United States Sentencing Guidelines define \u201cuse\u201d of a minor as \u201cinclud[ing] directing, commanding, encouraging, intimidating, counseling, training, procuring, recruiting or soliciting.\u201d U.S.S.G. 3B1.4, Appl. Note 1. Indeed, we have explained that section 3B1.4 merely requires \u201csome affirmative act....\u201d <em>United States v. Pojilenko, </em>416 F.3d 243, 247 (3d Cir.2005). The admitted acts clearly constitute \u201csome affirmative act beyond mere joint participation in a crime with a minor____\u201d <em>Pojilenko, </em>416 F.3d at 247. Thus, Zaku \u201cused\u201d B.I., a minor, in the conspiracy, within the meaning of section 3B1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b318-6\">. The initials of the minor, B.I., are being used to protect his privacy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b318-7\">. Zaku also approached Sulejmani. The issue on appeal, however, is whether Zaku used a minor, namely, B.I., in the conspiracy. Thus, our discussion focuses on B.I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b318-12\">. Zaku was given a 2-level reduction because \u201cno aggravating role [was] applicable\u201d to Zaku, as the trial court found that he was \u201cnot an organizer or leader of this particular criminal activity.\u201d He was also given a safety valve reduction of 2 levels.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b319-10\">. Moreover, we cannot consider this evidence now, for the first time on appeal. <em>See, e.g., In re Capital Cities/ABC, Inc\u2019s Application for Access to Sealed Transcripts, </em>913 F.2d 89, 96 (3d Cir.1990) (holding that an appellate court \"cannot consider material on appeal that is outside of the district court record\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
