Garcia argues that the district court erred in failing to reduce his sentence based on his being a minor or minimal participant in the offense and that the court relied on \u201cimproper\u201d facts to sentence him to 84 months of imprisonment. Under the 2001 version of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, a defendant could have received a reduction in his offense level if it was determined that he was a minimal or a minor participant in the criminal activity. A \u201cminimal participant\u201d is one who is \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group\u201d and who demonstrates a lack of knowledge or understanding of the scope and structure of the enterprise. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.4). A \u201cminor participant\u201d is one who is \u201cless culpable than most other participants, but one whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.5). To merit an adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2, the defendant must have been \u201csubstantially less culpable\u201d than the average participant. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3(A)). But, an adjustment is \u201cnot appropriate simply because a defendant does less than other participants; in order to qualify as a minor participant, a defendant must have been peripheral to the advancement of the illicit activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Miranda, </em>248 F.3d 434, 446-47 (5th Cir.2001). We review the district court\u2019s determination that Garcia did not play a minor or minimal role in the offense for clear error. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>54 F.3d 234, 240 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">Garcia\u2019s role in the offense was that of broker. He had a role in loading the marihuana, and he provided his personal vehicle in furtherance of that role. He admitted that his role included putting a middleman in touch with a commercial driver. The district court did not clearly err by denying Garcia the mitigating-role adjustment. <em>See Miranda, </em>248 F.3d at 446-47; <em>Brown, </em>54 F.3d at 240. There is no factual support in the record for Garcia\u2019s assertion that the court used extraneous factors in determining his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b568-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
