We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>The INA authorizes the Attorney General to confer asylum on any refugee. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a) (2000). It defines a refugee as a person unwilling or unable to return to her native country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2000). Substantial evidence supports the finding that Koha failed to show entitlement to asylum because the past events that were the basis for her asylum application did not establish persecution.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b414-14\"> We note Koha has abandoned challenges to the immigration judge's decision that she was not eligible for withholding from removal or withholding under the CAT.
