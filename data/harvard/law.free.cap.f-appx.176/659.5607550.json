The district court held that Ventra had failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>establish a prima facie case under the ADEA because she had not produced any evidence that the individual actually hired for the position was younger than she, and that, even assuming a prima facie case, Ventra had failed to demonstrate pretext because she had not produced any evidence to rebut the defendants\u2019 legitimate nondiseriminatory reason for not offering the position to Ventra. Further, the district court assumed for purposes of the summary judgment proceedings that Ventra had met the requirements of a prima facie ADA claim, but held that, as was the case with the ADEA claim, Ventra had not presented evidence to demonstrate pretext. Because discrimination claims brought under Ohio law are reviewed under the same evidentiary standards applicable to claims brought under the ADEA and ADA, the district court granted summary judgment on the state law claims as well. Ventra appeals only the granting of summary judgment on the federal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Having had the benefit of oral argument, and having carefully considered the record on appeal and the briefs of the parties, we conclude that the district court\u2019s order thoroughly and accurately sets out both the undisputed facts and the governing law. Because the issuance of a full opinion would serve no jurisprudential purpose and would be duplicative, we AFFIRM the grant of summary judgment on the basis of the district court\u2019s well-reasoned opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
