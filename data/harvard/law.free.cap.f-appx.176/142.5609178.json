The court has determined that the issues presented occasion no need for an opinion. <em>See </em>D.C.Cir. Rule 36. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b170-15\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s January 23, 2006 oral ruling be affirmed. Even assuming, without deciding, that the detention hearing could be reopened on the basis of the newly proffered information concerning appellant\u2019s lack of financial assets, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(f), the district court\u2019s determination that appellant poses a flight risk is supported by a preponderance of all of the evidence, and the decision to hold appellant pending trial is therefore affirmed. <em>See United States v. Xulam, </em>84 F.3d 441, 442 (D.C.Cir.1996) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-16\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
