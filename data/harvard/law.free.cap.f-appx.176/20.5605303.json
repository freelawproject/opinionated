Valdez appeals his sentence, arguing that: 1) the district court erred in denying him a minor-role reduction pursuant to the Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3B1.2(b); and 2) the district court failed to consider the requisite sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Valdez argues that the district court erred in failing to award him a minor-role reduction pursuant to the Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3B1.2(b). We review the district court\u2019s finding regarding a minor-role reduction for clear error. <em>United States v. Ryan, </em>289 F.3d 1339, 1348 (11th Cir.2002). Valdez has the burden of establishing that his role was minor by a preponderance of evidence. <em>Id. </em>\u201cOnly if the defendant can establish that [ ]he played a relatively minor role in the conduct for which [ ]he has already been held accountable\u2014not a minor role in any larger criminal conspiracy\u2019 may a downward adjustment be applied. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">At sentencing, Valdez did not object to the factual accuracy of the presentence report. The report indicated that Valdez was one of five crew members on a boat transporting approximately 2,627 kilograms of cocaine. In addition, when the crew encountered the United States Coast Guard, all members of the crew discarded numerous bales of cocaine, which were later recovered. Based on these facts, the district court\u2019s finding that Valdez played a role similar to others and, therefore, failed to show that he was substantially less culpable than other participants in the conspiracy, is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">Valdez also claims that the district court failed to sentence him pursuant to the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He argues that he should have been given a lesser sentence because he had no criminal history, was poor, was from a third world nation ravished by civil war, and only minimally participated in the offense. The government responds by saying that the district court explicitly stated it considered the factors in \u00a7 3553(a), and the court could have reasonably imposed a greater sentence under the guidelines based on the quantity of cocaine recovered by authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Supreme Court held that sentences are to be reviewed for \u201creasonableness.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 261-62, 125 S.Ct. 738. Moreover, we have held that we will review whether a sentence is reasonable in light of the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005); <em>see Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 261, 125 S.Ct. 738. However, we have also held that \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-12\">The record in this case reflects that the district court adequately and properly considered the sentencing factors set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>\u00a7 3553(a). At sentencing, the district court explicitly noted that \u201c[a]fter considering the advisory sentencing guidelines and all factors identified in Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(a)(1) through (7), [the] Court finds that the sentence imposed is sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, upon review of the sentencing transcript and the presentence investigation report, and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error with respect to Valdez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A_P\">. The district court also stated, \"the Court having reviewed the presentence report pursuant to Title 18, United States Code, Section 3551 and 3553 ... it is the judgement of the Court that the defendant ... is hereby committed to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons ... for a term of 135 months.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
