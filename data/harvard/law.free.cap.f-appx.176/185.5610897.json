We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-19\">When the BIA issues a short opinion affirming the IJ\u2019s decision in part and modifying it in part, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s opinion as modified by the BIA. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. DOJ, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, overturning them only if any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-20\">Chen correctly points out that the IJ labeled her testimony as \u201cinternally inconsistent,\u201d without identifying any inconsistencies in her testimony. However, given the context in which that statement was made, we are confident that the IJ was referring to the fact that her testimony was inconsistent with that of her husband. The IJ found, and the BIA agreed, that there were numerous inconsistencies between Chen\u2019s testimony and that of her husband. Based on the record before us, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ and BIA\u2019s adverse credibility ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>We do not review Chen\u2019s withholding of removal and CAT claims, because Chen has failed to present any factual or legal arguments as to why she is entitled to such relief. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 542 n. 1, 546 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
