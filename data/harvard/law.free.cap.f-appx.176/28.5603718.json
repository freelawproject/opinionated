George, United States District Judge for the District of Nevada, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b57-14\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b57-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b57-16\">On August 18, 1992, in the Southern District of West Virginia, Pugh was convicted on a plea of guilty to possession of firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(g)(1), and sentenced to prison for a term of 92 months, to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release. On October 13, 1999, Pugh was released from prison and his term of supervised release commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-17\">On September 12, 2002, a Southern District of West Virginia probation officer petitioned the district court to revoke Pugh\u2019s supervised release. The petition stated that Pugh had been arrested on September 9, 2002, by the Santa Rosa County, Florida sheriffs office for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The arresting officers discovered him riding on the passenger\u2019s seat of a vehicle driven by Thelma Holt. Holt told the officers that Pugh and an accomplice, Scott Bowers, who was in the back seat, had carjacked her and her automobile. It turned out that Pugh, Bowers and Holt were conspiring to rob a local business and that the officers interrupted their plan. The district court granted the petition and issued a warrant for Pugh\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-18\">On September 25, 2002, the court entered an order transferring jurisdiction of the case and Pugh\u2019s supervised release to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>the Northern District of Florida. The case was assigned to Chief Judge Roger Vinson, and given Case No. 02-00099-CR-3-RV.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">On January 22, Judge Vinson entered a judgment in Case No. 02-00099-CR-3-RV, revoking Pugh\u2019s supervised release and sentencing him to prison for 21 months. Pugh appealed that judgment, Appeal No. 03-10588.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">On November 19, 2002, while the petition for revocation of supervised release was pending in No. 02-00099-CR-3-RV, a Northern District of Florida grand jury indicted Pugh for possessing the firearm on September 9, 2002, as described in the petition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(c)(l)(C)(i). The indictment also charged him, in Count Two, with possession of ammunition on August 18, 2002, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(g) and 924(c)(l)(C)(i). This case was assigned to Chief Judge Vinson and given Case No. 02- 00110-CR-3-RV.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Pugh entered a not guilty plea, and the case went to trial. The jury found Pugh guilty on both counts, and, on April 25, 2003, Judge Vinson sentenced him to consecutive prison terms of 120 months on Count One and 108 months on Count Two, for a total of 228 months. Pugh appealed his convictions and sentences. Appeal No. 03- 12463.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">The two appeals were consolidated, and on December 29, 2003, we affirmed the district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release, and Pugh\u2019s convictions on two counts for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(c)(l)(C)(i), but we vacated the sentences imposed on those counts and remanded the case for resentencing. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>90 Fed.Appx. 386 (11th Cir.2003) and 90 Fed.Appx. 388 (not published).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">On March 25, 2004, Judge Vinson resentenced Pugh in No. 02-00110-CR-3-RV, imposing consecutive prison terms of 120 months on Count One and 90 months on Count Two, for a total of 210 months. The court\u2019s judgment provided that the 210 months would be consecutive to the 21 months the court imposed after revoking Pugh\u2019s supervised release in the Southern District of West Virginia case.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">THE INSTANT CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b58-12\">With this background in mind, we address the case before us, No. 05-10677. The indictment in this case was returned by a Northern District of Florida grand jury on August 17, 2004. In one count, the indictment alleged that on April 25, 2003, during the sentencing hearing in Case No. 02-00100-CR-3-RV, Pugh</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A23\">did knowingly and corruptly and by threats willfully endeavor to influence, intimidate and impede the due administration of justice in the matter of <em>United States v. Brian A. Pugh </em>... by threatening an officer of the court, United States Probation Officer Donna Easter-ling, in the discharge of her duty during a sentencing proceeding, in violation of [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-13\">The case was assigned to Judge Lacey Collier. At arraignment, Pugh, represented by the Federal Public Defender\u2019s office, pled not guilty. Following the disposition of several motions Pugh filed pretrial, the case proceeded to trial before a jury on November 9, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-14\">The Government\u2019s proof established that Officer Easterling was the probation officer assigned to Pugh\u2019s case, that she interviewed him at the Rosa County jail, that she prepared the presentence investigation report (PSI) for the district court, which was adverse to Pugh, and that she was present at Pugh\u2019s sentencing hearing on April 25, 2003. The court reporter at the hearing, Warren Rayborn, observed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>behavior that led to Pugh\u2019s indictment. He described that behavior; it occurred while Pugh\u2019s attorney, Stephen Sutherland, was presenting Pugh\u2019s objections to the PSI Officer Easterling had prepared for the court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">A [Rayborn]. Pugh was standing\u2014initially standing next to Mr. Sutherland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJm\">Q [Prosecutor]. Apparently Mr. Sutherland is making a number of objections during the course of the proceeding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASz\">A. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">Q. And the [chief] judge is hearing argument and ruling on the objections?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AC\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">Q. Did there come a point in time when you observed something in the proceedings that you stopped the proceedings and called it to the attention of the chief judge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-9\">Q. Tell me what you saw and what you did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-10\">A. Mr. Pugh, through his counsel, stated that he would like to sit down, and the marshals brought him a chair, and they actually sat him down right where he was standing initially. And as Mr. Sutherland was going through his argument on one objection, which I don\u2019t remember which objection it was, but Mr. Pugh seemed very uncomfortable with the proceedings and very unhappy with what was going on. Ms. Easterling was sitting in the jury box at the time, the probation officer for Mr. Pugh. And he turns towards Ms. Easterling and with a clenched fist and a very rigid ... index finger and pulled his finger across his throat looking at her and mouthed the words, You bitch,\u2019 not out loud, but I could read his lips. And that\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s when I just\u2014it kind of startled me. So I stood up and talked to Judge Vinson over the bench privately, just leaned over the bench and told him what I had seen. And Judge Vinson was obviously looking down at his paperwork and not looking at Mr. Pugh until I brought it to his attention, and that\u2019s when things stopped for a moment, and then we regrouped and continued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-12\">Q. From looking at what you saw, did you perceive it as a threat to Ms. Easterling?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-13\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-14\">Part of the Government\u2019s evidence was the transcript of the exchange that took place between Judge Vinson and Pugh after Rayborn told the judge what he had observed. Here is part of that exchange.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Am8\">THE DEFENDANT: I didn\u2019t threaten the probation officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-15\">THE COURT: What did you do then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWS\">THE DEFENDANT: All I did was\u2014I did do this (Indicating) motion, but I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ\">THE COURT: And you didn\u2019t mouth\u2014 you didn\u2019t mouth other words, like you bitch?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-16\">THE DEFENDANT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-17\">THE COURT: And what else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-18\">THE DEFENDANT: Well, I did mouth those words, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-19\">THE COURT: What?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-20\">THE DEFENDANT:\u2014I didn\u2019t threaten her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-21\">The trial lasted one day. At the close of the Government\u2019s case in chief, Pugh moved the court for judgment of acquittal. The court postponed its ruling on the motion until it could hear argument of counsel. After hearing argument, the court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-22\">Pugh took the stand in his own defense; he was the sole defense witness. On a brief direct examination, he said did not intend to \u201cthreaten\u201d Officer Easterling. On cross examination, in response to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>question, \u201cDid you look at Ms. Easterling during the sentencing ... and make a threat slashing motion to your neck,\u201d Pugh said: \u201cYes sir, I looked at her, and I did make a motion. It wasn\u2019t with my finger. It was with my hand.... I said, \u2018This is a bitch, man.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">The jury found Pugh guilty as charged, and on January 25, 2005, Judge Collier sentenced him to a prison term of 120 months, to be served consecutive to the sentences imposed in Case No. 02-00110-CR-3-RV. Pugh now appeals his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Pugh challenges his conviction on several grounds. He seeks a judgment of acquittal or the dismissal of his indictment on two grounds: (1) the evidence was insufficient to convict, and (2) he was subjected to \u201cvindictive prosecution.\u201d As alternative relief, he seeks a new trial because (3) the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for change of venue; (4) the district court constructively amended the indictment; (5) the court abused its discretion in permitting the Government to introduce evidence of collateral offenses and bad acts pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 404(b); (6) the court infringed his right against self-incrimination by allowing the Government to introduce statements he made, i.e., the portion of the transcript of the April 25, 2003 sentencing hearing set out above; (7) the court erred in denying his request to present the testimony of those present at the April 25, 2003 sentencing hearing, including Judge Vinson; (8) the court abused its discretion in denying his attorney\u2019s motion to withdraw and the appointment of substitute counsel; (9) the court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the case on the basis of the Government\u2019s failure to produce the \u201cwrit/detainer that caused [his] transfer ... from the Middle District of Pennsylvania to the Northern District of Florida\u201d;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (10) the court erred in denying his motion to dismiss due to the delay in bringing his case to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">Pugh challenges his sentence on these grounds: (11) the court abused its discretion in denying his request for a continuance of the sentencing hearing; (12) the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the court from imposing any sentence at all because a sentence would punish him for the conduct charged in Case No. 02-00110-CR-3-RV for which he had already been sentenced; and (13) the sentence he received is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">After hearing oral argument and considering the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Pugh\u2019s conviction and sentence. Addressing his conviction, we find nothing in the record that supports the notion that Pugh was subjected to vindictive prosecution. Regarding the sufficiency of the evidence, it is clear to us that the jury was presented with enough probative evidence to find him guilty as charged. Pugh effectively admitted to Judge Vinson at the April 25, 2003 sentencing hearing and to the jury at trial that, looking straight at Officer Easterling, he made the slashing motion the court reporter described and uttered the word \u201cbitch.\u201d All that the jury had to decide was whether his conduct was threatening to Easterling and whether he engaged it for the purpose alleged in the indictment. This was clearly a matter for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">In the light of the record, Pugh\u2019s grounds for a new trial are meritless. Only one ground merits comment, Pugh\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>argument that Judge Vinson was required to advise Pugh\u2014before addressing and questioning him during the April 25, 2003 sentencing hearing\u2014of his right to remain silent. Pugh contends that before asking him whether what the court reporter related to the court had actually occurred, the court was required to inform him of his constitutional right to remain silent because it should have known that the elicited statements could incriminate Pugh.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Pugh challenged the admissibility of his responses to Judge Vinson in a pretrial motion to suppress. The Government\u2019s response was that it would not use Pugh\u2019s statements in its case in chief; rather, it would use them for impeachment if Pugh took the stand and contradicted what he told the judge. The court deferred ruling on the motion. At trial, Pugh contradicted his statements to Judge Vinson and the Government impeached him with the transcript of what he said to the court at the sentencing hearing. Pugh\u2019s counsel did not object. The impeachment was appropriate. <em>See Harris v. New York, </em>401 U.S. 222, 225, 91 S.Ct. 643, 645, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Turning to Pugh\u2019s attacks on his sentence, we find no reason for vacating the sentence and remanding the case for resentencing. Nothing in the record supports his claim that the court abused its discretion in not postponing the sentencing hearing. His double jeopardy claim is based on the notion that in sentencing him on remand in Case No. 02-00110-CR-3-RV, Judge Vinson enhanced Pugh\u2019s sentences for obstruction of justice in part because of the threats against Officer Easterling at the earlier sentencing hearing, on April 25, 2003. The additional acts that obstructed justice were that Pugh had threatened a Supervising Deputy U.S. Marshal; he testified falsely on 35 occasions at his trial; and he committed battery on his jail cellmate. We have great difficulty in discerning how Judge Vinson\u2019s inclusion of the threats against Easterling among the other acts of obstruction precluded Judge Collier from punishing Pugh for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503. We therefore find no merit in Pugh\u2019s double jeopardy claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">Pugh\u2019s final attack on his sentence appears to be two-fold. First, the district court committed clear error in determining the sentence range under the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174 (11th Cir.2005). Alternatively, if the court did not commit clear error in this respect, the sentence it imposed is unreasonable because the court failed properly to consider the sentencing purposes listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We find no clear error in the court\u2019s determination of the sentence range, 110 to 137 months imprisonment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court explicitly treated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Guidelines as advisory and imposed a sentence of 120 months, a sentence that was both within the guideline range and the maximum that the law allows. After imposing sentence, the court elicited the parties\u2019 objections. After noting his previous objections, Pugh\u2019s counsel did not present the objection he makes here\u2014that the court failed to consider the sentencing purposes of \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">\u201cWhere the district court has offered the opportunity to object and a party is silent or fails to state the grounds for objection, objections to the sentence will be waived for purposes of appeal, and this court will not entertain an appeal based upon such objections unless refusal to do so would result in manifest injustice.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>899 F.2d 1097, 1103 (11th Cir.1990). The district court did not state on the record how the sentence it imposed satisfied the sentencing purposes listed in \u00a7 3553(a). We are aware of those purposes and are familiar with the sentencing record in this case\u2014that is, everything in the record that relates to the \u00a7 3553(a) purposes\u2014and we cannot say that Pugh\u2019s sentence is unreasonable. In that it is not unreasonable, affirming the sentence would not result in a manifest injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b60-6\">. At the time the indictment in this case was returned, Pugh was incarcerated at FCI-Allenwood in Whitedeer, Pennsylvania.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b61-7\">. Pugh contends that, in allowing the statements to be used for impeachment, the court erred in two respects. First, the statements were involuntary and, thus, could not be used for impeachment. As far as we can tell, Pugh did not present the involuntariness issue to the district court in support of his motion to suppress. We find nothing in the record indicating that his responses to the court\u2019s questions were involuntary. He made them in the presence of his own attorney, who did not object to the court's questioning. Second, he contends that the court erred in not giving the jury a limiting instruction\u2014that the statements could be considered for impeachment only, not as substantive evidence. Pugh did not request a limiting instruction; thus, to prevail on the point, he must demonstrate plain error\u2014that is, that the court had a duty to instruct the jury on its own initiative. We find no case establishing such duty in circumstances such as these.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b61-12\">. Pugh urged the court to \"group\u201d the offense in the instant case with the offenses in Case No. 02-00110-CR-3-JV and, after doing so, to impose a sentence of 18 months imprisonment consecutive to the 210 months of im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>prisonment imposed in that case, on March 25, 2004. Pugh contends that the court's failure to effect such grouping\u2014in two separate cases that could not possibly have been tried together\u2014constituted an erroneous application of the Guidelines. Pugh cites no authority for that proposition, and we find none.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
