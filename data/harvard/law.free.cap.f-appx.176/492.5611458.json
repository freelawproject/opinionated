We vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">\n<em>I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">Without the benefit of a plea agreement, Glenn Dordain pled guilty to one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and one count of possession of less than ten grams of heroin with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Dordain signed a stipulation in which he conceded that the government would have proven that Dordain possessed two firearms, that heroin was found in his toilet, and that he purchased the firearms \u201con the street ... for protection.\u201d Dordain confirmed these facts under oath at rearraignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">The presentece report assigned Dordain a base offense level of 20 and a three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. The PSR recommended a four-level adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) because Dordain possessed a firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d a felony offense\u2014here, the possession of heroin. Dordain objected to the PSR, arguing that the four-level adjustment was improper under <em>Blakely v. </em>Washington<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because the facts underlying the adjustment were neither found by a jury nor admitted by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-12\">At sentencing, Dordain again admitted both possession of a firearm and possession of heroin. He argued that the adjustment was inappropriate because the admitted-to facts were insufficient to show a nexus between the firearms and the heroin, as is necessary to impose the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) adjustment. The district court rejected Dordain\u2019s objection. Sentencing Dordain before the Supreme Court decided <em>United States v. Booker, </em>the district court concluded that, even if <em>Blakely </em>applied to the federal sentencing guidelines, the facts admitted to by Dordain were sufficient to impose the adjustment. The court sentenced Dordain to 87 months imprisonment (a level exceeding the guideline range absent the challenged enhancement) and a three-year term of supervised release. Dordain filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-13\">\n<em>II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b521-14\">Dordain challenges his sentence on appeal, contending that his admissions are insufficient to impose the adjustment under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) because he never admitted that there was a connection between possession of the firearm and possession of the heroin. Further, Dordain argues that his admission to purchasing the gun for \u201cprotection\u201d is insufficient to show the needed connection. The government argues that the admissions were sufficient and, regardless, that any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-15\">The Supreme Court held in <em>United States v. Booker </em>that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), a four-level adjustment is proper if the defendant \u201cused or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with a felony offense.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A district court\u2019s determination of the \u201cin connection with\u201d requirement is a factual finding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Although admitted facts will not give rise to a valid <em>Booker </em>claim,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the defendant must admit all facts necessary to a sentence enhancement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 2K2.1(b)(5) requires proof of three things: (1) that the defendant possessed a firearm, (2) that the defendant committed a felony offense, and (3) that the defendant possessed the firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d the commission of the felony offense. Here, Dordain admitted to the first two, but he did not admit that he possessed the firearm in connection with his possession of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Further, Dordain\u2019s statement that he possessed the firearm for \u201cprotection\u201d is insufficient, by itself, to compel a conclusion that he possessed the firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d the possession of heroin. A person can possess a firearm for a variety of reasons, ranging from self-protection to hunting enthusiast to facilitating drug-related crimes. Perhaps our conclusion would be different if the guns and drugs are found in temporal and spatial proximity, but that is not the case here. Dordain admitted only the he kept a firearm under his mattress, and the officers searching his apartment found two weapons there. The drugs, rather, were found in the toilet. There is no indication that the guns were facilitating Dordain\u2019s commission of the heroin possession offense. The district court inferred the \u201cin connection with\u201d requirement, and such inference is error under <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-16\">\n<em>Ill</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b522-17\">The government concedes that Dordain preserved his <em>Booker </em>claim by objecting at the district court and citing Blakely,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A sentence based on a preserved <em>Booker </em>error should be vacated unless the error is harmless.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Here, the government cannot show beyond a reasonable doubt \u201cthat the district court would have imposed the same sentence absent the error.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We have held that the government can show harmless error in two circumstances: (1) when the district court specifically says that it would not have given the defendant a lower sentence even if it were not bound by mandatory guidelines; and (2) when the district court refuses to allow a defendant to serve his federal and state sentences concurrently.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Neither scenario is present in this case. Nor does anything in this record suffice to establish harmlessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>\n<em>IV</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Accordingly, we VACATE Doradin\u2019s sentence and REMAND to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b521-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
