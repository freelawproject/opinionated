We dismiss the appeal because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-22\">Under Rule 4(b)(l)(A)(I) of the Rules of Appellate Procedure, criminal defendants have ten days from the entry of final judgment to note an appeal. A criminal judgment is \u201centered\u201d when it is entered on the criminal docket. Rule 4(b)(6). The district court may, \u201cbefore or after the time has expired, with or without motion and notice,\u201d extend the appeal period upon a finding of excusable neglect or good cause. Rule 4(b)(4). The extension, however, is \u201cfor a period not to exceed 30 days from the expiration of the time otherwise prescribed by this Rule 4(b).\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985). Compliance with Rule 4(b) is mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>Smith v. Barry, </em>502 U.S. 244, 248, 112 S.Ct. 678, 116 L.Ed.2d 678 (1992); <em>United States v. Raynor, </em>939 F.2d 191, 197 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-23\">Walters\u2019s final judgment of conviction was entered on the district court\u2019s docket on May 16, 2005. Even according Walters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>the benefit of <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988), in determining his filing date and accepting the date on the document construed as a notice of appeal (November 22, 2005) as the date he relayed a notice of appeal to prison officials for mailing, his notice of appeal was filed well beyond both the ten-day appeal period and the additional thirty-day excusable neglect period. Both parties agree in their filings that Walters\u2019s notice of appeal is late and that this Court therefore lacks appellate jurisdiction.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">We therefore dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions of the parties are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b429-15\"> If Walters\u2019s counsel in fact failed to timely file a notice of appeal as he requested, Walters must seek relief in the district court in a \u00a7 2255 action alleging ineffective assistance of counsel on that basis within that statute\u2019s one-year limitations period.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
