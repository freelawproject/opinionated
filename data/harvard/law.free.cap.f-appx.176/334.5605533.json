For the reasons stated herein, we will dismiss this appeal as legally frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">In May 2005, Awala filed a complaint and an amended complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, seeking to certify a class to vindicate the alleged violation of his and the purported class members\u2019 constitutional rights. In his complaints, Awala alleges that the defendants\u2019 failure to provide him with funds from client trust accounts with which to finance his defense in his criminal prosecution violates his right to due process, to counsel, and to a fair trial. He argues that these funds were intended to be used for legal services for indigent persons and that he and the other members of the class he seeks to represent should therefore have access to these funds for use in defending against their criminal prosecutions. Specifically, Awala alleges that he needs such funds to \u201chave compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense,\u201d notwithstanding his decision to represent himself in his criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Awala named as defendants the Federal and State Public Defenders (Salem County, New Jersey), Judicial Conference of the United States Courts, Director of the Administrative Office, Government Printing Office, and the American Bar Association. He alleges that the public defenders have failed to use client trust account funds to defend criminal defendants, and in fact, that they have used such funds for their own purposes, such as to purchase mansions and sports cars. He claims that the American Bar Association and the United States Courts should \u201cinstitute a judicially superintended adversary proceeding on the question of the \u2018amount deposited by attorney in an interest-bearing trust account.\u2019 \u201d He alleges that the Government Printing Office has a contract to print and bind all Congressional publications and materials, which are then distributed to federal and state prisons, and that it failed to respond to one of his requests for information. He seeks $150 million in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">The District Court dismissed Awala\u2019s complaint and amended complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)-1915A(b)(l). The Court first held that, as a prisoner acting <em>pro se, </em>Awala would not be able to adequately represent the interests of the inmates he sought to represent as a class, and therefore the requested class could not be certified. With respect to Awala\u2019s substantive claims, the Court concluded that they were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), reasoning that successful litigation of his claims would necessarily imply the invalidity of any future conviction or sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because Awala has been granted <em>informa pauperis </em>status pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, we must first review this appeal for possible dismissal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). An appeal may be dismissed under \u00a7 1915(e) if it has no arguable basis in law or fact. <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). Awala\u2019s claims are patently without merit. Awala asserts that his constitutional rights are being infringed upon by defendants\u2019 failure to provide him with money from interest-bearing trust accounts. By state statute or court rule, each state in the union uses interest on lawyers\u2019 trust accounts (\u201cIOLTA\u201d) to pay for legal services for the needy. <em>See Brown v. Legal Found. of Wash., </em>538 U.S. 216, 220, 123 S.Ct. 1406, 155 L.Ed.2d 376 (2003); <em>Phillips v. Wash. Legal Found., </em>524 U.S. 156, 159, 118 S.Ct. 1925, 141 L.Ed.2d 174 (1998). In the instant lawsuit, Awala has neither demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>strated that any of the defendants named in his complaints receive IOLTA funds nor that he nor any other indigent prisoner has a constitutional right to such funds for use in defense of their criminal prosecutions. As such, his claims have no arguable basis in law or fact. This appeal will therefore be dismissed under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). All other pending motions are denied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-15\">. We have considered the arguments raised in Appellees\u2019 motions for summary affirmance, but need not take action pursuant to Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6, as we are dismissing the appeal pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). We have also considered the arguments raised in Appellant\u2019s document entitled \"Appendix for Appellant Volumes I &amp; II,\u201d which addresses the merits of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
