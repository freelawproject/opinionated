We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo due process claims, <em>Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 775, 779 (9th Cir.2001), and review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>de Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>374 F.3d 759, 761 (9th Cir.2004). We grant the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">The BIA abused its discretion by failing to address Petitioners\u2019 contention that they did not receive the BIA\u2019s May 25, 2001 decision. <em>See Sagaydak v. Gonzales, </em>405 F.3d 1035, 1040 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201cThe BIA [is] not free to ignore arguments raised by a Petitioner.\u201d) The BIA\u2019s failure to address the issue is of particular concern because the record shows that the decision was sent to the wrong attorney, albeit at the correct address. Accordingly, we remand to the BIA to consider Petitioners\u2019 contention that their motion to reopen should not be considered untimely as they never received the May 25, 2001 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b796-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
