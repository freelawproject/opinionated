He was eighteen years old at the time. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) immediately detained him. In an interview at the airport, an INS officer informed Petitioner through an interpreter that the law of the United States provided protection to persons who would face persecution, harm or torture if returned to their home country, and that if he had fear of being sent home to China, he should say so now because he might not have a second chance. The officer also told Petitioner that he would have an opportunity to speak confidentially to another immigration officer who would determine whether he should not be removed from the United States because of such fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-22\">After being placed under oath, Petitioner stated that he understood what the INS officer had said. In response to questions put to him by the officer, he said that he had come to the United States for an education\u2014that Chinese education is lack<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>ing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When asked if he would be harmed if returned to China, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t think I would be harmed.\u201d He had no problems with the Chinese government.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">The INS issued a Notice to Appear, alleging that Petitioner was removable under the INA. Petitioner admitted the factual allegations in the Notice to Appeal, conceded removability, and requested asylum, withholding of removal under the INA, and protection under the U.N. Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). In his application for such relief, Petitioner gave a reason for coming to the United States that differed materially from the one he had given the INS officer at the Los Angeles airport. He stated that he had come to the United States because he had been mistreated by Chinese authorities\u2014on account of his Falun Gong activity\u2014and, according to his mother, the police wanted to arrest him. He said that if sent back to China, the police would arrest him not only because of his Falun Gong activity, but also because he had left China illegally.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-15\">An Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) held a hearing on Petitioner\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal and CAT relief. Petitioner was his only witness. He repeated (albeit in greater detail) what he had stated in his asylum application. The Government\u2019s attorney, and the IJ as well, asked Petitioner to explain the inconsistency between what he told the INS officer at the Los Angeles airport\u2014which was that he came to the United States for an education\u2014and what he was telling the court\u2014that he came here to avoid persecution for his Falun Gong activity. All he could say was that \u201cat the time, I just got off the plane, then, I don\u2019t know if I tell the truth, I will send [sic] back to China.\u201d When faced with his earlier statement to the INS officer\u2014that he would not be harmed if returned to China\u2014he responded that he could not remember what he had said.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-16\">The IJ found Petitioner\u2019s hearing testimony not credible. And because he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>not corroborated his story with other testimony\u2014for example, from the uncle with whom he had been living\u2014the IJ denied his request for asylum, withholding of removal and CAT protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">Petitioner appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d). The BIA affirmed, adopting the decision without opinion. Petitioner now seeks review in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">This case presents but one issue: whether substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision and, in particular, the IJ\u2019s\u2019 finding that Petitioner\u2019s testimony was not credible.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In his dispositive order, the IJ went to great length to explain why Petitioner\u2019s testimony was not worthy of belief. We cannot fault his explanation. The agency\u2019s decision must be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">. The relevant questions and Petitioner\u2019s responses were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-6\">Q: What is the purpose of your trip to the United States?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-7\">A: Because I don\u2019t like the education of China. They teach Marxism.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-8\">Q: Are you coming to live in the United States?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-9\">A: Yes and I would like to come to study here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-10\">Q: Why did you leave [China]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-11\">A: Because the education in China is no good and the information is lacking. Also, the teachers will give the students physical punishment. And for those who teach English, their English is no good, so I want to come here to study.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1030-12\">. The relevant questions and answers are these:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-13\">Q: Do you have any fear or concern about being returned to [China]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-14\">A: Probably, I will be worried. I only worry that if I am sent back to China that in the future I wouldn't be educated. I wouldn't have the knowledge that I need. Also, China has no human rights to speak about. I heard that the United States is a country of human rights and of freedom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A00\">Q: Would you be harmed if you are returned to [China]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Atg4\">A: If I get sent back to China, I wouldn\u2019t receive an education. I don't think I would be harmed. I am only thinking about studying in China, the way teachers treat the students.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ays\">Q: Do you have any problems with the Chinese government?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AE74\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJEL\">Q: Have you ever been arrested?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoDV\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq6\">Q: Do you have any questions or is there anything else you would like to add?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxM\">A: I would like to go to school here. I bet you give me the chance. No, I have no questions.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1031-10\">.
