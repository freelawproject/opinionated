As a threshold matter, this court is obligated to examine sua sponte the basis of its jurisdiction. <em>See Williams v. Chater, </em>87 F.3d 702, 704 (5th Cir.1996). At the same time he filed his notice of appeal, Ayers also filed a \u201cMotion and Order to Enter Objection,\u201d seeking reconsideration of the district court\u2019s dismissal order, which we construe as a timely-filed Rule 59(e) motion. <em>See Shepherd v. Int\u2019l Paper Co., </em>372 F.3d 326, 328 n. 1 (5th Cir.2004). The filing of a timely Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion renders a notice of appeal ineffective until the district court enters an order disposing of the motion. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(B)(i). Ayers\u2019s notice of appeal is, therefore, ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-21\">Consequently, this case must be remanded, and the record returned, so that the district court may rule on Ayers\u2019s post-judgment motion \u201cas expeditiously as possible, consistent with a just and fair disposition thereof.\u201d <em>Burt v. Ware, </em>14 F.3d 256, 261 (5th Cir.1994). The clerk of this court shall process the appeal immediately upon the return of the case from the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-22\">LIMITED REMAND.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b653-17\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
