The Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) determined that Silver should be held responsible for 2.143 kilograms of cocaine base distributed as part of the conspiracy, based in part upon information from witnesses who did not testify at trial. This recommended amount yielded a base offense level of 38. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l). The PSR also recommended that the sentencing court impose a two-level firearm enhancement, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), and reject a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). Accordingly, the total offense level assigned by the PSR was 40. After determining that Silver\u2019s criminal history placed him in category I, the PSR arrived at a recommended sentencing range of 292 to 365 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The district court concluded that under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), Silver\u2019s \u201cbase offense level may not be based on any facts not found specifically by the jury,\u201d J.A. 156, and determined that the appropriate base offense level was 32, which is prescribed by the \u201cguidelines for possession with intent to distribute more than [50 grams of] cocaine base.\u201d J.A. 156. Essentially, the district court read <em>Booker </em>as precluding it from considering, for sentencing purposes, any facts not specifically presented to and found by the jury-</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">The district court also determined, contrary to the recommendation of the PSR, that a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility was appropriate even though Silver pled not guilty and testified at trial that he did not sell crack to various witnesses who claimed that they made purchases from him. After adopting the two-level firearm enhancement, the district court arrived at a total offense level of 32, yielding a sentencing range of 121 to 151 months, and imposed a low-end sentence of 121 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">The Government appeals, arguing that the district court erroneously determined that it could not consider, for purposes of determining the appropriate offense level, \u201cany facts not found specifically by the jury.\u201d J.A. 156. In <em>Booker, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence based on the sentencing court\u2019s factual determinations offends the Sixth Amendment. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 226-30, 243\u201446, 125 S.Ct. 738. Therefore, <em>Booker </em>severed and excised the statutory provisions mandating the application of the Guidelines; however, <em>Booker </em>clearly requires sentencing courts to continue to \u201cconsult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing,\u201d despite the now-advisory nature of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 264, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">In <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005), which was decided after the sentencing hearing in this case, we outlined the procedure that sentencing courts in this circuit should follow in light of <em>Booker. </em>First, the sentencing court must \u201ccalculate <em>(after making the appropriate findings of </em>fact) the range prescribed by the guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546 (emphasis added). Next, the court must consider whether a sentence within the advisory guideline range \u201cserves the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) and, if not, select a sentence that does serve those factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.2006). In turn, to select a sentence that serves the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the sentencing court \u201cshould first look to whether a departure is appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>based on the Guidelines\u201d and, \u201c[i]f an appropriate basis for departure exists, the district court may depart.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir. 2006). \u201cIf the resulting departure range still does not serve the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), the court may then elect to impose a non-guideline sentence (a \u2018variance sentence\u2019).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Regardless of the sentence ultimately imposed, the district court must explain its reasons for choosing a given sentence, especially if a departure or variance is involved. <em>See id.; Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546 <em>&amp; </em>n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Because <em>Booker </em>does not preclude a sentencing court\u2019s consideration of facts not specifically found by the jury, we vacate Silver\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing. On remand, the district court should first calculate, based upon its own findings of fact, the appropriate sentencing range pursuant to the Guidelines. The court should then proceed to determine whether a sentence within the advisory Guideline range satisfies the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a), as explained in <em>Hughes, </em>and our recent decisions in <em>Green </em>and <em>Moreland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">In view of our conclusion that Silver must be resentenced in accordance with the procedures identified above, we need not decide the other issue raised by the Government\u2014whether the district court lacked a sufficient basis for downwardly adjusting Silver\u2019s offense level for acceptance of responsibility. We note, however, that Silver pled not guilty, forced the government to proceed to trial, and then testified at trial that he did not sell crack cocaine. The Guidelines commentary explains that an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility \u201cis not intended to apply to a defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.2); <em>see United States v. Dickerson, </em>114 F.3d 464, 470 (4th Cir.1997) (\u201cAlthough a defendant can remain eligible for a sentence reduction for acceptance of responsibility even when he demands a trial, this is only when a defendant goes to trial to assert and preserve issues that do not relate to factual guilt\u2014such as a constitutional challenge to a statutory provision ____\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). Our review of the record reveals no apparent basis for awarding an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility; however, we will leave this for the district court to consider as part of Silver\u2019s resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
