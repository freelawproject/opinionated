In the consolidated case, No.. 05-55834, Popov appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his habeas corpus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">1. We deny the petition for review insofar as it contends that Popov is not removable as charged for overstaying his visa. None of the authorities cited by Popov prohibits the government from commencing removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">2. The BIA addressed Popov\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim insofar as it pertains to the revocation of his visa petition, concluding that he did not show prejudice from prior counsel\u2019s failure to challenge the revocation or to appeal it: \u2018We do not find on the face of the record ... that the DHS would have reversed itself upon receiving a response from the respondent\u2019s counsel.\u201d The BIA\u2019s use of the \u201cwould have reversed itself\u2019 standard is incorrect and an abuse of discretion. <em>See Maravilla v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (\u201cPetitioners must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s performance was so inadequate that it <em>may </em>have affected the outcome of the proceedings. They need not show that they would win or lose on any claims.\u201d (emphasis added; internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">In his pro se motion to reopen and remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel, Popov generally challenged the revocation of his visa petition, invoking the statutory language of former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1155. Because Popov\u2019s lawyer had failed to challenge the revocation at all, Popov is entitled under the standards of ineffectiveness applicable to removal proceedings to a presumption of prejudice that is not rebutted if he shows a plausible ground for relief. <em>See Siong v. INS, </em>376 F.3d 1030, 1037-38 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-11\">We conclude that Popov satisfied the prejudice requirement by showing a plausible ground for relief, based on law in effect at the time the ineffective assistance of counsel was rendered. The Second Circuit held in <em>Firstland International, Inc. v. INS, </em>377 F.3d 127 (2d Cir.2004), that \u201cSection 1155 did not authorize the INS\u2019s decision to revoke [a] visa p\u00e9tition after [the beneficiary] had entered the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129. That \u00a7 1155 has been amended in a manner the government contends permits the revocation is not pertinent to the prejudice issue, as a timely challenge may have succeeded in forestalling the revocation under the former statute in time to permit Popov\u2019s adjustment of status. <em>See Castillo-Perez v. INS, </em>212 F.3d 518, 528 (9th Cir.2000) (stating that prejudice analysis should not be affected by legal changes depriving a petitioner of \u201cthe benefit of the old law\u201d). We therefore grant and remand this aspect of the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-12\">The government has noted BIA precedent holding that the Board lacks jurisdiction over appeals by visa petition beneficiaries, as opposed to the petitioners themselves, with respect to visa petition revocations in categories other than Popov\u2019s. <em>See Matter of Sano, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 299, 1985 WL 56053 (BIA 1985). We need not decide at this juncture whether the BIA may generally assess ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to visa petition revocations. The BIA decision presently under review assumed that the Board could do so, presumably because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>the visa petition revocation at issue underlay the denial of Popov\u2019s adjustment of status, and, if improper, affected the validity of the adjustment of status proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">3. With respect to Popov\u2019s cancellation of removal application, the BIA\u2019s decision did not address two of Popov\u2019s objections to the IJ\u2019s denial of relief: that the IJ improperly denied prior counsel\u2019s motion to reopen, and that prior counsel also provided ineffective assistance with regard to the cancellation issue. \u201cThis court has held that the BIA must indicate with specificity that it heard and considered petitioner\u2019s claims.\u201d <em>Maravilla, </em>381 F.3d at 858 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As the BIA did not meet this standard, we remand this aspect of the petition for review as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">4. Given our resolution of Popov\u2019s petition for review, it may not be necessary for us to decide Popov\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief. We therefore vacate submission of case No. OS-55334 pending further order of the court, and hold it in abeyance pending the BIA\u2019s ruling on remand. The parties are directed to notify the court immediately after the BIA\u2019s decision on remand. This panel shall retain jurisdiction over any further petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">No. 05-55334: SUBMISSION VACATED.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">No. 05-70001: PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; GRANTED in part; REMANDED. Costs on appeal are awarded to Popov.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b905-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b906-7\">. We note, and the government acknowledges, that the BIA's statement that Popov \"did not comply with the requirements set forth in <em>Matter of Lozada,\u201d </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637, 1988 WL 235454 (BIA 1988), is unexplained and, in our view, unsupported by the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
