After a two-day trial, a jury found Pedroza guilty of possession with intent to distribute. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(B)(ii). \u2019 Pedroza appeals his conviction, arguing that the district court erred in giving the jury an \u201costrich\u201d instruction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-23\">Pedroza worked for his cousin Christopher Osinger, who repossessed cars. According to Pedroza\u2019s account at trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>Osinger paid him to clean up the repossessed cars, inventory the personal property inside the cars, and drive the repos. Pedroza testified that on January 16, 2002, Osinger asked him to travel with him to Kentucky to look for cars. The next day the two men drove a pickup truck from Chicago to Jeffersonville, Indiana, where they stopped and got a hotel room. Pedroza testified he thought they stopped so they could get some sleep before repossessing cars that night. While at the hotel, Pedroza heard Osinger talking on the telephone, though he insisted that he did not hear the content of that conversation because he was not listening. Then, \u201cout of nowhere,\u201d Osinger told Pedroza, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go.\u201d Pedroza testified that he did not know where they were going and did not ask, and even though Osinger talked on the phone en route, he intentionally ignored Osinger\u2019s conversation because, he said, it was \u201cnone of [his] business.\u201d He stated, however, that \u201c[w]hen we left the hotel I had a feeling that something\u2014I was left out of something.\u201d Pedroza nonetheless rode with Osinger to a nearby McDonald\u2019s where he saw Dennis Skirvin, a family friend, standing in the parking lot. Osinger parked, and while Osinger remained in the pickup, Pedroza got out because, he said, \u201cit was already agreed that I would just go get something to eat for us.\u201d Pedroza then saw Skirvin approach the car and speak with Osinger through the driver\u2019s side window. Pedroza also approached the driver\u2019s side window because, he said, he had left his money inside the pickup and wanted to get money from Osinger. Skirvin, however, ordered him to get back in the vehicle. Only then, Pedroza insisted, did he see for the first time two packages near the pickup\u2019s center console that he recognized as drugs. He maintained that he was \u201cjust with\u201d Osinger and denied participating in the transaction or knowing that drugs were in the pickup. He also denied knowing that Osinger was a drug dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Skirvin, testifying on the government\u2019s behalf, told a different story. While acting as a government informant, he assisted police in arranging a purchase of two kilograms of cocaine from Osinger. When Osinger and Pedroza arrived at the McDonald\u2019s parking lot, Skirvin said, he approached the driver\u2019s side window and told Osinger, who was in the driver\u2019s seat, \u201c[L]et me see the merchandise.\u201d Skirvin testified Osinger turned to Pedroza, who was seated next to him, and said \u201cGive me that bag.\u201d Pedroza then, according to Skirvin, picked up a black plastic bag from the floor of the pickup near his legs and handed it to Osinger, who put the bag on his lap and opened it so that Skirvin could inspect its contents. At about that time, Skirvin said, Pedroza got out of the pickup and approached him from around the front of the vehicle. Skirvin testified that he believed Pedroza was coming to collect the money, so he told Pedroza: \u201cNo, get back into the truck. Let\u2019s get this deal done.\u201d Pedroza returned to the passenger seat while Skirvin continued to inspect the cocaine. Skirvin testified that he then said, \u2018Wait right here, I\u2019m going to get your money,\u201d and walked away while Osinger and Pedroza stayed in the vehicle. Skirvin alerted the police that Osinger and Pedroza had the drugs, and the police made the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">The district court instructed the jury that to convict Pedroza under \u00a7 841, it must find beyond a reasonable doubt that he \u201cknowingly or intentionally possessed a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine ... with intent to distribute it.\u201d Over Pedroza\u2019s objection the court defined \u201cknowingly\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-8\">When the word \u201cknowingly\u201d is used in these instructions, it means that the defendant realized what he was doing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>was aware of the nature of his conduct, and did not act through ignorance, mistake or accident. Knowledge may be proved by the defendant\u2019s conduct, and by all the facts and circumstances surrounding the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-4\">You may infer knowledge from a combination of suspicion and indifference to the truth. If you find that a person had a strong suspicion that things were not what they seemed or that someone had withheld some important facts, yet shut his eyes for fear of what he would learn, you may conclude that he acted knowingly, as I have used that word.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The jury found Pedroza guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">On appeal Pedroza challenges the district court\u2019s decision to instruct the jury on deliberate ignorance. He does not challenge the form of the instruction but instead argues that any instruction was improper because, he contends, the evidence at trial supported only a \u201cclear cut \u2018binary choice\u2019 he either knew or did not know about the drugs in the truck. He contends the evidence was insufficient to support an inference that he purposefully avoided learning about the drug deal and that, at most, his failure to listen to Osinger\u2019s telephone conversations or look around the pickup\u2019s cab demonstrated a \u201clack of curiosity.\u201d He argues the instruction effectively allowed the jury to convict him for being negligent in not finding out about the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to give an ostrich instruction for abuse of discretion, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the government. <em>United States v. Carrillo, </em>435 F.3d 767, 780 (7th Cir.2006). An ostrich instruction is appropriate when: (1) the defendant denies guilty knowledge, and (2) there is enough evidence for a jury to infer that he deliberately avoided learning the truth. <em>United States v. Fallon, </em>348 F.3d 248, 253 (7th Cir.2003). Evidence that the defendant took overt physical steps to avoid actual knowledge supports an inference of deliberate ignorance, <em>Carrillo, </em>435 F.3d at 780, as does a defendant\u2019s \u201ccutting off of [his] normal curiosity by an effort of will,\u201d <em>United States v. Giovannetti, </em>919 F.2d 1223, 1229 (7th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Craig, </em>178 F.3d 891, 896 (7th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">In this case, the district court permissibly instructed the jury on deliberate ignorance. Contrary to Pedroza\u2019s contention that, at most, he negligently failed to discover the exact nature of Osinger\u2019s activities, Pedroza testified that he felt as if he were being \u201cleft out of something\u201d when at the hotel Osinger unexpectedly said, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go.\u201d But he nevertheless departed with Osigner, did not ask where they were going, and then intentionally ignored Osinger\u2019s telephone conversations en route. This testimony alone supports an inference that Pedroza purposefully stuck his head in the sand to avoid acquiring full knowledge of his involvement in Osinger\u2019s activities. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>929 F.2d 1224, 1227-28 (7th Cir.1991) (concluding that ostrich instruction was proper where defendant did not ask participants in drug distribution scheme why they needed him to make a trip); <em>see also United States v. Wallace, </em>212 F.3d 1000, 1004 (7th Cir.2000) (instructing that ostrich instruction is proper where defendant suspects that he is involved in \u201cshady dealings\u201d and takes steps to avoid acquiring \u201cfull or exact knowledge of the nature and extent of those dealings\u201d). Pedroza also took steps to physically distance himself from the drug deal when he attempted to leave the vehicle during the transaction. Although neither mere presence at the scene of a crime nor leaving the scene if someone suspects something is amiss is enough to establish guilt, a court may instruct a jury as to willful blindness where the facts support an inference that the defendant participated in a drug deal but left the scene of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>sale to insulate himself from guilty knowledge of the transaction. <em>See United States v. Diaz, </em>864 F.2d 544, 551 (7th Cir.1988). And the government presented substantial evidence that Pedroza had actual knowledge of the transaction. A reasonable jury therefore could have concluded either that Pedroza had actual knowledge that he was participating in a drug deal or that he had deliberately avoided confirming the truth about his involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">This court has frequently upheld the use of an ostrich instruction where a defendant transported packages containing drugs under suspicious circumstances and then denied knowledge of the packages\u2019 contents. <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>134 F.3d 855, 868-69 (7th Cir.1998) (collecting cases). This case is no exception. Moreover, when the government presents substantial evidence that a defendant had actual knowledge of the illegal activities, any error in giving an ostrich instruction is harmless. <em>See United States v. Carrillo, </em>269 F.3d 761, 770 n. 3 (7th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Graffia, </em>120 F.3d 706, 713 n. 5 (7th Cir.1997). We therefore uphold the district court\u2019s use of an ostrich instruction and AFFIRM Pedroza\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
