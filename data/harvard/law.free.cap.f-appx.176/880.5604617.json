He also argues for the first time that the court erred in sentencing him for possession of methamphetamine \u201cice\u201d rather than for the \u201cmixture\u201d to which he pled guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-22\">When Moreno pleaded grnlty to possession of more than 50g of methamphetamine, the penalty he faced was fixed at 5 to 40 years in prison. The district court committed no <em>Apprendi </em>error<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> when it considered, along with other evidence, that Moreno was in possession of \u201cice\u201d and other drugs when fixing Moreno\u2019s sentence under the Guidelines at 100 months.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-23\">However, that same determination resulted in constitutional <em>Booker </em>error<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because it lead to the significant enhancement of Moreno\u2019s sentence under mandatory sentencing guidelines. As the error was unpreserved, a limited <em>Ameline </em>remand is appropriate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-24\">He also argues that sentencing him for the greater quantity determined in the sentencing proceeding amounted to double jeopardy, because it gave the government a second chance, beyond his indictment, to prove a quantity. That is but another formulation of the argument against consideration of relevant conduct beyond that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>admitted in the plea to the indictment, and fails for the same reason. He was sentenced only once on his plea, for the crime of which he was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Moreno also argues that his sentence should not have been enganced for sales with 1,000 feet of public housing,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because neither he nor anyone else realized they were within a special or protected zone. The defendant need not be aware of the protected location to apply this enhancement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">We grant a limited remand to allow the district court to answer the question whether it would have imposed a different sentence had it viewed the Guidelines as advisory.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">AFFIRMED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b909-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
