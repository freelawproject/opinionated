He contends that he was sentenced in contravention of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-17\">Riches\u2019s plea agreement contained an express waiver of his \u201cright to appeal the sentence imposed or the manner in which it was determined,\u201d but he retained the right to appeal <em>\u201conly </em>(a) the sentence imposed above the statutory maximum; or (b) an upward departure from the Sentencing Guidelines, which has not been requested by the United States as set forth in Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(b).\u201d The Government seeks to enforce the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-22\">Our review of the record indicates that the waiver was knowing and voluntary and that, under its plain language, it bars Riches\u2019s <em>Booker </em>arguments. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 545-46 (5th Cir.2005). The waiver is not invalid merely because it was made before <em>Booker. See United States v. Burns, </em>433 F.3d 442, 450-51 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b508-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
