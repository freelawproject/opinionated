Petitioners petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) opinion which affirmed the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) denial of their application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-26\">\u2018Where, as here, the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision while adding its own reasons, we review both decisions.\u201d <em>See Kataria v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 1107, 1112 (9th Cir.2000). We review for substantial evidence an adverse credibility determination. <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-27\">The IJ offered at least one specific, cogent reason for his credibility determination based on discrepancies regarding the circumstances of the May 2000 rob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>bery. Because this goes to the heart of petitioners\u2019 claim, substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility determination. <em>See id.; see also Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 964 (9th Cir.2004) (this court is bound to accept the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding so long as one of the IJ\u2019s identified grounds is supported by substantial evidence and goes to the heart of the petitioner\u2019s claim of persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Because petitioners\u2019 did not establish eligibility for asylum, it follows that they did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Petitioners waived their claim for CAT relief by failing to raise any arguments challenging the IJ\u2019s denial of this claim in their opening brief. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b818-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
