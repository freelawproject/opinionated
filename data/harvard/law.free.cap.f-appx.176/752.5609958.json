Gonzales, </em>427 F.3d 1218, 1221-22 (9th Cir. 2005). We dismiss the petition on the asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-24\">We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 over his remaining claims. We review for substantial evidence and may reverse only if the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Rostomian v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 1088, 1089 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-25\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s withholding of removal claim because he did not show that it was more likely than not that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>he would be persecuted if returned to Syria. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Because petitioner failed to show that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured in Syria, his CAT claim fails. <em>See Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1230 (9th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b780-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
