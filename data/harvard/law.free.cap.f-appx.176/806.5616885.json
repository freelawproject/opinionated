At trial, the government introduced testimony from multiple witnesses, each of which stated that Jackson had participated and taken the lead in the murder of Victor Villareal, as well as in the attempted cover-up. The government also introduced physical evidence that corroborated these witnesses\u2019 testimony in important ways. \u201c[V]iewing th[is] evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,\u201d <em>United States v. Lynch, </em>437 F.3d 902, 915 (9th Cir.2006), and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the government, <em>see United States v. Labrada-Bustamante, </em>428 F.3d 1252, 1260 (9th Cir.2005), this evidence was more than sufficient to establish Jackson\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-18\">\u201cClaims of ineffective assistance of counsel are generally inappropriate on direct appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Ross, </em>206 F.3d 896, 900 (9th Cir.2000). Ineffective assistance claims \u201cmay be reviewed on direct appeal in two instances: 1) when the record on appeal is sufficiently developed to permit review and determination of the issue, or 2) when the legal representation is so inadequate that it obviously denies a defendant his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>967 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>F.2d 287, 290 (9th Cir.1992) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Neither of these scenarios is presented here. The record establishes some baseline facts about Jackson\u2019s attorney Rood\u2019s efforts, but it is not sufficiently developed to answer many questions about his actions. Nor does the record establish\u2014or even suggest\u2014that Rood\u2019s performance was so inadequate as to \u201cobviously den[y Jackson] his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We therefore decline to consider Jackson\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Lastly, Jackson asks for a remand under <em>United States v. Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir.2005). To receive a remand under <em>Ameline, </em>a defendant must establish that his \u201csubstantial rights\u201d have been affected by the district court mistakenly sentencing him as if the advisory sentencing guidelines were mandatory. <em>See id. </em>at 1074-75; <em>id. </em>at 1078. Here, some of Jackson\u2019s convictions require a mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment. Consequently, any other sentences that the district court imposed for Jackson\u2019s other convictions could not have affected his substantial rights, and <em>Ameline </em>does not apply-</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b835-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
