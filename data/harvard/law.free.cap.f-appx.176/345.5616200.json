We affirmed his sentence. <em>United States v. Greene, </em>108 Fed.Appx. 814 (4th Cir.2004) (unpublished). The Supreme Court subsequently granted certiorari, vacated this court\u2019s judgment in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and remanded Greene\u2019s case to this court for further proceedings. For the reasons explained below, we affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-25\">Greene\u2019s sentence was imposed before <em>Booker </em>and its predecessor, <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), were decided, and he did not raise objections to his sentence based on the mandatory nature of the sentencing guidelines or the district court\u2019s application of sentencing enhancements based on facts he did not admit. Therefore, we review his sentence for plain error. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-26\">When Greene was arrested, law enforcement officers seized methamphetamine, around fifty grams of marijuana, small <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>amounts of prescription drugs, and thirteen firearms from Greene\u2019s home. Greene made a statement in which he admitted selling 112 grams of methamphetamine. In his presentence interview with the probation officer, Greene again admitted responsibility for these drug quantities, and he did not contest the district court\u2019s determination that he was responsible for 224.051 grams of marijuana equivalent, which gave him a base offense level of 26. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(7) (2003). Greene did contest the two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm during the offense; however, the court overruled his objection and applied the enhancement pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). The resulting offense level was 28. Greene was in criminal history category I. His guideline range was 78-97 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Because Greene admitted selling 112 grams of methamphetamine, a quantity that in itself is sufficient to support the base offense level of 26 used by the district court, see USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(7) (50-250 grams of methamphetamine), we conclude that no Sixth Amendment violation occurred when the district court adopted the base offense level recommended in the presentence report. Although Greene challenged the two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm, elimination of the enhancement would only reduce the guideline range to 63-78 months. Greene\u2019s sentence of seventy-eight months imprisonment is thus within the range that would apply based only on facts that he admitted. Consequently, the sentence imposed did not violate the Sixth Amendment. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>416 F.3d 298, 300-01 (4th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b374-5\"> Greene does not claim that the district court erred in applying the guidelines as mandatory. In any event, the record does not reveal any nonspeculative basis for concluding that the district court would have imposed a lower sentence under an advisory guideline scheme. <em>See United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 223 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
