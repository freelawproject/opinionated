We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, and its conclusions of law de novo. <em>Lentini v. Cal. Ctr. for the Arts, Escondido, </em>370 F.3d 837, 843 (9th Cir.2004). We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. <em>See Janes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>279 F.3d 883, 886 (9th Cir. 2002). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">The district court did not err in concluding that Bailey failed to demonstrate either that he was retaliated against for exercising his constitutional rights or that his transfer did not advance legitimate penological goals. <em>See Bruce v. Ylst, </em>351 F.3d 1283, 1288 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">Bailey\u2019s contention that the district court erred in admitting hearsay lacks merit. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 803(8)(C) (allowing the admission of \u201cfactual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Whitman, </em>771 F.2d 1348, 1352 (9th Cir.1985) (admitting statements by government informant under an exception to the hearsay rule because they were not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Bailey\u2019s remaining contentions also lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b871-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
