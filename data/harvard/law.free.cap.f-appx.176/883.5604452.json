Under the provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, habeas relief is proper if the state court\u2019s adjudication of the merits of the habeas claim resulted in a decision that was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Earle\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Earle\u2019s adult record consists of six first-degree burglary convictions. For those in 1988 and 1989, he was placed on probation. For those in 1990, he was sentenced to eight years in prison. After his release, Earle was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Despite his recidivism, Earle claims that the state\u2019s imposition of a sentence of 26-years-to-life imprisonment for receiving stolen property violated the Eighth Amendment. Although Earle\u2019s sentence is indisputably harsh when viewed against the underlying conduct leading to his conviction for violating Cal. PemCode \u00a7 496(a), the state court\u2019s denial of his claim was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law in light of Earle\u2019s criminal history and the California legislature\u2019s \u201cdecision that when ... a person commits yet another felony, he should be subjected to the admittedly serious penalty of [potential] incarceration for life, subject only to the State\u2019s judgment as to whether to grant him parole.\u201d <em>Rummel v. Estelle, </em>445 U.S. 263, 278, 100 S.Ct. 1133, 63 L.Ed.2d 382 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Earle argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Solem v. Helm, </em>463 U.S. 277, 103 S.Ct. 3001, 77 L.Ed.2d 637 (1983), provides clearly established authority to support his Eighth Amendment claim. However, the facts of Earle\u2019s case do not permit us to conclude that the California courts unreasonably applied the Supreme Court\u2019s Eighth Amendment cases on proportionality. In such cases as this, where the facts do not present an \u201cexceedingly rare\u201d case of unconstitutionally disproportionate punishment, <em>Rummel, </em>445 U.S. at 274, 100 S.Ct. 1133 relief from the harshness of California\u2019s sentencing laws must come from the legislature or initiative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">Similarly, Earle\u2019s reliance on <em>Ramirez v. Castro, </em>365 F.3d 755 (9th Cir.2004), is misplaced. Earle contends that <em>Ramirez </em>supports his argument that the state\u2019s sentence is grossly disproportionate to the gravity of his most recent offense and prior criminal history. However, Earle\u2019s six first-degree burglaries\u2014the 1989 burglary being committed while he was on probation for the 1988 charge, and the 1990 burglaries while he was on probation for the 1988 and 1989 charges\u2014and conviction of being a felon in possession of a gun distinguish him from the defendant in <em>Ramirez. </em>Unlike that defendant, whose prior offenses merely comprised two convictions for second-degree robbery obtained through a single guilty plea, Earle has been in prison, received two grants of probation and had opportunities for rehabilitation through the juvenile justice system (after his arrest as a minor for vandalism and further juvenile adjudications for petty theft, driving without a license and evading an officer). Under these circumstances, Earle was \u201cgraphically informed of the consequences of lawlessness and given an opportunity to reform,\u201d <em>Rummel, </em>445 U.S. at 278, 100 S.Ct. 1133 but nevertheless violated the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>We also deny Earle\u2019s claim that the trial court\u2019s failure to conduct an adequate inquiry into potential juror misconduct arising from premature deliberations violated Earle\u2019s right to an impartial jury and his due process right to have the government prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Here, the state court did not unreasonably apply clearly established federal law in concluding that the jurors\u2019 misconduct was of a mild nature and did not concern Earle\u2019s guilt or innocence or the evidence presented, but was rather an expression of exasperation with the way the attorneys were conducting their questioning. Moreover, a post-trial investigation produced no evidence suggesting that the jurors\u2019 opinion(s) of counsel substantially and injuriously affected the verdict, <em>see Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 623, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993), or that the jury based its verdict on anything other than the evidence before it. And because the Supreme Court has approved a post-verdict inquiry into juror partiality, as occurred here, <em>see Smith v. Phillips, </em>455 U.S. 209, 218, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982), no clearly established federal law renders fatal the state court of appeal\u2019s conclusion that the trial court\u2019s failure to question the jurors during trial (as opposed to after) was a harmless error under the state\u2019s \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d standard. Consequently, Earle was not deprived of his right to an impartial jury and to have the government prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b912-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
