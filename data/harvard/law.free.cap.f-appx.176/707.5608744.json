Shafer (Shafer) appeals his conviction and sentence entered by the district <em>court</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>upon his guilty plea to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). His counsel filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing Shafer\u2019s guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary because during the plea colloquy, Shafer was under the influence of prescription drugs. In a pro se supplemental brief, Shafer appears to join counsel in arguing the prescription drugs compromised his ability to plead guilty voluntarily, and argues additionally (1) his trial counsel and the government conspired against him in sharing trial information, (2) prosecutorial misconduct occurred during discovery, (3) he was wrongly charged and convicted, and (4) he received ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-24\">First, the attack on the voluntariness of Shafer\u2019s plea is not properly before us, because he failed to first raise the issue in the district court by seeking to withdraw his guilty plea; rather, at sentencing Shafer affirmatively represented he wished to maintain his plea. <em>See United States v. Murphy, </em>899 F.2d 714, 716 (8th Cir.1990) (claim of involuntary guilty plea \u201cfirst must be presented to the district court and [is] not cognizable on direct appeal\u201d). Second, Shafer\u2019s guilty plea forecloses all preplea non-jurisdictional attacks on his conviction, including prosecutorial misconduct. <em>See United States v. Beck, </em>250 F.3d 1163, 1166 (8th Cir.2001). Third, we find nothing in the record to indicate Shafer was wrongly charged or convicted. Finally, Shafer\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim is not properly before us either, as ineffective-assistance claims generally must be raised in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceedings before the district court where the record can be properly developed. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>330 F.3d 1068, 1069 (8th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-25\">Having independently reviewed the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>(1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b735-21\">. The Honorable James E.
