Gonzales, </em>399 F.3d 1148, 1151-52 (9th Cir.2005), the conditions of Petitioner\u2019s residence in Russia \u201cwere so substantially and consciously restricted by the authority of the country of refuge that ... she was not in fact resettled,\u201d <em>Ali v. Ashcroft, </em>394 F.3d 780, 789 (9th Cir.2005) (citation omitted), particularly because of her lack of a <em>propiska, </em>which denied her the rights \u201cordinarily available to others resident in the country.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.15(b) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Because Petitioner was not firmly resettled in Russia, the parties agree that a remand to the BIA is appropriate for a determination of whether the Petitioner would face future persecution in Azerbaijan; the immigration judge found that Petitioner suffered past persecution on account of her ethnicity. Accordingly, we grant the petition for review and remand to the BIA to consider these claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See INS v.

Because Petitioner sought asylum, withholding of removal and CAT relief from Russia only if the firm resettlement determination were upheld, we do not consider those claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
