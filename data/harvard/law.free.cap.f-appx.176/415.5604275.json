Hart pled guilty to theft/embezzlement of United States property not in excess of $1,000, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641 (2000). The district court sentenced Hart to five years of probation, as a condition of which he would serve a six-month term of home confinement, and to pay restitution of $3,000. Hart appeals his sentence, arguing that his sentence was enhanced in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-20\">The Government asserts that Hart validly waived the right to appeal his sentence in the plea agreement. A defendant may waive the right to appeal if that waiver is knowing and intelligent. <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 169 (4th Cir.2005). Generally, if the district court fully questions a defendant regarding the waiver of his right to appeal during the Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 colloquy, the waiver is both valid and enforceable. <em>United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165, 167-68 (4th Cir. 1991); <em>United States v. Wiggins, </em>905 F.2d 51, 53-54 (4th Cir.1990). A waiver of appeal does not prohibit the appeal of a sentence imposed in excess of the statutory maximum, a sentence based on a constitutionally impermissible factor such as race, <em>United States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir.1992), or proceedings conducted in violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel following the entry of the guilty plea. <em>United States v. Attar, </em>38 F.3d 727, 732-33 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-21\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that Hart knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his sentence. <em>See Blick, </em>408 F.3d at 169-73 (holding that plea agreement waiver of right to appeal that district court accepted prior to <em>Booker </em>was not invalidated by change in law effected by that decision). Moreover, the challenges raised on appeal fall within the scope of the waiver. Accordingly, we dismiss Hart\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>We note, however, a clerical error in Hart\u2019s criminal judgment. The Government charged Hart with theft/embezzlement of United States property not in excess of $1,000, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641 (2000). This is also the charge listed in the plea agreement. Although the judgment correctly describes the offense as theffc/embezzlement of United States property not in excess of $1,000, it inaccurately lists the statutory violation as 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641 rather than 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641. We request that the clerk of the district court correct this typographical error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
