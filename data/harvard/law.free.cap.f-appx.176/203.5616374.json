HALL, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b231-14\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b231-15\">Chuan Shu Lin, a native and citizen of China, petitions for review from the denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) relief. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-18\">We note first that the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s finding that Lin failed to meet his burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that he applied for asylum within one year of entering the United States. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). Because we lack jurisdiction to review this finding, <em>see Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 150-54 (2d Cir.2006), our review is limited to Lin\u2019s claim for withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-19\">This Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision where, as here,' the BIA fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See, e.g., Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003). We review factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73-79 (2d Cir .2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-20\">In this case, the IJ denied Lin\u2019s withholding claim based on an adverse credibility finding. The IJ noted several problems with Lin\u2019s testimony, including his curious demeanor and numerous inconsistencies between his testimony and documents submitted in support of his claim, which he failed adequately to explain. These problems provide substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-21\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-16\">. Lin has not challenged the BIA\u2019s denial of his CAT claim in his brief to this Court. Issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
