By moving to proceed IFP, Wright is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that IFP should not be granted on appeal because his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The district court determined that Wright\u2019s complaint, which alleged the mishandling of Wright\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court, sounded in negligence and did not state a constitutional claim. In his IFP motion to this court, as in his Rule 60(b) motion, Wright contends that the negligent acts of the defendants resulted in a denial of the right of access to the courts, as well as in the violation of his rights to due process and equal protection. Negligent conduct is not actionable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>Marsh v. Jones, </em>53 F.3d 707, 711-12 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Wright also argues, as he did in his Rule 60(b) motion, that the district court erred procedurally in handling his action. Specifically, Wright contends that the district court should have provided him an opportunity to amend his complaint, that he was entitled to a hearing under <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985), that his complaint should not have been dismissed prior to service on the defendants, and that his pro se complaint was not given the benefit of liberal construction. Wright\u2019s arguments fail to show that the district court abused its discretion in denying his Rule 60(b) motion. <em>See Seven Elves, Inc. v. Eskenazi, </em>635 F.2d 396, 402 (5th Cir.1981). Accordingly, we uphold the district court\u2019s order certifying that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">Wright\u2019s request for IFP status is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal of Wright\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Wright is hereby cautioned that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b608-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
