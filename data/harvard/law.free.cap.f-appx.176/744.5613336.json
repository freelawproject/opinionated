We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1) to review whether an alien\u2019s conduct falls within a per se exclusion category for purposes of eligibility for cancellation of removal. <em>Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 890 (9th Cir. 2003). We review questions of law de novo, <em>Cabrera-Alvarez v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 1006, 1009 (9th Cir.2005), and findings of fact for substantial evidence, <em>Moran v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1089, 1091 (9th Cir.2005). We grant the petition for review, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-21\">Villalobos testified that he assisted his wife when entering the United States without inspection near Tijuana. The BIA concluded that he was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal and ineligible for a waiver. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(f)(3), 1182(a)(6)(E)\u00a9 (stating that an alien who assists another alien to enter the United States in violation of the law fails the moral character requirement for cancellation of removal). The agency, however, did not have the benefit of this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Moran, </em>395 F.3d at 1094, which indicates that Villalobos is eligible for a family unity waiver. <em>See id. </em>(stating that \u201cthe alien-smuggling provision ... does not operate to deny the applicant statutory eligibility under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(B) for cancellation of removal ... because the Attorney General may waive the applicability of the alien-smuggling provision\u201d when the applicant assisted his spouse to enter the United States in violation of the law). Villalobos therefore remains eligible for cancellation of removal and the agency improperly pretermitted his application. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b772-22\">In accordance with <em>INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam), we remand for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b772-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9 th Cir.
