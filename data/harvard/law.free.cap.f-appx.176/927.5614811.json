R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court dismissed the complaints after Mr. Greenlee failed to demonstrate in response to an order to show cause that he had pled a claim upon which relief could be granted. In fact, the district court found not only that Mr. Greenlee had failed to state a cognizable legal claim, but that his allegations were \u201cfanciful and delusional.\u201d R., Vol. 1, Doc. 8 at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of an action under Rule 12(b)(6). <em>See Beck v. City of Muskogee Police Dep\u2019t, </em>195 F.3d 553, 556 (10th Cir.1999). Under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim \u201cunless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Hall v. Bellmon, </em>935 F.2d 1106, 1109 (10th Cir.1991) (quotation omitted). In making this determination, we \u201cpresume[ ] all of plaintiffs factual allegations are true and eonstrue[ ] them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">It is also well established that \u201c[a] pro se litigant\u2019s pleadings are to be construed liberally and held to a less stringent standard than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1110. This liberal treatment is not unlimited, however, and \u201c[t]his court has repeatedly insisted that pro se parties follow the same rules of procedure that govern other litigants.\u201d <em>Garrett v. Selby Connor Maddux &amp; Janer, </em>425 F.3d 836, 840 (10th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). As a result, \u201cconclusory allegations without supporting factual averments are insufficient to state a claim on which relief can be based.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>935 F.2d at 1110. In addition, we will not \u201ctake on the responsibility of serving as the [pro se] litigant\u2019s attorney in constructing arguments and searching the record.\u201d <em>Garrett, </em>425 F.3d at 840.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">Having reviewed the virtually incomprehensible allegations that are set forth in Mr. Greenlee\u2019s notice of appeal, his opening brief, the several \u201ccomplaints\u201d he filed in the district court, both before and after this appeal was commenced, and his response to the district court\u2019s show cause order, we agree with defendant that Mr. Greenlee has \u201cfailed to state a claim on which relief may be granted because the complaint[s] consisted of fanciful allegations that, even if ... true, could not establish that the Postal Service violated any legal obligation owed to [him].\u201d Aplee. Br. at 2. Instead, as aptly summarized by defendant, \u201c[t]he gravamen of his pleadings, echoed in his brief on appeal, is that unidentified third parties seek to injure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>him in various ways with a variety of weapons, and he appears to seek the help of the Postal Service and possibly other government agencies to protect him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6-7. This is insufficient to state a claim against defendant under federal law, however, as Mr. Greenlee has \u201cnot allege[d] either that anyone at the Postal Service is the party attempting to hurt him or that the Postal Service has a duty to seek out [his] alleged attackers; indeed he acknowledges that he does not work for the Postal Service.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b956-8\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judieata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b956-12\">. The district court also dismissed Mr. Green-lee\u2019s complaints without prejudice due to his failure to accomplish timely service on defendant as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m). Because we are affirming the district court\u2019s alternative with prejudice dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), we do not need to address this aspect of the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AJY\">. Although Mr. Greenlee\u2019s pleadings indicate that he worked for the Postal Service in the past, he has not asserted a claim for relief in this case that is based on his past employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
