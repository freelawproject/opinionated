Willis points to no legal authority for the district court to entertain his motion. Thus, Willis has abandoned any argument that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his motion for lack of jurisdiction was erroneous. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Even if we were to construe Willis\u2019s motion liberally as seeking relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, such a motion would be successive. Willis\u2019s claims do not meet the criteria for filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion because (a) they do not rely on newly-discovered facts that would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty, and (b) they do not rely on a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive by the Supreme Court on collateral review. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3), 2255; <em>see also In re Elwood, </em>408 F.3d 211, 213 (5th Cir.2005) (holding that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), provides no basis for a successive \u00a7 2255 motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Willis has failed to show that his appeal involves \u201clegal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Therefore, we DISMISS the appeal as frivolous.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b481-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
