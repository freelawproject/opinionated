We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>de Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>374 F.3d 759, 761 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Singh\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely because Singh filed it more than one year after the final administrative decision. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (generally requiring that a motion to reopen be filed within 90 days after a final decision is rendered).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">We lack jurisdiction to review Singh\u2019s challenges to the BIA\u2019s January 8, 2003 order dismissing his appeal and denying his motion to remand.
