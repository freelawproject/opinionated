We review de novo the constitutionality of a statute. <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>307 F.3d 906, 909 (9th Cir.2002). Because the parties are familiar with the facts we need not recite them in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">Kontsagh, a convicted felon, was in possession of a gun that he concedes was assembled in Belgium and traveled through Missouri before arriving in Hawaii. The government does not dispute that Kontsagh himself never carried the firearm across state lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Established precedent forecloses Kontsagh\u2019s as-applied constitutional claim because it is clear that his firearm, at some earlier time, traveled through interstate commerce. <em>See United States v. Rousseau, </em>257 F.3d 925, 932-33 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied. </em>534 U.S. 1013, 122 S.Ct. 503, 151 L.Ed.2d 413 (2001). In the absence of intervening, conflicting Supreme Court authority, we are bound by precedent. <em>See United States v. Gay, </em>967 F.2d 322, 327 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">The district court\u2019s denial is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b859-35\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
