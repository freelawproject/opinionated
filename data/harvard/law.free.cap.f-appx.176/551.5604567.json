Lim\u00f3n argues that the district court erred in increasing his offense level for creating a \u201csubstantial risk of death or serious bodily injury\u201d by transporting two undocumented aliens in the windjammer spoiler of his tractor trailer. Lim\u00f3n acknowledges that he agreed to transport the aliens. However, he asserts that he was not aware of the fact that they were hiding in the windjammer spoiler of his tractor trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-25\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this court continues to review the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 268, 163 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005). A factual finding is not clearly erroneous as long as it is plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>United States v. Simpson, </em>334 F.3d 453, 455-56 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-28\">Limon\u2019s argument that the record lacks evidence demonstrating his knowledge of the fact that the aliens were hiding in the windjammer is unavailing. The presentence report (PSR) reflects that Lim\u00f3n admitted to authorities that he knew that the aliens were hiding in the windjammer spoiler of his tractor trailer. Lim\u00f3n never objected to the PSR\u2019s recitation of his statement nor denied making the statement to authorities. He has thus failed to show that the information in the PSR concerning his own statement \u201cwas materially untrue.\u201d <em>See United States v. Angulo, </em>927 F.2d 202, 205 (5th Cir.1991). As such, the district court\u2019s determination that Lim\u00f3n \u201cintentionally or recklessly ereat[ed] a substantial risk of death or serious bodily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>injury\u201d by transporting the aliens in the windjammer spoiler of his tractor trailer is plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See Simpson, </em>334 F.3d at 455-56. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in applying the enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5). Limon\u2019s sentence is thus AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b579-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
