Castillo argues that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on a prior Texas robbery conviction. Because Castillo did not raise this issue in the district court, review is limited to plain error. <em>United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 162-64 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), a defendant\u2019s base offense level is increased by 16 levels if he was previously deported after being convicted of a crime of violence. Robbery is an offense enumerated as a crime of violence in the application notes to \u00a7 2L1.2. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)). Castillo has not shown that the district court\u2019s increase in his offense level pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2 based on his prior robbery conviction, a specifically enumerated offense under the commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2, was a \u201cclear or obvious\u201d error. <em>See United States v. Rayo-Valdez, </em>302 F.3d 314, 317 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">Castillo argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional. He acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but raises the argument to preserve it for further review. We have \u201crepeatedly rejected arguments like the one made by [Castillo] and ... held that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding despite <em>Apprendi[ v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).]\u201d <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b502-9\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
