We presume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the scope of the issue; presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-27\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Sukhraj Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) <em>(per </em>curiam). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or eonclusory state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>ments; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Huang\u2019s motion to reopen was not time- or numerically-barred, as the BIA found. Normally, an alien may only file one motion to reopen exclusion proceedings within 90 days of the fina administrative decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). However, the same time and numerical limitations do not apply to <em>in absentia </em>orders in deportation proceedings. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)\u00ae, 1003.23(b)(4)(iii). This regulation does not specifically cover exclusion proceedings, but the BIA found this omission to be a drafting oversight, and interpreted the regulation as \u201csetting no time or numerical limitations on aliens who wish to reopen exclusion proceedings conducted <em>in absentia.\u201d Matter of N-B-, </em>22 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 590, 592-93 (BIA 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">However, even treating Huang\u2019s motion\u2014filed nearly ten years after the BIA last visited his case\u2014as timely, the BIA rationally concluded in the alternative that Huang \u201cdid not exercise sufficient diligence in filing the motion to reopen,\u201d even if he was not under any official time limit. <em>See Edin Cekic v. INS, 435 </em>F.3d 167, 171-72 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Stanislav Iavorski v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 124, 134-35 (2d Cir.2000) (requiring aliens claiming entitlement to equitable tolling in ineffective assistance of counsel cases to exercise due diligence). The BIA denied his appeal of the IJ\u2019s denial of his first motion to reopen in 1996, and Huang did nothing to challenge his order of exclusion until after the birth of his third child in 2005. Therefore, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Huang had failed to exercise due diligence here, or to provide a compelling reason for the BIA to reopen his case, based on his children born years after the entry of his final order. <em>See Wei Guang Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 273-74 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Li Yong Zheng v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>416 F.3d 129, 131 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal is this petition is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
