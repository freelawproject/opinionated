We will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-21\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b248-22\">On May 5, 2003, Appellee St. Thomas Development, Inc. (\u201cCorporation\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>chased over 450 acres of land. Thereafter, the Corporation submitted a land development plan to the Township of Saint Thomas, Pennsylvania (\u201cTownship\u201d). The development plan sought authorization for the Corporation to develop a limestone quarry, an asphalt plant and a concrete plant on 360 acres of land located within the Township.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">In response to the Corporation\u2019s development plan, residents and land owners in the Township formed Appellant, Friends and Residents of Saint Thomas Township, Inc. (\u201cFROST\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> With the aid of FROST, on November 4, 2003, the Township elected Frank Stearn, (\u201cStearn\u201d), a member of FROST, as a write-in candidate for Township Supervisor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Stearn ran on the platform that, as a Supervisor, he would work to stop the Corporation\u2019s development plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">On February 18, 2004, the Corporation sent a letter to the Chairman of the Township\u2019s Board of Supervisors. The letter \u201crequested\u201d that Stearn \u201crecuse himself from any and all actions taken by the [Township] Board of Supervisors on any and all matters relating to or connected with [the Corporation]^ project.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (App. 151.) Citing Pennsylvania case law, the Corporation based the request for recusal upon Steam\u2019s \u201cclear bias concerning [the Corporation\u2019s] project and his corresponding duties and legal obligations as an elected public official in the capacity [as a] Supervisor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Corporation concluded that \u201c[i]t would be far better [for Stearn to recuse himself] than to litigate the matter.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">In his Affidavit, Stearn recounted three instances in which the Corporation\u2019s letter affected his position as a Township Supervisor. First, Stearn states that the Chairman asked him to \u201csend a letter to the Department of Environmental Protection outlining the concerns of the Township Supervisors\u201d regarding the Corporation\u2019s development plan. (App.210.) Upon Stearn reminding the Chairman of the Corporation\u2019s letter, the Chairman withdrew his request for Stearn to send the letter. On a second occasion, Stearn abstained from voting on issue that related to the Corporation. <em>Id. </em>at 212. Finally, when another Supervisor asked Stearn to second a motion to approve a request by the Corporation, Stearn again reminded the Supervisors of the letter from the Corporation, and the Township Solicitor determined that the motion could not be seconded or approved. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-13\">On February 27, 2004, Appellants submitted a formal request to Appellee, the Attorney General for the Commonwealth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>of Pennsylvania (\u201cAttorney General\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On March 8, 2004, Appellants also submitted a formal request to Appellee, the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (\u201cSecretary\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In its formal request, Appellants alleged that the Corporation exceeded its authority as a \u201clawful\u201d business, by wielding \u201cillegitimately claimed rights to deny the fundamental rights of the residents of [the Township] to self government.\u201d (App.69.) Appellants then requested that the Attorney General and the Secretary \u201ctake immediate action to enjoin the violation of constitutional rights of the residents of [the Township].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">When neither the Attorney General nor the Secretary responded to Appellants\u2019 request, Appellants filed a Complaint in the Middle District of Pennsylvania on March 24, 2004<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> asserting that the Corporation \u201cwielded State-conferred corporate powers to prevent the residents\u2019 elected representatives from governing the Township\u201d in violation of 42. U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1988 and 1985. (App.162.) The Appellants also filed the action against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for \u201cbestow[ing] constitutional rights and protections by natural person onto corporations through the adoption of 15 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 1501 (2005) (\u201c\u00a7 1501\u201d),\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (App.175, 111159, 76, 89, 99), and the Attorney General and the Secretary for allegedly enabling and sanctioning \u201cthe constitutional violations committed by the [Corporation]\u201d and for refusing \u201cto take action to enjoin them.\u201d (App.162).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">The Commonwealth Appellees filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint on April 13, 2004. The Corporate Appellees filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint on April 23, 2004. The Corporate Appellees also filed motion for sanctions under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on May 19, 2004. Appellants then filed a Motion to Certify the Class on June 21, 2004. On March 31, 2005, the District Court granted both motions to dismiss, denied the motion for sanctions and denied as moot Appellants\u2019 motion for class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">Appellants raise the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-12\">(1) Whether the District Court erred in ruling that the [Appellants] were not injured by the action of the [Corporate Appellees], despite the [Corporate Appellees\u2019] threat to sue the [Appellants\u2019] local government that directly injured the [Appellants] by forcing the removal of their Supervisor from the decision-making process?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-13\">(2) Whether the District Court erred in holding that the [Appellants] have failed to state a claim that the [Corporate Appellees] corporate Defendants acted under \u2018color of state law\" despite the [Corporate Appellees\u2019] wielding of Commonwealth-bestowed constitutional rights to threaten and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>intimidate the [Appellants\u2019] local government and its residents?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">(3) Whether the District Court erred in ruling that the Eleventh Amendment limits the jurisdiction of the federal court to hear the [Appellants\u2019] [s]uit [w]hich [s]eeks to [vindicate [Appellants\u2019] [fundamental [constitutional Mights? <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">(Appellants Br. at 1-2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">II. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(a), and this Court has jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. This Court has plenary review over the District Court\u2019s decision to grant dismissal of Appellants\u2019 Amended Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and reviews the District Court\u2019s decision <em>de novo. Lum v. Bank of America, </em>361 F.3d 217, 223 (3d Cir.2004). A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) should be granted only if, \u201caccepting as true the facts alleged and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom\u201d there is no reasonable reading upon which the plaintiff is entitled to relief. <em>Colburn v. Upper Darby Twp., </em>838 F.2d 663, 665-66 (3d Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">A. <em>Standing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-14\">The District Court properly ruled that Appellants\u2019 Complaint should be dismissed because Appellants lack standing to bring the suit. As stated by the Supreme Court in <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992), standing requires, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Appellants must suffer an \u201cinjury in fact.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> An \u201cinjury in fact\u201d is \u201can invasion of a legally protected interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent and not merely conjectural or hypothetical.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The District Court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARL\">the catalyzing event around which [Appellants] construct this cause of action is the February 18, 2004 letter the [Corporation], through their counsel issued to the Township\u2019s Board.... It was apparently because of this act that Mr. Stearn elected to recuse himself from considering or voting on matters concerning the Corporation, and it is allegedly because of this letter that [Appellants] believe their constitutional rights have been violated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">(App.9.) The District Court concluded that Appellants failed to \u201callege a cognizable injury in fact\u201d because the Corporation\u2019s \u201cact of issuing the February 18, 2004 letter simply did not abridge any constitutional right of any of the Plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10-11. Additionally, although Appellants categorize their feelings and concerns as \u201cinjuries,\u201d as a matter of law, such \u201cinjuries\u201d are simply not recognized for purposes of standing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Nonetheless, Appellants argue that \u201cthe threat of the commencement of \u2018proceedings, either of a civil or criminal nature,\u2019 which seek to interfere with the exercise of constitutionally-protected rights, constitutes legal injury.\u201d (Appellants Br. at 11) (citing <em>Dombrowski v. Pfister, </em>380 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 14 L.Ed.2d 22 (1965); <em>Steffel v. Thompson, </em>415 U.S. 452, 94 S.Ct. 1209, 39 L.Ed.2d 505 (1974); <em>Babbitt v. United Farm Workers Nat\u2019l Union, </em>442 U.S. 289, 99 S.Ct. 2301, 60 L.Ed.2d 895 (1979); <em>Pestrak v. Ohio Elections Comm\u2019n, </em>926 F.2d 573 (6th Cir.1991)). Yet, as Corporate Appellees note, each case cited by Appellants is distinguishable from the present case. For example, in <em>Dombrowski, </em>the plaintiffs attempted to restrain government officials from prosecuting or threatening to prosecute them for alleged violations of the Louisiana Subversive Activities and Communist Control Law and the Communist Propaganda Control Law. 380 U.S. at 481, 85 S.Ct. 1116. The Supreme Court stated that \u201cso long as the statute remains available to the State the threat of prosecutions of protected expression is a real and substantial one.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 494, 85 S.Ct. 1116. Unlike the Appellants in <em>Dombrowski </em>\u201cthere is no allegation of any action of any kind being taken or threatened against any of the [Appellants], let alone any threatened criminal prosecution.\u201d (Corp. Appellees\u2019 Br. at 13.) Although the letter from the Corporation to the Township Board threatens litigation against the Township if Stearn failed to recuse himself, litigation is not threatened against any of the Appellants.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Appellants fare no better in their attempt to categorize \u00a7 1501, as opposed to the threat of litigation, as the basis for their \u201cinjuries.\u201d The Supreme Court in <em>Babbitt </em>noted that appellants \u201cmust demonstrate a realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the statute\u2019s operation or enforcement.\u201d 443 U.S. at 298, 99 S.Ct. 2767. Here, \u00a7 1501 does not result in a \u201cdirect injury\u201d to Appellants because as the Commonwealth Appellees note, \u201c[t]his section does no more than permit a corporation to act as a legal entity separate from its stockholders and to be the legal owner of its property.\u201d (Commw. Appellees\u2019 Br. at 15) (citing <em>Cole v. Price, </em>758 A.2d 231 (Pa.Super.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">We agree with the District Court that Appellants cite \u201cno persuasive legal authority in support of their contention that the act of issuing a letter by a corporation to influence\u2014or even threaten\u2014an elected municipal body or its members is unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11. Appellants also fail to cite any persuasive legal authority that the threat of litigation against a third-party constitutes an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d or that an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d occurs from a statute that fails to result in direct injury upon Appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">B. <em>Eleventh Amendment Immunity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">In addition to ruling that Appellants lacked standing, the District Court properly ruled that Appellants\u2019 Complaint should be dismissed against the Commonwealth Appellees under the Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Appellants argue that the District Court erred in dismissing their claims against the Commonwealth Appellees<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> for three reasons: (1) the plain language, original intent, and history of the Eleventh Amendment bars only actions brought by citizens of another state and not by citizens of the state being sued; (2) by ratifying the Constitution, Pennsylvania consented to federal review of its citizens\u2019 claims of Pennsylvania\u2019s denial of their constitutional rights, and (3) the District Court failed to examine the fundamental nature of Appellants\u2019 constitutional injuries. (Appellants\u2019 Br. at 26, 31, 39.)</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">Appellants\u2019 first argument must fail. Appellants argue that the plain language, original intent and history of the Eleventh Amendment do not bar actions in federal court by citizens of the state being sued. Appellants attempt to draw support for their argument by citing cases which predate the Supreme Court\u2019s controlling decision in <em>Hans v. Louisiana, </em>134 U.S. 1, 10 S.Ct. 504, 33 L.Ed. 842 (1890). (Appellants\u2019 Br. at 27) (citing <em>Cohens v. Virginia, </em>19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264, 5 L.Ed. 257 (1821); <em>Osborn v. Bank of the United States, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 738, 6 L.Ed. 204 (1824)). As noted by the District Court, \u201calthough the terms of the amendment do not specifically proscribe suits against a state by its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>own citizens, the Supreme Court has held that states are immune from such suits brought in federal court.\u201d (App.12) (citing <em>Hans, </em>134 U.S. at 10, 10 S.Ct. 504); <em>see also Fed. Mar. Com\u2019n v. South Carolina State Ports Auth., </em>535 U.S. 743, 754, 122 S.Ct. 1864, 152 L.Ed.2d 962 (2002) (noting that the Supreme Court has consistently \u201cheld that the sovereign immunity enjoyed by the States extends beyond the literal text of the Eleventh Amendment\u201d); <em>Bd. of Tr. of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, </em>531 U.S. 356, 363, 121 S.Ct. 955, 148 L.Ed.2d 866 (2001) (finding that the \u201cultimate guarantee of the Eleventh Amendment\u201d is to protect non-consenting States from suits by private individuals in federal court); <em>Employees of the Dep\u2019t of Pub. Health &amp; Welfare v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Health &amp; Welfare, </em>411 U.S. 279, 280, 93 S.Ct. 1614, 36 L.Ed.2d 251 (1973) (stating that \u201cit is established that an unconsenting State is immune from suits brought in federal courts by her own citizens as well as by citizens of another State\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Appellants concede that courts have held that the Eleventh Amendment provides states with broad immunity but assert that \u201cthe underpinnings of those cases have been challenged....\u201d (Appellants\u2019 Br. at 26) (citing <em>Welch v. State Dep\u2019t of Highways, </em>483 U.S. 468, 107 S.Ct. 2941, 97 L.Ed.2d 389 (1987)). Appellants also cite extensive historical and legal scholarship as support for their interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment. (Appellants\u2019 Br. at 26-30.) Despite Appellants perceived validity of the dissent in cases such as <em>Welch </em>and the plethora of scholarship on this issue, Appellants overlook the words of the <em>Welch </em>majority, which clearly state that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYt\">[t]he rule of law depends in large part on adherence to the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>.... It follows that <em>\u2018any departure from the doctrine of stare decisis demands special justification.\u2019 </em>Although the doctrine is not rigidly observed in constitutional cases, \u2018we should not be ... unmindful, even when constitutional questions are involved, of the principle of <em>stare decisis </em>....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-7\"><em>Welch, </em>483 U.S. at 478, 107 S.Ct. 2941 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). Although Appellants argue that they have an \u201cunprecedented case,\u201d Appellants fail to articulate any \u201cspecial circumstance\u201d that necessitates overruling over a hundred years of precedent since <em>Hans.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Next, Appellants\u2019 second argument also fails. Appellants argue that Pennsylvania consented to suits by its own citizens in federal court by ratifying the Constitution. Even though courts have interpreted the Eleventh Amendment to provide broad sovereign immunity for states, a state can waive immunity by consenting to suit.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Blatchford v. Native Vill. of Noatak &amp; Circle Vill., </em>501 U.S. 775, 779, 111 S.Ct. 2578, 115 L.Ed.2d 686 (1991). State consent, however, is construed narrowly and exists only where the State \u201cmakes a \u2018clear declaration\u2019 that it intends to submit itself\u2019 to a court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>Coll. Sav. Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense Bd., </em>527 U.S. 666, 670, 119 S.Ct. 2219, 144 L.Ed.2d 605 (1999). In the absence of any \u201cclear declaration\u201d by the Commonwealth Appellee indicating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Commonwealth\u2019s waiver of immunity in this case, the District Court was correct in holding that Eleventh Amendment immunity applies. Further, as Commonwealth Appellees note, the Supreme Court expressly stated that states did not surrender their immunity from private suits under the Eleventh Amendment by ratifying the Constitution. <em>Fed. Mar. Com\u2019n, </em>535 U.S. at 751-52, 122 S.Ct. 1864.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Finally, Appellants\u2019 third argument also fails. Appellants argue that the District Court erred in its Eleventh Amendment analysis by failing to examine the fundamental nature of Appellants\u2019 constitutional injuries. As discussed above, Eleventh Amendment immunity is well-established and broad, subject only to a few noted exceptions. The proper focus for the District Court in determining the scope of Eleventh Amendment immunity is an examination of the applicability of those exceptions, which the District Court did.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">C. <em>Section 1988 Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The District Court properly ruled that Appellants failed to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In deciding whether state action is present in the context of a claim brought under \u00a7 1983, the court determines whether \u201cthere is a sufficiently close nexus between the State and the challenged action of the regulated entity so that the action of the latter may be fairly treated as that of the State itself.\u201d <em>Blum v. Yaretsky, </em>457 U.S. 991, 1004, 102 S.Ct. 2777, 73 L.Ed.2d 534 (1982) (quotation omitted). Such a nexus can be established if a state has exercised \u201ccoercive power or has provided such significant encouragement ... that the choice must in law be deemed to be that of the State.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1004, 102 S.Ct. 2777. Yet, \u201cmere approval of or acquiescence in the initiatives of a private party is not sufficient to justify holding the State responsible for those initiatives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1004-1005, 102 S.Ct. 2777.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">The District Court dismissed Appellants \u00a7 1983 claim because Appellants \u201coffer[ed] no allegations in the Complaint that even suggest a \u2018sufficiently close nexus\u2019 between the Commonwealth and the Corporation.\u201d (App.22) (citing <em>Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, </em>407 U.S. 163, 92 S.Ct. 1965, 32 L.Ed.2d 627 (1972); <em>Jackson v. Metro. Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. 345, 95 S.Ct. 449, 42 L.Ed.2d 477 (1974)). The District Court found that the \u201cComplaint indicates only that the Corporation was chartered in Pennsylvania and that [Commonwealth Appellees] Pappert and Cortes did not respond to [Appellants\u2019] letters demanding that they enjoin the Corporation from act<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>ing.\u201d (App.14.) The District Court concluded that \u201cneither of these actions or inactions by the Commonwealth or its officials can be interpreted as \u2018significant encouragement\u2019 from the Commonwealth. At most, [Appellants\u2019] allegations suggest that the Commonwealth may have acquiesced in the Corporation\u2019s actions by not responding to [Appellants\u2019] demands.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Yet, the District Court concluded that <em>\u201cBlum </em>clearly instructs that such acquiescence is insufficient to hold the Commonwealth responsible for the any alleged injury cause by the Corporation\u2019s letter to the Township.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Nonetheless, appellants argue that the District Court erred by \u201cmisinterpreting\u2014 and then misapplying\u2014the [Appellants\u2019] assertion that the Corporate Defendants acted \u2018under color of state law\u2019 when they wielded State-conferred rights against the [Appellants\u2019] Township government.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (Appellants\u2019 Br. at 16.) Yet, Appellants \u201cacknowledge the extensive modern jurisprudence under which corporations are not treated as state actors\u201d and seem to argue not that the District Court erred in its interpretation and application but for \u201ca re-evaluation of that \u2018settled law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20. Despite citing a plethora of cases in which the federal judiciary has recognized corporations to be \u201ccreations of the state\u201d or \u201ccreatures of the state,\u201d Appellants fail to articulate why this Court should depart from the well-founded precedent upon which the District Court relied.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">D. <em>Section 1985 Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"AN\">The District Court also properly ruled that Appellants failed to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In order to state a claim under \u00a7 1985(3), a plaintiff must allege: (1) a conspiracy of two or more persons; (2) motivated by a racial or class based discriminatory animus designed to deprive, directly or indirectly, any person or class of person to the equal protection of the laws; (3) an act in furtherance of the conspiracy; and (4) an injury to person or property or the deprivation of any right or privilege of a citizen of the United States. <em>Lake v. Arnold, </em>112 F.3d 682, 685 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">Notably, the Supreme Court has limited the reach of claims under \u00a7 1985(3). The Supreme Court initially noted that in order to assert a claim under \u00a7 1985(3) \u201cthere must be some racial, or perhaps otherwise class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus behind the conspirators\u2019 action.\u201d <em>Griffin v. Breckenridge, </em>403 U.S. 88, 102, 91 S.Ct. 1790, 29 L.Ed.2d 338 (1971). Subsequent Supreme Court decisions have noted that \u201cwhatever may be the precise meaning of \u2018class\u2019 for purposes of <em>Griffin\u2019s </em>speculative extension of \u00a7 1985(3) beyond race, the term unquestionably connotes something more than a group of individuals who share a desire to engage in conduct that the \u00a7 1985(3) defendant disfavors.\u201d <em>Bray v. Alexandria Women\u2019s Health Clinic, </em>506 U.S. 263, 269, 113 S.Ct. 753, 122 L.Ed.2d 34 (1993); <em>see also United Bhd. of Carpenters &amp; Joiners of America v. Scott, </em>463 U.S. 825, 828-829, 103 S.Ct. 3352, 77 L.Ed.2d 1049 (expressing skepticism that the statute forbids \u201cwholly nonracial, but politically motivated conspiracies\u201d and concluding that commercial or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>economic animus could not form the basis for a cognizable \u00a7 1985(3) claim). The Third Circuit in <em>Lake </em>further limited \u00a7 1985(3) claims to \u201cinvidious discrimination\u201d predicated on discrimination against individuals with \u201cimmutable characteristics\u201d such as race, gender or mental handicap. 112 F.3d at 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">In the present case, the District Court concluded that although Appellants adequately alleged a conspiracy,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Appellants\u2019 claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3) \u201cmust fail because [Appellants] do not constitute a protected class.\u201d (App.24.) The Appellants state that their \u201cclass\u201d consists of \u201call natural persons residing in the Township of Saint Thomas in Franklin County, Pennsylvania, on February 18, 2004, who currently reside in the Township\u201d and the class deals with \u201cissues related to governance of [the Township].\u201d (App.80, 1122, 24.) Without further explanation, in its opening brief Appellants\u2019 only contention is that the District Court erred in dismissing Appellants\u2019 claim under \u00a7 1985(3) because \u201ccourts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have declared that classifications based on political activity may constitute an actionable claim under \u00a7 1985.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 42) (citing <em>Snowden v. Hughes, </em>321 U.S. 1, 64 S.Ct. 397, 88 L.Ed. 497 (1944); <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>321 U.S. 804, 64 S.Ct. 778, 88 L.Ed. 1090 (1944); <em>Nixon v.

Brock, </em>473 F.2d 608 (6th Cir. 1973); <em>Keating v. Carey, </em>706 F.2d 377 (2nd Cir.1983)). In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bray </em>and further clarification of the scope of \u00a7 1985(3) in the Third Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Lake, </em>the cases that Appellants cite are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">In its Reply, Appellants also argue that \u201cthe District Court improperly dismissed the [Appellants\u2019] Section 1985 claims, because the District Court\u2019s \u2018strongly suggest\u2019 standard does not rise to the level of review required for a ruling on a Motion to Dismiss.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> (Appellants\u2019 Reply at 33.) Regardless of how the District Court characterized the precedent, under <em>Bray, </em>Appellants must allege \u201csomething more\u201d than simply a group of individuals who share in their disagreement regarding the political influence of the Corporation in their Township. As noted, the Third Circuit defined this \u201csomething more\u201d to include \u201cimmutable characteristics\u201d such as race, gender or mental handicap. Appellants fail to assert a commonality of an immutable characteristic amongst the class members, such as race, gender or mental handicap, in their Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">Additionally, other than quoting <em>Lake </em>for the proposition that \u201cSection 1985(3) must be \u2018subject to reinterpretation as times and circumstances require\u2019 \u201d (Appellants\u2019 Reply at 34) (quoting <em>Lake, </em>112 F.3d at 687), Appellants fail to persuade, or even argue, why \u00a7 1985(3) should be extended to include Appellant\u2019s \u201cdiscrete political jurisdiction,\u201d particularly in the ab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>sence of an immutable characteristic.

Appellants state that the class includes \"all natural persons in the Township of Saint Thomas in Franklin County, Pennsylvania on February 18, 2004, who currently reside in the Township of Saint Thomas.\u201d (App.167,112.) The Court will refer to Urban, Walls, Saberin and FROST collectively as Appellants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b249-15\">.

Section 1501 states that \"a business corporation shall have the legal capacity of natural persons to act.\u201d 15 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 1501 (2005). For example, under \u00a7 1502, the Corporation has the power \u201c[t]o sell, convey, exchange or otherwise dispose of all or any part of its property and assets, or any interest therein, wherever situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1502(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-15\">Though addressed by the District Court and Commonwealth Appellees, Appellants have not raised or argued the constitutionality of \u00a7 1501 on appeal. Therefore, the Court will not discuss this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b251-9\">. The Corporate Appellees argue that Appellants waive their \u00a7 1985(3) claim by failing to include it in the issue section of their brief pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28. (Corporate Appellees Br. at 25.) Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28 requires, <em>inter alia, </em>that Appellants include in their brief, \"(5) a statement of the issue presented for review.\" Fed. R.App. P. 28(5). Appellants included a statement of three issues in its opening brief. The issues, however, do not reference Appellants' argument under \u00a7 1985(3). (Appellants Br. at 1-2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">The Corporate Appellees concede, however, that Appellants address their \u00a7 1985(3) claim in \u201csummary two-paragraph argument\u201d in their opening brief. (Corporate Appellees Br. at 26.) The Court finds that the inclusion of a section on \u00a7 1985(3) in the argument portion of Appellants brief is sufficient to preserve this issue on appeal. <em>Nagle v. Alspach, </em>8 F.3d 141, 143 (3d Cir.1993) (\"When an issue is either not set forth in the statement of issues presented or not pursued in the argument section of the brief, the appellant has abandoned and waived that issue on appeal\u201d). The Court also finds that Appellant, albeit terse, discusses this issue enough to presume the issue is not waived. <em>Id. </em>(declining to review issue mentioned \u201ccasually in one sentence\u201d); <em>Laborers\u2019 Int'l Union v. Foster Wheeler Corp., </em>26 F.3d 375, 398 (3d Cir.1994) (\"An issue is waived unless a party raises it in its opening brief, and for those purposes \u2018a passing reference to an issue ... will not suffice to bring that issue before this court\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Simmons v. City of Philadelphia, </em>947 F.2d 1042, 1066 (3d Cir.1991)). Finally, under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 2, the Court has discretion to relax the requirements of Rule 28. Fed. R.App. P. 2. Thus, the Court will address Appellants claim under \u00a7 1985(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b251-17\">. In addition to an \u201cinjury in fact,\u201d there must be \"a casual connection between the injury and the conduct complained of\u2014the injury has to be 'fairly ... trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not the result [of] the independent action of some third party not before the court.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (citations omitted).

Additionally, Appellants standing argument fails because Appellants are not attempting to assert their own rights because neither the statute nor the letter is preventing Appellants\u2019 participation in Township governance.
