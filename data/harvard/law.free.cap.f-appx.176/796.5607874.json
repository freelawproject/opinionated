In her opening brief, Zhuravlova does not challenge the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Zhuravlova failed to show that the people who attacked her were government actors, or persons or organizations that the government was unwilling or unable to control. Because that determination is dispositive, Zhuravlova waives any challenge to the IJ\u2019s order. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v.
