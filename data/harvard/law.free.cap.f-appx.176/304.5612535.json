On May 17, 2005, Burke admitted using marijuana and pled guilty to a corresponding Grade C violation of supervised release, see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1 (classifying supervised release violations), in exchange for the dismissal of 10 additional alleged violations. Because Burke\u2019s criminal history category was VI and he had pled guilty to a Grade C violation, the advisory sentencing guideline range for Revocation of Supervised Release was 8-14 months imprisonment. The court, however, was permitted to require Burke to serve in prison \u201call or part of the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in such term of supervised release,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3), which equated to 20 months, 24 days remaining on the supervised release term for the original offense of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Following testimony by the defendant and argument from both sides, the district court revoked supervised release and sentenced Burke to 17 months incarceration. Burke appeals, arguing first that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), lessened the \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard of review applicable to violations of supervised release from the federal sentencing guidelines, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e)(4), and second that the sentence imposed was unreasonable. Because we affirm the district court\u2019s sentence under the less deferential standard of \u201creasonableness\u201d, we need not decide which standard of review applies to violations of supervised release, <em>post-Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(1). <em>See United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 328 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">When a district court imposes a longer prison sentence in a Revocation of Supervised Release proceeding, it must \u201cconsider\u201d the now advisory sentencing range under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a), as well as \u201cstate on the record its general reasons under section 3553(a) ... for imposing a more stringent sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Blackston, </em>940 F.2d 877, 894 (3d Cir.1991). \u201c[Tjhere is no requirement that the district court make specific findings with respect to each of the section 3553(a) factors that it considered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 893-94. Rather, the court must simply give meaningful consideration to the section 3553(a) factors and address any argument raised by a party that has recognized legal merit. <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 329 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">On appeal, Burke argues that the 17-month term of imprisonment imposed by the district court was unreasonable given his substantial assistance to authorities, his longstanding history of mental health issues, and physical injuries he suffered in prison following a seizure and fall. Burke also asserts that his sentence violates section 3553(a) because it is greater than necessary to meet the purposes of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-13\">We disagree. The record shows that the district court explicitly acknowledged the advisory guideline range and considered each of Burke\u2019s three arguments in support of leniency. The judge referenced a letter he received from Burke articulating his feelings regarding sentencing, and asked the defendant to restate his feelings on the record. The judge questioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Burke about his repeated failure to take his medication and comply with court-ordered drug testing. Finally, the judge considered the government\u2019s request for an upward departure from the guideline range owing to the downward departure in the original sentence giving rise to the term of supervised release, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, and in light of the defendant\u2019s history of recidivism.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The sentence imposed was warranted given the numerous occasions on which Burke appeared before the district court and his failure to take advantage of the mental health treatment and anger management counseling afforded him over the course of his supervision. Burke\u2019s history of recidivism is truly extraordinary: his criminal activity commenced at age ten, and he reached the highest criminal history category, Category VI, at age twenty-one. Moreover, this was Burke\u2019s second violation of the supervised release term imposed for the original offense of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The district judge explained his decision to exceed the guideline range as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">I think a lot of your problem over the years was a result of ... various judges along the way feeling sorry for you and thinking or concluding that a certain sentence would be good for you. I looked over that record. And that may have given you an impetus to go on further and further so far as crime is coneern[ed]. Somewhere along the line it\u2019s got to stop. It\u2019s got to stop ... [Ujnder the Guidelines I do have an ability to provide an upward departure, and I\u2019m going to do that. I\u2019m going to do that. And I\u2019m going to do it because I feel it\u2019s for your benefit that I do that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aud\">In sentencing Burke to 17 months, the judge stated \u201cI\u2019ve given you less than I would have\u201d. He admonished Burke to take his psychotropic medication, commended Burke on his eloquence, and recommended that Burke be designated to a specific prison with appropriate treatment facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Because the sentence imposed by the district court for violation of supervised release was reasonable, the judgment of sentence is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
