We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, decisions and records below, and issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-16\">Sow\u2019s claim for asylum was based on his allegation that he fears persecution, if returned to Guinea, both as a member of the Fulani ethnic group and as an active participant in a political party known as the Union for Progress and Renewal (\u201cUPR\u201d), which is closely affiliated with the Fulani ethnic group and opposed to Guinea\u2019s government. The IJ found that Sow\u2019s claim for asylum was time-barred. As Sow concedes, we lack jurisdiction to review that determination. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. United States DOJ, </em>434 F.3d 144, 154 (2d Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-17\">Finding that Sow had failed to show that he would be more likely than not to face persecution or torture if returned to Guinea, the IJ also rejected Sow\u2019s claims for withholding and CAT relief. Because Sow failed to argue his CAT claim in his peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>tion for review, that claim is deemed waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 542 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Where the BIA adopts and summarily affirms a decision of an IJ, we review the decision of the IJ directly. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, overturning those findings only if any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. U.S. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The IJ did not make an explicit adverse credibility determination, and Sow therefore has a rebuttable presumption of credibility on appeal. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The IJ carefully considered Sow\u2019s claim that he would be subject to persecution in Guinea on the basis of his political activities. The IJ found that that was unlikely to be the case, because Sow had not been prominent or more than casually involved in political activities in the past, because he had failed to show any instance of past politically-motivated persecution or any indication that the Guinean authorities were aware of his political activities, and finally because he had failed to show that he was likely to be active in politics in the future. The IJ\u2019s findings in this respect were supported by substantial evidence and we cannot disturb them.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">However, Sow\u2019s claim was based not only on the threat of retaliation for his political activities, but also on his allegations that he will be subject to persecution for his Fulani ethnicity. Although the IJ recognized that \u201cthe political divisions in the country have some connection to ethnic or tribal divisions,\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision does not explicitly address the ethnic dimension of Sow\u2019s claim. The IJ\u2019s reasoning regarding the level of Sow\u2019s prominence in and commitment to the UPR is not relevant to assessing the danger that Sow will face persecution simply because of his ethnicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">We cannot assess that danger on the record before us. \u201c[I]n reviewing an IJ\u2019s decision we \u2018ordinarily will not affirm based on evidence that may appear in the record but that was not relied on in the IJ\u2019s decision because we cannot know how the IJ would have viewed evidence she did not analyze.\u2019 \u201d <em>Xiao Ji Chen, </em>434 F.3d at 162 (quoting <em>Cao He Lin v. United States DOJ, </em>428 F.3d 391, 400 (2d Cir.2005)). \u201cTo assume a hypothetical basis for the IJ\u2019s determination, even one based in the record, would usurp her role.\u201d <em>Cao He Lin, </em>428 F.3d at 400. The failure of the IJ explicitly to address a critical element of Sow\u2019s claim requires that we remand for the narrow purpose of determining whether Sow will more likely than not face persecution by reason of his ethnicity if returned to Guinea.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED, the BIA\u2019s order is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this decision. Having completed our review, all pending motions are DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
