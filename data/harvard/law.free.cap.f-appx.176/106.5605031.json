Fallore appeals the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board, affirming the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (\u201cOPM\u201d) dismissal of his request for reconsideration as untimely. <em>Fallore v. Office of Personnel Mgmt., </em>97 M.S.P.R. 680 (2004). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-31\">In an October 19, 2001, initial decision, OPM denied Fallore\u2019s request for a survivor annuity. Fallore requested reconsideration in January 2003, arguing that he was prevented from filing within the required 30 days, <em>see </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.109(e)(1), because he did not receive notice until December 27, 2002 because the initial decision was \u201cmissent.\u201d OPM denied his request as untimely, finding that Fallore did not set forth sufficient reasons to justify a filing extension. On appeal to the board, the administrative judge (\u201cAJ\u201d) affirmed OPM\u2019s dismissal, stating that Fallore \u201cdid not show that he was not notified of the time limit, or that circumstances beyond his control prevented him from making a timely request.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number><em>Fallore v. Office of Personnel Mgmt., </em>SE0831030364-I-1 (MSPB Oct. 30, 2003) (applying 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.109(e)(2)). In considering Fallore\u2019s petition for review, the two reviewing board members disagreed on the disposition of the petition, and the AJ\u2019s decision became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">We must affirm the board\u2019s decision unless it was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; obtained without procedures required by law, rule or regulation having been followed; or unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000). Even if Fallore received notice of OPM\u2019s initial decision thirteen months late, the record supports the finding that the delay was caused by Fallore\u2019s failure to notify OPM of his change of address or to take other reasonable steps to ensure that he received his mail. Because he failed to exercise appropriate diligence, the board properly affirmed OPM\u2019s dismissal of his petition for reconsideration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
