The district court sentenced Rodriguez-Escobar to 70 months in prison and a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-25\">Rodriguez-Escobar challenges the 16-level sentencing enhancement he received under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), arguing that the district court erred by finding that his prior Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d The district court correctly found that Rodriguez-Escobar\u2019s prior conviction for burglary of a habitation was a conviction for a crime of violence. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1398, - L.Ed.2d - (2006); <em>United States v. Hornsby, </em>88 F.3d 336, 339 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"AbF\">Rodriguez-Escobar argues for the first time on appeal that his sentence was imposed illegally in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). This court\u2019s review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732-33 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-33\">After <em>Booker, </em>\u201c[i]t is clear that application of the Guidelines in their mandatory form constitutes error that is plain.\u201d <em>Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d at 733. To satisfy the plain error test in light of <em>Booker, </em>Rodriguez-Escobar must demonstrate that his substantial rights were affected by the error. <em>See United States v. Infante, </em>404 F.3d 376, 395 (5th Cir.2005). There is nothing in the record indicating that the district court would have imposed a different sentence under an advisory sentencing guidelines scheme. <em>See United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number><em>Bringier, </em>405 F.3d 310, 317 n. 4 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 264, 163 L.Ed.2d 238 (2005). Rodr\u00edguez-Escobar argues that application of the plain error standard is contrary to the plain error standard enunciated in <em>United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004). Rodriguez-Eseobar\u2019s challenge to the showing required under <em>Mares </em>and <em>Bringier </em>is unavailing, as one panel may not overrule the decision of a prior panel absent en banc reconsideration or a superseding contrary decision of the Supreme Court. <em>See United States v. Eastland, </em>989 F.2d 760, 768 n. 16 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Rodriguez-Escobar\u2019s constitutional challenge to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although RodriguezEscobar contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Rodriguez-Escobar properly con-' cedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b493-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
