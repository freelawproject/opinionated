We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">Petitioners filed their motion to reopen over one year after the BIA issued its final order. The BIA did not abuse its discretion in refusing to apply equitable tolling in this case because Petitioners did not demonstrate due diligence in pursuing their ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>See id. </em>at 897 (holding that equitable tolling applies \u201cduring periods when a petitioner is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error\u201d). Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Petitioners\u2019 motion as untimely. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"ACf\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b840-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
