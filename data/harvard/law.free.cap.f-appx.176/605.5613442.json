She argues that the district court erred in increasing her offense level by three levels because the offense \u201cinvolved intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person,\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-26\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this court continues to review the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 268, 163 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005). The facts of Rocha\u2019s case are undisputed, and the question for this court is a strictly legal one to be reviewed de novo: \u2018Whether [Rocha\u2019s] conduct in transporting the illegal aliens qualifies as \u2018intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person\u2019 as required for a \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5) sentence enhancement.\u201d <em>See United States v. Solis-Garcia, </em>420 F.3d 511, 514 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-29\">The sentencing transcript reflects that the district court overruled Rocha\u2019s objection to the enhancement because two of the illegal aliens she was transporting in her truck were not wearing seatbelts. Recently, in <em>Solis-Garcia, </em>420 F.3d at 516, this court determined that the \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5) enhancement \u201cdoes not extend so far as to increase punishment for offenders simply for transporting illegal aliens without requiring them to wear seatbelts.\u201d Further, Rocha\u2019s transportation of six individuals in the cab of a pickup truck designed to seat five does not approach the overcrowding present in other cases in which the \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5) enhancement has been upheld. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the district court erred in applying the \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5) enhancement in the instant case. Accordingly, Rocha\u2019s sentence is vacated and the case remanded for resen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>tencing in accordance with this opinion. <em>See Solis-Garcia, </em>420 F.3d at 516; <em>see also Villegas, </em>404 F.3d at 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b633-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
