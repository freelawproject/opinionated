New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and that his sentence should not have been increased based on obstruction of justice. He contends that he is entitled to seek relief under \u00a7 2241 because 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 offers an inadequate or ineffective remedy. He contends that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective because his prior \u00a7 2255 motions were dismissed solely on procedural grounds and because he is actually innocent of two of the crimes of which he was convicted. Porter has not shown that the remedy provided in \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or ineffective. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (2001); <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Porter\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b462-33\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
