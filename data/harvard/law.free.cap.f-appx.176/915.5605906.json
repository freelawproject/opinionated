R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Nelson Chamizo Torres, a federal'prisoner, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress and challenges the legality of his 210-month sentence. His attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has moved for leave to withdraw as Mr. Torres\u2019s counsel. For the following reasons, we GRANT the leave to withdraw and DISMISS Mr. Torres\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">During a traffic stop, an Oklahoma Highway Patrol officer found cocaine in a vehicle in which Mr. Torres was a passenger. His girlfriend and co-defendant, Laura Morales, was driving. After writing Ms. Morales a citation, and while she was leaving the patrol car, the officer asked Ms. Morales whether she had any drugs, alcohol, weapons, or a large amount of currency in the car. Ms. Morales replied that she did not. The officer asked if he could search the car, and Ms. Morales agreed. Ms. Morales remained in the officer\u2019s car, and the officer returned to the vehicle to ask Mr. Torres, who had told the officer that he owned the car, whether he could search the car. Mr. Torres also agreed to the search. The officer found 4.52 kilograms of cocaine during the search in the airbag compartment of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">After he was charged in state court, a federal grand jury issued a one-count indictment charging Mr. Torres with possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Mr. Torres filed a motion to suppress, arguing that Ms. Morales\u2019s consent was not voluntary because she \u201cdid not adequately understand the English language\u201d and because, even if he and Ms. Morales consented to a search, the search of the airbag compartment exceeded the scope of their consent. Rec. vol. 1 doc. 15, at 7 (Report and Recommendation, dated Apr. 23, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-12\">During the motion to suppress hearing, the trooper indicated that Ms. Morales\u2019s \u201cEnglish was broken,\u201d and that he could not recall whether he had asked for her consent to search in English or Spanish, but that he was confident that her consent was knowing and voluntary. Rec. vol. II, at 13-14 (Tr., filed May 2, 2005). He also testified that Mr. Torres \u201cspoke much better English than Ms. Morales did,\u201d and that Mr. Torres told him that he owned the car and also gave his consent to search. <em>Id. </em>at 15. The defendant produced no evidence of coercion during the motion hearing, and also produced no evidence that either he or Ms. Morales objected at any time during the search of their vehicle. At the end of the motion hearing, Mr. Torres\u2019s counsel told the court that he would review the video and audio tape evidence, and provide it to the court if it contradicted the trooper\u2019s testimony. The tapes were never put into evidence because \u201c[cjounsel did not feel that the tape or transcription/translation benefitted defendant\u2019s claims.\u201d Aplt\u2019s Br. at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-13\">After the district court denied Mr. Torres\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>found in the vehicle, Mr. Torres pleaded guilty to the indictment. The PSR recommended that Mr. Torres be subject to the career offender enhancement because of his history of prior convictions. Initially, Mr. Torres objected to the PSR recommendation claiming that one of the listed convictions which supported the career offender enhancement, was not actually a conviction, but a revocation of probation for a separate offense. At the sentencing hearing, however, Mr. Torres\u2019s counsel withdrew these objections after his counsel received the court records that established the conviction record in the PSR was accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">Acknowledging that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>548 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), rendered the Sentencing Guidelines advisory rather than mandatory, the district court relied on these two convictions to support the Guidelines\u2019 recommendation of applying a career offender enhancement. The Guidelines\u2019 range was 210-262 months, and after reviewing the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the district court sentenced Mr. Torres to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">Mr. Torres wishes to appeal both the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress and the 210-month sentence it imposed. His counsel submitted a brief complying with <em>Anders v. California, </em>and has moved for leave to withdraw as counsel. 386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396 (explaining that counsel\u2019s request to withdraw must \u201cbe accompanied by a brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal\u201d). Here, counsel furnished a copy of the brief to Mr. Torres, who filed a supplemental brief addressing why he is appealing his sentence. Mr. Torres does not raise any additional issues beyond those in the brief submitted by his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">In <em>Anders, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cif counsel finds his case to be wholly frivolous, after a conscientious examination of it, he should so advise the court and request permission to withdraw.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This court \u201cmust then conduct a full examination of the record to determine whether defendant\u2019s claims are wholly frivolous. If [we] conclude[ ] after such an examination that the appeal is frivolous, [we] may grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and may dismiss the appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>428 F.3d 928, 929 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">A. Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b945-11\">When reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, we accept all factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous and view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government. <em>United States v. Angelos, </em>433 F.3d 738, 744 (10th Cir.2006). \u201cWhether consent has been given is a question of fact and is determined from the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Santurio, </em>29 F.3d 550, 552 (10th Cir.1994). \u201cThe scope of consent is a fact question based upon what a reasonable person would have understood under the circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Gregoire, </em>425 F.3d 872, 880 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">After a careful review of the record, we conclude that there is no credible evidence to support Mr. Torres\u2019s contention that the trooper either searched his car without consent or exceeded the scope of the consent that either Mr. Torres or Ms. Morales may have provided. The trooper\u2019s testimony during the motion to suppress hearing was uncontroverted: nei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>ther Ms. Morales or Mr. Torres testified, and after reviewing the video and audio evidence, Mr. Torres\u2019s counsel determined that those pieces of evidence would not assist Mr. Torres\u2019s argument. The only evidence before the district court was the trooper\u2019s testimony, which established that even if Ms. Morales had not completely understood the questions posed to her regarding the search of the vehicle, Mr. Torres spoke English well and also gave his consent to search the vehicle. There is simply nothing in the record to support Mr. Torres\u2019s contention that the district court\u2019s determinations regarding consent were clearly erroneous. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress, and conclude that this aspect of Mr. Torres\u2019s appeal is wholly frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">B. Mr. Torres\u2019s Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">For sentences imposed after <em>Booker, </em>we review a defendant\u2019s sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Morales-Chaires, </em>430 F.3d 1124, 1128 (10th Cir. 2005). As we noted above, Mr. Torres\u2019s counsel withdrew certain objections to the PSR at the sentencing hearing, and acknowledged that the defendant had, in fact, been convicted of the two offenses the district court relied upon in coming to its determination that Mr. Torres was a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">Mr. Torres now argues that the district court erred in applying the career-offender enhancement because he served only ninety days on one of the charges. His argument is clearly foreclosed by the Guidelines themselves: the notes to section 4.B1.2 explain that a \u201c \u2018[pjrior felony conviction\u2019 [as that term is used in the career offender enhancement guideline] means a prior adult federal or state conviction for an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... <em>regardless of the actual sentence imposed.\u201d </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 n. 1 (emphasis added). The two prior convictions that the district court relied upon were convictions in California for possession of cocaine for sale, which are punishable by up to five years imprisonment. Cal. Health <em>&amp; </em>Safety Code \u00a7 11351.5. Therefore, we hold that Mr. Torres\u2019s argument regarding his sentence is wholly without merit and that the district court\u2019s imposition of a 210-month sentence in this case was reasonable. \u201c[A] sentence that is properly calculated under the Guidelines is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness,\u201d <em>United States v. Kristl, </em>437 F.3d 1050, 1054 (10th Cir.2006), and Mr. Torres has made no meritorious arguments that the sentence is unreasonable when viewed in light of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. 3553(a) that could overcome that presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"AWN\">Because Mr. Torres has not shown any meritorious grounds for appeal, we GRANT his counsel\u2019s request to withdraw and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b943-18\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
