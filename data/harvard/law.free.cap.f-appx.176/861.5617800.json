We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-22\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that petitioners failed to established the requisite ten years of continuous physical presence because they conceded through counsel that they left the United States for a period of more than ninety days between May 1992 and August 1992, and the Notice to Appear was issued in May of 2002. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(A) and (d)(2) (stating that a departure of more than ninety days breaks the accrual of continuous physical presence and requiring ten year\u2019s of continuous physical presence immediately preceding issuance of the Notice to Appear).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-23\">We reject petitioners\u2019 contention that the IJ deprived them of due process by failing to develop the record concerning their 1992 departure. <em>See Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 775, 779 (9th Cir.2001) (requiring prejudice to establish a due process violation during immigration proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AYT\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
