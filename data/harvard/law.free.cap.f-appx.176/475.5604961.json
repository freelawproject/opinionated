A certificate of appeal-ability was granted on the issues \u201cwhether he was eligible for credit for his street time under Tex. Gov\u2019t Code Ann. \u00a7 508.283(c) and whether he had a protected liberty interest in credit for his street time.\u201d <em>Gibson v. Dretke, </em>No. 04-20456 (5th Cir. Jan.4, 2005) (unpublished). We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>Summers v. Dretke, </em>431 F.3d 861, 868 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-14\">Section 508.283(c) was amended to provide \u201cthat certain parole violators will receive street-time credit if the \u2018remaining portion\u2019 of their sentence is less than the amount of time they have spent out on parole.\u201d <em>See Ex parte Spann, </em>132 S.W.3d 390, 392 (Tex.Crim.App.2004). The amendments, however, apply only to revocations occurring on or after September 1, 2001. <em>Id.; </em>Tex. Gov\u2019t Code Ann. \u00a7 508.283 (Vernon 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-16\">The record discloses that Gibson\u2019s mandatory supervision was revoked on March 26, 2001. Consequently, he is not entitled to credit for street time because his mandatory supervision was revoked prior to September 1, 2001. <em>See Spann, </em>132 S.W.3d at 392. We therefore need not reach the issue whether \u00a7 508.283(c) affords Texas prisoners a liberty interest in street-time credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-17\">In light of the foregoing, the state court\u2019s decision was neither contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, nor was it based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2254(d); <em>Summers, </em>431 F.3d at 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b504-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
