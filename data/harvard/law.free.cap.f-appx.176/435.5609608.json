Section 1915A directs the district court to dismiss sua sponte any frivolous complaint filed by a prisoner against a \u201cgovernmental entity or officer or employee of a governmental entity.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b). A complaint is frivolous if it lacks an arguable basis in fact or if it is based on an indisputably meritless legal theory. <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-23\">Bradden alleged that he was denied prescription medication in deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. The magistrate judge <footnotemark>**</footnotemark> held that the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>plaint was frivolous because Bradden\u2019s claims lacked an arguable legal basis. Bradden has failed to demonstrate that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to a serious medical need or that the magistrate judge erred by dismissing the complaint as frivolous. <em>Velasquez v. Woods, </em>329 F.3d 420, 421 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Domino v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001). Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The dismissal of the complaint and this court\u2019s affirmance of the dismissal count as one strike against Bradden for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir. 1996). Bradden is warned that, should he accumulate three strikes, he will be barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b463-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
