The district court committed no <em>Apprendi </em>error<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> when it considered, along with other evidence, that defendants were in possession of \u201cice\u201d and other drugs when fixing their Guidelines sentences at 120 months.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">However, that same determination resulted in constitutional <em>Booker </em>error<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because it lead to the significant enhancement of defendants\u2019 sentences under mandatory sentencing guidelines. As the error was unpreserved, a limited <em>Ameline </em>remand is appropriate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">Their argument that hearsay evidence\u2014 the presentence report that reported what FBI agents had said\u2014was improperly considered in determining purity fails for the reasons stated in our concurrently filed opinion in <em>United States v. Littlesun, </em>444 F.3d 1196 (9th Cir.2006). Likewise, their objection to consideration of what their accomplices said fails under <em>Littlesun.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">We affirm, but grant a limited remand to allow the district court to answer the question whether it would have imposed a different sentence had it viewed the Guidelines as advisory.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-18\">AFFIRMED in part and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b915-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
