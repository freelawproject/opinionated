He argues for the first time on appeal that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by enhancing his sentence based on facts that were not admitted by him or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. He argues that this was constitutional error in light of the holding in <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number><em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The Government argues that Ledesma waived his right to appeal his sentence or the manner in which it was determined. Ledesma argues that the appeal waiver does not bar his claim, which in effect is a claim that his sentence exceeds the statutory maximum. He also argues that he did not waive the right to appeal a structural error and that the waiver should not be enforced for public policy reasons. The record reflects that Ledesma knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his sentence. <em>See United States v. Burns, </em>433 F.3d 442, 450 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 545-46 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>413 F.3d 502, 503 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 502, 163 L.Ed.2d 365 (2005). Ledesma\u2019s appeal waiver is enforceable and bars his claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b491-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
