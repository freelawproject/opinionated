Buelna-Valenzuela contends that the district court erred in admitting portions of testimony by three Drug Enforcement Administration agents in violation of the hearsay rule and the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">A. Testimony of Agent Garrett and Agent Giacobbe</p>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">Agents Donald Garrett and Nicholas Giacobbe both testified that Agent Jesse Faircloth broadcasted over the radio that a Hispanic male wearing a bright yellow shirt was getting into the marijuana-loaded car and driving away. While the radio-broadcasted statements were hearsay, they were admissible under the present sense impression exception. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 803(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-14\">Because Buelna-Valenzuela faded to object on Confrontation Clause grounds to the admission of Agents Garrett\u2019s and Giacobbe\u2019s testimony, we review for plain error the admission of their testimony in the face of that appellate challenge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Blandin, </em>435 F.3d 1191, 1195 (9th Cir.2006). To reverse under the plain error standard, \u201cthere must be (1) \u2018error,\u2019 (2) that is \u2018plain,\u2019 and (3) that \u2018affect[s] substantial rights.\u2019\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 466-67, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). If these three conditions are met, we may exercise our discretion to reverse, but \u201conly if (4) the error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 467, 117 S.Ct. 1544 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-15\">In reviewing Buelna-Valenzuela\u2019s Confrontation Clause argument, we need not decide whether the radio-broadcasted statements of Agent Faircloth were \u201ctestimonial\u201d under <em>Crawford. </em>Even if they were \u201ctestimonial\u201d and we were to assume that a Confrontation Clause violation occurred by their admission into evidence, such an error would not rise to the level of \u201cplain error\u201d because admission of the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>dence did not affect Buelna-Valenzuela\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See Olano, 507 </em>U.S. at 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (stating that to establish that an error affected a defendant\u2019s substantial rights, the defendant must show that the error was \u201cprejudicial,\u201d i.e., that it \u201caffected the outcome of the district court proceedings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Buelna-Valenzuela has not made the required showing of prejudice. In addition to what he heard Agent Faircloth say on the radio, Agent Giacobbe testified that moments after the car was picked up, he observed that the driver was a Hispanic male wearing a bright yellow shirt. This evidence was properly admitted and, therefore, the radio-broadcasted statements of what Agent Faircloth saw, which was identical to the description of the individual given by Agent Giacobbe, was cumulative and did not affect Buelna-Valenzuela\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">We affirm the district court\u2019s admission of Agents Garrett\u2019s and Giacobbe\u2019s testimony regarding the radio-broadcasted statements of Agent Faircloth.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">B. Testimony of Agent Mylius</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">Agent Dan Mylius\u2019s testimony that nobody entered or left the house while he was observing it does not implicate the hearsay rule or Confrontation Clause. He testified about his own observations, not about any statements made by other agents conducting surveillance.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">However, even if the hearsay rule or Confrontation Clause were implicated, any error in admitting the challenged testimony of Agent Mylius did not rise to the level of \u201cplain error.\u201d We review for \u201cplain error\u201d because Buelna-Valenzuela failed to object to Agent Mylius\u2019s testimony on hearsay or Confrontation Clause grounds. <em>See Blandin, 435 F.3d </em>at 1195. In challenging this testimony on appeal, Buelna-Valenzuela cannot satisfy the second prong of the \u201cplain error\u201d test because any error in admitting the evidence was not \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cobvious.\u201d <em>Johnson, 520 </em>U.S. at 467, 117 S.Ct. 1544 (quoting <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770); <em>see also United States v. Smith, </em>424 F.3d 992, 1002-03 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201cPlain error \u2018is so clear-cut, so obvious, a competent district judge should be able to avoid it without benefit of objection.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Turman, </em>122 F.3d 1167, 1170 (9th Cir.1997))). The district court did not commit plain error by admitting Agent Mylius\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b920-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b920-16\">. <em>Crawford v.
