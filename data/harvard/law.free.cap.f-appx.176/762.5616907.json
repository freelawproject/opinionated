We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review adverse credibility findings for substantial evidence, <em>Chebchoub v. </em>INS, 257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-19\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding based on inconsistencies between petitioner\u2019s application, testimony, and statements to the asylum officer regarding his attendance at political rallies and the plausibility of his fear of persecution in Pakistan. <em>See id. </em>at 1043-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-20\">Because petitioner failed to demonstrate that he is eligible for asylum, it follows that he did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-21\">Substantial evidence also supports the conclusion that petitioner failed to show that it was more likely than not that he will be tortured if returned to Pakistan. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-22\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b791-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
