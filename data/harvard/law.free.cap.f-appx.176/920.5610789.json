McKAY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">Appellant, a federal prisoner appearing pro se, was convicted of possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(A). He appealed his conviction, which we affirmed in <em>United States v. Jones, </em>No. 96-2061, 1998 WL 4355 (10th Cir. Jan.8, 1998). On June 20, 2005, Appellant sought review before the district court to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. On July 13, 2005, the district court issued an order requiring Appellant to show why his \u00a7 2255 motion should not be dismissed as barred by the one-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">The district court disagreed with Appellant\u2019s response\u2014that we had authorized Appellant\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion or, alternatively, that the recent Supreme Court decisions of <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), made his motion timely. Memorandum Opinion and Order, 1-2 (D.N.M. Oct. 19, 2005). The district court explained that \u201c[e]ven assuming for purposes of this order that <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Booker </em>recognize new rights, these decisions] have not been made retroactive on collateral review of a criminal sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2 (citing <em>Brown v. Uphoff, </em>381 F.3d 1219, 1227 (10th Cir. 2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">The issues Appellant raises on appeal are identical to those brought before the district court. To grant a certificate of appealability, Appellant must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (1994). In order to meet this burden, Appellant must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">We have carefully reviewed Appellant\u2019s brief, the district court\u2019s disposition, and the record on appeal. Nothing in the facts, the record on appeal, or Appellant\u2019s filing raises an issue which meets our standard for the grant of a certificate of appealability. For substantially the same reasons set forth by the district court in its order of October 19, 2005, we cannot say \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-13\">We DENY Appellant\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
