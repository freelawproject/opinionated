On appeal, he argues that the district court erred by denying him a minor-role reduction. Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s determination of whether a defendant qualifies for an adjustment under the sentencing guidelines for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2002). Section 3B1.2(b) of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual provides for a two-level reduction to a defendant\u2019s offense level if he was a minor participant in the offense. The guidelines further define a minor participant as one \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>cmt. n. 5. \u201c[A] defendant who is convicted of a drug trafficking offense, whose role in that offense was limited to transporting or storing drugs and who is accountable under [\u00a7 IB] 1.3 only for the quantity of drugs the defendant personally transported or stored is not precluded from consideration ... under this guideline.\u201d <em>Id., </em>cmt. n. 3(A). \u201cThe defendant bears the burden of proving his minor role by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Boyd, </em>291 F.3d at 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\u201c[I]n determining a defendant\u2019s role in the offense, a district court [first] must measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct attributed to [him] in calculating [his] base offense level.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 943-44 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). Next, \u201cthe district court may also measure the defendant\u2019s culpability in comparison to that of other participants in the relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Here, the district court did not clearly err by denying Escalona-Martinez a minor-role reduction. Applying the first part of <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>the relevant conduct for which he was held accountable was the weight of the bales discarded from the go-fast boat, determined to weigh 320 kilograms. Therefore, his actual and relevant conduct were the same. \u201c[W]hen a drug courier\u2019s relevant conduct is limited to [his] own act of importation, a district court may legitimately conclude that the courier played an important or essential role in the importation of those drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 942-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">With respect to the second part of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>analysis, there is insufficient evidence to show that Escalona-Martinez was a minor participant in comparison to others. In determining whether a defendant was less culpable than others, \u201cthe district court may consider only those participants who were involved in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant,\u201d as \u201c[t]he conduct of participants in any larger criminal conspiracy is irrelevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. Here, the only persons identifiable from the evidence are Escalona-Martinez and the seven other crew members of the vessel. Escalona-Martinez claims that he was a helmsman whose role was limited to taking turns piloting the vessel. However, neither the presentence investigation report nor the sentencing hearing reveal any evidence of each crew member\u2019s role, and Escalona-Martinez failed to show that his responsibilities aboard the vessel were less vital to the enterprise than those of any other crew members. Therefore, the district court did not clearly err by refusing to grant a minor-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
