No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">Roper was convicted by a jury in 1996 for two cocaine trafficking offenses and for carrying a firearm during the commission of a drug trafficking crime, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). The presentenee investigation report (PSI) grouped the drug counts and recommended a base offense level of 28.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The PSI then recommended\u2014and the district court imposed\u2014a three-level official victim enhancement, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(b) (1995), because Roper had fired his weapon at police officers while they attempted to arrest him.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-16\">In 2004, Roper filed the instant \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on the retroactive application of Sentencing Guidelines Amendment 599. Roper argued that the district court engaged in impermissible double counting in applying the \u00a7 3A1.2(b) enhancement because he was punished for the same conduct as a result of his \u00a7 924(c) firearm conviction. The district court denied Roper\u2019s motion, determining that Amendment 599 did not apply to Roper, as Roper\u2019s offense level was enhanced under the \u201cofficial victim\u201d provision of the Guidelines, not the provision for possessing, brandishing, using, or discharging a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-17\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir. 2003). A district court abuses its discretion when in makes an error of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-18\">Here, the district court committed no error in determining that Amendment 599 does not apply to Roper\u2019s conduct. Amendment 599 amended the commentary to \u00a7 2K2.4(b), which sets the statutory mandatory minimum sentence as the guideline sentence for persons who have violated \u00a7 924(c). Amendment 599 provides that \u201c[i]f a sentence under this guideline is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, do not apply any specific offense characteristic for possession, brandishing, use, or discharge of an explosive or firearm when determining the sentence for the underlying offense.\u201d U.S.S.GApp. C, Arndt. 599. The version of \u00a7 3A1.2(b) applicable at Roper\u2019s sentencing authorized a three-level en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>haneement if, during the offense, the defendant assaulted a person that the defendant knew or had reason to believe was a law enforcement officer in a manner creating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(b)(1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Thus, \u00a7 3A1.2(b) is not an enhancement based on a defendant\u2019s possession or use of a firearm. Roper\u2019s sentences for the underlying drug offenses were enhanced under \u00a7 3A1.2 because he shot at, and thus assaulted, a police officer during the commission of the offenses. Roper\u2019s sentences were not enhanced because he possessed or brandished a firearm. Amendment 599 does not alter the applicable guideline range in this case and provides no basis for reducing Roper\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Roper also argues that the district court\u2019s fact determinations in assessing the \u00a7 3A1.2 enhancement violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To the extent that Roper is contending that his sentence runs afoul of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and that <em>Booker </em>authorizes a basis for granting him relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we recently have rejected this claim. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220-21 (11th Cir. 2005) (-writing that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions because it is a Supreme Court decision, not a guideline amendment made retroactively applicable by the Sentencing Commission). And to the extent that Roper challenges the constitutionality of his sentence, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not the proper vehicle for such an attack. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-13\">. The PSI did not include the firearm count in the guideline calculation because that offense required a mandatory 5-year consecutive sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b97-7\">. On the same day that the district court denied Roper\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, Roper filed a supplemental motion alleging that the \u00a7 3A1.2(b) enhancement constituted double counting and was unconstitutional in the light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court did not address the supplemental motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
