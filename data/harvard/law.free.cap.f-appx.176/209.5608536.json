July 16, 2003) (\u201cIJ Decision\u201d). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Where, as here, the BIA has affirmed an IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>Ming Xia Chen v. BIA, </em>435 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">We evaluate the IJ\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, reversing only if any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 156-58 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Jin Hui Gao v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>400 F.3d 963, 964 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73-74; <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 177-78 (2d Cir. 2004). By contrast, we review <em>de novo </em>the IJ\u2019s application of legal principles to undisputed facts (for example, in determining whether certain conduct constitutes persecution). <em>See Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 287 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">As an initial matter, although the IJ indicated that she had \u201csome general concerns\u201d about Quiroz-Lopez\u2019s testimony, the IJ did not make an explicit adverse credibility determination. <em>See </em>IJ Decision at 9-10. Accordingly, we assume for the purposes of this opinion that Quiroz-Lopez\u2019s testimony was credible and evaluate only whether the evidence presented before the IJ was sufficient to meet QuirozLopez\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">According to Quiroz-Lopez, the Ejercito De Liberaci\u00f3n (\u201cELN\u201d) guerillas had attempted to extort money from him and threatened to kill him if he did not cooperate with their organization. In his asylum application, Quiroz-Lopez stated that the ELN had targeted \u201ctruck drivers, cab drivers[, and] business people\u201d in his town, and had killed another taxi driver for failing to comply with their demands. J.A. at 379. On appeal to the BIA, <em>see </em>J.A. at 12, Quiroz-Lopez maintained that such conduct established past persecution and a well-founded fear of persecution based on an enumerated ground in the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), specifically \u201cmembership in a particular social group\u201d and imputed \u201cpolitical opinion.\u201d <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">With respect to petitioner\u2019s \u201csocial group\u201d claim, we conclude that the IJ correctly held that Quiroz-Lopez\u2019s status as a self-employed taxi driver with \u201caccess to money\u201d did not establish persecution on account of an \u201cimmutable characteristic or common trait.\u201d <em>See Matter of Acosta, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 211, 233 (BIA 1985) (members of taxi cooperative did not constitute \u201cparticular social group\u201d); <em>In re S-V-, </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1306, 1310 (BIA 2000) (actions motivated by victim\u2019s \u201cperceived wealth,\u201d without more, were insufficient to support finding of persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-13\">With regard to Quiroz-Lopez\u2019s \u201cpolitical opinion\u201d claim, the IJ appears to have recognized \u201cthat an imputed political opinion, whether correctly or incorrectly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>attributed, can constitute a ground of political persecution with the meaning of the [INA],\u201d <em>see Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 129 (2d Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted), but concluded that Quiroz-Lopez had \u201c[njeither alleged that any political opinion would be imputed to him nor provided evidence in support of such a claim,\u201d IJ Decision at 13-14. In so holding, however, the IJ expressly considered only whether Quiroz-Lopez was actually \u201cinvolved in politics,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 14, rather than evaluating Quiroz-Lopez\u2019s additional claims that (1) the ELN had sought his \u201ccollaboration\u201d and money, and he had become its \u201cenemy\u201d when he refused to comply with its demands, J.A. at 379, 397; and (2) the ELN had \u201cblamed\u201d Quiroz-Lopez for allegedly calling the Colombian army to attack the guerillas during the August 17, 2001 incident, J.A. at 81, 89, 91. Because the IJ failed to analyze whether this evidence supported Quiroz-Lopez\u2019s claim of imputed political opinion, we remand to the BIA for further consideration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Chun Gao, </em>424 F.3d at 130; <em>see also Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 127-28 (2d Cir.2004) (authorizing remand where the IJ and BIA failed \u201cto acknowledge, much less evaluate\u201d evidence central to the petitioner\u2019s claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Finally, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of QuirozLopez\u2019s CAT claim, inasmuch as the ELN guerillas who would likely target QuirozLopez would not be acting with the consent or acquiescence of public officials. <em>See In re S-V-, </em>22 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. at 1312.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED in part and the case is remanded in part for further proceedings solely with respect to petitioner\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims based on imputed political opinion. The petition for review is DENIED with respect to the CAT claim. Any pending motion for a stay of removal is DENIED as moot, and any pending request for oral argument is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2) and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-6\">. We emphasize that on remand the burden remains on Quiroz-Lopez to demonstrate (1) \"that his persecutors <em>actually imputed </em>a political opinion to him,\u201d <em>Chun Gao, </em>424 F.3d at 130 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Sangha v. INS, </em>103 F.3d 1482, 1489 (9th Cir.1997)); and (2) that \"the guerillas will persecute him <em>because of </em>that political opinion, rather than because of his refusal\u201d to collaborate with, or fund, the ELN, <em>see INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>see also Sangha, </em>103 F.3d at 1491 (holding that guerrilla group did not act \"on <em>account </em>of\u201d the petitioner\u2019s political opinion where the group was \"acting in furtherance of its own goals, rather than to persecute [the petitioner] for any views he might hold\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 1487 (stating that \u201d[t]he petitioner must prove something more than violence [by anti-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>government guerrillas] plus disparity of [political] views\").</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
