Kay, Texas prisoner # 707717, seeks leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) in her appeal of the dismissal of her 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint. Kay\u2019s IFP motion is construed as a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that her appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into Kay\u2019s good faith is limited to the district court\u2019s reasons for the certification; we consider the IFP motion to determine \u201cwhether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. Because Kay\u2019s complaint was dismissed as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), we review that dismissal for an abuse of discretion. <em>Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">Kay argues that she stated a valid equal protection claim. However, examination of her pleadings show that she did not allege the requisite facts for such a claim. <em>See Wheeler v. Miller, </em>168 F.3d 241, 252 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Johnson v. Rodriguez, </em>110 F.3d 299, 306-07 (5th Cir.1997). Moreover, Kay has not refuted the district court\u2019s conclusion that the defendants could not be held vicariously liable for the alleged violations, thereby abandoning her challenge to that holding. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, 985 </em>F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993). Accordingly, Kay has not shown that her appeal involves \u201clegal points arguable on their merits.\u201d <em>Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. Accordingly, Kay\u2019s request for IFP status is denied, and her appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-12\">The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint as frivolous both count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Kay previously accumulated one strike. <em>See Kay v. Perret, </em>73 Fed.Appx. 79 (5th Cir. 2003) (unpublished) (affirming the district court\u2019s dismissal of Kay\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous). Kay is now barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed which she is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless she is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-13\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; THREE-STRIKES BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b585-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
