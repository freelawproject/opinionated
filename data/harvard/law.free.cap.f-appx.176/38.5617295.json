Specifically, petitioners argue that Bohorquez suffered past persecution and has a well-founded fear of future persecution because of threatening phone calls, and an attempted abduction by members of FARC.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b67-13\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause such future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>see Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1287 (11th Cir. 2001). \u201cDemonstrating such a connection requires the alien to present specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of [a statutory factor].\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). An asylum applicant may not show merely that he has a political opinion, but must show that he was persecuted because of that opinion. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-14\">We recognize that \u201c\u2018persecution\u2019 is an \u2018extreme concept,\u2019 requiring \u2018more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation,\u2019 and that \u2018[m]ere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u2019\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). In <em>Sepulveda, </em>we held that menacing telephone calls and threats to the alien, her family members, and colleagues did not rise to the level of past persecution. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-15\">An alien who has not shown past persecution may still be entitled to asylum if he can demonstrate a future threat in his country to his life or freedom on a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2). To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>establish a well-founded fear, \u201can applicant must demonstrate that his or her fear of persecution is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, 257 </em>F.3d at 1289. However, if the IJ finds that the alien could avoid a future threat by relocating to another part of his country and it is reasonable to do so, he cannot demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)-(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">To qualify for withholding of removal under the INA, an alien must show that his or her life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). \u201cAn alien bears the burden of demonstrating that he more-likely-than-not would be persecuted or tortured upon his return to the country in question.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">An alien\u2019s testimony, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof for asylum or withholding of removal without corroboration. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(a), 208.16(b). \u201cConversely, an adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[T]he weaker the applicant\u2019s testimony ... the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). When the IJ enumerates an applicant\u2019s inconsistencies and is supported by the record, we \u201cmay not substitute our judgment for that of the IJ with respect to its credibility findings.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 819 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">We review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were the BIA\u2019s because the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s findings. <em>Al Najjar, 257 </em>F.3d at 1284. To the extent that the IJ\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir. 2001). The IJ\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial-evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Al Najjar, 257 </em>F.3d at 1284 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">We conclude that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence in this case. Bohorquez first testified that the FARC tried to abduct him on June 6, 2000 and that he was shot at while driving on the highway eight to ten months later. He later testified that the attempted kidnaping occurred on June 6, 2001 and that this was the only attack against him. Bohorquez also stated that FARC began threatening him in 1997, but later admitted that the threats did not begin until 2000. Additionally, he stated in his application that he received a letter declaring him a military target before his abduction attempt, but he did not discuss that letter in his testimony. However, he did testify that he received a letter two days after the attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">While nervousness could explain confusion as to the exact date, as Bohorquez and Sanchez argue, or even a minor error in communicating the year of the event, Bohorquez demonstrated more than mere nervousness as he confused both the number of personal encounters with FARC and what occurred during the encounters. There is a material difference between being consistently threatened from 1997 and being threatened since 2000. These inconsistencies cut to the heart of his claim as they concern the frequency, severity, and nature of the threats Bohorquez received. Accordingly, the IJ\u2019s finding that Bohorquez was not credible was supported by substantial evidence, and Bohorquez presented no evidence that compels a reversal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>of this determination. However, as the IJ based his ultimate conclusion on Bohorquez\u2019s lack of evidence, the adverse credibility finding was not determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">We also find that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision that Bohorquez did not suffer past persecution on account of a protected ground. The IJ found that Bohorquez\u2019s testimony was not credible, and, as explained above, this finding was supported by substantial evidence. Further, the documentary evidence that the petitioners provided is not compelling. Petitioners provided numerous letters from his family that were vague as to what specific events constituted Bohorquez\u2019s persecution. Petitioners also provided a copy of a letter purportedly from FARC declaring him a military target but, even assuming the letter is genuine, it does not clearly state that the FARC sought to punish Bohorquez for his political opinion. As the petitioners provided no compelling testimony or documentation of Bohorquez\u2019s persecution, petitioners\u2019 past persecution claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">With regard to a well-founded fear of future persecution, petitioners have pointed to no credible evidence that compels a finding that he would be persecuted by the FARC if they were returned to Colombia. Further, Bohorquez\u2019s uncle remains in Colombia without sustaining any harm from FARC members. Such evidence shows that Bohorquez\u2019s fear is not objectively reasonable and thus undermines any fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Finally, petitioners\u2019 withholding of removal claims fail, as they did not establish eligibility for asylum, which carries a lower burden of proof. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93 (noting that because the evidentiary burden for withholding of removal is greater than that imposed for asylum, if an alien has not met the well-founded fear standard for asylum, he generally cannot meet the standard for withholding of removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-10\">. Petitioners make no argument regarding relief under the United Nations Convention and have thus abandoned this issue. See <em>Sepulveda </em>v. <em>U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
