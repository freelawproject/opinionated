INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including its finding as to credibility, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Jin Hui Gao v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>400 F.3d 963, 964 (2d Cir. 2005). Here, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Jaupi failed to offer credible evidence in support of his political persecution claim. This finding, in turn, constitutes substantial evidence to support denial of relief from removal in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-24\">The IJ based his adverse credibility decision in part on material inconsistencies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>between Jaupi\u2019s statements on his asylum application and his hearing testimony. <em>See Borovikova v. United States DOJ, </em>435 F.3d 151, 156 (2d Cir.2006). On his application, Jaupi specifically stated that he was not, and had never been a member of any political party. In his accompanying eight-page affidavit Jaupi noted that he \u201cliked the Democratic party,\u201d but he made no mention of ever being a member. At his hearing, however, Jaupi testified that, for some years, he had been a member of the Democratic Party, and that he had served as a permanent election observer and worked on numerous campaigns on the party\u2019s behalf. This inconsistency is significant and goes to the heart of petitioner\u2019s claim for political asylum. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">In challenging the IJ\u2019s reliance on this inconsistency, Jaupi faults the IJ for referring to his asylum interview, the transcript of which was never offered into evidence at his hearing. He is wrong. The IJ\u2019s decision refers not to the asylum interview but only to Jaupi\u2019s signed asylum application and accompanying affidavit. The IJ acted within his discretion in considering and rejecting Jaupi\u2019s explanation as to the inconsistencies between these asylum application documents and his hearing testimony. We defer to the IJ\u2019s finding of specific inconsistencies as to this material element of Jaupi\u2019s political persecution claim. <em>See Zhou Yi Ni v. United States DOJ, </em>424 F.3d 172, 174 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">In addition, the IJ appropriately noted that the absence of \u201ceasily obtainable and directly supportive\u201d documentary evidence for the claim of political persecution further undermined Jaupi\u2019s credibility. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 78-79 (2d Cir.2004). The IJ\u2019s decision to reject Jaupi\u2019s medical documents finds support in the State Department Country Profile, which indicates that such records are frequently inaccurate or forged. The IJ also reasonably found that Jaupi failed to provice specific, available corroborative evidence, such as a statement or testimony from his wife, who has lived in the United States since April 2001, or affidavits from Jaupi\u2019s brother or parents, who have personal knowledge of the Jaupi\u2019s life in Albania. <em>See id. </em>Jaupi argues that his brother-in-law was available to testify, as he was present at Jaupi\u2019s hearing, but that the IJ erred by never asking him to do so. This argument fails, as it is incumbent on the applicant, not the IJ, to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Furthermore, the IJ reasonably found that the State Department Profile\u2019s indication that the success of the Democratic Party in recent elections in various districts in Albania as well as the presence of Democratic leaders in parliament contradicted Jaupi\u2019s claim that he had to flee Albania. The IJ\u2019s reliance on the Profile was appropriate, as it was used only to bolster an otherwise substantially supported adverse credibility determination. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. United States DOJ, </em>434 F.3d 144, 164-65 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Accordingly, we conclude that the IJ did not err in denying Jaupi asylum and withholding of removal based on his failure to present credible supporting evidence. Because Jaupi does not challenge the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s CAT decision in his <em>pro se </em>brief, we deem that point waived. In any event, any such challenge would similarly fail in light of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. United States DOJ, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005). Accordingly, Jaupi\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
