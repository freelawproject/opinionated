FLETCHER, BEEZER, and FISHER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b845-5\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Defendant-Appellant Jesus Salvador Carrillo-Lopez appeals from his jury conviction and sentencing for possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(l)(A)(ii)(II), and importation of that cocaine into the United States, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952(a), 960(a)(1) and 960(b)(l)(B)(ii). We affirm the conviction and sentence. Because the facts are known to the parties, we do not relate them in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>\u201cwhether references to a defendant\u2019s silence violate the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination,\u201d <em>United States v. Bushyhead, </em>270 F.3d 905, 911 (9th Cir.2001), and whether the prosecutor has shifted the burden of proof to the defendant, <em>see United States v. Mares, </em>940 F.2d 455, 461 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">Because Appellant was not in custody at the time he \u201cdeflated\u201d and said \u201cOkay, okay,\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>322 F.3d 592, 597 (9th Cir.2002), no Fifth Amendment right had attached, <em>United States v. Oplinger, </em>150 F.3d 1061, 1066-67 (9th Cir.1998). Therefore, the prosecutor\u2019s references to Agent Mellon\u2019s testimony did not violate Appellant\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights. <em>United States v. Beckman, </em>298 F.3d 788, 795 (9th Cir.2002). Furthermore, even had Carrillo-Lopez been in custody, his conduct and statements were not silence. <em>See United States v. Velarde-Gomez, </em>269 F.3d 1023, 1031 (9th Cir.2001) (distinguishing between silence, as defined as a \u201clack of response\u201d or \u201cfailure to speak,\u201d and demeanor evidence, defined as \u201can act[] or a physical response.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-13\">Second, a prosecutor may comment on the weaknesses in a defendant\u2019s case or defense counsel\u2019s failure to present exculpatory evidence in closing arguments without shifting the burden of proof where those comments were not intended to draw attention to defendant\u2019s decision not to testify and where the prosecution expressly stated that the burden of proof remains with the government. <em>Mares, </em>940 F.2d at 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-14\">Finally, even if the authentication of the car registration was preserved by Appellant at trial, the admission of the registration was not erroneous because Appellant had himself given it to the border agent as proof of his ownership of that car. Fed. R.Evid. 901(a). We therefore affirm Appellant\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b845-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
