We agree with the District Court, and will similarly dismiss Ararat\u2019s appeal for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-25\">The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361, which gives district courts authority to compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff. We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review a court\u2019s mandamus decision for abuse of discretion, but we review non-discretionary elements <em>de novo. Stehney v. Perry, </em>101 F.3d 925, 929 (3d Cir.1996). We note that \u201cMandamus is an extraordinary remedy that can only be granted where a legal duty \u2018is positively commanded and so plainly prescribed as to be free from doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Appalachian States Low-Level Radioactive Waste Com\u2019n v. O\u2019Leary, </em>93 F.3d 103, 112 (3d Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Harmon Cove Condominium Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Marsh, </em>815 F.2d 949, 951 (3d Cir.1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-26\">Ararat is serving a prison sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution at Fort Dix, New Jersey, for a drug conviction. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (which has been succeeded by the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement) lodged a detainer against him, on the grounds that his drug conviction is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>an \u201caggravated felony\u201d that renders him subject to removal from the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Ararat\u2019s petition sought to have the detainer lifted based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Leocal v. Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004), which held that an alien\u2019s conviction for driving under the influence was not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and was therefore not an aggravated felony. Ararat argues that his crime was not a crime of violence, either. However, <em>Leocal </em>involved a different section of the definition of \u201caggravated felony,\u201d namely, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). As the District Court pointed out, Ararat\u2019s drug conviction would fall under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), which does not require the crime to be one involving violence. Thus, his argument that the detainer should be lifted is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">We further agree, for the reasons stated by the District Court, that any collateral consequences flowing from the detainer did not warrant mandamus relief. The appeal will be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
