The District Court concluded that Fields was a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) and determined that his guideline sentencing range was a 210 to 262 month term of imprisonment. The Court imposed a 210 month term of imprison-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>merit for the drug charge, a concurrent 120 month term of imprisonment for the ammunition charge, and three years of supervised release. Fields now appeals the conviction and sentence on grounds that: (1) the District Court improperly denied his motion to suppress the evidence against him; (2) the District Court inappropriately determined that his prior conviction constituted a crime of violence pursuant to U.S.S.G. 4B1.2(a)(2); and (3) 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional on its face and as applied in this case. We disagree with each of Fields\u2019 contentions. Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment of conviction and approve its substantive application of the sentencing guidelines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nonetheless, we conelude-and the parties agree-that, in accordance with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Davis, </em>407 F.3d 162 (3d Cir.2005), we must vacate Fields\u2019 sentence and remand the matter to the District Court for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">On March 7, 2003, Canonsburg Police Department Detective Charles Tenney and his partner, Officer Michael Leger, were on patrol in a marked police cruiser when they observed the driver of a grey Ford pickup truck make a turn without using a signal. The truck contained a driver and two passengers, all of whom sat on a single bench seat. When the driver pulled into a CoGo\u2019s convenience store parking lot, Detective Tenney pulled in behind him. As the truck came to a stop, one of the passengers-who was later identified as Fields-exited the vehicle and entered the store. While Fields was inside the store, Detective Tenney approached the vehicle and asked the driver, Raymond Ward, for his license. When he did so, the passenger who remained in the truck with Ward-later identified as Anthony \u201cCrazy Boy\u201d Hutchinson-moved to the far end of the bench seat, near the passenger window. Tenney issued a verbal warning to Ward and returned to his patrol car.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">When Fields returned to the truck, Hutchinson slid back to the center of the bench, and Ward backed up and began to leave the parking lot. As Ward drove out of the lot, the truck passed in front of the police cruiser\u2019s headlights, and Detective Tenney recognized the middle passenger as \u201cCrazy Boy\u201d Hutchinson. Tenney, a member of the Washington County Drug Task Force, was familiar with Hutchinson from a previous arrest and from other information he obtained through his work on the Task Force. Approximately a month before the investigatory stop on March 7, a Task Force agent had notified Tenney that there was an outstanding warrant for Hutchinson\u2019s arrest. Relying on this information, Tenney followed the truck out of the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">As Detective Tenney trailed the truck, he radioed dispatch in an effort to confirm the existence of the outstanding warrant and advised another officer, Sergeant James Spingola, that he needed backup. Tenney activated his lights and pulled the truck to the side of the road. Tenney received two confirmations of the outstanding warrant, but it is unclear from the record whether he received them before or after he activated his lights and stopped the vehicle.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>During the course of the stop, Detective Tenney asked Ward to step out of the vehicle, and Sergeant Spingola moved him to the back of the cruiser and conducted a pat-down. Tenney and Spingola returned to the driver\u2019s .side of the vehicle, and Detective Tenney informed Hutchinson of the outstanding warrant and asked him to exit the vehicle. As Hutchinson moved towards the door, Sergeant Spingola observed a revolver perched in a cargo net between Fields\u2019 legs. After patting-down and securing Hutchinson, the officers ordered Fields out of the truck. In conducting a pat-down of Fields, Officer Leger discovered a fully-loaded speed loader with six .38 special rounds of ammunition in Fields left shirt pocket, a stack of folded cash in the amount of $1298 in his right front pants pocket, and a razor blade with a white powdery residue in his left front pants pocket. Fields was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and arrested. At the police station, Detective Tenney and Sergeant Spingola conducted a full search and discovered heroin in Fields\u2019 right shoe.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">A grand jury issued a three-count indictment against Fields, charging him with: (1) possession with intent to distribute less than 100 grams of heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(C); (2) carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime and possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c); and (3) possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Fields was tried and the jury found him guilty as to Count One and Count Three insofar as it related to possession of ammunition; the jury returned a verdict of not guilty as to Count Two and as to Count Three insofar as it related to possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">Before, during, and after the trial, Fields moved to suppress the evidence against him on the basis that the vehicle stop violated the Fourth Amendment. On appeal, Fields argues that the District Court committed clear error in finding that Detective Tenney received confirmation of the outstanding warrant for Hutchinson\u2019s arrest before conducting the stop. For the purposes of reviewing a ruhng on a motion to suppress, we review a district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, and its conclusions of law <em>de novo. See Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <em>United States v. Myers, </em>308 F.3d 251, 255 (3d Cir.2002). We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-13\">Consistent with the Fourth Amendment, a law enforcement officer may conduct an investigatory stop of a moving automobile when the officer has a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the vehicle\u2019s occupants are involved in criminal activity. <em>See United States v. Hensley, </em>469 U.S. 221, 226, 105 S.Ct. 675, 83 L.Ed.2d 604 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>(1985) (citing <em>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. 873, 881, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975)). To determine whether an officer\u2019s suspicion was reasonable, the court must examine \u201cthe totality of the circumstances,\u201d including the officer\u2019s knowledge and experience. <em>See United States v. </em>Robertson, 305 F.3d 164, 166 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Fields contends that Officer Tenney lacked reasonable suspicion because he did not receive confirmation of the existence of an outstanding warrant for Hutchinson until after he stopped the vehicle. Although we agree that the record is ambiguous with respect to the timing of the confirmation, the District Court also found that \u201cbecause Tenney worked on the [Task Force],\u201d he had personal knowledge \u201cthat there was an active bench warrant for Hutchinson.\u201d This knowledge is itself sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion. <em>Cf. Hensley, </em>469 U.S. at 232, 105 S.Ct. 675 (holding that an officer may rely upon information in a \u201cwanted flyer\u201d or police bulletin). We therefore need not determine whether Detective Tenney received verification of the warrant prior to conducting the investigatory stop and conclude that the District Court properly denied the motion to suppress.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Fields also contends that the District Court erred in finding that his prior conviction for possession of an unregistered short-barreled rifle in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d) constituted a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d a determination which subjected him to an enhanced sentence as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. He argues that because the District Court made findings regarding the nature of his prior crime, and not merely the fact of conviction, it violated his Sixth Amendment rights as set forth in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 750, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In the alternative, he suggests that even if the District Court was permitted to make such a determination, it nevertheless erred in concluding that his prior crime was a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d We disagree on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">Section 4B1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines provides that a \u201cdefendant is a career offender if ... the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d The term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is defined in \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) as, among other things, \u201cany offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that ... involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d Contrary to Fields\u2019 contention, a determination regarding whether a prior offense is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is a legal question. <em>See United States v. McQuilkin, </em>97 F.3d 723, 727 (3d Cir.1996) (\u201cThe proper construction of the term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is a legal question ....\u201d). The District Court in this case did not make factual findings about the commission of the crime itself, but determined whether a violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d), as a categorical matter, was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>\u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Accordingly, the District Court did not violate Fields\u2019 Sixth Amendment rights in making the career offender determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The question then is whether the District Court erred in concluding that Fields\u2019 prior conviction was for a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Our review is plenary, <em>McQuilkin, </em>97 F.3d at 727, and we will affirm. Fields\u2019 prior conviction was for a violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d), a statutory provision which makes it unlawful \u201cto receive or possess a firearm which is not registered ... in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer record.\u201d \u201cFor purposes of the statute, \u2018firearm\u2019 is not defined broadly to include all weapons; rather, it is narrowly circumscribed to forbid the unregistered possession of specific types of guns and other destructive devices.\u201d <em>United States v. Jennings, </em>195 F.3d 795, 799 (5th Cir.1999) (citations omitted). The definition of the term \u201cfirearm\u201d includes short-barreled rifles. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Several of our sister circuits have concluded that possession of a weapon in violation of \u00a7 5861(d) constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because it \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>See United States v. Brazeau, </em>237 F.3d 842 (7th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>246 F.3d 330 (4th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Dwyer, </em>245 F.3d 1168 (10th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Allegree, </em>175 F.3d 648 (8th Cir. 1999); <em>United States v. Fortes, </em>141 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Hayes, </em>7 F.3d 144 (9th Cir.1993). These courts have reasoned that, in enacting \u00a7 5861, Congress determined that such weapons are, by their very nature, \u201cinherently dangerous,\u201d \u201clack usefulness,\u201d and \u201ctheir possession involves substantial risk of improper physical force.\u201d <em>See Hayes, </em>7 F.3d at 145; <em>see also Allegree, </em>175 F.3d at 651; <em>Brazeau, </em>237 F.3d at 845. We agree with this analysis, and therefore, we find no error in the District Court\u2019s determination that Fields qualified as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">Fields final argument is that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), under which he was charged for unlawful possession of ammunition, is unconstitutional on its face and as applied because Congress exceeded its authority under the Commerce Clause in enacting it. We squarely addressed and rejected this same argument in <em>United States v. Singletary, </em>268 F.3d 196 (3d Cir.2001), and can discern no reason to revisit the issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">For the reasons set forth above, we will affirm the judgment of conviction by the District Court. Despite our determination that the District Court properly applied the sentencing guidelines in this case, we nevertheless conclude that Fields is eligible for re-sentencing pursuant to <em>Booker </em>and <em>Davis. </em>We will vacate the sentence imposed by the District Court and remand the matter for re-sentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-6\">. The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We exercise appellate jurisdiction over Fields\u2019 conviction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and over his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b356-11\">. At the suppression hearing, Detective Ten-</p>\n<p id=\"AOi\">ney testified that \"there was a hit for an Anthony Hutchinson\u201d and \"that radio control advised [him] that there was an active warrant\u201d <em>before </em>he activated his lights. App. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>121. During cross-examination at the trial, however, he testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFJ\">Q: Did you call dispatch to find out about Hutchinson before you stopped their car the second time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMkh\">A: I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I had the information, and that\u2019s what I based it on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAg\">Q: Did you\u2014you did call to check on the warrant after you stopped the truck, at least, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMN\">A: Yes, sir; that\u2019s exactly when I did it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ahl\">App. at 466. In connection with the motion to suppress made during the trial, defense counsel also submitted documents that the government had produced after the suppression hearing, which reflected the radio communications between Detective Tenney and the dispatchers. Although these documents appear to support Field\u2019s contention that the verification of the warrant did not occur prior to the stop, we need not address the issue in light of our conclusion that Tenney\u2019s personal knowledge was sufficient to support a finding of reasonable suspicion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b358-7\">. We note that Fields does not contest Detective Tenney\u2019s testimony that another Task Force agent informed Tenney of the existence of an active warrant for Hutchinson. Rather, he contends that Tenney did not have reasonable suspicion because he failed to confirm that the warrant was still outstanding at the time of the investigatory stop. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 1-2. Although in some circumstances an officer's reliance on personal knowledge may not be reasonable because that knowledge is based on stale information, in this case we find that the information was not so dated as to render Detective Tenney\u2019s suspicion unreasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
