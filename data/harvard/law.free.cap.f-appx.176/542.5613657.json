Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is unreasonable. Specifically, Neal claims the district court\u2019s assessment of a four-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (increase of base-level offense where defendant used or possessed firearm in connection with another felony offense) was improper because the facts underlying the enhancement exceeded the scope of his guilty-plea admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-24\">Contrary to Neal\u2019s claim, the district court was permitted to look beyond Neal\u2019s guilty-plea admissions for purposes of determining his post<em>-Booker </em>sentence. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). The district court heard testimony on the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) four-level increase and concluded the enhancement was supported by proof \u201cfar beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d. Because Neal\u2019s sentence fell within a properly calculated guideline range, it is pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>sumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>485 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"AyHr\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b570-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
