Henry maintained that officials had denied him medication, diabetic-friendly food trays, eyeglasses, and a \u201cbottom bunk pass.\u201d The magistrate judge concluded that his allegations in support of each of these claims were insufficient to establish an Eighth Amendment violation. In his appellate brief, Henry has failed to make specific arguments with respect to any of his medical-care claims or to cite the portions of the record upon which he relies. Accordingly, we conclude that Henry has effectively abandoned these claims, in that they are inadequately briefed. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">Henry contends that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion to amend his complaint, a motion that he filed two days after the magistrate judge had issued a report recommending that his complaint be dismissed as frivolous. Although it is possible that the distriet court erred in denying this motion, <em>see Whitley v. Hunt, </em>158 F.3d 882, 884 (5th Cir.1998), Henry has failed to demonstrate that any error was anything other than harmless. <em>See Bazrowx v. Scott, </em>136 F.3d 1053, 1054-55 (5th Cir.1998); <em>State of La. v. Litton Mortgage Co., </em>50 F.3d 1298, 1299 (5th Cir.1995); Fed.R.Civ.P. 61. In the proposed amended complaint, Henry alleged only that several prison officials had failed to re-fill a prescription for glucose pills within three days, an assertion that failed to state a cognizable deliberate-indifference claim. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-14\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b640-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
