We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>See Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1187 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc). We review de novo claims of due process violations in removal proceedings. <em>See Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 775, 779 (9th Cir.2001). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">The BIA acted within its discretion in denying Beltran-Hernandez\u2019s motion to reopen, filed two days after the deadline, because he failed to show he was prevented from timely filing the motion. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 898-99 (9th Cir.2003). Even if Beltran-Hernandez\u2019s prior counsel was tardy in informing Beltran-Hernandez of the BIA\u2019s December 18, 2003 decision to dismiss his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s order denying cancellation, Beltran-Hernandez still had two months after learning of the decision to file a timely motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (motion to reopen must be filed within ninety days of final administrative decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-12\">Beltran-Hernandez contends the BIA violated his due process rights when it refused to consider the medical report concerning his United States citizen daughter that he submitted with his motion to reopen. This contention is unavailing because Beltran-Hernandez failed to show the BIA erred in denying his motion to reopen as untimely. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (explaining that petitioner must show error to prevail on a due process challenge).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-13\">Finally, Beltran-Hernandez\u2019s equal protection argument is without merit in that he does not claim the BIA\u2019s decision was improperly mailed or that he received less process than other claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b790-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
