Norton\u2019s sentence included several enhancements based on facts not found by the jury nor admitted by Norton. Therefore, Nor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>ton\u2019s sentence violates the Sixth Amendment under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and we remand for the district court to resentence Norton under an advisory guidelines scheme. We conclude, however, that the district court properly denied the reduction for Norton\u2019s alleged minor role in the offense, and correctly applied the enhancement for identity theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">Norton was indicted along with one co-defendant, Alfred Davis, for one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and three counts of bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344. He entered an unconditional plea to all four counts. According to the record, Davis created an internet Paypal account (which enables internet payment and money transfers for purchases) in the name of Donald Hink, who Davis falsely listed as the administrator of Boca Raton Community Hospital. Davis transferred funds from the hospital\u2019s account to his Paypal account, and then transferred the money from Paypal to an account at that Norton had opened at Wachovia using the fake name of Davon Lee Wallace and another person\u2019s real social security number. Norton then withdrew funds amounting to $105,000 from the Wachovia account.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">The probation officer prepared a presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), grouping the offenses together and assigning a base offense level of 7 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(a)(l), with a 10-level enhancement for the intended amount of loss of $200,000. According to the probation officer, after the defendants transferred $105,000, they attempted to transfer an additional $95,000 into the Paypal account, which Paypal discovered and stopped. The probation officer then recommended a two-level enhancement for sophisticated means, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(8)(C), and another two-level enhancement for identity theft under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C)(i). With a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Norton\u2019s total offense level was 18, and his criminal history category was III, resulting in a guidelines range of 33 to 41 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-9\">Norton filed several objections to the PSI. First he claimed that the enhancements were unconstitutional under <em>Blakely </em>(now <em>Booker). </em>Second, he made factual objections to the amount of loss, which he conceded should have been $105,000, and to the enhancements for sophisticated means and identity theft. Third, he claimed he was entitled to a reduction for his minor role in the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-10\">At sentencing, Secret Service agent Charles Brad Leopard testified that Norton had opened the accounts under a fake name due to his criminal history and his desire to hide money from his probation officer. Leopard explained that Norton\u2019s role in the conspiracy was to open the account and withdraw funds through cashier\u2019s checks, withdrawals, and through giving Davis ATM access and blank checks. According to Leopard, Norton used the account before the conspiracy began, although he could not say for what purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-11\">After considering the arguments, the district court sustained the objection to the amount of loss, finding that the amount was too speculative. The court overruled the <em>Blakely </em>objection and the objections to sophisticated means and identity theft, finding that Norton had used another person\u2019s name and another social security number to open accounts as part of the conspiracy. The court indicated, however, that these issues presented \u201cclose calls.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>The court further denied a reduction for role in the offense, concluding that Norton played an integral part in the scheme, and, even though his conduct was less culpable than Davis\u2019s conduct, he was not a minor participant. With a total offense level of 17, Norton\u2019s guidelines range was 30 to 37 months imprisonment. The court sentenced Norton to 30 months on each count, to run concurrently, and ordered him to pay restitution in the amount of $105,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">A. <em>Booker </em>error</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that <em>Blakely </em>applied to the federal sentencing guidelines and that the Sixth Amendment required that any fact that increased a defendant\u2019s sentence beyond the maximum sentence authorized by the facts established by a plea or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. 125 S.Ct. 738. This court has explained that a <em>Booker </em>error also results from the district court\u2019s use of a mandatory guidelines scheme, even in the absence of any constitutional error. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005). Notably, after <em>Booker, </em>the same extra-verdict enhancements remain, and the district court considers the same factual evidence in applying the enhancements as it would under a mandatory guidelines scheme. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>408 F.3d 745 (11th Cir.2005). Additionally, after <em>Booker, </em>this court applies the same standard of review for applications of guidelines enhancements. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-10\">Because Norton preserved his <em>Booker </em>challenge in the district court, we review the sentences de novo, but will reverse only if the error was not harmless. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). The burden is on the government to show that the error was harmless. <em>Id. </em>There are two standards for the harmless error test. Constitutional harmless error occurs when the error did not affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, that is \u201cwhere it is clear \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the [sentence] obtained.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1291-92 (11th Cir.2005). Statutory harmless error is a less demanding standard, but requires the government to show that, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, the error had no effect or a very slight effect on the sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-11\">Here, the government concedes that the error was not harmless and that Norton\u2019s case should be remanded for resentencing under an advisory guidelines scheme.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we vacate and remand for re-sentencing. On remand, the district court is required to sentence Norton under an advisory guidelines regime and shall consider the guidelines range of 30 to 37 months imprisonment and the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in determining a reasonable sentence. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 757; <em>United States v. DeVegter, </em>439 F.3d 1299, 1303-04 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-12\">B. Minor-Role Reduction</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-13\">We review a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s entitlement to a role <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>reduction for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 938 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en </em>banc). The defendant has the burden of establishing his role by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 939; <em>see also United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1277-78 (11th Cir.2002). Minor-role reductions are to be given infrequently. <em>United States v. Costales, </em>5 F.3d 480, 486 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">A two-level reduction for playing a minor role in the offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b) is warranted if the defendant is less culpable than most other participants, but his role could not be described as minimal. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3). The district court\u2019s determination concerning a role reduction is premised on a case-by-case factual inquiry and the court is guided by two principles. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (baekg\u2019d); <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 941. First, the district court must assess whether a defendant is a minor participant in the relevant conduct attributed to him in calculating his base offense level. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 941. If a defendant\u2019s relevant conduct is identical to his actual conduct, then he cannot establish that he was entitled to a minor-role reduction. <em>Id. </em>Second, the district court may assess a defendant\u2019s culpability as compared to other participants in the relevant conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 944. It is possible that no one involved in the offense was a minor participant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">Here, the court determined that Norton was responsible for his own conduct of allowing his bank account to be used to transfer funds as part of the bank fraud scheme, which the court determined was an integral part of the conspiracy. Norton has not met his burden of showing that this finding was clearly erroneous or that he was entitled to a reduction. Moreover, even if Norton was less culpable than Davis, it is possible that no one was a minor participant. Therefore, the district court did not clearly err in denying the reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-9\">C. Identity Theft</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">Finally, Norton argues that he should not have received an enhancement for identity theft under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C)(i). We conclude, however, that Norton\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-11\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>Devegter, </em>at 1303.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-12\">Pursuant to \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C)(i), a defendant receives a two-level enhancement if his offense conduct involved \u201cthe unauthorized transfer or use of any means of identification unlawfully to produce or obtain any means of identification.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C)(i). According to the commentary, \u201cmeans of identification\u201d includes those offenses defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.8(B)). According to \u00a7 1028(d)(7), \u201cthe term \u2018means of identification\u2019 refers to any name or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific individual.... \u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7); <em>United States v. Auguste, </em>392 F.3d 1266, 1267-68 (11th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-13\">In this case, the district court applied the enhancement because Norton admitted that he opened the bank account using a real person\u2019s name and a fake social security number. Thus, under the guideline, Norton used one means of identification (the name) to obtain another means of identification (the bank account number). <em>Auguste, </em>392 F.3d at 1268. Because Nor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>ton\u2019s conduct falls within the parameters of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C)(i), we conclude that the district court properly applied the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE Norton\u2019s 30-month sentence and REMAND this case for resentencing under an advisory guidelines scheme.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">. Because Norton received extra-verdict enhancements, there was constitutional error in addition to the statutory error. Given the district court\u2019s statement that the application of these enhancements presented a close call, the government has not met its burden of showing that the constitutional error was harmless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
