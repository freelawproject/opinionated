We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we grant the petition for review and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-23\">Substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, because it was based on a finding that an incident in 2002 that Gyulamjyan described was not mentioned in the official documentary evidence. <em>See Chand v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1066, 1077 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cwe will not infer that a petitioner\u2019s otherwise credible testimony is not believable merely because the events he relates are not described in a State Department document\u201d). Because the IJ had no valid reason to question Gyulamjyan\u2019s credibility, the IJ erred by requiring him to provide corroborating official documentary evidence of the incident he described. <em>See Salaam v. INS, </em>229 F.3d 1234, 1239 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>Accordingly, we grant the petition for review and remand for the BIA to consider whether, accepting Gyulamjyan\u2019s testimony as true, he has shown eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal and protection under CAT. <em>See INS v. Ventura, 537 </em>U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">GRANTED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b792-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
