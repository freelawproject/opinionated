Terrell appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, on grounds of qualified immuni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>ty, in favor of Defendants-Appellees Chief Carlos Leon and several officers of the El Paso Police Department. We dismiss this appeal without prejudice to refile, as we lack jurisdiction to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">We are without jurisdiction to review the summary judgment because it is not a final decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201c[A]s a general rule, all claims and issues in a case must be adjudicated before appeal, and a notice of appeal is effective only if it is from a final order or judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Terrell\u2019s appeal is ineffective at this time because there are still claims and issues pending in the district court, including the City\u2019s, County\u2019s, and District Attorney\u2019s motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Moreover, Terrell\u2019s appeal does not fit within the collateral order exception to the final judgment rule,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which exception is reserved for decisions that would \u201cbe effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment\u201d and for that reason require immediate review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In sharp contrast to an order <em>denying </em>immunity, the district court\u2019s summary judgment <em>granting </em>qualified immunity can be fully reviewed after a final judgment. Terrell\u2019s \u201cobjection to the district court\u2019s order in this context is in no danger of becoming moot if appellate consideration is delayed until final judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-14\">Terrell contends that we have pendent jurisdiction over the district court\u2019s order granting qualified immunity because the order is \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with another issue separately on appeal, viz., the denial of his motion for declaratory judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This argument fails because we do not in fact have jurisdiction to review that appeal<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>; by definition there can be no pendent jurisdiction here.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-15\">This appeal is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b652-16\">DISMISSED without PREJUDICE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b651-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.

The collateral order exception permits appellate review of a \"small class\" of nonfinal judgments that \"finally determine claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.\u201d <em>Cohen v.
