Terrell appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for declaratory judgment and his motion to recuse Judge Kathleen Cardone.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>As we are without jurisdiction to review the denial of either motion, this appeal is dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">With some exceptions not applicable here, our jurisdiction extends only to final decisions of the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In general, a \u201cfinal decision\u201d is one that \u201cends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the [district] court to do but execute the judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Terrell\u2019s appeal is ineffective at this time because there are still claims and issues pending in the district court, including the City\u2019s, County\u2019s, and District Attorney\u2019s motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">We are thus without jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of Terrell\u2019s motion for declaratory judgment because it is not a final decision. In fact, the district court did not even reach the merits of the motion, but instead denied it without prejudice because of Terrell\u2019s failure to comply with the district court\u2019s local rule on filing such motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">We likewise lack jurisdiction to consider Terrell\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to recuse. Questions concerning the disqualification of judges are not immediately appealable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Accordingly, we do not reach the merits of Terrell\u2019s appeal from the denial of his motion for declaratory judgment and his motion to recuse. This appeal is</p>\n<p id=\"b650-12\">DISMISSED without PREJUDICE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b649-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b649-24\">. This opinion is rendered contemporaneously with our opinion in <em>James K. Terrell v. City of El Paso, </em>04-51281, 2006 WL 1049041 (5th Cir. Apr. 20, 2006) (unpublished).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b650-8\">. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (\"The courts of appeals ... shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b650-9\">. <em>McLaughlin v.

We acknowledge that our holding on the absence of appellate jurisdiction to review the denial of a motion to recuse is inconsistent with another panel\u2019s disposition of the same issue in the related case of <em>Jacob Telles v. City of El Paso, </em>164 Fed.Appx. 492 (5th Cir.2006) (unpublished). But <em>Corrugated, </em>which predates <em>Telles, </em>is the controlling precedent and we must follow it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
