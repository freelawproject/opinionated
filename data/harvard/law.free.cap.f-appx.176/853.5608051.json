We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence <em>Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1225 (9th Cir.2002), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding because the IJ had reason to question Kumar\u2019s credibility with regard to his claim that a corrupt local businessman, Mr. Manchanda, caused his arrest. Kumar\u2019s claim is inconsistent with documents he produced showing that he was arrested in India for falsifying his wife\u2019s passport, and that he left India after threatening a magistrate. <em>See Wang v. INS, </em>352 F.3d 1250, 1258 (9th Cir.2003) (upholding the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on inconsistencies between documentary evidence and testimony). Further, because the IJ had reason to question Kumar\u2019s credibility, the IJ could properly seek corroborating documents. <em>See Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 964 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">In the absence of credible testimony, Kumar has failed to establish eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-12\">Kumar\u2019s motion for a stay of removal is granted and shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b882-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
