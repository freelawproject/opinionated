Gonzalez was sentenced to a 45-month term of imprisonment and to a three-year period of supervised release. Gonzalez gave timely notice of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Gonzalez challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Gonzalez\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), in which the Supreme Court held that treatment of prior convictions as sentencing factors in \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) was constitutional. Although Gonzalez contends that a majority of the Supreme Court would now consider <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>to be incorrectly decided in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>\u201c[t]his court has repeatedly rejected arguments like the one made by [Gonzalez] and has held that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding despite <em>Apprendi.\u201d United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Gonzalez concedes as much, but he raises the argument to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b544-40\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
