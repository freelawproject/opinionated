He pled guilty to a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), and subsequently was sentenced to 60 months in prison. English now appeals from that sentence, arguing that it was unreasonable under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the district court did not sufficiently articulate its consideration of the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). For the reasons provided below, we will affirm. We presume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history, which we include only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">I. JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">We have jurisdiction to review sentences for reasonableness under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(1). <em>See United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 327 (3d Cir.2006) (\u2018We believe an unreasonable sentence is \u2018imposed in violation of law5 under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(1).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"Ayb\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"AVg\">Because English did not object to the district court\u2019s failure to sufficiently articulate the reasons for its sentence, we review that issue for plain error. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>407 F.3d 162, 164-65 (3d Cir.2005) (using the plain error analysis when the defendant did not raise the <em>Booker </em>issue before the District Court). In order to establish plain error, the appellant must demonstrate that (1) it was error, (2) the error was plain, and (3) it affected substantial rights of the defendant. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>155 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">B. The \u00a7 3553(a) Sentencing Factors</p>\n<p id=\"AnQ\">When reviewing a district court\u2019s sentence, we must be satisfied that it considered the relevant sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 329. While a court is not required to discuss or make findings as to each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the record must demonstrate that it gave \u201cmeaningful consideration\u201d to the factors and took them into account in sentencing. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, while a court need not discuss arguments that are \u201cclearly without merit,\u201d it must address any \u201cground of recognized legal merit\u201d properly raised at sentencing by either the defendant or the prosecution, \u201cprovided [the legal ground] has a factual basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Cunningham, </em>429 F.3d 673, 679 (7th Cir. 2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Our review of the record in the instant case shows that the district court addressed its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and English\u2019s arguments. Specifically, the court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-10\">The sentence imposed satisfies the purposes set forth in Title 18 of the United States Code, Section 3553(a), including the necessity of deterrence and just punishment, promotion of respect for the law, protection of the public, avoidance of unwanted disparities, and assurance of correctional treatment for the defend\u00e1nt, <em>and reflects this court\u2019s full consideration of all factors relevant to the sentencing determination, </em>including the nature and seriousness of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, and the advisory range and policies prescribed by the sentencing commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">(App.61.)</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">Further, the district court discussed English\u2019s request to serve the sentence concurrently with a separate sentence he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>received from an earlier weapons charge and conviction. In denying that request, the court stated: \u201cI reviewed English\u2019s correspondence to me before I imposed that sentence, and so it was my intent that the sentence run consecutively. I did not overlook those submissions, I should state for the record, but that sentence will be consecutive.\u201d (App.62.) <em>Cooper </em>does not require an express articulation of each factor under \u00a7 3553(a). The record need only show the district court\u2019s meaningful consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors at sentencing. <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 329. We are satisfied that these statements, and the record as a whole, demonstrate the district court\u2019s meaningful consideration of both the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the issues raised by English\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"Aeo\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment of sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
