Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), has limited the Sentencing Guidelines to advisory status. <em>See United States v. Paladino, </em>401 F.3d 471 (7th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The district judge has now replied that he cannot conclude that he would have imposed the same sentence on Santiago at the time of his original sentencing had he known that the Sentencing Guidelines were advisory and not binding. The parties\u2019 position statements in response to our invitation to comment on the district court\u2019s <em>Paladino </em>response agree that re-sentencing is appropriate. Accordingly, pursuant to <em>Paladino, </em>we VACATE Santiago\u2019s sentence and REMAND to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
