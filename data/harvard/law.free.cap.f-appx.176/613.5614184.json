Ruiz argues for the first time on appeal that the district court erred when it enhanced his base offense level by 16 levels because his prior Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation does not qualify as a crime of violence for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). The district court did not plainly err when it determined that burglary of a habitation was a crime of violence for purposes of assessing a 16-level increase under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). <em>See United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1398, 164 L.Ed.2d 100 (2006). Ruiz\u2019s argument that <em>Garciar-Mendez </em>is contrary to this court and the Supreme Court\u2019s precedent is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>180 F.3d 675, 676 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-19\">Ruiz argues that his sentence must be vacated and his case remanded for re-sentencing because the district court committed reversible error by sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory Sentencing Guidelines regime in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court\u2019s sentence pursuant to a mandatory Guidelines scheme constitutes <em>Fanfan </em>error. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463-64 (5th Cir.2005). Because the sentencing transcript is silent regarding whether the district court would have imposed the same sentence had the Guidelines been advisory, the Government has failed to meet its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would have imposed the same sentence had the Guidelines been advisory only. <em>See id. </em>at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-20\">Ruiz argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. Ruiz\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Ruiz contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly deeid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>ed and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Ruiz properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for farther review.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM Ruiz\u2019s conviction, VACATE his sentence, and REMAND the case for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b642-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
