For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-9\">Turner was convicted by a jury of one count of conspiracy to possess and two counts of possession with the intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. He was sentenced to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment on each count to run concurrently. Turner\u2019s conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal in 1997. The record indicates that Turner filed a motion to vacate, which was denied. Turner then filed a motion for relief from his judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4) and (b)(6), arguing, among other things, that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the use of prior convictions to enhance his sentence. Turner\u2019s motion was denied, and both the district court and this Court denied his request for a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-10\">On April 11, 2005, Turner filed the instant motion to modify or correct his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He argued that the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) acted as a clarifying amendment to the guidelines and that <em>Booker </em>should, therefore, be applied retroactively to permit the district court to resentence him without the enhancements made to his sentence based on prior convictions under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. The district court denied the motion after finding that the <em>Booker </em>decision did not apply retroactively. Turner\u2019s notice of appeal sought review of the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-12\">On appeal, Turner does not appear to raise the same claims he raised in the district court. Rather, he argues <em>pro se </em>that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 because he only had one prior controlled substance conviction. He further raises a claim of \u201cactual innocence\u201d because he did not meet the criteria for being a \u201ccareer offender.\u201d Lastly, he argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the career offender enhancement at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-13\">We conclude that Turner abandoned his original argument regarding his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion by failing to offer any argument in his brief. <em>United States v. Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d 1343, 1344 (11th Cir.1998). Furthermore, we decline to address any of the arguments raised for the first time in Turner\u2019s brief because these arguments are \u00a7 2255 issues, and, as he has previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion in district court, he failed to properly file a motion seeking this Court\u2019s permission to raise the arguments as required by statute. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A)-(B), 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
