On appeal, Lyons argues that the district court clearly erred in applying a two-level enhancement for an organizational/leadership role pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). Lyons claims that the facts presented in the record indicate that his conduct and that of his codefendants was unorganized and unrehearsed. Because he was acting equally to and in concert with his codefendants, and his contributions to the offense were minimal, Lyons argues that a two-level aggravating-role enhancement is improper.</p>\n<p id=\"AWO\">Lyons also argues that the sentence imposed by the district court is unreasonable and greater than necessary to achieve the goals of punishment in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), claiming further that the district court engaged in improper double counting by unfairly relying on evidence that Lyons was the only person to use a firearm in the commission of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>We have consistently held that the two-level enhancement for the defendant\u2019s role \u201cas a leader or organizer under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 is a finding of fact reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>287 F.3d 1053, 1055 (11th Cir.2002). In determining the defendant\u2019s role, the decision falls within the sound discretion of the district court: \u201ca trial court\u2019s choice between \u2018two permissible views of the evidence\u2019 is the very essence of the clear error standard of review.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 945 (11th Cir. 1999) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for an increase in the offense level based on the defendant\u2019s role in the offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1. A two-level increase is applied if the defendant \u201cwas an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor\u201d in an offense with more than one participant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). In determining the nature of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, the district court should consider \u201cthe exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The undisputed facts in the record indicate that Lyons recruited his codefendants, selected the banks to be robbed, and made arrangements for a getaway car. He also supplied his codefendants with bags to carry money out of the bank and he provided one codefendant with clothes to wear during the offense. We have held that \u201cthe assertion of control or influence over only one individual is enough to support a \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) enhancement.\u201d <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d 1243, 1251 (11th Cir.2000). Given the evidence in the record indicating that Lyons recruited his codefendants and provided the materials used to carry out the offense, we cannot say that it was clear error for the district court to conclude that Lyons played an organizational role in the offense and exercised leadership over the participants therein. Accordingly, Lyons\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Furthermore, Lyons\u2019s argument that his sentence is unreasonable also fails. The district court must properly consult the guidelines when determining the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005). While each calculation is not reviewed for reasonableness, the final sentence is reviewed for reasonableness using the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThese factors include the available sentences, the applicable Guideline <em>range, </em>the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, and provide the defendant with needed medical care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">As the record shows, the district court correctly consulted the sentencing range and there is no misapplication. A correctly calculated range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786-87 (11th Cir.2005). However, Lyons has the burden to show that the ultimate sentence is unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 788. He argues that the sentence does not meet the goals of \u00a7 3553(a), but does not make specific arguments except to argue that double-counting has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">We have held that where \u201ctwo enhancements embody conceptually separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>notions relating to sentencing because they are designed for two different purposes,\u201d it is not double-counting to apply them cumulatively. Uni<em>ted States v. Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d 1344, 1356 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Rendon, </em>354 F.3d 1320, 1334 (11th Cir.2003). Lyons claimed that the 10-year mandatory minimum sentence he received for violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(iii) was satisfactory punishment for his use of a firearm during the offense and argued that it was unfair to consider his use of a firearm as a factor in determining his role in the offense. As previously discussed, the district court did not clearly err in applying a two-level role enhancement after considering the evidence in the record and the factors enumerated in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1. This role enhancement under the advisory guidelines is separate and distinct from the statutory penalty provided for under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(iii). Thus, Lyons cannot argue this ground to assert that the sentence is unreasonable and greater than necessary to achieve the goals of punishment in \u00a7 3553(a), including the available sentences and the need for the punishment to reflect the seriousness of the offense. Accordingly, we conclude from the record that the district court did not clearly err in applying a two-level role enhancement for Lyons\u2019s role as an organizer/leader, and moreover the final sentence is reasonable. For the above-stated reasons, we affirm Lyons\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
