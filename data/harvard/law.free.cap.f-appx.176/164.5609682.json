We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-21\">When the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See, e.g., Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). Nevertheless, \u201cthe fact that the [agency] has relied primarily on credibility grounds in dismissing an asylum application cannot insulate the decision from review.\u201d <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004). An adverse credibility determination must be based on \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d that \u201cbear a legitimate nexus\u201d to the finding. <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Aguilera-Cota v. I.N.S., </em>914 F.2d 1375, 1381 (9th Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The IJ found Ho not credible because he failed to provide any documentary evidence or witness testimony to corroborate his alleged practice of Christianity in the United States. The IJ\u2019s finding is reasonable, given that Ho\u2019s claim that he practices Christianity in the United States was presented to bolster his claims of past persecution and a well-founded fear of persecution in China based on his faith, and considering that he alleged he had been attending the \u201cChinese Christian Church\u201d in New York weekly for two or three years and had friends who attended the services with him. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 163-64 (2d Cir. 2006)</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The IJ also found Ho incredible because his father\u2019s letter omitted any mention of the authorities coming to the house of Ho\u2019s parents on numerous occasions to arrest Ho and of the threats that the authorities made against his family because of his alleged religious activities. The IJ\u2019s finding is based on substantial evidence and involves the heart of Ho\u2019s claim. <em>See Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 308. Further, the IJ found Ho incredible because he failed to mention in both his airport interview and his credible fear interview that he was persecuted in China because of his Christian faith. The IJ could reasonably find that if Ho actually were persecuted in China on account of his religious beliefs, he would have raised that claim during those interviews, notwithstanding Ho\u2019s claim of misguided instruction given to him by the \u201csnakeheads\u201d who transported him to the United States. <em>See Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 398-400 (2d Cir. 2005) (holding that an adverse credibility finding can be based on materially different asylum claims in an airport interview and petitioner\u2019s subsequent testimony before the IJ).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">These findings alone support the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen, </em>434 F.3d at 159-65; <em>Cao He Lin v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 395 (2d Cir.2005). Because Ho has been found to be incredible, he cannot demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See Ramsameachire, </em>357 F.3d at 178. As a result, he necessarily cannot succeed on the claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003). Because Ho did not raise his CAT claim before the BIA, and he does not raise it here, his claim is both unexhausted and waived. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Gill v. INS, </em>420 F.3d 82, 86 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 542 n. 1, 546 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
