Martin challenged his conviction based on <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-22\">Martin argues that his challenge to the firearms offense falls within the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in light of <em>Bailey </em>and <em>Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998). He also argues that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing his <em>Booker </em>claim with prejudice. \u201c[T]he savings clause of \u00a7 2255 applies to a claim (i) that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-23\">Martin raised a <em>Bailey </em>challenge to his \u00a7 924(c) conviction in his first \u00a7 2255 motion, and he has not shown that his claim was foreclosed when he sought \u00a7 2255 relief. Further, Martin\u2019s claims based on <em>Booker </em>are foreclosed in light of <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 427 (5th Cir. 2005). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b507-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
