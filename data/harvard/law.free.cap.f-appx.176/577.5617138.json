We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-27\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-28\">Pennington is a former employee of Hanson\u2019s. From 1999 to 2001 Pennington was stationed in Australia, during which time Hanson paid Pennington\u2019s foreign income taxes under a \u201ctax equalization policy.\u201d On termination of his employment with Hanson, Pennington and Hanson entered into a Confidential Separation Agreement and Full Settlement of Claims (\u201cSeparation Agreement\u201d), which contained a mandatory arbitration clause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Hanson later sued Pennington under the tax equalization policy for the return of foreign tax refunds that were paid to Pennington. Pennington counterclaimed for breach of the Separation Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Each party moved for compelled arbitration of the claim against it pursuant to the Separation Agreement\u2019s arbitration provision. The district court issued an order dismissing and compelling arbitration of both claims. The court determined that Pennington\u2019s counterclaim for breach of the Separation Agreement was plainly governed by the Separation Agreement and therefore subject to arbitration. The court further held that Hanson\u2019s claim under the tax equalization policy was subject to the arbitration provisions of the Separation Agreement because the Separation Agreement superseded the tax equalization policy. The court relied on the following language from paragraph 14 of the Separation Agreement:</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Employee (Pennington) fully under stands and acknowledges that this Agreement ... constitutes the full resolution and satisfaction of all duties and obligations owed by the Company (Hanson) and supersedes any other agreement, whether express or implied, regarding the terms and conditions of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The parties agree that Pennington\u2019s counterclaim for breach of the Separation Agreement is subject to arbitration. Hanson contends, however, that its claim for the return of foreign tax refunds under the tax equalization policy is not covered by the Separation Agreement and therefore is not subject to arbitration. Hanson argues that the Separation Agreement did not supersede the tax equalization policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss and to compel arbitration. <em>Pennzoil Exploration &amp; Prod. Co. v. Ramco Energy Ltd., </em>139 F.3d 1061, 1065 (5th Cir.1998). \u201cA party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.\u201d <em>United Steelworkers of Am. v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Nav. Co., </em>363 U.S. 574, 582, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 4 L.Ed.2d 409 (1960). In determining whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate, we ask (1) whether a valid agreement to arbitrate between the parties exists and (2) whether the dispute in question falls within the scope of that arbitration agreement. <em>PaineWebber Inc. v. Chase Manhattan Private Bank (Switzerland), </em>260 F.3d 453, 462 (5th Cir.2001). \u201cIn doing so, we must bear in mind the strong federal policy favoring arbitration and resolve any ambiguity as to the availability of arbitration in favor of arbitration.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">The parties agree that the Separation Agreement contains a valid arbitration clause covering all disputes under the Separation Agreement. We must determine, therefore, whether Hanson\u2019s claim under the tax equalization policy falls under the Separation Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">The plain language of paragraph 14 of the Separation Agreement contains two distinct agreements. First, the parties agreed that the Separation Agreement \u201cconstitutes the full resolution and satisfaction of all duties and obligations owed by the Company.\u201d Second, they agreed that the Separation Agreement \u201csupersedes any other agreement, whether express or implied, regarding the terms and conditions of his (Pennington\u2019s) employment.\u201d This second agreement is not somehow subsumed by the first, as argued by Hanson.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-12\">The tax equalization policy is certainly an \u201cagreement ... regarding the terms and conditions of [Pennington\u2019s] employment.\u201d Therefore, it was superseded by the Separation Agreement. Any dispute now arising under the tax equalization pol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>icy is therefore governed by the Separation Agreement and subject to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"AxO\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b605-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b605-19\">. Paragraph 13 of the Separation Agreement states as follows: \u201cIn the event of any dispute under the provision [sic] of this Agreement other than a dispute in which the primary relief sought is an equitable remedy such as an injunction, the Parties shall be required to have the dispute, controversy, or claim settled by arbitration....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
