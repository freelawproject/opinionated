We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-28\">Generally, courts of appeals review decisions of the Board, and not those of immigration judges. <em>See Alaelua v. INS, </em>45 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>F.3d 1379, 1381-82 (9th Cir.1995). But where, as here, the Board affirms the decision of the immigration judge for the reasons stated in her decision without offering its own discussion of particular findings of the immigration judge, the Court reviews the decision of the immigration judge. <em>See Al-Harbi v. INS, </em>242 F.3d 882, 887-88 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Alaelua, </em>45 F.3d at 1381-82. The substantial evidence standard of review governs the judicial review of adverse credibility findings in removal cases. <em>Al-Harbi v. INS, </em>242 F.3d at 888 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">There is substantial record evidence to support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. <em>See Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1225 (9th Cir.2002). Apart from Senthinathan\u2019s admittedly false testimony, there were significant internal inconsistencies with Senthinathan\u2019s testimony, as well as discrepancies between his testimony before the IJ and the information contained in the prior record of sworn statement and credible fear worksheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Substantial evidence also supports the determination of the BIA and IJ that Senthinathan failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. \u201cA failure to satisfy the lower standard of proof required to establish eligibility for asylum ... necessarily results in a failure to demonstrate eligibility for withholding of deportation.\u201d <em>Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). Even setting aside this general rule, the record fails to show that \u201cit is more likely than not\u201d that Senthinathan would be threatened by persecution if he were returned to Sri Lanka.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">An applicant for protection under the Convention Against Torture has the burden to show that it is \u201cmore likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(e)(l)-(2). Torture is defined as \u201cany act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person ... by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 208.18(a)(1). Substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s denial of torture protection. Senthinathan was unable to provide credible evidence that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured by or with the acquiescence of the Sri Lankan government if he returns to Sri Lanka.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b893-29\"> xhiS disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
