The ALJ determined that Carte was not without fault because Carte had failed to report his work status to the Social Security Administration on a yearly basis. Because the ALJ applied the wrong reporting requirement in determining fault, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-22\">The reporting requirement that applies to recipients of disability benefits instructs, \u201cIf you are entitled to cash benefits or to a period of disability because you are disabled, you should promptly tell us if\u2014(a) Your condition improves; (b) You return to work; (c) You increase the amount of your work; or (d) Your earnings increase.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1588. There is no \u201cyearly\u201d reporting requirement in this provision. Although the regulations contain a yearly reporting requirement, it does not apply to disability benefits: \u201cIf you have not reached full retirement age ... and you are entitled to a monthly benefit, <em>other than only a disability insurance benefit, </em>you are required to report to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>us the total amount of your earnings ... for each taxable year.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.452(a)(1) (emphasis added). On remand, the ALJ should apply the correct reporting requirement to determine whether Carte was without fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
