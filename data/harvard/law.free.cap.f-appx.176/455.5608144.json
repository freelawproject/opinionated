He contends that the district court erred by adjusting his offense level due to his brother\u2019s possession of a weapon and due to obstruction of justice. He argues that the waiver provision in his plea agreement does not preclude an appeal from his sentence, in light of the issuance of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), subsequent to the entry of his plea. The Government seeks enforcement of the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-18\">\u201c[A]n otherwise valid appeal waiver is not rendered invalid, or inapplicable to an appeal seeking to raise a <em>Booker </em>or <em>Fan-fan </em>issue ... merely because the waiver was made before <em>Booker.\u201d United States v. Burns, </em>433 F.3d 442, 450-51 (5th Cir. 2005). Moreover, <em>Booker </em>did not transform the district court\u2019s upward adjustments into upward departures that are appealable under the waiver provision. <em>See United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746-47 (5th Cir.2005). Additionally, judicial creation of an exception in every waiver provision for \u201cmaterial and unlawful misapplication of the Sentencing Guidelines\u201d would effectively preclude waivers of any and all guideline misapplications. We routinely have enforced such waivers. <em>See, e.g., Burns, </em>433 F.3d at 443-44. Finally, appointment of appellate counsel did not constitute an implied finding that the waiver provision was inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-19\">Escamilla has not shown that his plea waiver was involuntary or that it should not be enforced. Escamilla\u2019s arguments regarding the guideline sentencing adjustments thus are precluded by the waiver provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b484-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
