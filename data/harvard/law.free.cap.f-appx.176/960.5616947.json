A drug dog alerted to her person, and federal agents searched her. She was carrying a package containing 326 grams of cocaine. A federal grand jury thereafter returned a two-count indictment charging her in Count 1 with importing a substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952(a) and 960(b), and in Count 2 with possessing such substance with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Appellant plead guilty under a plea agreement to the Count 1 offense, and the district court sentenced her to a prison term of 33 months. She now appeals her sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">Appellant asks us to vacate her sentence and remand the case for resentencing on two grounds: (1) the district court erred in refusing to grant a downward adjustment from the prescribed Guidelines sentence range under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.12; and (2) the court clearly erred in refusing to reduce her offense level under U.S.S.G., \u00a7 3B1.2. We consider these grounds in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">Section 5K2.12 authorizes the court to depart downward \u201c[i]f the defendant committed the offense because of serious coercion, blackmail or duress, under circumstances not amounting to a complete defense.\u201d The problem appellant faces in pursuing her first ground that the court erred in applying \u00a7 5K2.12 is that we lack jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s refusal to depart downward unless the district court erroneously believed that it lacked authority to depart. <em>United States v. Adams, </em>316 F.3d 1196, 1197 (11th Cir. 2003). In this case, the court was well aware of its authority to depart; thus, we lack jurisdiction to consider appellant\u2019s first ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">Appellant claims that the court erred in considering whether to grant her \u00a7 3B1.2 relief because it applied a <em>per se </em>preclusive rule instead of the two-part analysis established in <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930 (11th Cir.1999). Section 3B1.2 provides for a two to four-level decrease in offense level based on a defendant\u2019s role in the offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. A defendant can receive a four-level reduction if determined to be a minimal participant in the offense, a two-level reduction if a minor participant, and a three-level reduction if her role falls between a minimal and minor participant. <em>Id. </em>The application notes to \u00a7 3B1.2 provide that a minimal participant is a defendant \u201cwho plays a minimal role in concerted activity\u201d and is \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, App. Note 4. A minor participant is a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, App. Note 5. The commentary further indicates that a defendant \u201cwho is convicted of a drug trafficking offense, whose role in that offense was limited to transporting or storing drugs and who is accountable under \u00a7 1B1.3 only for the quantity of drugs the defendant personally transported or stored is not precluded from consideration for an adjustment under this guideline.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, App. Note 3(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">In considering a defendant\u2019s role in an offense, a district court first must \u201cmeasure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which she was held accountable at sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945. \u201c[I]n many cases, this method of analysis will be dispositive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cSecond, the district court may also measure the defendant\u2019s role against the other participants, to the extent that they are discernable, in that relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b990-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>The proponent of the downward adjustment has the burden of proving a mitigating role in an offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 939. \u201c[A] defendant\u2019s status as a drug courier does not alter the principle that the district court [first] must assess the defendant\u2019s role in light of the relevant conduct attributed to her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 942. \u201c[W]hen a drug courier\u2019s relevant conduct is limited to her own act of importation, a district court may legitimately conclude that the courier played an important or essential role in the importation of those drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 942-943.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">The district court\u2019s determination that appellant did not play a minor role in her offense was not clearly erroneous because she played an essential role by transporting the drugs in to the United States. Given this circumstance, her sentence is due to be, and is,</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
