We will dismiss the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">In December 2004, Anderson filed a complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging Eighth Amendment claims of deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs-an ongoing knee and lower back condition. Specifically, Anderson claimed the defendants misdiagnosed his knee and back pain and provided \u201cconservative\u201d treatments that were ineffective. For relief, Anderson sought an independent medical evaluation, an MRI, and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, for summary judgment arguing that Anderson failed to state a claim for relief. The District Court granted defendants\u2019 motion and dismissed Anderson\u2019s complaint. The District Court also denied Anderson\u2019s motion for injunctive relief. Anderson timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Having granted Anderson leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal, we must now determine whether his appeal should be dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). An appeal may be dismissed under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if it has no arguable basis in law or fact. <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). Summary judgment is proper only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and if, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Saldana v. Kmart Corp., </em>260 F.3d 228, 232 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">With respect to defendant Hemp-hill, Anderson\u2019s Bivens<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> action fails because Hemphill, as USP-Lewisburg\u2019s Health Services Administrator, is a member of the United States Public Health Service (USPHS). <em>See Cuoco v. Moritsugu, </em>222 F.3d 99, 107 (2d Cir.2000) (under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 233(a), members of the Public Health Service are immune from suit in a <em>Bivens </em>action if the injury for which compensation is sought resulted from the performance of a medical or related function while acting within the scope of their office or employment). Anderson\u2019s exclusive remedy for injuries caused by a member of the USPHS is against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2671, <em>et. seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">The Eighth Amendment \u201crequires prison officials to provide basic medical treatment to those [ ] incarcerated.\u201d <em>Rouse v. Plantier, </em>182 F.3d 192, 197 (3d Cir.1999) (citing <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976)). To establish a medical claim based on the Eighth Amendment, an inmate must allege acts or omissions by prison officials sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to a serious medical need. <em>See Spruill v. Gillis, </em>372 F.3d 218, 235-36 (3d Cir.2004). Without the requisite mental state, a prison official\u2019s conduct alone will not constitute deliberate indifference. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837-38, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). Negligence, unsuccessful medical treatment, or medical malpractice do not give rise to a successful claim, and an inmate\u2019s disagreement with medical treatment is insufficient to establish deliberate indifference. <em>See Durmer v. O\u2019Carroll, </em>991 F.2d 64, 68-69 (3d Cir.1993). Also, a civil rights claim cannot be premised on a theory of respondeat superior. <em>See Rode v. Dellar</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number><em>ciprete, </em>845 F.2d 1195, 1207 (3d Cir.1988). Rather, each named defendant must be shown, via the complaint\u2019s allegations, to have been personally involved in the events or occurrences alleged by the plaintiff to be unlawful. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">In this case, the District Court noted that because the Bureau of Prisons defendants (Warden Smith, Regional Director Dodrill, or Administrator Watts) are not health workers, Anderson failed to state an Eighth Amendment claim of deliberate indifference against them. We agree. <em>See Durmer, </em>991 F.2d at 69 (stating that prison personnel who were not physicians could not be considered deliberately indifferent for failing to respond to an inmate\u2019s medical needs when the inmate was already receiving treatment from the prison\u2019s medical staff). Moreover, none of the defendants is alleged to have any direct contact with Anderson regarding his medical care concerns. Anderson simply identifies the defendants by their titles in his complaint and does not mention them anywhere in his statement of the claim. As there is no respondeat superior liability in a civil rights action, he cannot hold these defendants responsible for the acts of their subordinates simply because of their supervisory positions. <em>See Rode </em>845 F.2d at 1207. Furthermore, we agree with the District Court that his allegations do no more than allege \u201cmere\u201d negligence. <em>See Durmer, </em>991 F.2d at 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">For the foregoing reasons, Anderson\u2019s appeal will be dismissed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) for lack of legal merit.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-9\">. <em>Bivens v.
