Booker, </em>548 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We previously affirmed Appellant\u2019s convictions and sentences for cocaine importation, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952(a), and possession with intent to distribute cocaine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). <em>See United States v. Ferguson, </em>129 Fed.Appx. 597 (11th Cir.2005) (unpublished). The Supreme Court vacated our prior decision and remanded the case to us for further consideration in the light of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">In his initial brief on direct appeal, Appellant challenged his convictions, but not his sentences. And Appellant did not assert error based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or any case extending or applying the <em>Apprendi </em>principle. Appellant first mentioned a Boo/eer-based sentencing claim in his petition for rehearing, which we denied. In <em>United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>533 U.S. 962, 121 S.Ct. 2621, 150 L.Ed.2d 774 (2001), after the Supreme Court\u2019s remand with instructions to reconsider our opinion in the light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we declined to review the <em>Apprendi </em>issue because it was not presented in the appellant\u2019s initial brief. <em>Id. </em>at 990 (citations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Nealy, </em>232 F.3d 825, 830 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201cDefendant abandoned the <em>[Apprendi </em>] indictment issue by not raising the issue in his initial brief\u2019). Recently, we applied <em>Ardley </em>to a <em>post-Booker </em>remand and determined that the defendant had abandoned his <em>Booker </em>claim because he failed to raise it at the district court or in his initial brief. <em>See United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261, 1262-63 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied, -U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 442, 163 L.Ed.2d 336 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-15\">Appellant did not assert error based on <em>Apprendi </em>(or its progeny) in his initial brief on appeal. We, thus, reinstate our previous opinion in this case and affirm Appellant\u2019s convictions and sentences after our reconsideration in the light of <em>Booker, </em>pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-16\">OPINION REINSTATED; CONVICTIONS AND SENTENCES AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
