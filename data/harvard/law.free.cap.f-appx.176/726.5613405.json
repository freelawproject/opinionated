To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review only the BIA\u2019s denial of Malhi\u2019s second motion to reopen, as he did not petition for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of his first motion to reopen. <em>Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1258 (9th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>1996). We deny the petition for review in part and dismiss it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>see Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1187 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc), we conclude that the BIA acted within its discretion in denying Malhi\u2019s motion to reopen on the ground that he failed to comply with the requirements of <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637, 1988 WL 235454 (BIA 1988). To be timely filed, Malhi\u2019s second motion to reopen must depend on the ineffectiveness of his second counsel. Yet, Malhi did not comply with the <em>Lozada </em>requirement to provide this prior counsel with notice and an opportunity to respond. <em>See Reyes v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 592, 599 (9th Cir. 2004) (\u201cBecause Reyes cannot prove he gave [counsel] notice of the ineffective assistance allegations or an adequate opportunity to respond, we conclude that Reyes has not substantially satisfied <em>Lozada.\u201d). </em>Prior counsel\u2019s alleged ineffectiveness is not evident from the record before us. Accordingly, we deny this aspect of the petition for review. <em>See id. </em>at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">To the extent that Malhi challenges the BIA\u2019s failure to reopen his proceedings <em>sua sponte, </em>we lack jurisdiction over this claim. <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159-60 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">We also lack jurisdiction over Malhi\u2019s contention that he did not receive adequate warnings from the immigration judge concerning the consequences of overstaying his voluntary departure period, as this claim was not exhausted before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that exhaustion is mandatory and jurisdictional).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">Malhi\u2019s pending motion to stay removal, post a bond, or remand is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b754-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
