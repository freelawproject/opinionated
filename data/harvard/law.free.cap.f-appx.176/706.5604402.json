At sentencing, the parties agreed that Ramirez\u2019s advisory Guidelines imprisonment range, based on a total offense level of 27 and a Category I criminal history and after safety-valve relief, was 70-87 months. Ramirez\u2019s counsel indicated that Ramirez was not seeking a variance from that range and asked for a 70-month sentence. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced Ramirez to 70 months\u2019 imprisonment and 5 years\u2019 supervised release. On appeal, different counsel for Ramirez has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the district court plainly erred in failing to consider all of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors before imposing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-23\">We conclude that, because Ramirez agreed to the underlying Guidelines calculations and specifically requested the 70-month prison term, he may not challenge his sentence on appeal. <em>See United States v. Nguyen, </em>46 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1995) (\u201cA defendant who explicitly and voluntarily exposes himself to a specific sentence may not challenge that punishment on appeal.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Mickelson, </em>433 F.3d 1050, 1056 (8th Cir.2006) (defendant\u2019s stipulation to total offense level and to specific Guidelines range and his counsel\u2019s request for sentence within stipulated-to range \u201cmay be interpreted as an acknowledgment that any sentence within the range would have been reasonable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-24\">After reviewing the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>district court, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b734-25\">.
