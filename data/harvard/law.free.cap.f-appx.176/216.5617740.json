Among other instances of persecution, Balde alleged that he was arrested multiple times, that his house was destroyed, that he was incarcerated for four months, that he was beaten and burned with scalding water by police, and that his wife was assaulted by police. The IJ found Balde\u2019s testimony not credible and, accordingly, concluded that Balde did not qualify for asylum or for withholding of removal under the INA or the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">When the BIA affirms an IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). On review, we accept the factual findings of an IJ \u201cunless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B), and apply the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard. <em>See, e.g., Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201cA court reviewing the determinations of an administrative agency for \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 must defer to the factfinder\u2019s findings based on \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)). We are especially deferential when reviewing adverse credibility determinations. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73-74 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">Here, we find that the IJ\u2019s decision was based upon substantial evidence. The IJ pointed to specific inconsistencies with direct relevance to Balde\u2019s claim. For example, the IJ found that Balde told contradictory stories related to the government\u2019s alleged destruction of his house in 1998. Balde said at one point that police \u201cfound me in my house and they arrested me.\u201d He then said that he was arrested while standing in a line with other protesters outdoors near his house. The IJ also found that Balde made inconsistent statements with regard to a 1993 arrest, stating at one time that his uncle \u201cwas there\u201d with him when he was arrested and stating at another time that his uncle \u201cwas not there.\u201d Although Balde offered explanations for these discrepancies, it was not unreasonable for the IJ\u2014who observed Balde\u2019s demeanor and heard his testimony live\u2014to reject the explanations as implausible. In addition, the IJ found that Balde\u2019s credibility was undermined by his failure to submit any documentary evidence of the multiple summonses Balde claimed to have received from police. She noted as well that if Balde\u2019s testimony concerning the dates of his imprisonment and the birth date of his youngest child are accurate, the child would have spent more than ten months <em>in \u00fatero.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>While we may not agree with every finding of the IJ, we cannot conclude that \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled\u201d to believe Balde\u2019s story. We therefore decline to disturb the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum. Because Balde lacks the well-founded fear of persecution needed to qualify for asylum, he cannot qualify for withholding of removal. <em>See Abankwah v. INS, </em>185 F.3d 18, 22 (2d Cir.1999). The IJ\u2019s finding that Balde has no credible fear of persecution also supports the denial of Balde\u2019s CAT claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\"><em>% </em>\u2756</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-9\">.

When questioned as to these dates, Balde stated that his wife was pregnant for \"[n]ine months and ten days.\u201d While it is possible, of course, for a mother to carry her child for ten months and for the father to misapprehend the length of gestation, the IJ was not unreasonable in finding that this testimony undermined Balde\u2019s credibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
