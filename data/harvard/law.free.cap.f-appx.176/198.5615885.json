Pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 43(c)(2), Attorney General Alberto R.

We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">We review the IJ\u2019s decision where, as here, the BIA summarily adopted or affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion. <em>See Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Jin Hui Gao v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>400 F.3d 963, 964 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">In this case, despite several flaws in the IJ\u2019s analysis, the adverse credibility finding was supported by substantial evidence. It was proper for the IJ to rely on Yeh\u2019s failure to mention, prior to the hearing, that his wife had been interrogated regarding Yeh\u2019s father\u2019s involvement in Falun Gong, because it involved \u201cthe heart of the asylum claim,\u201d <em>cf. Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308 (2d Cir.2003) (citing <em>Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d Cir.2002)), and was not a \u201cminor and isolated\u201d disparity <em>cf. id. </em>(citing <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 288 (2d Cir.2000)). Although the IJ confused Yeh\u2019s explanation for this omission with another part of Yeh\u2019s testimony, this oversight is not dis-positive, as the IJ would not have been compelled to accept the explanation Yeh gave for the omission. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80 (2d Cir.2005) (stressing that a petitioner must do more than offer a plausible explanation for his inconsistent statements to secure relief; he must show that the fact-finder would be compelled to credit his testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">Moreover, the IJ\u2019s dubious reliance on the fact that the abortion certificate submitted by Yeh did not indicate on its face that the abortion had been involuntary, and thus illegal, and his factually incorrect finding that Yeh had not testified as to any fear stemming from the authorities\u2019 suspicions of Yeh\u2019s or his father\u2019s involvement in Falun Gong, do not overcome the other substantial evidence in support of the adverse credibility finding. This evidence includes the inconsistency between Yeh\u2019s testimony and the letter from Yeh\u2019s wife\u2019s aunt and the implausibility of Yeh\u2019s fear that he would be persecuted for his father\u2019s practice of Falun Gong in light of his testimony that his wife had been left alone by authorities after her initial interrogation. Because of this evidence, we can state with confidence that the same decision would be made on remand. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 161-63 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">Because the only evidence of a threat to Yeh\u2019s life or freedom depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on the claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 276 (2d Cir.2003). Additionally, because the record supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Yeh failed to testify credibly with respect to the specific facts upon which his asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT claims were based, denial of CAT relief was proper. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005) (upholding denial of CAT relief based on adverse credibility determination with respect to specific fact upon which CAT claim premised).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having complet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>ed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
