Nomar pled guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud via the internet, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (2000), and escape, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751(a) (2000), and was sentenced to a term of seventy-seven months imprisonment. We affirmed his sentence. <em>United States v. Nomar, </em>95 Fed.Appx. 28 (4th Cir.2004) (unpublished). The Supreme Court subsequently granted certiorari, vacated this court\u2019s judgment in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and remanded Nomar\u2019s case to this court for further proceedings. For the reasons explained below, we vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-14\">Nomar was sentenced before <em>Booker </em>and its predecessor, <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), were decided, and he did not raise objections in the district court based on the mandatory nature of the sentencing guidelines or the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines based on facts he did not admit. Therefore, we review his sentence for plain error. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). Nomar had posed as a doctor and written prescriptions for online customers, some of whom were addicts. The district court calculated Nomar\u2019s guideline range under the 2003 version of the <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-15\">Count One (conspiracy to commit wire fraud)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-16\">Base offense level 6 USSG \u00a7 2Fl.l(a)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-17\">+ 7 loss of $175,000, (b)(1)(H)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APP\">+ 2 more than minimal planning, (b)(2)(A)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-18\">+ 2 use of mass marketing, (b)(3)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-19\">+ 2 risk of serious bodily injury, (b)(7)(A)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-20\">+ 2 abuse of position of trust, USSG \u00a7 3B1.3 + 2 organizerAeader role, USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(c)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-21\">+ 2 obstruction of justice (escape during prosecution),</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-22\">_ USSG \u00a7 3C1.1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-23\">Adjusted offense level 25</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-26\">Count Two (escape)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-27\">Base offense level .13 USSG \u00a7 2Pl.l(a)(l)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-28\">Adjusted offense level 13</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-29\">Multiple count adjustment None, USSG \u00a7\u00a7 3D1.3, 3D1.4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-30\">Combined adjusted offense level: 25 Criminal history category: III Guideline range: 70-87 months</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-31\">At the sentencing hearing, Nomar objected to the enhancement for risk of serious bodily injury. He either admitted, failed to object to, or withdrew his objections to the remaining sentence enhancements. In his supplemental brief, filed at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>this court\u2019s direction after his case was remanded by the Supreme Court, Nomar argues that his sentence violated the Sixth Amendment because the district court determined certain facts that increased his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">If Nomar\u2019s offense level is calculated using all the enhancements except the one he specifically contested at sentencing (risk of serious bodily injury), the combined adjusted offense level would be 23 and his guideline range would be 57-71 months. Nomar concedes in his supplemental brief that the court correctly applied an increase of 7 levels for the amount of loss, a 2-level increase for the use of mass marketing, and a 2-level adjustment for obstruction of justice. Using this calculation, the offense level would be 17 and the guideline range would be 30-37 months. Nomar\u2019s sentence of seventy-seven months imprisonment exceeds the maximum permitted under either calculation. We conclude that Nomar\u2019s seventy-seven-month sentence was imposed in violation of the Sixth Amendment and meets the standard for plain error that must be noticed set out in Hughes.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">We therefore vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker. </em>Although the sentencing guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \u201cconsult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b376-6\"> Just as we noted in <em>Hughes, </em>\"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district court judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Nomar\u2019s sentencing. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 545 n. 4. <em>See generally Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (stating that an error is ''plain\u201d if \"the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
