A sentence imposed in the advent of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), will generally be affirmed if it is \u201creasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 517-20 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). After <em>Booker, </em>we still review the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines de novo and factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 268, 163 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-19\">\u201cWhere there is no drug seizure ..., the [district] court shall approximate the quantity of the controlled substance\u201d attributable to the defendant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n.12). In Garcia\u2019s case, the Factual Resume for his plea agreement and the information contained in his Presentence Report (PSR) supported the district court\u2019s determination that Garcia was responsible for five kilograms of cocaine. The PSR reflected that other members of the conspiracy often transported even larger quantities of cocaine than five kilograms. Moreover, Garcia and coconspirator Leopoldo Torres-Diaz went to great lengths to arrange for Garcia to drive a load of cocaine from Mexico into this country: Torres-Diaz made several telephone calls to his supplier in Mexico, traveled from the Dallas area to the Houston area to meet personally with Garcia, arranged for Garcia to travel to California to pick up a BMW sedan to use as the load vehicle, and had Garcia drive the BMW for more than a day back to Texas in order to pick up a cocaine shipment arriving from Mexico. This process took nine days, during which Torres-Diaz was apparently paying all of Garcia\u2019s expenses. Although this shipment failed, the district court did not clearly err in determining that these elaborate and expensive plans were unlikely to involve less than a multi-kilogram quantity of cocaine. <em>United States v. Torres, </em>114 F.3d 520, 527 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>The conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b578-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
