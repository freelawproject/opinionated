Circuit Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b169-18\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the petition for review be denied for the reasons stated in the order under review. The petitioners forfeited several arguments by failing to raise them in a petition for reconsideration. <em>See </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(a); <em>Freeman Eng\u2019g Assocs., Inc. v. FCC, </em>103 F.3d 169, 182 (D.C.Cir.1997). In any event, their challenges to the order, in which the Commission concluded Cingular\u2019s imposition of a corporate account administration fee did not violate Sections 201(b) and 202(a) of the Communications Act, lack merit. Where possible the Commission \u201chas regulated [mobile service providers] ... through competitive market forces,\u201d <em>Kiefer v. Paging Network, Inc., </em>16 F.C.C. Red 19,129, 19,131 (2001), and its precedent does not require a provider\u2019s charges be tied to specific costs incurred in order to satisfy \u00a7 201(b). <em>See id. </em>The Commission in this case did not err in <em>determining the </em>relevant market was competitive and the administration fee was not \u201cunjust\u201d or \u201cunreasonable.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-20\">Nor did the Commission err in concluding Gilmore failed to demonstrate Cingular\u2019s corporate and non-corporate services were \u201cfunctionally equivalent,\u201d <em>Beehive Tel., Inc. v. Bell Operating Cos., </em>12 F.C.C. Red 17,930, 17,964 (1997), a prerequisite for showing a carrier engaged in \u201cany unjust or unreasonable discrimination\u201d in violation of \u00a7 202(a). As the Commission noted and the record makes clear, Cingular offered corporate customers several services to which non-corporate customers were not entitled, including several calling features and replacement phones, at no additional charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-21\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
