His argument is based on the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Sanchez states that he is raising this issue to preserve it for Supreme Court review. This issue is foreclosed by our opinion in <em>United States v. Gamez-Gonzalez, </em>319 F.3d 695, 700 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-22\">Sanchez also argues, for the first time on appeal, that the district court lacked jurisdiction to convict and sentence him because 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 is unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi. </em>Sanchez also acknowledges that he is raising this issue to preserve it for Supreme Court review. This issue is foreclosed by our opinion in <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b541-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
