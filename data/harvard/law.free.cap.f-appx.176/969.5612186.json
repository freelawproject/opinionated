In her application for asylum and withholding of removal, Wang claimed a well-founded fear of future persecution on the ground that her mother had been sterilized by force, that she herself had violated local marriage policies, and that this violation provoked investigation and intimidation by local officials.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the IJ\u2019s findings focused on Wang\u2019s questionable credibility, the BIA rested its adoption and affirmation of the IJ\u2019s decision on the ground that Wang \u201chas not established a protected ground. Asylum for coercive population control has not been extended to the children of those subjected to forcible abortion or sterilization.\u201d Because such failure was the sole basis of the BIA\u2019s ruling, and because we are satisfied that this ground was sufficient to support the IJ\u2019s ruling, this is the only issue we need address here. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (holding that when the BIA issues a decision, this court reviews only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-10\">Upon <em>de novo </em>review, we affirm the BIA\u2019s legal determination that the daughter of a forcibly sterilized mother does not, on that basis alone, fall within the INA\u2019s definition of \u201crefugee.\u201d This holding is supported by the plain language of the INA, which specifically provides that, \u201c[f]or purposes of determinations under this chapter, a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization, or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program, shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion.... \u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-13\">Furthermore, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s factual determination that Wang has not established a \u201cwell founded fear that ... she will be forced to undergo [involuntary sterilization] or [will be] subject to persecution for ... failure, refusal, or resistance\u201d to do so. <em>Id. </em>Although Wang testified that she would be forcibly sterilized if she had more than one child in China, the IJ\u2019s contrary finding was amply supported by the following facts, also corroborated by the record: (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>Wang currently has no children and therefore would not be in violation of the family planning policy if she returned to China; (2) the Chinese government prohibits the use of force to compel a person to submit to an abortion or sterilization; (3) should Wang actually have more than once child upon returning to China, the family planning rules in Wang\u2019s province of origin admit exceptions when the first child is a girl and are, in any event, weakly enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">For the foregoing reasons, Wang cannot establish eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal under the INA. Her ineligibility for asylum confirms that she is also unable to carry the weightier burden for relief under CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b998-8\">. Wang\u2019s initial application also claimed actual persecution arising from her alleged violation of local marriage policy, which restricts marriage to individuals above a certain age. However, in addition to denying at trial that she ever suffered persecution in China, neither the policy itself nor the single instance of actual persecution cited by Wang (a confrontation between her onetime boyfriend and allegedly violent government officials) supports a claim of past persecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
