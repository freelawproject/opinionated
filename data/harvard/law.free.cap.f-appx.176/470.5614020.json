Campbell-Allison appeals the district court\u2019s denial of her motion to compel the Government to move pursuant to Fed. R.Crim.P. 35(b) for a reduction of sentence based on her substantial assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-18\">The district court construed Campbell-Allison\u2019s motion as arising under Rule 35(b). A motion for reduction of a sentence pursuant to Rule 35(b) must be filed by the Government. <em>United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 141 (5th Cir.1994). The Government\u2019s refusal to move for a reduction of sentence is not renewable by the district court absent a \u201csubstantial threshold showing\u201d that the decision is based on an unconstitutional motive. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). Campbell-Allison has not made such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-23\">Campbell-Allison\u2019s motion was \u201cunauthorized and without a jurisdictional basis.\u201d <em>United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 141 (5th Cir.1994). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b498-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
