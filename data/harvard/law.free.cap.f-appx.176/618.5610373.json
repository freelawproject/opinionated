Our review is limited to determining whether the Commissioner used proper legal standards to evaluate the evidence and whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a careful review of the record, we AFFIRM for the reasons articulated by the magistrate judge and adopted by the district court, namely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">1. The Commissioner properly applied the three-step sequential analysis in determining whether Torres is eligible for SSI benefits on the basis of disability,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by addressing: (1) whether Torres is engaged in substantial gainful activity, (2) whether Torres has a severe physical or mental impairment, and (3) whether Torres\u2019s impairments meet or equal in severity the listed impairments set forth in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">2. There is substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s finding that Torres\u2019s impairments do not meet or equal in severity a listed impairment. To show that his impairments are functionally equal to a listed impairment, Torres must establish that he has a \u201cmarked\u201d limitation in two broad areas of functioning, also known as \u201cdomains,\u201d or an \u201cextreme\u201d limitation in one domain.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The domains used to assess childhood disability are: (1) acquiring and using information; (2) attending and completing tasks; (3) interacting and relating with others; (4) moving around and manipulating objects; (5) caring for oneself; and (6) health and physical well being.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the record shows that Torres suffers from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (\u201cADHD\u201d), dyslexia, and asthma, there is substantial evidence that these impairments do not \u201cinterfere[] seriously with [his] ability to independently initiate, sustain, or complete activities.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX1\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b646-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
