The district court\u2019s ruling is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Pardue, </em>36 F.3d 429, 430 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Alegr\u00eda argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion, asserting that, pursuant to retroactive Amendment 484 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, packing materials must be excluded from calculating drug quantities for sentencing purposes. He conclusionally states that the 163 kilograms of cocaine attributed to him in the PSR included 12.6 kilograms of duct tape and packaging and that, without those wrappings, he would have been held responsible for only 150 kilograms of cocaine, which would have reduced his total offense level and removed the possibility of a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Even prior to Amendment 484, packaging materials were not to be included when determining the amount of drugs attributable to a defendant for sentencing purposes. <em>See, e.g., Chapman v. United States, </em>500 U.S. 453, 463, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 114 L.Ed.2d 524 (1991). Because Alegr\u00eda could have raised his argument on direct appeal, it is not cognizable under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994). The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Alegria\u2019s motion. Accordingly, its judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b490-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
