We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">This Court reviews the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>418 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam); <em>Khouzam v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 161, 165 (2d Cir.2004) (citing <em>Brice v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>806 F.2d 415, 419 (2d Cir.1986)). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Kaur, </em>413 F.3d at 233-34; <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted in Kaur).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">In Liu\u2019s case, establishing <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for asylum was dependent on establishing credibility. Her new evidence did nothing to challenge the IJ\u2019s finding that her testimony regarding her Falun Gong activities and the local authorities\u2019 pursuit of her was incredible. In her motion to reopen, Liu claimed that: (1) the authorities began harassing her parents two and one-half years after she left China; and (2) only since she has been in the United States have the local authorities discovered that she is now an extensive Falun Gong practitioner. Liu submitted a letter from her parents, which supported her claim that: (1) the village cadres harassed her parents, in an effort to find her; and (2) the village cadres knew about her Falun Gong activities. The BIA\u2019s observation that, \u201cit is clear from the materials presented that the respondent doesn\u2019t want to return to China,\u201d reflects the BIA\u2019s skepticism of Liu\u2019s evidence. The BIA\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe materials presented by [Liu] do not provide a basis ... to conclude that [Liu] now possesses a well-founded fear of persecution\u201d was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">Liu has not challenged the BIA\u2019s decision regarding her family planning claim in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>her brief to this Court. Issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 542 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
