Having carefully reviewed the record and briefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment because, although Fortenberry raised five points of error in her notice of appeal, she did not substantively address any of these issues in her appellate brief, provide us with any authority in support of her position, or direct us to any pertinent portions of the record. Generally, issues not briefed are deemed to be abandoned on appeal, even in the case of a pro se litigant like Fortenberry.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-24\">Fortenberry\u2019s only argument on appeal is that we should reverse the district court\u2019s judgment because First Federal Bank for Savings\u2019s (\u201cFirst Federal\u201d) attorney obtained it by committing a fraud on that court. She has not cited to any evidence in support of her claim and we have found none in the record. We thus AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment denying Fortenberry pre-judgment interest.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b658-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
