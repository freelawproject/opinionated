For the first time on appeal, Bailones argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel that made his guilty plea involuntary and his sentence unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-24\">Because Bailones did not raise his claims in the district court, there is no evidentiary record on these issues. Consequently, the record has not been developed sufficiently for us to consider Bal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Jones\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Kizzee, </em>150 F.3d 497, 502-03 (5th Cir. 1998). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed without prejudice to Ballones\u2019s right to raise his ineffective assistance of counsel claims in a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. We express no view on the merits of such a motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b482-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
