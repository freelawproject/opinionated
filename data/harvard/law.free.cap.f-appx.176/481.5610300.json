He contends that he was sentenced in contravention of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Jones\u2019s plea agreement contained an express waiver of his right to appeal his sentence and he retained only the \u201crights (a) to bring a direct appeal of (i) a sentence exceeding the statutory maximum punishment, (ii) an upward departure from the guideline range deemed applicable by the district court, or (iii) an arithmetic error at sentencing, and (b) a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d The Government seeks to enforce the waiver. Our review of the record indicates that the waiver was knowing and voluntary and that under its plain language, it bars Jones\u2019s <em>Booker </em>arguments. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 545-46 (5th Cir.2005). The waiver is not invalid merely because it was made before <em>Booker. See United States v. Burns, </em>433 F.3d 442, 450-51 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"Aq5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b510-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
