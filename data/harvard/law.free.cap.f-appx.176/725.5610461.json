Gonzales, </em>427 F.3d 1218, 1221-22 (9th Cir. 2005). We dismiss the petition on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 over petitioner\u2019s withholding of removal claim. We review for substantial evidence and may reverse only if the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Rostomian v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 1088, 1089 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s withholding of removal claim because he did not show that it was more likely than not that he would be persecuted if returned to Pakistan. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Petitioner failed to raise his CAT claim in his opening brief and therefore waived this claim. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v.
