To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-23\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s discretionary determination that the petitioners failed to demonstrate exceptional and extremely unusual hardship. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 929-30 (9th Cir.2005). Furthermore, the petitioners\u2019 challenge to the IJ\u2019s interpretation of the hardship standard fails because the IJ\u2019s interpretation fell within the broad range of acceptable interpretations. <em>See Ramirez-Perez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 1001, 1005 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-24\">We are not persuaded that the petitioners\u2019 removal results in the deprivation of their children\u2019s rights. <em>See Cabrera-Alvarez v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 1006, 1012-13 (9th Cir.2005). Moreover, the IJ\u2019s interpretation and application of the hardship standard did not violate the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. <em>See id. </em>(holding that the agency\u2019s interpretation of the hardship standard does not violate the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d principle articulated in the Convention on the Rights of the Child).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>The respondent\u2019s motion to accept its late opposition to petitioners\u2019 motion for sanctions is granted. The Clerk shall file the opposition received on November 17, 2005. The petitioners\u2019 motion for sanctions is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b745-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
