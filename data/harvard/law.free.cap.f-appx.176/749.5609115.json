Dec. 74, 2001 WL 534296 (BIA 2001). As a result, because he failed to exhaust, we lack jurisdiction to consider petitioner\u2019s contentions regarding his waiver of appeal, his detention status, his alleged eligibility for other forms of immigration relief, and his order of removal. <em>See Joo v.
