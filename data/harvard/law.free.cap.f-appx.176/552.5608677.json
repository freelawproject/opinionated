Castanon argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Castanon\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Castanon contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Castanon properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Castanon asserts that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment because his prior deportation order was fundamentally unfair. An alien seeking to collaterally challenge an order of deportation or removal in a \u00a7 1326 prosecution must establish (1) that proceeding was \u201cfundamentally unfair\u201d; (2) that the proceeding \u201ceffectively eliminated\u201d his right to challenge the proceeding by means of judicial review; and (3) that \u201cprocedural deficiencies\u201d actually prejudiced him. <em>United States v. Mendoza-Mata, </em>322 F.3d 829, 832 (5th Cir.2003) (citation omitted); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 1326(d). If the alien fails to establish one prong of the test, the others need not be considered. <em>See Mendoza-Mata, </em>322 F.3d at 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Castanon argues that he was denied the opportunity to be heard and to present evidence in support of his claims for discretionary relief and that the deportation order had an impermissible retroactive effect. However, Castanon requested a type of discretionary relief for which he was not eligible. Moreover, the failure to inform an alien of types of discretionary relief for which he is eligible does not violate due process. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Ortiz, </em>313 F.3d 225, 230-31 (5th Cir.2002). As Castanon concedes, this court has rejected his assertion about the retroactive effect of the definition of deportable offenses; he seeks to preserve the issue for Supreme Court review. <em>See Max-George v. Reno, </em>205 F.3d 194, 200 (5th Cir.2000), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>533 U.S. 945, 121 S.Ct. 2585, 150 L.Ed.2d 746 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">We conclude that Castanon has failed to show that he was denied the opportunity to be heard or that his deportation proceedings were fundamentally unfair. Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b580-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
