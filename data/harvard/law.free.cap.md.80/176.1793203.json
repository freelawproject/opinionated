Every fact stated in the prayer might have been found to be true, and yet the jury might properly have refused to sustain the marriage, because there was evidence qualifying these facts and tending to throw discredit and suspicion upon the cohabitation between the parties.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b204-12\">If a marriage can be justly inferred from the facts, then the presumption is that it was lawfully contracted wherever it may have taken place, and it will make no difference if it be shown that by the law of the State where it was contracted, the same ceremony is not requisite which is prescribed by the law of this State.

The appellants answered, denying that the petitioner was the lawful child of the said Jackson, who&gt; they alleged, was never married, and died without lawful issue, and asked that administration be granted to one of his brothers or sisters, as next of kin. Upon the petition of the appellee the following issue was sent by the said Orphans\u2019 Court to the Circuit Court for trial: \u201c Is Sallie Jackson, the petitioner in this cause, the only lawful child of Richard Watson Jackson, intestate, deceased, whose estate is sought to be administered upon?\u201d At the trial ten bills of exceptions were taken to the rulings of the Circuit Court, (Lloyd and Holland, JJ.) The second exception was taken to the testimony of a medical witness who had attended Mary Morris, the mother of the appellee, before and after her alleged marriage, to the effect that she had never been delivered of a child before the one spoken of by the witness. The fourth exception was taken to the refusal of the Court to allow a witness to be asked, on cross-examination, if he had ever heard the reputation of the plaintiff\u2019s mother for chastity questioned or doubted before the time she lived with Watson Jackson as his wife. The other exceptions to the evidence are stated in the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-5\">The plaintiff offered the following prayers :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-6\"><em>Plaintiff's First Prayer. </em>\u2014 If the jury find from the evidence that R.- Watson Jackson, during the period from the early part of the year 1870 to the early part of the year 1872, visited Mary Morris at her mother\u2019s house in Philadelphia, and that sometime between the first of February and the first of April, 1872, the said R. Watson Jackson and Mary Monis left the city of Philadelphia for a short period of time, and afterward returned to the house of said Maiy Morris in said city, and stated to her parents and relatives that they had been married in Chester, Pa.;

Watson Jackson and the plaintiffs mother did live together as man and wife, and did so hold themselves out to the world and so declare, and there was repute of their marriage in the communities where they lived, yet, in determining or finding from this evidence whether or not they were married, they should take into consideration the reputation of the plaintiffs mother for chastity, the length of time they so lived together and held themselves out as man and wife, the manner and circumstances of their coming together as husband and wife and so living, the length of time they lived apart, their conduct, habits and circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>since their separation, the declarations of them or either of them during their separation, and the manner in which they were received and treated by their respective families and the society of the cpmmunity in which they lived during the time of their cohabitation and the years of their separation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-5\"><em>Defendants' Ninth Prayer. </em>\u2014 The defendants pray the Court to instruct the jury, that if there is no evidence of a valid marriage between the plaintiffs mother and R.

Pattison </em>on the brief), for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-7\">\u2022 The first exception arises on the admission of the depositions taken in Philadelphia. This testimony was taken under the Act of 1888, 1 Code, Art. 35, sec. 16. On the call of the docket on April 23, this case was set for trial by consent of all parties for May 8th. On April 27th notice was given of the plaintiff\u2019s (appellee\u2019s) intention to take this testimony on the fourth of May, which was taken in Philadelphia, returned and filed May 7th (Record, page 12.) We submit that the whole proceedings were <em>irregular, </em>and that the appellants were taken by <em>surprise. </em>Sec. 16 declares that depositions taken under it \u201c shall be treated in all respects as if taken under a commission regularly issued by said Court, and shall be subject to like exceptions as testimony taken under commission.\u201d Therefore, all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>particularity is required in this \u201cmode\u201d as if taken under a commission. The \u201cnotice of not less than five days\u201d takes the place of a commission, but in all other respects the modes are identical.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-5\">First, we ask if this statute is to be so construed as to take a party by surprise, allowing depositions taken and filed one day before trial under the statutory requirement of five days notice? If so, what becomes of the rule and practice requiring depositions to lie in Court, and \u201c to be published in the same manner and form as has heretofore been the practice in the case of a commission from a Court of Equity.\u201d Code, Sec. 15, Art. 35. 2 Poe\u2019s Pleading, in speaking of \u201c open commissions\u201d and oral examinations, declares \u201c that it is absolutely indispensable that <em>due and reasonable notice </em>be given of the time and place, etc.\u201d This is such a just principle and practice that no authority need be cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-7\">The second ground of irregularity and surprise is, that there were no interrogatories filed or served on the appellants. While a notice of time and place is not necessary in the taking of depositions under a commission, \u201cactual'or constructive notice should be given to the opposite party <em>in time </em>to enable him to exhibit cross-interrogatories before the commission is sent out.\u201d <em>B. &amp; O. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>State, </em>60 Md. 458. Supplemental interrogatories were ruled out in <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Dare, 20 </em>Md. 268; <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Sedgwick, </em>5 Gill, 320. It was impossible for the appellants to know the nature of the testimony to be taken and to prepare cross-interrogatories, or rebuttal testimony. The depositions were taken Friday, May 4th, and immediately sent for filing, and filed on Monday, the seventh. Nor is the appearance of the appellants\u2019 attorney a waiver of any rights, as he appeared specially and noted objections to the mode and procedure, and for the special purpose of reserving their rights. There was no waiver, expressed or implied, of any rights: In the next place, the notice is irregular, as \u201c It is a notice that the plaintiff will attend <em>in person or by attorney.\" </em>No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>such right is given under the Code. A party cannot compel the opposite party to attend in person. \u201c The depositions shall be treated in all respects as if taken under a commission regularly issued.\u201d This practice * requires interrogatories to be filed. Notice by filing interrogatories is a prerequisite. 60 Md. 458. The notice under the statute supersedes the commission only, not the interrogatories. The second and third exceptions must fall with the first.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-5\">On the other exceptions and the prayers, the counsel relied on: <em>Boone </em>v. <em>Purnell, </em>28 Md. 607; <em>Redgrave </em>v. <em>Redgrave, </em>38 Md. 95; <em>Barnum\u2019s case, </em>42 Md. 251; <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Blackburn, </em>17 Md. 53; <em>Denison </em>v. <em>Denison, </em>33 Md. 361; <em>Dartmouth College case, </em>4 Wheat. 518; <em>Wade </em>v. <em>Kalbfleisch, </em>58 N.

At the trial before the jury the plaintiff introduced a good deal of testimony tending to prove the marriage of her parents and her legitimacy. It was in evidence that Richard Watson Jackson was residing in Philadelphia, and that he and Mary Morris, who was residing there in February or M\u00e1rch, eighteen hundred and seventy-two, went to Chester to be married, and after they returned, both of them stated that they were married. It was also testified that they acknowledged each other as husband and wife; that they cohabited together and were generally reputed to be married. It is not-certain, from the testimony, at what time their cohabitation conmenced or when the child was born.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Evidence was also given of the declarations of Jackson and the reputed wife, who are both dead, that Sallie Jackson was their legitimate daughter; also of declarations to the same purport made by the mother of the reputed wife. On the other hand, the evidence in behalf of the defendants tended to prove declarations by Watson Jackson that he was not the father of Sallie Jackson, and declarations, both by him and the mother, that they were never married; that the reputation of the mother for chastity was bad, both- before and during her cohabitation with Watson Jackson; that they were not generally reputed to be married, and that they separated sometime in eighteen hundred and seventy-four, and never lived together afterwards. It appears from the proceedings in the Orphans\u2019 Court, that Watson Jackson died in October, eighteen hundred and ninety-three. It does not devolve upon us to settle the disputed questions of fact arising on the evidence; it was for the jury to determine the credibility of the testimony, and to draw all legitimate inferences from it. We are limited to a review of the questions of law decided by the Circuit Court as they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>are presented in the bills of exception. These are ten in number, and were all taken by the defendants. They have appealed, as the verdict was in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">By the law of Maryland a valid marriage cannot exist unless it is celebrated by a religious ceremony. It is not required that the marriage should be proved by witnesses who were present at the time ; but such facts must be proved, as in the contemplation of the law will justifiy the inference that a religious ceremony has been performed. The declarations of deceased parents are admitted as evidence to prove the legitimacy of their children. <em>Craufurd </em>v. <em>Blackburn, </em>17 Md. 49. It was said in the <em>Berkley Peerage </em>case: <em>\u201c </em>If the father is proved to have brought up the party as his legitimate son, this is sufficient evidence of legitimacy until impeached, and indeed it amounts to a daily assertion that the son is legitimate.\u201d This assertion of the legitimacy of the son involves and implies the precedent condition that the parents were lawfully married. In <em>Copes </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>7 Gill, 247, the evidence of the legitimacy of the female petitioner (Mrs. Pearce) consisted of the declarations of her reputed father, Giles Copes, deceased, that he had been married to her mother, and that she was his daughter; together with the fact that she lived with him as his daughter before her marriage, and proof that she was called \u201c Sister Betsy,\u201d and treated and recognized as a sister by the sons of a woman whom he married after the death of her mother. The Court said: \u201c The declarations of Giles Copes are full and explicit with regard to his marriage and the birth of Elizabeth, the appellee; and his whole subsequent conduct, and the course and bearing of the brothers, is an entire corroboration of them. Nothing short of actual proof of marriage and birth, by witnesses actually present, could be more convincing and conclusive.\u201d Marriage may also be proved by general reputation. <em>Boone </em>v. <em>Purnell, </em>28 Md. 607. In most cases it is proved by general reputation, cohabitation and acknowledgment. This species of evidence is admissible in all cases, except actions to recover damages for adultery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>and indictments for bigamy. <em>Taylor on Evidence, </em>sec. 517; <em>Redgrave </em>v. <em>Redgrave, </em>38 Md. 97. The probative force of such evidence will vary according to the circumstances with which it is connected. For the sake of illustration let us state a case. Suppose it is shown that a man and a woman, lived together as husband and wife for many years, and continued this connection until it was dissolved by the death of one of them; that their deportment on all occasions was that of married people; that they acknowledged each other as husband and wife ; that they were received in society as such, and were generally so reputed and esteemed, and that to all external appearance their lives were upright, moral and irreproachable. This body of facts would lead any impartial mind irresistibly to the conclusion that they were married. The suggestion that they had been living in sin and dishonor would be justly rejected as irrational and scandalous. The necessary inference- then would be that their union originated under the circumstances which the law required to make it valid. In <em>Vincent's appeal, </em>60 Pennsylvania State Reports, 240, there were unusual and irregular features attending the cohabitation between a man and a woman; but the facts of the case were of a peculiar character, and the Court thought that the pure fame and spotless reputation of the woman made it highly improbable that she would have consented to a lascivious connection, and they gave great weight to her exemplary conduct, in considering circumstances which otherwise would have been fatally suspicious. But men and women frequently live together in honorable matrimony who do not possess the virtues of the couple in the supposed case. Therefore, it cannot be held that all of the facts which we have enumerated are absolutely necessary to prove marriage. They would prove it in a very complete and satisfactory manner. Circumstances less favorable would also establish it, but not so conclusively. The lower the standard of rectitude of the parties, the less improbable would it be that they would lead a life of shame. And so we may say that the weaker the gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>eral reputation of marriage, the less would be its effect in producing the conviction that it really existed. And matters of suspicion, if not satisfactorily explained, would in proportion to their gravity weaken the proposed inference, or might defeat it altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">It is believed that the general principles governing this branch of the law are well settled by the authorities. But there is sometimes considerable difficulty in applying them to combinations of facts. The plaintiff\u2019s first prayer accumulates a number of facts relating to the acknowledgment of marriage of the parties and to cohabitation and reputation ; with regard to reputation it required the jury to find that they \u201c were recognized in the community of Salisbury as man and wife, and held themselves out to the world as such, and that they or either of them stated to one or more citizens of Salisbury that they were married in Chester, Pa.\u201d Upon the finding of these facts it asserts that \u201c the law presumes that they were lawfully married, and the burden of proof is upon the defendants to show by a preponderance of evidence, that the said Watson and Mary were never lawfully married.\u201d It does not require the jury to find that there was a general reputation of their mai'riage. They were recognized in the community of Salisbury by some persons as husband and wife; there was also evidence that there was a general reputation in the community in favor of the marriage ; on the other hand, there was evidence that they had never been recognized as married by the family of the man, and a witness testified \u201c that there was a divided opinion as to their being married; that the general opinion of those with whom he talked was that they were not married.\u201d General reputation is of great importance in determining the nature of the cohabitation, and the question ought to have been submitted to the jury. It would have been competent for the jury to find the general reputation according to the evidence in behalf of the plaintiff, or they might have found according to the evidence on the other side. But it is necessary that the reputation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>from which marriage is to be inferred should be general and not divided or singular. <em>Barnum </em>v. <em>Barnum, </em>42 Md. 297<em>Jones </em>v. Jones, 48 Md. 391. The conclusion of the prayer is stated too strongly. The facts mentioned in the prayer, with the addition of general reputation, would have justified the jury in finding the marriage if they believed that it existed, but it was an error to say that these facts made the conclusion of law imperative in favor of a lawful marriage, and imposed on the defendants the burden of proving the negative. Every fact stated in the prayer might have been found to be true, and yet the jury might properly have refused to sustain the marriage, because there was evidence qualifying these facts, and tending to throw discredit and suspicion on the cohabitation between the parties. Mary Fuller testified that during the time of the cohabitation the plaintiff\u2019s mother stated that she was not married; and there was also evidence that her reputation for chastity was bad, both before the cohabitation and during its continuance. There was also evidence that Watson Jackson, during the time of the cohabitation, said that the child was not his. It was also testified that before they separated he stated in the woman\u2019s presence \u201c that they were never married, and she knew it,\u201d and that the woman made no reply. If the character of the woman for chastity was bad, one of the elements would be wanting which give weight to cohabitation as one of the proofs of marriage, because it would be evident that moral restraints would not prevent her from living in concubinage. And if both man and woman stated that they were not married, these declarations would be grave impeachments of the connection between them. If they stated the truth the inference of marriage would, of course, be impossible. The cohabitation important to be considered in cases of this kind, is that which in its character and circumstances is consistent with the matrimonial union. The jury must decide on the credibility of the testimony, and it was their province to decide the question of marriage according to the inferences, which, in their judgment, ought properly to be drawn from the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>The plaintiff\u2019s second prayer is in these words : <em>\u201c </em>If the jury find the facts set forth in plaintiff\u2019s first prayer, then they are instructed that said marriage is legally presumed to have been duly and lawfully contracted according to the law of the place in which they may find that said marriage occurred; and if they find that such marriage occurred in the State of Pennsylvania, then the validity of such marriage is recognized in Maryland, even though the jury may not find that any religious ceremony was performed at such marriage, nor any license obtained therefor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">This prayer is founded on the first, and must fall with it. A general principle is correctly stated in it. If the marriage is justly inferred from the facts, then the presumption is that it was lawfully contracted wherever it may have taken place, and it will make no difference, if it be shown that by the law of the State where it was contracted the same ceremony is not required which is prescribed in this State. <em>Redgrave </em>v. <em>Redgrave, </em>38 Md. 97. We, however, cannot take judicial notice of the law of Pennsylvania; if it was desired that it shpuld have any influence in this case, it ought to have been proved in evidence. <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>7 Gill, 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The first prayer on the part of the defendants, was as follows: \u201c The defendants pray the Court to instruct the jury that it is incumbent on the plaintiff to prove to the satisfaction of the jury a valid marriage between Richard Watson Jackson and the plaintiff\u2019s mother, and unless they shall so believe, their verdict must be for the defendants.\u201d The inquiry was whether there was a valid marriage, and this prayer presents the question fairly to the jury. It was correct as an abstract proposition. But as an instruction applicable to the case, it was defective, because it did not inform the jury what was necessary to constitute a valid marriage. It left them to their own conjectures to determine what circumstances were necessary to its validity. The Court made an amendment which left the jury to find <em>\u201c </em>facts from which a valid marriage may be presumed,\u201d but did not inform them what facts were required for the purpose. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>In a case like the present, where it is sought to deduce a marriage from facts and circumstances, the instructions on one side ought to set clearly before the jury the facts in evidence, from which they would be justified in finding the marriage; and on the other side the facts and circumstances should be stated which would justify them in refusing so to find. The first prayer for the defendant in <em>Boone </em>v. <em>Purnell, </em>28 Md. 618, is a good example of such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The second prayer for the defendants and the Court\u2019s amendment of it are liable to the same objections as the first. The defendants\u2019 third prayer was correct as an abstract proposition. It asserted that under the circumstances stated in the prayer, the jury could not find a marriage from reputation. But there was a good deal of other evidence for the plaintiff besides that bearing on reputation. It would perplex and embarrass trials very much to permit such a mode of practice. It is not right to instruct a jury that they cannot find a verdict from a portion of the evidence, and leave them in the dark as to what they ought to find from other portions competent to sustain a verdict. It would be an easy matter in every contested case to select some portion of the testimony which, standing alone, would not authorize a verdict for the plaintiff; but it is his right that all of the competent evidence in his favor should be considered by the jury. We do not question the right of a party to segregate a portion of the evidence, and obtain by a prayer the opinion of the Court upon its effect, as sanctioned by <em>Whiteford </em>v. <em>Buckmeyer, </em>1 Gill, 127, and many other cases. But this right must be exercised in harmony with the.other rules of practice, and is necessarily limited by their operation. The fourth and fifth prayers are liable to similar objections, and the amendments made by the Court do not materially change them. Upon the supposition that the connection between Watson Jackson and the plaintiff\u2019s mother was illicit at its commencement, it was incumbent on the plaintiff to show a subsequent marriage between them. <em>Barnum </em>v. <em>Barnum, </em>42 Md. 297; although this may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>shown by indirect proof. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>45 Md. 156. But this is not the proposition of the fourth prayer. It asserts that under such circumstances, other evidence than cohabitation was necessary to establish their marriage, but does not specify what other evidence was required. In point of fact there was much more evidence; so the prayer gave no definite information to the jury. The sixth prayer is not in question! The seventh prayer seeks an instruction in respect to the law of Pennsylvania. There is no evidence in the record of the law of Pennsylvania, and we have already said that we cannot take judicial notice of it. The eighth prayer asserts that the jury should take into consideration \u201cthe reputation of the plaintiffs motherfor chastity, the length of time they so lived together and held themselves out as man and wife, the manner and circumstances of their coming together as husband and wife and so living, the length of time they lived apart, their conduct, habits and circumstances since their separation, the declarations of them or either of them during their separation, and the manner in which they were received and treated by their respective families, and the society of the community in which they lived during the time of their cohabitation and the years of their separation.\u201d All these matters tended to show the nature of the connection between the parties, and were important in enabling the jury to determine whether the cohabitation was pure and innocent, according to the proprieties of married life, or whether it was. licentious. If the appearances and circumstances indicated virtue and respectability, they would be favorable to the inference of marriage ; but if they bore the marks of incontinence and depravity, the tendency-would be to the contrary. It rested with the jury to decide the question. The ninth prayer was properly rejected. The declarations of Jackson and the plaintiff\u2019s mother, that they were married at Chester, were competent evidence to go to the jury to prove the marriage. For this reason the tenth prayer was also properly rejected. The Court granted the two prayers of the plaintiff, and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>jected all of the defendant\u2019s in the form in which they were offered, except the sixth ; but granted the first, second, fourth and fifth with amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">We will now consider the exceptions to the rulings on the evidence. The first exception is to the admission of depositions taken in Philadelphia in behalf of the plaintiff. They were- taken in accordance with the requirements of Article 35, section 16 of the Code, and after the notice therein prescribed had been given. The defendant\u2019s counsel was present at the taking of the testimony and cross-examined the witnesses. We see no objection to the depositions. The second exception was to the testimony of Dr. Price, given in answer to the eleventh interrogatory. The matter of inquiry was a question of medical knowledge, and the witness, a physician, was competent to testify as an expert. The third exception was to the following testimony given by Lettie A. Morris : \u201c One thing I have thought of since I have been in this room. Why should he come forward and want this child ? He made the proposition to her grandmother to take her and educate her.\u201d She was speaking of' a proposition which the mother of plaintiff\u2019s mother (who died two years ago) said had been made by Jackson. It is urged that this declaration is admissible to prove family relationship It is maintained that Jackson\u2019s offer to provide for the child was evidence of an acknowledgment of her on his part as his legitimate daughter, and that this declaration of the child\u2019s grandmother tends to prove the repute in the family of her legitimacy. Waiving all question about the remoteness of this declaration from the point in issue, we may state that the effort is to establish a relationship to Jackson, and this cannot be done by the declarations of a person who is not shown by evidence <em>aliunde </em>to be related to him. This point was distinctly adjudged in <em>Blackburn </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>3 Wallace (S. C.) Reports, 188. The evidence ought to have been rejected. The question asked of the witness in the fourth exception seems to have been disallowed, because it was leading. In the fifth bill of excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>tions the defendnts proposed to ask a witness his opinion whether the parties were married. This was clearly incompetent. In the sixth the witness was asked whether he and his wife had recognized Jackson and the plaintiff\u2019s mother as husband and wife. Family repute and general reputation are evidence, but the individual opinions and recognition of two persons are hot admissible. They were not even connected with the family. In the seventh exception a witness for defendant testified that she lived in a house about three yards distant from the one occupied by Jackson and the plaintiff\u2019s mother, and that \u201c she heard whistling at night about the house, and saw men in the yard about the house at night, and that she would meet them sometimes as she was going to the well for water; that the mother of the plaintiff had told her that she had a child in Philadelphia before she was married, and that she had disposed of it by putting it in the water pipes, and that it came- before its time; that she never saw a man go in the house; but that on one occasion at night she saw a man come to the door, and plaintiff\u2019s mother met him at the door.\u201d She was then asked this question by defendants\u2019 counsel: \u201c State under what circumstances and conditions you saw the party whom you speak of go to the door, and state what you saw on that occasion?\u201d The counsel for defendants stated, \u201c that they proposed to show the conduct of the plaintiff\u2019s mother, and the suspicious character of the inmates of the house, and proposed to follow it up by frequent visits of men to the premises at night under suspicious circumstances.\u201d But on objection by the plaintiff the Court overruled the question. If the defendants could prove that the house was kept in a disorderly and disreputable manner, it would have a tendency to show that the intercourse between these parties was not of a virtuous kind. Similar testimony was tendered in the eighth exception, and for the same reason it ought to have been admitted. In the ninth exception the defendants offered to prove by a witness that he had never heard Jackson say that he was married or that he had a child.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AcP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>(Decided December 18th, 1894.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b224-3\">This witness had already testified that he was very intimate with Jackson, and had talked with him on the subject of marriage. If Jackson had said that he had never been married, it would have been admissible in evidence, but we cannot see how his failure to make any statement on the subject can be evidence. The Court ruled against the de\u2022fendants on all the questions of evidence which we have been considering. There was error in granting the plaintiff\u2019s two prayers and in refusing the defendants' eighth prayer, and in the rulings in the third, seventh and eighth exceptions to evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">\n<em>Rulings reversed and cause remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
