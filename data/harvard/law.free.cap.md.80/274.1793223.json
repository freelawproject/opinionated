Rohr, General Manager of the Consumers\u2019 Meat Company, a body corporate of the State of New Jersey, but doing business in the city of Baltimore, applied to the appellee, the Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas of Baltimore, for a single trader\u2019s license to conduct business at thirteen different, unconnected stores, alleging that the total value of all the stock and merchandise kept on hand at the principal season of sale in all thirteen of these stores, collectively, was six thousand dollars. And it was conceded at the hearing, that but for the Act of 1894, ch. 113, the clerk would have been authorized to grant the license as applied for, as provided by the Public General Laws of the State, relating to traders\u2019, licenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The only question, then, in this case, is as to the validity of the Act of 1894, ch. 113. It is. insisted that the law is in conflict with that part of the 15 th Article of the Bill of Rights, which declares \u201c that every person in the State or person holding property therein ought to contribute his proportion of public taxes for the support of the government, according to his actual worth in real or personal property.\u201d This Article of our Declaration of Rights has been so often and so recently considered by this Court, that the question here raised can hardly be considered at the present time, as <em>res nova. </em>There is but one construction in the whole line of these decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">While it is true that every person in the State, or person holding property therein should contribute his proportion of public taxes for the support of the government according to his actual worth in real or personal property, and that all taxes levied upon property should be equal and uniform according to its actual value, yet the framers of the Constitution also declared, that in addition to taxes on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>property other taxes might be levied \u201cfor the good government and benefit of the community.\u201d A license tax as laid or imposed here, is not a direct tax on property within the meaning of the first clause of the 15th Article of the Bill of Rights, but is a tax on the business or occupation of the trader or licensee, under the last clause of that Article. The power of a State, says the Supreme Court, to impose a tax, in the way of license upon pursuits and occupations within its limits, has never been seriously questioned. <em>License Tax Cases, </em>5 Wall. 472; <em>Welton </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>91 U. S. 278.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"A30X\">(Decided December 18th, 1894.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Without stopping, then, to review the many cases where this question has been passed upon, we content ourselves with a simple reference to some of them. These clearly show that the act in question is free from the constitutional objection urged against it. <em>State </em>v. <em>P. W. &amp; B. R. R. Co., </em>45 Md. 380; <em>State </em>v. <em>C. &amp; P. R. R. Co., </em>40 Md. <em>41; Tyson </em>v. <em>State, </em>28 Md. 585; <em>Corson </em>v. <em>State, </em>57 Md. 262; <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Com. of Hyattsville, </em>77 Md. 125; <em>Cooley on Taxation, </em>570; 1 <em>Testy on Taxation, </em>305; 2 <em>Desty on Taxation, </em>1385; <em>Cooley\u2019s Const. Lint. </em>616.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Being of opinion that the Act of 1894, ch. 113, is constitutional and valid, the order of the Court overruling demurrer and dismissing petition for <em>mandamus </em>will be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">\n<em>Order affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
