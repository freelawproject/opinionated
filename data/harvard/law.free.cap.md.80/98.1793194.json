The order of the Court is, \u201c that the judgment of condemnation in this case be and it is hereby stricken out, and the writ of attachment be and hereby is quashed, on the ground of the insufficiency of the voucher, provided the defendant enters his appearance to the short note case.\u201d The voucher, thus declared by the Court to be insufficient, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-10\">Philadelphia, Oct. 17th, 1892.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-11\">S.

It is impossible for the defendant to state, as his defence, what part of the plaintiffs claim is admitted and what denied, where no information as to the particulars of the indebtedness is given; and as it was the object of the Act of Assembly to narrow the questions in issue between the parties as much as could practicably be done, it seems clear upon principle, that such a statement as that filed by the appellee, is very far from being what the statute exacts.\u201d In <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Katz, </em>30 Md. 346, the account was declared sufficient because \u201c it was certain in its items and details,\u201d and \u201c is made out in the mode usually adopted by merchants engaged in extensive business, and is perfectly intelligible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">In <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Waters, </em>34 Md. 461, the account: \u201cTo cash loaned at sundry times on call,\u201d was held sufficient, because it gave the debtor the real nature and character of the claim. In that case, a distinction is made between \u201c an account for goods bargained and sold at sundry times,\u201d which would not be sufficient, and the one they then had under consideration. The former embraces elements of quantity and prices, and unless these were set out, no information as to the real nature of the claim could be given ; but the cas\u00e9 of \u201c cash loaned \u201d is more simple, and if the aggregate is stated, dates and quantities of the several sums loaned are not essential to make the matter perfectly intelligible. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>In <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Robins, </em>53 Md. 501, \u201ceach of the items is set forth, the building for which they were furnished is specifically referred to, and the time during which the appellee was employed in doing and in superintending the work is stated.\u201d</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AN7\">(Decided November 22d, 1894.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">From this brief review of the principal cases in Maryland on this subject, the rule to be applied here is, does the account filed in this case, furnish such certain information as to make' clear to the defendant what is the real nature and character of the claim <em>? </em>The item charged is \u201c cash.\u201d Now, if the account was for \u201ccash loaned,\u201d if would have been clear that the suit was to recover for money, which the plaintiff had loaned the defendant. But the claim as it stands means simply, that the defendant owes the plaintiff $1,978.50 (the dollar mark, when the whole account is examined, may be supplied) ; .but on what account, whether for goods sold or money loaned or otherwise, the account entirely fails to show. It therefore leaves the defendant entirely uninformed as to the \u201c teal nature and character \u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and is wholly insufficient to support the attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Other reasons for quashing the attachment were argued in the briefs of counsel; but, inasmuch as what we have said disposes of the case we will not consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
