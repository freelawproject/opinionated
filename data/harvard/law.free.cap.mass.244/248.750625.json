A verdict was ordered for the defendant on the ground that the automobile was not properly registered, and hence was an outlaw upon the highways of Massachusetts. <em>Gondek </em>v. <em>Cudahy Packing Co. </em>233 Mass. 105, 110, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">The statute G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 2, provides that application for the registration of motor vehicles may be made \u201cby the owner thereof;\u201d and that the application and the certificate of registration issued thereon shall contain, with other particulars, a statement of \u201cthe name, place of residence and address of the applicant.\u201d This automobile was registered for the year 1920 in the name of \u201cThe International Brotherhood of Steam Shovel and Dredge Men,\u201d as owner. Martin J. Hanley, the original plaintiff, was operating the machine at the time of the accident, and was the secretary, treasurer and business agent of \u201cLocal No. 60,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>an unincorporated voluntary association. The automobile was bought for his use, and \u201cwas owned by the members of the Brotherhood in common.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\">If \u201cThe International Brotherhood of Steam Shovel and Dredge Men\u201d in whose name the car was registered was a national or international body, of which Local No. 60 was a mere branch, manifestly the registration was not in the name of the \u201c owner.\u201d If, as probably was the fact, the registration name was intended to designate Local No. 60, the difficulty is that there is no such legal entity. This \"local\u201d is merely a voluntary association of some three hundred members, and has no separate existence in law \u2014 unlike a corporation which is a legal person quite apart from its stockholders. At the time of the attempted registration the legal title to the automobile was in those who were then members of Local No. 60. Under the most liberal extension of the word, Hanley was not the \u201cowner,\u201d and could not recover for damage to the automobile. See <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Sinman, </em>241 Mass. 462. The reverse of this situation appears in the recent case of <em>Maguire </em>v. <em>Reough, </em>238 Mass. 98, where the widow of a member of a local union sought to recover a death benefit. The defence was successfully set up that all the members of the union, being copartners, must be joined as defendants. And see <em>Pickett </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>192 Mass. 572, 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The amendment, allowed after the verdict for the defendant had been ordered, whereby all the members of Local No. 60 on the day of the accident were made plaintiffs, is of no avail. The machine was not in fact registered in their names. Even if the registration should be considered as embracing the then members of Local No. 60 (see <em>United Mine Workers of America </em>v. <em>Coronado Coal Co. </em>259 U. S. 344) there would be an equally conclusive defence. It is in evidence that between January, 1920, when the car was registered, and May 12,1920, the date of the accident, there had been thirty or forty changes in the membership of Local No. 60. Said \u00a7 2 of the statute expressly provides: \u201cUpon the transfer of ownership of any motor vehicle or trailer its registration shall expire. . . .\u201d In <em>Rolli </em>v. <em>Converse, </em>227 Mass. 162, where a motor truck was registered in the name of two partners, and subsequently one of them retired and transferred his interest in the partnership, including the motor truck, to a new partner, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>-was held that the car, when operated upon a highway without a new registration was a trespasser. The principle applied in that \u2022case would prevent recovery by the new plaintiffs here, even if the car had been registered in the names of those who were members of Local No. 60 on January 1, 1920; because there were changes in the ownership of the car between that time and the day of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">In the opinion of a majority of the court, judgment must be entered for the defendant on the verdict, in accordance with the ieport.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
