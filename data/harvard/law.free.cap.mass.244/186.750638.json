The plaintiff in his letter of January 20, recalls the fact that unless he could make $7,000 \u201cthis year,\u201d it would not be worth his while to move from Atlanta, Georgia, to Boston, and the defendant speaks of the territory to which the plaintiff was to be assigned for \u201cthis year.\u201d There was evidence of a contract for a year\u2019s employment, as shown by the correspondence, and the judge could not rule as requested by the defendant. Judgment is to be entered on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
