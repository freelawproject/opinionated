S. Documentary Stamps.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-10\">David H. Goodman</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">It is contended that the defendant indorsed for the accommodation of the plaintiff, and is liable only to holders in due course subsequent to the payee. G. L. c. 107, \u00a7 87, cl. 3. See <em>Quimby </em>v. <em>Varnum, </em>190 Mass. 211. The genuineness of the defendant\u2019s signature was not denied, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 29, and the plaintiff gave the only evidence at the trial, on which the jury would have been warranted in finding, that the maker Bean signed the note and handed it to the plaintiff, who then saw the defendant at his place of business and asked him to indorse it. The plaintiff also stated, \u201cIn fact, I asked him a couple of days previous if he will indorse a note for Bennie Bean, so he said he would, so I brought it up to him and he indorsed it without asking me any questions.\u201d The circumstances under which the indorsement was made could be shown to determine whether the defendant \u25a0 was an accommodation party, and if so whether he accommodated Bean or the plaintiff. <em>Haddock, Blanchard &amp; Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Haddock, </em>192 N. Y. 499. G. L. c. 107, \u00a7 52. But it does not appear that Bean had solicited the defendant\u2019s indorsement, or had requested, or authorized the plaintiff to obtain it, or that it was understood between the maker and payee that the note although given for value by Bean was not to become a completed instrument until the defendant\u2019s signature had been affixed. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Cushing, </em>162 Mass. 594. See <em>Spaulding </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>128 Mass. 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">The signing and delivery of the note made the plaintiff the holder, who could pass title. \u201cA negotiable instrument payable to a named payee is negotiated when the physical possession of it is handed for value to the person named as payee.\u201d G. L. c. 107, \u00a7 18. <em>Liberty Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Tilton, </em>217 Mass. 462, 465. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>It is plain on the record that the defendant signed for the accommodation of the plaintiff, and the party for whose accommodation a note is given cannot enforce it against the accommodator. It is a mere gratuity. G. L. c. 107, \u00a7\u00a7 86, 87, cl. 3. <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Bickford, </em>201 Mass. 543. <em>Neal </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>213 Mass. 336, 338. <em>Conners Brothers Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>220 Mass. 600, 605. The fact that the indorsement was made after the note had been negotiated does not aid the plaintiff who as between himself and the defendant is not a subsequent holder in due course under G. L. c. 107, \u00a7\u00a7 38, 52. <em>Liberty Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Tilton, </em>217 Mass. 462. See <em>Rodocanachi </em>v. <em>Buttrick, </em>125 Mass. 134, 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\">The plaintiff asks to be allowed to amend and to proceed on the defendant\u2019s indorsement as a written guaranty. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 125. But the note fails to show any contract of guaranty. \u201cA person placing his signature upon an instrument otherwise than as maker, drawer or acceptor is deemed to be an endorser, unless he clearly indicates by appropriate words his intention to be bound in some other capacity.\u201d G. L. c. 107, \u00a7 86. <em>Fourth National Bank of Boston </em>v. <em>Mead, </em>216 Mass. 521. <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Sturtevant, </em>235 Mass. 249. And there are no circumstances on which it could be found that the defendant actually undertook to guarantee the payment of the note as in <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Calkin, </em>139 Mass. 529, and <em>Equitable Marine Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>173 Mass. 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
