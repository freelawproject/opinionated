T. Grant Co. </em>233 Mass. 140, wrote the shippers a letter, the material part of which is as follows: \"Under date of May 4th, you shipped 11 boxes of macaroni consigned to S. Trini, this city. These goods are on hand at our pier unclaimed by consignees, and we also understand that consignees have filed a petition in Bankruptcy. Please advise us as to what disposition you wish made of these goods.\u201d The plaintiff testified that about two weeks later the agent of the shippers showed him the letter, and it was conceded that the plaintiff had not filed a petition in bankruptcy although another grocer next door to the plaintiff\u2019s place of business had \u201cclosed up within a few days of\u201d the date of the letter. The jury could find that because of the letter the order for the macaroni was cancelled and other dealers with whom he had executory contracts for supplies declined to fill the orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">It is contended by the plaintiff that the letter was a libel, and that its publication under the circumstances entitled him to damages. But the letter was written and mailed in the ordinary course of the defendant\u2019s business to ascertain what it should do with the shipment in which the shipper and seller had a direct interest. It has often been decided that under such conditions a plaintiff, on whom the burden of proof rests, cannot recover without proof of actual malice, of which no evidence is found in the present record. <em>Joannes </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>5 Allen, 169. <em>Brow </em>v. <em>Hathaway, </em>13 Allen, 239. <em>Sweet </em>v. <em>Post Publishing Co. </em>215 Mass. 450. <em>Doone </em>v. <em>Grew, </em>220 Mass. 171,182. <em>Childs </em>v. <em>Erhard, </em>226 Mass. 454.

But there is no evidence that the defendant knew of their existence, and that with such knowledge it intentionally and malevolently persuaded the dealers and sellers to refuse performance. <em>May </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>172 Mass. 11. <em>McGurk </em>v. <em>Cronenwett, </em>199 Mass. 457, 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The exceptions to the rulings on evidence have not been argued, and, a verdict for the defendant having been directed rightly, judgment thereon is to be entered in accordance with the terms of the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
