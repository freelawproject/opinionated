The mats are provided with openings, for. the controlling levers of the automobile, with conical extensions or sleeves around them seemed by metal fasteners; the mats are made of rubberized cloth. The plaintiffs adopted the name \u201c Air Break\u201d and on January 8, 1916, filed this trademark under R. L. c. 72, \u00a7 7 (G. L. c. 110, \u00a7 8), and since then have used this trademark in the manufacture and sale of their mats. The mats were offered for sale in boxes \u201ctwelve inches by six inches by one and one half inches in depth\u201d on which were printed or pasted' the words \u201cAir Break for Fords,\u201d and a label containing the words \u201cAir Break for Fords\u201d was attached to each mat. The plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>also advertised the mats by display cards, indicating the floor of a Ford car, showing the mat and its connections with the levers.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-3\">In October, 1921, the defendants began to manufacture and sell to dealers in automobile supplies mats called \u201cThe Practo Wind Break for Fords.\u201d It was not disputed that mats designed for Ford cars to prevent air coming through the openings in the floor are manufactured and sold by many makers and dealers. The defendants\u2019 mat was made of leatherette cloth; its sleeve was tubular in form, and held in place by rubber bands. This mat was offered for sale in a large flat envelope, eleven inches long, seven and one half inches wide, and the words \u201cThe Practo Wind Break for Fords\u201d appeared in large type at the top of the envelope; below these words appeared a picture of a Ford car with the word \u201cFord\u201d on it. When the defendants saw the picture shown by the plaintiffs, they at once changed their picture to avoid similarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">The plaintiffs seek to restrain the defendants from selling their mats for use on Ford automobiles, in packages upon which the words \u201cWind Break\u201d \u201cWind Break for Fords\u201d appear. In the Superior Court the judge found that the plaintiffs\u2019 mat was lighter in color than the defendants\u2019; that its fasteners were of metal and those of the defendants\u2019 were of rubber; that it differed from the defendants\u2019 in every essential; that the plaintiffs\u2019 mat was packed and offered for sale in a box, and the defendants\u2019 was packed and sold in an envelope; that the plaintiffs\u2019 box was distinctly marked \u201cAir Break for Fords,\u201d and the defendants\u2019 package was plainly marked \"The Practo Wind Break for Fords,\u201d the letters on the latter being much larger than those on the plaintiffs\u2019 box; that the dissimilarity between the plaintiffs\u2019 and the defendants\u2019 mat,' and the box and the envelope in which each was sold, was so marked that no reasonably careful buyer could be deceived. It was further found that customers of the plaintiffs were not deceived into buying the defendants\u2019 mat supposing it was the plaintiffs\u2019; that the name adopted by the defendants was not likely to mislead \u201cthe dealers with whom both parties exclusively deal\u201d and that they were not in fact misled or confused. It appeared that the plaintiffs disclaimed the exclusive right to manufacture mats designed to prevent air from coming through the floor of an automobile. No objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>tian was made to the shape of the defendants\u2019 mat and no question of fraud was involved. A decree was entered dismissing the bill, and the plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\">An examination of the record discloses no reason for disturbing the findings of the- trial judge; <em>George W. Gale Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>227 Mass. 203, 206; <em>Hub Dress Manuf. Co. </em>v. <em>Rottenberg, </em>237 Mass. 281; he has found that the name adopted by the defendants is not likely to mislead or confuse the plaintiffs\u2019 customers, and that there was no evidence to show they were misled or confused by the use of the name \u201cThe Practo Wind Break for Fords;\u201d and that they \u201cwere not deceived into buying the defendants\u2019 mat instead of the plaintiffs\u2019;\u201d that the words \u201cThe Practo Wind Break for Fords\u201d on the defendants\u2019 envelope were printed in much larger letters than the words \u201cAir Break for Fords\u201d on the plaintiffs\u2019 box; and that the defendants\u2019 mat was so packed and stamped that no reasonably careful buyer could be deceived; that there was no fraudulent intent to deceive, and no liability to deception arising from the similarity between the name used by the plaintiffs and that adopted by the defendants; and that customers were not misled. These findings of the judge are supported by the evidence, and on them the plaintiffs are not entitled to the injunction prayed for. <em>Hub Dress Manuf. Co. </em>v. <em>Rottenberg, supra. Libby, McNeill &amp; Libby </em>v. <em>Libby, </em>241 Mass. 239. As was said in <em>Howe Scale Co. </em>v. <em>Wyckoff, Seamans &amp; Benedict, </em>198 U. S. 118, at page 140: \u201c'A court of equity will not interfere when ordinary attention by the purchaser of the article would enable him at once to discriminate the one from, the other.\u2019 . . . 'Even in the case of a valid trademark, the similarity of brands must be such as to mislead the ordinary observer.\u2019 \u201d <em>International Trust Co. </em>v. <em>International Loan &amp; Trust Co. </em>153 Mass. 271, 277. <em>C. A. Briggs Co. </em>v. <em>National Wafer Co. </em>215 Mass. 100. There was no actual deception of the public to the plaintiffs\u2019 harm and such deception was not probable. There was no unfair trade competition by the defendants or interference with the plaintiffs\u2019 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><em>Lawrence Manuf. Co. </em>v. <em>Lowell Hosiery Mills, </em>129 Mass. 325, <em>Viano </em>v. <em>Baccigalupo, </em>183 Mass. 160, and <em>Regis </em>v. <em>H. A. Jaynes &amp; Co. </em>185 Mass. 458, relied on by the plaintiffs, are not in conflict with what is here decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\n<em>Decree dismissing the bill affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
