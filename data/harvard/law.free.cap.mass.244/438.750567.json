The defendant at the close of the evidence moved for a directed verdict. The motion was denied and the jury having found for the plaintiff the case is before us on exceptions to the ruling. The law is well settled that \u201cAny general restraint is sufficient to constitute an imprisonment; and though this be effected without actual contact of the person, it will be presumptively actionable,\u201d and \u201cAny demonstration of physical power which, to all appearances, can be avoided only by submission, operates as effectually to constitute an imprisonment, if submitted to, as if any amount of force had been exercised.\u201d \u201c If a man is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>restrained of his personal liberty by fear of a personal difficulty, that amounts to a false imprisonment\u201d within the legal meaning of such term. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nickerson, </em>5 Allen, 518, 525, 526. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Ashcraft, </em>98 Ky. 314, 318. <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Maine Central Railroad, </em>92 Maine, 399. <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>De Armit, </em>99 Penn.

The question for decision accordingly is whether as matter of law there was any evidence which warranted the verdict. It may be assumed, indeed it is not denied, that the plaintiff knew that she must pay for her luncheon before leaving the restaurant, and the defendant undoubtedly had the right if apparently she had not paid to detain her for a reasonable time to investigate the circumstances. But if she was detained for an unreasonable time or in an unreasonable way she is entitled to recover. <em>Standish </em>v. <em>Narragansett Steamship Co. </em>111 Mass. 512, 517, 518. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Balmain New Ferry Co. Ltd. </em>[1910] A. C. 295. The jury on the plaintiff\u2019s testimony could properly find that accompanied by her aunt she entered the defendant\u2019s restaurant between four and six o\u2019clock in the afternoon for the purpose of being served with food although the aunt \u201cdid not wish for anything to eat.\u201d The \u201crestaurant was very crowded,\u201d and they went \u201cup one flight of stairs to the ladies\u2019 waiting room, on the balcony.\u201d The plaintiff went downstairs and sat at a table where she was served and the waiter presented her with a check the amount of which was small. Upon receiving the check she returned to her aunt and taking her by the arm they passed to the front of the restaurant to the cashier\u2019s desk where she stopped and paid her check and with her aunt started toward the door. It is evident that having made payment of the defendant\u2019s demand she had the unqualified right to leave the premises without any restraint being imposed on her freedom of departure. But after the payment, and while proceeding toward the door, \u201ctheir attention was attracted by the ringing of a bell, . . . and the cashier motioned for the plaintiff to come back,\u201d and the plaintiff and her aunt returned to the desk when the cashier asked the plaintiff \u201cif her aunt was with her and she answered 'Yes.\u2019 \u201d The cashier said, \u201cWhy has she no check, your check just pays for one.\u201d The plaintiff replied, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>have any check because she did n\u2019t eat,\u201d and they again \u201cstarted to go out.\u201d \u201cThe cashier said 'Wait,\u2019\u201d and called the headwaiter who appeared, and asked \u201cthe plaintiff what the matter was,\u201d and upon being informed by the plaintiff of the situation substantially as described to the cashier, the headwaiter said \u201c Come with me.\u201d The plaintiff, her aunt and the headwaiter thereupon went to the rear of the restaurant where the plaintiff was asked if \u201cshe could recognize the person who waited on her,\u201d and she said she thought she could. When the waiter appeared and was identified by the plaintiff the headwaiter asked, \u201cWhat did she have to eat, and was she alone?\u201d The reply was, \u201cYes, I remember she was all alone,\u201d and enumerated \"what the plaintiff had to eat.\u201d But upon referring to the check which the waitress had, he said \"... that is not my check.\u201d In reply to the question asked by the waitress \u201cWhere did you get this check?\u201d the plaintiff answered, \u201cWhy it is the only check I have, the check they gave me when I got through eating.\u201d To the further statement by the waitress, \u201cBut it is not his (the waiter\u2019s) check, it is a different number . . . How do you account for that?\u201d the reply was, \u201cI don\u2019t attempt to account for it, all I know is he, the waiter, says I ate twenty or thirty cents\u2019 worth, that is the only check I saw and I went out and paid for it.\u201d A further conversation of a few minutes followed when the waitress said \u201cCbme with me,\u201d and \"they went to the front part of the restaurant near the cashier\u2019s desk,\u201d and the waitress told the plaintiff '\"Wait here.\u2019 I stood there and she called a man,\u201d who could be found to have been the defendant\u2019s \u201cmanager.\u201d While the plaintiff was explaining the circumstances to the manager \u201cthe cashier . . . came over with another check and said, 'I think I must have mixed the checks up, I think this is the correct check.\u2019 \u201d The manager took the check, looked at it, and said to the plaintiff \"You may go now,\u201d and the plaintiff after a delay of twenty-five or thirty minutes from the time when the check was paid left the restaurant. The jury if they so determined further could find that beginning with the ringing of the bell to the time when the manager said, \"You may go now\u201d the plaintiff was under investigation to ascertain whether she was evading payment, and if no payment had been made, she would not be permitted to depart until a settlement had been effected. It is obvious that no criminal offence had been committed, and \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>right appertaining to private individuals to arrest without a warrant, ... is confined to cases of the actual guilt of the party-arrested; and the arrest can only be justified by proving such guilt.\u201d <em>Rohan </em>v. <em>Sawin, </em>5 Cush. 281, 285. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>209 Mass. 396, 404. The defendant must be held to have intended the result of the acts of its servants. <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Jacot, </em>235 Mass. 521. \u201cWhen one has done an act unaccompanied by circumstances which justify its commission, it is a principle of law that he intended to produce the consequences which have ensued.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nickerson, </em>5 Allen, 518, 527. It is argued that there was no interference with her \u201cfreedom of locomotion,\u201d that the detention was lawful, and she voluntarily remained. But her honesty and veracity had been openly and repeatedly challenged. If she had gone out before exoneration, her departure well might have been interpreted by the lookers on as an admission of guilt, \u25a0or of circumstances from which guilt might be inferred. The \u25a0situation was in the control of the defendant. The restraint or \u25a0duress imposed by the mode of investigation, which has been described at length, the jury could say was for the accomplishment of the-defendant\u2019s purpose, even if no threats of public exposure or of arrest were made, and no physical restraint of her person was attempted. <em>Silsbee </em>v. <em>Webber, </em>171 Mass. 378. <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Thissell, </em>240 Mass. 541. It therefore was a question of fact whether the plaintiff\u2019s detention, caused solely by the inattention and carelessness of the cashier, was under all the circumstances unreasonable, or for an unreasonable time. <em>Standish </em>v. <em>Narragansett Steamship Co. </em>111 Mass. 512. The motion was denied rightly, and the case having been submitted to the jury under full and clear instructions to which the defendant did not except, the entry must be exceptions overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
