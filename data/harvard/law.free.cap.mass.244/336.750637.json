The elevators shall carry weight of twenty-nine hundred fifty . . . pounds and to be 6 x 9 feet in size, and shall be run by electricity. Sufficient radiation, so as to furnish at least 60 degrees of heat in zero weather, to be installed on all floors\u201d while in the attic two new windows were to be put in and \"the old ones to be repaired. All ceilings to be painted white.\u201d The master states that \u201cin fact most of the alterations would be indispensable to the full enjoyment of these premises\u201d by the lessee. The defendant, while admitting the agreement, avers that its requirements have been waived. But the question of waiver is one of fact, and the master\u2019s finding that waiver had not been established is final. The defendant provided the elevators, the electric wiring, and heating apparatus, but she has not supplied the windows on the third and fourth floors,'nor painted some of the ceilings, nor removed the partition on the second floor. The term is for five years beginning August 1, 1920, with an option of renewal for a further period of five years at a \u201cyearly rental of three thousand dollars,\u201d and the lessee duly entered and has remained in possession. The lessor, however, has not fully performed his covenant, as some of the alterations have not been made. The suit is for specific performance. But, if specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>performance is denied, the bill can be retained for the assessment of money damages, as in the case at bar. <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Bridges, </em>216 Mass. 416, 421. <em>Wentworth </em>v. <em>Manhattan Market Co. </em>218 Mass. 91. The master found on conflicting evidence that the fair cost of making the omitted alterations \u201cwould be $750,\u201d and this amount was awarded the plaintiff. The intention of the parties is to be gathered from the instrument and not from a single clause. \u201cThe grant of anything carries an implication, that the grantee shall have all that is necessary to the enjoyment of the grant, so far as the grantor has power to give it.\u201d <em>Salisbury </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>19 Pick. 250, 255. <em>Cumings </em>v. <em>Hackett, </em>98 Mass. 51. <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Appleton, </em>161 Mass. 313, 315. The premises for which the rent stipulated was to be paid'were the premises described in the granting clause, including the alterations and additions as if they had been specifically named. <em>Lipsky </em>v. <em>Heller, </em>199 Mass. 310. The lessee was under no duty to supply the changes the lessor had omitted. It could however have done so and recovered the actual expense. It also could remain inactive and bring an action for damages. <em>Winne </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>34 Iowa, 339, 341. <em>Biggs </em>v. <em>McCurley, </em>76 Md. 409, 414. <em>Bostwick </em>v. <em>Losey, </em>67 Mich. 554. <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>35 N. Y. 269. <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Nolde, </em>176 Penn. St. 594, 602. See <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Janvrin, </em>200 Mass. 514, 516. But the measure of recovery for the defendant\u2019s breach is not the amount the lessee would have to expend as found by the master and decreed by the court. It is the difference between the rent reserved and the actual value of the term. <em>Neal </em>v. <em>Jefferson, </em>212 Mass. 517, 522. <em>Arafe </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>228 Mass. 46, 52. <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>35 N. Y. 269. Thom<em>son-Houston Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Durant Land Improvement Co. </em>144 N. Y. 34, 47. <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Nolde, </em>176 Penn. St. 594, 602. The decree dismissing the original bill is affirmed, but the decree on the cross bill is reversed and the case is to stand for further proceedings in the trial court not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
