He returned to work on October 20, 1921, and continued until December 31, 1921. He died on January 6, 1922, of facial erysipelas and chronic myocarditis. It is not here contended that the employee was not entitled to compensation under the act for the injury of September 30, 1921. The single member and the Industrial Accident Board on review have found that there was no causal connection between the injury and the death. This was a pure question of fact. It is manifest from the report of the evidence that a finding of such causal connection was not required. There was ample evidence to support the finding made. It cannot be reviewed. It must stand as final under the authority of numerous decisions. <em>Pigeon\u2019s Case, </em>216 Mass. 51. <em>Pass\u2019s Case, </em>232 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>515, and cases there collected. <em>Chisholm\u2019s Case, </em>238 Mass. 412, 419.
