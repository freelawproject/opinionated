In this appeal, Luciano Montalvo contends the trial judge abused his discretion when he refused to invoke the first offender drug statute after Montalvo pled guilty to possession of cocaine. We find that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion; therefore, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">On appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975). So viewed, the record established that Montalvo was arrested and charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>with possessing cocaine after an officer recovered the cocaine while investigating a domestic complaint at Montalvo\u2019s residence. At trial, after pleading guilty to possession of cocaine, Montalvo requested that the judge defer finding him guilty and grant him first offender status under Code \u00a7 18.2-251. In support of his motion, Montalvo tendered a copy of his criminal record, which verified that he had no prior drug-related convictions. The arresting officer testified that Montalvo admitted \u201cthat he had a bad drug problem and that he was going to the VA hospital in an attempt to try to help himself out.\u201d The trial judge ordered a presentence report and deferred sentencing pending his review of the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The presentence report showed that Montalvo had two prior assault and battery convictions and numerous driving infractions, including three for reckless driving. The report also revealed charged offenses in New York for robbery with physical injury and assault with intent to cause serious injury, the dispositions of which were \u201cUnknown.\u201d The probation officer\u2019s report stated that it would be difficult to supervise Montalvo on probation because he was \u201cliving at different places and not living at home.\u201d It showed that Montalvo was 100% disabled because he suffered from post-traumatic stress syndrome, depression, and HIV infection. The probation officer also noted in his report that Montalvo\u2019s drug use was \u201capparent.\u201d The probation officer further reported that Montalvo was reluctant to sign the medical release forms that were required of him in order to obtain his medical records from the VA hospital. Because of Montalvo\u2019s delay and reluctance to sign the release, the officer had not obtained the records at the time of the sentencing hearing. At the hearing, when Montalvo was asked about his delay in signing the release, he stated that he was \u201ctold it doesn\u2019t make any sense to sign it\u201d and that he eventually signed the release after he checked with the VA hospital and was told to sign the forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The trial judge denied Montalvo\u2019s request to defer his sentence and to grant him first offender status. The judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>The point is [that] the Court\u2019s confronted with this man being difficult when he is being given an opportunity to have first-offender status. That\u2019s inexcusable so far as the Court is concerned.... It wouldn\u2019t have been the VA that gave the difficulty, it was the defendant. The Court\u2019s not inclined to give first-offender status under these circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The trial judge found Montalvo guilty, sentenced him to five years in the penitentiary, and suspended that sentence for a period of ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Montalvo asserts that the evidence does not support the judge\u2019s finding that he was uncooperative in providing the medical release. Accordingly, Montalvo argues the judge abused his discretion by denying him first offender status because the trial judge based his decision upon a finding the record does not support.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">A trial court has broad discretion under Code \u00a7 19.2-203 in deciding whether to suspend all or any portion of a penitentiary sentence and to grant probation. <em>See Hamilton v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 325, 327, 228 S.E.2d 555, 556 (1976); <em>Slayton v. Commonwealth, </em>185 Va. 357, 365, 38 S.E.2d 479, 483 (1946); <em>Bell v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 146, 148, 442 S.E.2d 427, 428 (1994). Similarly, the court has broad discretion under Code \u00a7 18.2-251 in deciding whether to defer a finding of guilt and to grant first offender status to a first-time drug offender. We will reverse a trial judge\u2019s decision to deny first offender status only where the trial judge has made an arbitrary decision and abused his discretion by failing to exercise a conscientious judgment in rendering the decision. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Here, the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that Montalvo was unwilling to cooperate with the probation officer by being reluctant to sign the medical release forms. Montalvo stated that he had been told \u201cit doesn\u2019t make any sense to sign it [the release].\u201d Although Montalvo explained why he delayed but eventually signed the medical release, the trial judge, who had the opportunity to hear Montalvo and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>observe his demeanor, did not err in finding that he was uncooperative. Furthermore, from the information contained in the presentence report, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in finding that Montalvo would not be a good candidate for first offender status.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">A first-time drug offender is not entitled as a matter of right to receive a suspended sentence, probation, or treatment under Code \u00a7 18.2-251. As alternatives to confinement and incarceration, the statute\u2019s benefits are reserved for those first-time drug offenders who demonstrate a likelihood of being able to adhere to the terms and conditions of probation. Here, Montalvo had pled guilty to possession of cocaine and, although it was his first drug offense, he admitted he had used drugs on other occasions and had a drug problem for which he was being treated at the VA hospital. Moreover, the fact that Montalvo was a drug user was apparent to the probation officer. Although a first-time offender who has' a history of drug use may still be considered for first offender status, when considered with the fact that Montalvo did not have a regular address, had a prior criminal record of two assault convictions and numerous traffic related offenses, was suffering from depression and post-traumatic stress syndrome and that he had demonstrated an uncooperative attitude by being reluctant to provide the medical release forms that would have enabled the court to obtain information about his drug use and treatment, we cannot say the trial judge abused his discretion by denying Montalvo first offender status under Code \u00a7 18.2-251.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Accordingly, we uphold the ruling of the trial court and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b141-8\">BENTON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aqs\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">Stating that Montalvo \u201cmade it very difficult\u201d for the probation officer to obtain Montalvo\u2019s medical records from the Veterans\u2019 Administration', the trial judge refused to grant Montalvo first offender status under Code \u00a7 18.2-251. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>record does not support that finding. Therefore, I would hold that the trial judge abused his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">At trial, both the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney and Montalvo represented to the judge that Montalvo was eligible for first offender status pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-251 and that his criminal record was not disqualifying. At the sentencing hearing, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">THE COURT: This case was tried in December. To date the probation officer tells me he has not been able to get the necessary signatures from the defendant to get medical records that are required in order to go forward with first-offender status. Still has not had it since December. We\u2019ve continued it once before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I think [the probation officer] has gotten the signatures at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">THE COURT: Told me a few minutes ago he did not have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_G\">[PROBATION OFFICER]: I got the signature on the first release eventually, Judge, and then the second release that was sent to me\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\">THE COURT: The point is, the Court\u2019s confronted with this man being difficult when he is being given an opportunity to have first-offender status. That\u2019s inexcusable so far as the Court is concerned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, sir. I believe at first he did have a problem with medical records, and after talking to him he did give a release to [the probation officer]. That\u2019s my understanding. It\u2019s difficult to get records from the Veteran\u2019s Administration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">This record clearly establishes that, based on an off-the-record conversation with the probation officer, the trial judge concluded that Montalvo had not signed the second release that the Veterans\u2019 Administration required. No evidence proved that Montalvo or his counsel were present when that off-the-record discussion occurred. Montalvo\u2019s counsel made an unrefuted avowal on the record that Montalvo had signed the second release and had given it to the probation officer. Indeed, when the probation officer began to explain the events <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>after he received the second release, the trial judge spontaneously ruled that Montalvo was \u201cbeing difficult\u201d before the probation officer could complete his explanation. This is the sole basis upon which the trial judge refused to consider Montalvo for first offender status under Code \u00a7 18.2-251.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Although the majority concludes, based on its own examination of Montalvo\u2019s history, that Montalvo was not a \u201cgood candidate\u201d for first offender status, the trial judge\u2019s decision was grounded only in the judge\u2019s perception that Montalvo was uncooperative with the probation officer. We are not at liberty to conclude that the trial judge <em>might </em>have discovered some reason other than the stated reason. The trial judge\u2019s stated reason was based on an erroneous assumption. Therefore, I would reverse the judgment and remand to the trial judge for reconsideration of the sentence and Montalvo\u2019s eligibility for first offender status as provided by Code \u00a7 18.2-251.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
