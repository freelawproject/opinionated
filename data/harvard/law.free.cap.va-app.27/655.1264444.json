On appeal, he contends the trial court erroneously (1) qualified a witness with no expertise in population genetics to testify as a DNA expert, (2) admitted DNA evidence for which proof of the chain of custody was lacking, (3) failed to appoint a DNA expert to help him prepare his defense, resulting in a fundamentally unfair trial, (4) denied his motion to reconsider based on a certificate of analysis allegedly showing the presence of DNA from a third person on the victim\u2019s body, and (5) found the evidence sufficient to prove penetration. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">At about 4:30 a.m. on September 28, 1996, Deputy Dennis Dowling responded to a specified address in Gloucester County to investigate a domestic disturbance. When he arrived, he found appellant and appellant\u2019s girlfriend, Mary, arguing in the front yard. Mary\u2019s eleven-year-old sister (victim) and their mother came out of the house. \u201c[Victim\u2019s] clothes were very disheveled, her pants were hanging down, and ... [she was] screaming that [appellant] had raped her.... She was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>clinging to- her mother, extremely shaken, hysterically crying, barely coherent, but she kept screaming over and over that [appellant] had done this to her.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Deputy Dowling told appellant he was under arrest; appellant fled on foot, but Dowling wrestled him to the ground and sprayed him with \u201cCap stun,\u201d a mucous membrane irritant, to subdue him.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Appellant was taken to the police station, where he waived his constitutional rights and agreed to make a statement. When asked if he raped victim, he said he did not rape anyone. When asked whether he had intercourse with victim, appellant replied, \u201cShe\u2019s eleven years old. I\u2019m not saying anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Victim was taken to the hospital, where Dr. Villamer Parilla used a physical evidence recovery kit (PERK) to collect samples from inside and outside victim\u2019s vagina. The swabs provided for this purpose were sealed in separate, properly-labeled envelopes provided with the PERK, initialled, sealed in a box, and given to Investigator Randy Oakley at the hospital. Blood, hair and saliva samples taken from appellant in Oakley\u2019s presence were sealed, initialled, and given to Oakley. Oakley placed the sealed evidence kits in the unlocked refrigerator in the department\u2019s crime lab and sealed the refrigerator \u201cin evidence tape with [his] initials to make sure that no one else went into the refrigerator.\u201d Oakley retrieved the kits on October 3, 1996. Although several other people had access to the crime lab, Oakley could observe from the individual packages that their contents had not been tampered with during the time they were in the refrigerator.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Jeffrey Ban, the section chief in charge of DNA testing at the state\u2019s Division of Forensic Science laboratory, performed RFLP DNA analysis of the \u201cvaginal/cervical\u201d swabs taken from victim and the blood taken from appellant. Ban qualified as an expert without objection from appellant. Ban explained the process of collecting and analyzing evidence and concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>that appellant could not be eliminated as the contributor of the seminal fluid found in victim\u2019s vagina. He testified that appellant\u2019s DNA profile was \u201cextremely rare\u201d and that only one or two other people in the United States would have it, providing a likelihood of less than one in 100 million that a Caucasian male other than appellant could have contributed the seminal fluid. The certificate of analysis Ban prepared was admitted into evidence without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">On cross-examination, Ban said he assumed the swabs he tested came from inside victim\u2019s vagina \u201c[bjecause the swab that I actually received ... was marked on the envelope [in which my laboratory associate Barbara] Llewellyn repackaged the evidence and sent it to me as a vaginal/cervical swab.\u201d Llewellyn had previously opened the envelope to perform a PCR DNA test. Ban testified that the PCR test is used as a screening test and when, as here, it does not eliminate a defendant, it is followed by the more discriminating RFLP DNA test. Llewellyn\u2019s certificate of analysis was not admitted into evidence, but Ban testified that it confirmed the presence of spermatozoa on victim\u2019s thighs and external genitalia, as well as in her vaginal/cervical smears. Ban analyzed only the vaginal/cervical swabs.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Victim testified at trial but refused to give any testimony against appellant. She testified that appellant was living with victim\u2019s adult sister, Mary, who, according to appellant\u2019s attorney, was carrying appellant\u2019s baby at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Appellant moved to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. He argued that proof of sperm in victim\u2019s vagina without other evidence of penetration was insufficient to prove rape because \u201cthere can be an ejaculation externally with sperm entering the vagina.\u201d The trial court denied the motion and convicted appellant of rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">After sentencing, appellant filed a motion to reconsider based on a certificate of analysis of the initial DNA test, a PCR test, not introduced by the Commonwealth at trial. He contended the initial DNA test, performed by forensic scientist Barbara Llewellyn, had concluded that \u201cthe DNA profile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>obtained from the non-sperm fraction of the pubic area swabs of the victim (Item 2) was consistent with a mixture of the DNA profiles of [appellant, victim], <em>and a third individual.\u201d </em>Appellant conceded that the certificate of analysis containing these results had been introduced into evidence at the preliminary hearing. At trial, appellant\u2019s counsel used a portion of Llewellyn\u2019s PCR DNA test results while cross-examining DNA expert Ban, but did not question Ban regarding the portion of the certificate showing the possible presence of bodily fluids from a third person. The PCR certificate was never offered into evidence at trial. The trial court denied the motion, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">\n<em>Procedural Bar</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Rule 5A:18 provides that \u201c[n]o ruling of the trial court ... will be considered as a basis for reversal unless the objection was stated together with the grounds therefor at the time of the ruling, except for good cause shown or to enable the Court of Appeals to attain the ends of justice.\u201d Rule 5A:18 applies to bar even constitutional claims. <em>See Deal v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 157, 161, 421 S.E.2d 897, 900 (1992).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-7\">The main purpose of requiring timely specific objections is to afford the trial court an opportunity to rule intelligently on the issues presented, thus avoiding unnecessary appeals and reversals. In addition, a specific, contemporaneous objection gives the opposing party the opportunity to meet the objection at that stage of the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-8\"><em>Weidman v. Babcock, </em>241 Va. 40, 44, 400 S.E.2d 164, 167 (1991) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">\u201c[T]he ends of justice exception is narrow and is to be used sparingly....\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 126, 132, 380 S.E.2d 8, 11 (1989). \u201cIn order to avail oneself of the exception, a defendant must affirmatively show that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, not that a miscarriage <em>might </em>have occurred.\u201d <em>Redman v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 215, 221, 487 S.E.2d 269, 272 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Appellant concedes that his trial counsel failed (1) to object to the trial court\u2019s qualifying Ban as an expert witness on DNA, (2) to object to the admission of the DNA test results into evidence, and (3) to request the appointment of a DNA expert to assist in the preparation of his defense. He contends, however, that the ends of justice exception should be applied to permit our consideration of these issues. We disagree. The record does not show affirmatively that a miscarriage of justice occurred and, therefore, provides insufficient grounds for invocation of the ends of justice exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">\n<em>Motion to Reconsider</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">We also conclude that the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to reconsider. That motion was based on the claim that the PCR DNA test result \u201cobtained from the non-sperm fraction of the pubic area swabs of the victim (Item 2) was consistent with a mixture of the DNA profiles of [appellant, victim], <em>and a third </em>individual.\u201d However, as appellant\u2019s counsel on appeal admitted, appellant\u2019s trial counsel did not offer that test result into evidence at trial and did not cross-examine the Commonwealth\u2019s DNA expert on that information, despite the fact that the certificate previously was introduced at appellant\u2019s preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Moreover, even if the trial court had agreed to consider this evidence, it would not have changed the result. We interpret the certificate to show that genetic material from a third party was found on <em>appellant\u2019s </em>pubic area swabs, rather than on those of victim, as appellant contends. The PCR certificate of analysis shows the DNA of a third person on \u201cthe pubic area swabs.\u201d Those swabs are referred to as coming from \u201cItem 2,\u201d and Item 2 is identified elsewhere in the certificate as <em>appellant\u2019s </em>PERK rather than victim\u2019s, which is Item 1. Furthermore, that DNA came from \u201cthe non-sperm fraction\u201d of the \u201cpubic area swabs,\u201d which indicates that the gender of the third person is unknown and, statistically speaking, that it was just as likely to have come from a woman as from a man. Accordingly, the evidence, if accepted, would have shown, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>most, that a third person of unknown gender had some sexual contact with <em>appellant, </em>not with victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Therefore, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion to reconsider. <em>See Murphy v. Commonwealth, </em>246 Va. 136, 148, 431 S.E.2d 48, 55 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence to Prove Penetration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Although appellant concedes that the evidence proved he had some sexual contact with victim, he contends it was insufficient to prove penetration, a necessary element of rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">Under familiar principles of appellate review, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>See Martin v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). The judgment of a trial court will be disturbed only if plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>See id. </em>The credibility of a witness\u2019 testimony and the inferences to be drawn from proven facts are matters solely for the fact finder\u2019s determination. <em>See Long v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 194, 199, 379 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"AFq\">\u201cCircumstantial evidence is as competent and is entitled to as much weight as direct evidence, provided it is sufficiently convincing to exclude every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 31, 53, 307 S.E.2d 864, 876 (1983). However, \u201cthe Commonwealth need only exclude reasonable hypotheses of innocence that flow from the evidence, not those that spring from the imagination of the defendant.\u201d <em>Hamilton v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 751, 755, 433 S.E.2d 27, 29 (1993). Whether a hypothesis of innocence is reasonable is a question of fact. <em>See Cantrell v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 269, 290, 373 S.E.2d 328, 339 (1988). Penetration, like any other element, \u201cmay be proved by circumstantial evidence and is not dependent on direct testimony from the victim that penetration occurred.\u201d <em>Morrison v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 300, 301, 391 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>612, 612 (1990) (holding that although the victim never testified directly that penetration occurred, her testimony regarding sexual contact and doctor\u2019s testimony that some object penetrated her vagina were sufficient to prove accused guilty of rape).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Here, the circumstantial evidence was sufficient to prove penetration. Based on the DNA evidence introduced, the trial court was entitled to conclude that appellant\u2019s semen was found in victim\u2019s vagina and that it was deposited there when appellant \u201craped [victim],\u201d which required him to penetrate victim\u2019s vagina with his penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Although appellant offers what he contends are reasonable hypotheses of innocence, we conclude that these hypotheses do not flow from the evidence. First, appellant contends his semen could have been deposited on appellant\u2019s external genitalia and could have been forced into victim\u2019s vagina when she was penetrated by a third person. Appellant\u2019s contention does not constitute a reasonable hypothesis of innocence flowing from the evidence because no evidence was introduced at trial regarding the possible presence on victim of genetic material from a third party. The certificate of analysis from the PCR DNA test is contained in the record only as an attachment to appellant\u2019s motion to reconsider. In addition, as discussed above, we interpret this evidence as showing genetic material from a third person of unknown gender on <em>appellant\u2019s </em>pubic area swabs, rather than on those of victim. Therefore, such evidence would not have provided the foundation for a reasonable hypothesis of innocence if it had been admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Appellant also argues that sperm is highly motile and could independently have found its way into victim\u2019s vagina after being deposited by appellant outside the vagina. Regardless of whether this is a medical possibility, appellant offered no evidence to this effect at trial; therefore, it does not constitute a reasonable hypothesis of innocence flowing from the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>For these reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"A24\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-8\">. Appellant objected on hearsay grounds when Officer Dowling testified to this out-of-court statement, but the trial court admitted the statement as an excited utterance. On appeal, appellant has not assigned error to the admission of the statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
