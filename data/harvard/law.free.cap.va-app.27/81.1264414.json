He contends the trial court erred when it: (1) refused to instruct the jury on the \u201cheat of passion\u201d defense, and (2) excluded from the jury\u2019s consideration during the sentencing phase evidence regarding the impact of appellant\u2019s incarceration upon his family. Finding no error, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>\n<em>I. BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">At a social gathering hosted by Sharon George Peak, Peak\u2019s four-year-old daughter accidentally knocked an ashtray into appellant\u2019s lap. Appellant \u201cjumped up and ... called her a little bitch and a little whore.\u201d Harris, another guest, told appellant he should not speak to a child in that manner. Peak asked appellant to leave the trailer, which he did. Once outside, appellant started cursing and screaming for Harris to come out of the trailer \u201cand settle it.\u201d Appellant stated: \u201cI just want to talk.\u201d Harris decided to \u201cgo talk to him and see if he\u2019ll calm down.\u201d When Harris exited the trailer, appellant lunged at him and slashed Harris\u2019 face with a shiny object. Appellant then warned another guest that \u201che was the next little son-of-a-bitch ... he was going to get.\u201d At trial, appellant testified that he did not recall the incident because he was very intoxicated. Harris\u2019 face was permanently scarred as a result of the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\n<em>II. \u201cHEAT OF PASSION\u201d INSTRUCTION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The trial court denied appellant\u2019s request for a jury instruction on the heat of passion defense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant contends the trial court improperly refused the instruction because the jury could have concluded that Harris\u2019 \u201charsh words\u201d reasonably provoked appellant to attack Harris in the \u201cheat of passion.\u201d Appellant asserts that had the instruction been given, the jury could have convicted him for the lesser offense of unlawful wounding. <em>See Miller v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 22, 24-25, 359 S.E.2d 841, 842 (1987). His contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">\u201cIt is well settled that a trial court must instruct the jury on a lesser-included offense if more than a scintilla of evidence supports it.\u201d <em>Donkor v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 325, 330, 494 S.E.2d 497, 500 (1998). However, an instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>is properly refused when it is unsupported by the evidence. <em>Bennett v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 228, 284, 380 S.E.2d 17, 21 (1989). Although the Commonwealth prevailed at trial, we must view the evidence with respect to the refused instruction in the light most favorable to the appellant. <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 270, 275, 476 S.E.2d 504, 507 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">No evidence in the record supports appellant\u2019s contention that the trial court was required to give an instruction on the heat of passion defense. \u201cHeat of passion\u201d refers to the <em>furor brevis </em>which renders a man deaf to the voice of reason. <em>Hannah v. Commonwealth, </em>153 Va. 863, 870, 149 S.E. 419, 421 (1929). To establish the heat of passion defense, an accused must prove he committed the crime with \u201cpassion\u201d and upon \u201creasonable provocation.\u201d <em>Canipe v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 629, 643, 491 S.E.2d 747, 753 (1997). Viewed in the light most favorable to appellant, the evidence establishes, at most, that appellant and Harris exchanged \u201charsh words\u201d before the attack. The long-standing rule in Virginia is that \u201c[w]ords alone, however insulting or contemptuous, are <em>never </em>a sufficient provocation\u201d for one to seriously injure or kill another. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Read v. Commonwealth, </em>63 Va. (22 Gratt) 924, 938 (1872)) (emphasis added). The evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to prove \u201cheat of passion.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on the heat of passion defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\n<em>III. ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE AT SENTENCING HEARING</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">At his sentencing hearing, appellant informed the court that he wished to offer as mitigating evidence for the jury\u2019s consideration appellant\u2019s wife\u2019s testimony that she suffered from a serious medical condition and depended upon him to administer her medication and to take her to the doctor. The trial judge and defense counsel had the following dialogue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Al\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, your honor, we wanted to call Betty Jean Caudill as a witness for mitigation. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>proffered evidence would be and (sic) Ms. Caudill would testify to her current health condition. The medication that she is receiving and the type of treatment she has to undergo (sic) her medical condition. It would consist of (sic) that Mr. Caudill who assists her with her medication. Who assists or does the housekeeping chores as all of the children are out of the home, your honor. He is responsible for taking her to the doctor and back. And, that would be the proffer of what she would testify to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\">THE COURT: So, do I understand that the testimony would be basically that she has a medical condition and is unable to do these other items that you just enumerated for herself and that, that if Mr. Caudill were to be incarcerated that she would not have anyone to help her do these things?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AR\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Over appellant\u2019s objection, the trial judge excluded the evidence, holding that the adverse impact of appellant\u2019s incarceration on his family was irrelevant to the jury\u2019s recommendation of punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-8\">In cases of trial by jury, upon finding that the defendant is guilty of a felony, a separate proceeding limited to the ascertainment of punishment shall be held as soon as possible before the same jury.... After the Commonwealth has introduced ... evidence of prior convictions, or if no such evidence is introduced, the defendant may introduce <em>relevant, admissible evidence related to punishment.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">(Emphasis added.) The question of what evidence may be properly admitted by the defendant at sentencing as \u201crelevant, admissible evidence related to punishment\u201d is an unsettled issue in Virginia. <em>See Shifflett v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 254, 494 S.E.2d 163 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc) (currently on appeal to the Virginia Supreme Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">However, in <em>Coppola v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 243, 257 S.E.2d 797 (1979), upon being convicted for capital murder, the defendant sought to introduce his former wife\u2019s testimony as to the adverse effect that sentencing him to death would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>have upon their two young children. The trial court refused to admit the evidence. On appeal, the Supreme Court noted that Coppola\u2019s proffered evidence of family impact was \u201cnot analogous to any of the evidence specifically approved in the [death penalty] statute.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 253, 257 S.E.2d at 804. Affirming the trial court\u2019s ruling, the Court held that \u201cthe effect of [the defendant\u2019s] incarceration upon relatives is not a mitigating circumstance for the jury to consider\u201d during the sentencing phase of trial. <em>Id. </em>at 254, 257 S.E.2d at 804. We find the <em>Coppola </em>decision persuasive and controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Within the past year, in <em>Shifflett, </em>we held that the trial court erred by excluding from the jury\u2019s consideration at sentencing Shifflett\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s testimony that \u201cwould have proved that Shifflett was a responsible father who worked earnestly to provide for his children.\u201d 26 Va.App. at 261, 494 S.E.2d at 166. We stated: \u201cFor the determination of sentences, justice generally requires consideration of more than the particular acts by which the crime was committed and that there be taken into account the circumstances of the offense together with the [offender\u2019s] <em>character and propensities </em>[for rehabilitation].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 259, 494 S.E.2d at 166 (quoting <em>Pennsylvania v. Ashe, </em>302 U.S. 51, 55, 58 S.Ct. 59, 61, 82 L.Ed. 43 (1937)) (emphasis added). Thus, we held in <em>Shifflett </em>that evidence of an offender\u2019s \u201chabits\u201d and \u201ccharacter\u201d is \u201crelevant to determining an appropriate punishment\u201d under Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1. <em>Id. </em>at 261, 494 S.E.2d at 166. In so holding, we concluded the evidence that Shifflett \u201ccontributed positively to his family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>situation\u201d would have reflected upon his character and was, therefore, admissible at his sentencing hearing. <em>Id. </em>However, we noted that the evidence \u201cwas not offered merely to prove the family\u2019s apparent need for [the defendant\u2019s] income.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Here, as in <em>Coppola, </em>appellant offered the evidence in order to prove that his incarceration would adversely affect his family. Unlike the circumstances of <em>Shifflett, </em>appellant\u2019s wife\u2019s testimony that she suffered from a serious medical condition and depended upon appellant to ensure that she receive medical treatment did not reflect upon the appellant\u2019s \u201ccharacter\u201d and \u201cpropensities\u201d for rehabilitation. Accordingly, under <em>Coppola, </em>appellant\u2019s proffered evidence that his incarceration would adversely impact his wife was not a mitigating circumstance that the jury could properly consider under Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, and the trial court did not err in refusing to admit the evidence at appellant\u2019s sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">For these reasons, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b126-9\">. The so-called \"heat of passion\u201d defense is not a defense in the traditional sense; the existence of \"heat of passion\u201d merely reduces the grade of the offense to a Class 6 felony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b129-6\">. Because the defendant was convicted for capital murder, the <em>Coppola </em>Court considered the admissibility of evidence under Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(B), Virginia\u2019s death penalty statute. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(B) provides \u201d[i]n cases of trial by jury, evidence may be presented as to any matter which the court deems <em>relevant to </em>sentence....\u201d The statute then enumerates an extensive, but not exhaustive, list of evidence that may be introduced at sentencing, all of which \"bears upon the record of the defendant and the atrociousness of the crime.\u201d <em>Coppola, </em>220 Va. at 253, 257 S.E.2d at 804. Our decisions have analogized the sentencing provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 to those applicable to the sentencing phase of bifurcated capital murder trials. <em>See Bunn v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 593, 598, 466 S.E.2d 744, 746 (1996); <em>Gilliam v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 519, 522-23, 465 S.E.2d 592, 594 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
