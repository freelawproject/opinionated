Code \u00a7 19.2-294 provides in pertinent part that \u201c[i]f the same act be a violation of two or more statutes ... conviction under one of such statutes ... shall be a bar to prosecution or proceeding under the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">Matthew Phillips was charged with feloniously distributing marijuana on school property (two counts), in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-255.2. A week later, Phillips was charged with distributing less than one-half ounce of marijuana (two counts), misdemeanors, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248.1, based on the same acts as the felony charges. In a single proceeding in the general district court, that court accepted Phillips\u2019 guilty plea on the misdemeanor charges and certified the felony charges to the circuit court, where the grand jury returned indictments. In the circuit court, Phillips entered conditional guilty pleas on the felony charges. On appeal, Phillips contends that under the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-294, the two misdemeanor convictions bar the Commonwealth from prosecuting him on the felony charges based on the same acts. We disagree and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">\u201cCode \u00a7 19.2-294 ... prohibits multiple convictions for separate offenses arising out of the same act [or acts], <em>except where the convictions are obtained in a single prosecution\u201d Hall v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 892, 900, 421 S.E.2d 455, 461 (1992) <em>(en </em>banc) (emphasis added). Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>only a prior conviction bars a subsequent prosecution, \u201cCode \u00a7 19.2-294 does not apply to simultaneous prosecutions.\u201d <em>Slater v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 593, 595, 425 S.E.2d 816, 817 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">In <em>Slater, </em>we addressed whether Code \u00a7 19.2-294 precluded the Commonwealth from prosecuting and convicting a defendant for felony and misdemeanor charges arising from the same act or acts. Slater was \u201csimultaneously charged\u201d with driving while under the influence of alcohol, a misdemeanor offense, and driving after having been adjudged an habitual offender, a felony offense. The trial of the misdemeanor charge and the preliminary hearing on the. felony charge were heard together in a concurrent proceeding in the general district court. The general district court convicted Slater on the misdemeanor charge and certified the felony charge to the grand jury of the circuit court, where he was indicted and subsequently convicted. This Court held that Code \u00a7 19.2-294 did not bar the felony habitual offender prosecution in circuit court. Noting that the general district court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the felony charge, we held that \u201c[w]here charges are brought simultaneously, the amenability of one to early conclusion while the other requires further proceedings does not alter the fact that the proceedings are concurrent, not successive, prosecutions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 595, 425 S.E.2d at 817 (citing <em>Freeman v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 126, 129, 414 S.E.2d 871, 873 (1992)). In so holding, we also stated: \u201cMany circumstances may determine the time within which criminal charges are concluded. It is the time of institution which determines whether multiple charges are simultaneous or successive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 596, 425 S.E.2d at 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Relying on our statement in <em>Slater </em>that \u201cthe time of institution ... determines whether multiple charges are simultaneous or successive,\u201d Phillips argues that the felony and misdemeanor charges were successive because they were instituted on different dates. Thus, he reasons, the Commonwealth violated Code \u00a7 19.2-294 by convicting him for two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>separate statutory offenses in successive prosecutions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Code 19.2-294, like the Fifth Amendment former jeopardy protection, \u201cwas designed to prevent the [Commonwealth from] subjecting an accused to the hazards of vexatious, multiple prosecutions.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>14 Va.App. at 899, 421 S.E.2d at 460. The statute \u201cprevents a prosecutor from subjecting an accused through successive prosecutions to \u2018embarrassment, expense, ordeal and compelling him [or her] to live in a continuing state of anxiety or insecurity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Grady v. Corbin, </em>495 U.S. 508, 518, 110 S.Ct. 2084, 2091, 109 L.Ed.2d 548 (1990), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, United States v. Dixon, </em>509 U.S. 688, 113 S.Ct. 2849, 125 L.Ed.2d 556 (1993)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-6\">[B]y limiting its reach to successive prosecutions for multiple offenses for the same act, [the statute] prevents prosecutors from using the prosecution of a minor offense as a \u201cdress rehearsal\u201d for a more serious, later prosecution. Consequently, Code \u00a7 19.2-294 protects against a <em>second </em>prosecution or proceeding for separate statutory offenses based on the same act after there has been a conviction for one offense. <em>See North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 717 [89 S.Ct. 2072, 2076, 23 L.Ed.2d 656] (1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-7\"><em>Hall, </em>14 Va.App. at 899-900, 421 S.E.2d at 461 (emphasis added) (other citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">Considering the legislative purpose for enacting Code \u00a7 19.2-294, we find that the controlling principle in <em>Slater </em>is that both charges were prosecuted simultaneously or in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>concurrent proceeding despite \u201cthe amenability of the misdemeanor charge to early conclusion\u201d in general district court. The Commonwealth does not subject the accused to the \u201chazards of vexatious, multiple prosecutions\u201d where it institutes felony and misdemeanor charges separately but prosecutes them at the same time in a single hearing before the court. Although arrest warrants may be obtained on different dates, the Commonwealth does not thereby impose a greater burden on the accused than when it institutes the charges simultaneously. Moreover, the Commonwealth does not receive a greater opportunity to rehearse its evidence by instituting charges on separate dates. Borrowing the \u201cjurisdictional exception\u201d from our double jeopardy decisions, <em>Slater </em>held that Code \u00a7 19.2-294 does not apply where the several crimes charged are not amenable to common jurisdiction and cannot be heard in the same proceeding. <em>See Freeman, </em>14 Va.App. at 129, 414 S.E.2d at 873; <em>Curtis v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 622, 629, 414 S.E.2d 421, 425 (1992) <em>(en </em>banc). The fact that the charges in <em>Slater </em>were \u201clodged simultaneously\u201d does not control the outcome of this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Admittedly, as the appellant points out, the <em>Slater </em>panel held, based on the facts of that case, that because the charges were initiated at the same time, the prosecutions for the offenses were simultaneous or concurrent. We do not read the <em>Slater </em>decision to hold that simultaneous initiation of charges is the exclusive measure of whether convictions arise from a single prosecution. We hold that the more significant and compelling factor is whether the offenses were prosecuted in a single, concurrent evidentiary hearing. Thus, where felony and misdemean- or charges are instituted at separate times, but are heard simultaneously in a single proceeding, they are part of a single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>prosecution, even though jurisdictional limitations necessitate that they be concluded in different courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Here, Phillips was charged with both felony and misdemeanor marijuana distribution offenses arising out of the same acts. The charges were heard together in the general district court. Because the charges were not amenable to conclusion in the same court, Phillips was convicted for the misdemeanor charge in general district court and for the felony charge in circuit court. Under the jurisdictional exception to Code \u00a7 19.2-294 recognized in <em>Slater, </em>we find that the charges were prosecuted as part of a single proceeding. Where the charges are heard or prosecuted together, the fact that they were initiated on separate dates is a difference without a distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Phillips asserted at oral argument that this case is controlled by <em>Wade v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 359, 388 S.E.2d 277 (1990), in which we held that under Code \u00a7 19.2-294, a conviction for obstruction of justice barred a prosecution for capital murder when the offenses arose out of \u201cthe same act.\u201d Although factually similar to this case because trial of the misdemeanor charge and the preliminary hearing for the felony charge occurred in a single prosecution, the sole issue and basis for the decision -in <em>Wade </em>was whether the offenses arose out of \u201cthe same act.\u201d <em>Slater </em>was decided subsequent to <em>Wade. </em>In <em>Wade, </em>neither the Attorney General nor appellant raised the issue whether Code \u00a7 19.2-294 applied where there was a simultaneous or concurrent prosecution in a single proceeding. <em>Wade </em>did not consider whether the language of Code \u00a7 19.2-294 that only a \u201cconviction\u201d would bar \u201ca prosecution or proceeding\u201d creates a single or simultaneous prosecution exception to the statute\u2019s bar. That issue was subsequently decided in <em>Slater, </em>and the principles enunciated therein are controlling. Therefore, <em>Wade </em>is inapposite to the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Accordingly, we hold that the felony convictions for distributing marijuana on school property were not barred by Code \u00a7 19.2-294 because of the misdemeanor convictions for distri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>bution of marijuana. The judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b721-9\">. Phillips also contends the felony convictions violated the Fifth Amendment's Double Jeopardy Clause. In our January 8, 1998 order granting in part Phillips\u2019 petition for appeal, we stated that the legislature expressly indicated that \u201c[a] defendant can be prosecuted under both the general statute concerning the distribution of marijuana and Code \u00a7 18.2-255.2. The trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to quash the felony indictments on double jeopardy grounds.\u201d <em>See Hall, </em>14 Va.App. at 900, 421 S.E.2d at 461 (1992). Thus, because the question of whether the felony convictions violated double jeopardy has been decided, we denied the appeal of that issue. Accordingly, we may not consider Phillips' double jeopardy claim. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b722-5\">. In. <em>Slater, </em>as in the present case, the misdemeanor and felo'ny charges were heard in a single prosecution in the general district court where Slater was convicted of the misdemeanor and the felony charge was certified to the circuit court grand jury. <em>Slater </em>leaves unanswered whether the simultaneous initiation of charges would have continued to control had there been a misdemeanor prosecution in the general district court separate from the felony preliminary hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
