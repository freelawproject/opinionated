On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>appeal, he contends the trial court erred in admitting evidence of his subsequent \u201cbad acts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">On November 21, 1996, at approximately 5:00 p.m., Dr. Alexander Yuzefovsky (the victim) was returning to his apartment in the St. John\u2019s Woods apartment complex in Richmond. It was daylight and a \u201clittle bit rainy.\u201d Shortly after Yuzefovsky got out of his car, he heard what he believed to be a \u201cjogger\u201d running up behind him. As he began to turn to the right to let the person pass, he \u201cheard a shot\u201d and \u201cfelt [a sharp] pain in [his] right shoulder.\u201d As he fell to the ground, Yuzefovsky saw the attacker pick up his car keys and run back to his car, where another man was standing. Both men drove away in Yuzefovsky\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Yuzefovsky was taken to the Medical College of Virginia, where he had a total of nine surgeries. As a result of the attack, Yuzefovsky suffered severe and permanent injury to his right shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">No shell casings or ballistic evidence was recovered at the crime scene. The police concluded that Yuzefovsky was shot in the shoulder with a weapon that was not a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">Yuzefovsky saw his assailant\u2019s face when the man picked up the keys and again at the time he opened the car door. The victim made a conscious effort to \u201ctry to remember the face.\u201d Neither the assailant nor his accomplice was wearing a mask. Yuzefovsky described the man who shot him as an African-American, seventeen to nineteen years old, 5'8\"-5'9\" tall and weighing 160-165 pounds. Appellant is a nineteen-year-old African-American male. He is 5'9\" and weighs 160 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">On December 17, 1996, the police visited Yuzefovsky in the hospital and showed him six photographs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He told police that his assailant was not in any of the photos. On December 23, the police returned to the hospital and created a computer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>composite drawing based on the victim\u2019s description of his assailant. On January 28,1997, Yuzefovsky reviewed a second photo spread at the police station. He picked appellant\u2019s photograph from the group of eight and identified him as his attacker. Yuzefovsky also identified appellant in court as the man who shot him.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">At trial, the Commonwealth introduced evidence from two witnesses over appellant\u2019s objection. Stanley Hawkins identified a sawed-off shotgun as the gun he borrowed from appellant and used in a robbery in Richmond on December 31,1996, one month after the Yuzefovsky shooting.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hawkins recognized the gun by its \u201ctaped\u201d stock and its \u201cpull bolt\u201d and cartridge. Hawkins added that on January 6, 1997, he purchased the shotgun from appellant for $25. Hawkins further testified that on the evening of January 6, 1997, he and appellant were riding in a vehicle \u201cbeing pursued by the police.\u201d During the pursuit, Hawkins kicked the car door open and threw the shotgun out of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Richmond Police Detective Michael Mabry testified that after an undercover surveillance operation which resulted in the January 6 chase, the police recovered the shotgun that was thrown from the car. He further testified that appellant was one of the occupants of the vehicle apprehended after the chase.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">When counsel showed Yuzefovsky the shotgun recovered on January 6, he testified that \u201c[t]his thing looks ... identical [to what] that man had in his hands.\u201d The shotgun was introduced into evidence as the weapon used to shoot Yuzefovsky.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Appellant\u2019s defense included four alibi witnesses who testified that appellant was at his apartment in Stratford Hills<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> throughout the afternoon of November 21, 1996. Elanda Wilson, appellant\u2019s roommate, testified that appellant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>home when she awoke around noon and she remained with him all afternoon, except for a half-hour around 2:00 p.m. Kenya Moore, appellant\u2019s friend, testified that he was with appellant at the apartment from 1:30 or 2:00 p.m. until after 7:00 p.m. Jaroon Woodson, another friend, testified that appellant was there when he arrived at around 7:00 p.m. Additionally, appellant\u2019s girlfriend, Trade Walker, testified that she spoke to appellant on the telephone at his home, sometime between noon and 4:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Appellant challenges the admission of Hawkins\u2019 and Mabry\u2019s testimony regarding appellant\u2019s role in the events of December 31, 1996 and January 6, 1997. He contends the trial court erred in finding the probative value of the evidence outweighed the prejudicial effect on appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">\u201cEvidence of other crimes or bad acts is inadmissible if it is offered merely to show that the defendant is likely to have committed the crime charged.\u201d <em>Goins v. Commonwealth, </em>251 Va. 442, 462, 470 S.E.2d 114, 127, <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 117 S.Ct. 222, 136 L.Ed.2d 154 (1996). However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZF\">there are important exceptions to that rule. Evidence of other crimes is admissible if it tends to prove any fact in issue, even though it also tends to show the defendant guilty of another crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-10\"><em>Hewston v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 409, 412, 444 S.E.2d 267, 268 (1994) (citing <em>Spencer v. Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 78, 89, 393 S.E.2d 609, 616, <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 908, 111 S.Ct. 281, 112 L.Ed.2d 235 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">\u201c \u2018[O]ne of the issues upon which \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence may be admitted is that of the perpetrator\u2019s identity, or criminal agency, where that has been disputed.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, \u201c[ejvidence of \u2018other crimes\u2019 is relevant and admissible if it tends to prove any element of the offense charged,\u201d <em>Guill v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 134, 138, 495 S.E.2d 489, 491 (1998), \u201cor if \u2018the evidence is connected with ... the offense for which the accused is on trial.\u2019\u201d <em>Woodfin v. Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number><em>wealth, </em>236 Va. 89, 95, 372 S.E.2d 377, 381 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1009, 109 S.Ct. 1649, 104 L.Ed.2d 163 (1989) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\u201cAdmission of evidence under [the] exceptions ... is subject to the further requirement that the legitimate probative value of the evidence must exceed the incidental prejudice caused the defendant.\u201d <em>Guill, </em>255 Va. at 139, 495 S.E.2d at 491-92. \u2018\u201cThe responsibility for balancing the competing considerations of probative value and prejudice rests in the sound discretion of the trial court. The exercise of that discretion will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of a clear abuse.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hewston, </em>18 Va.App. at 414, 444 S.E.2d at 269 (citation omitted). <em>See Battle v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 440, 482 S.E.2d 873 (1997). \u201c[T]he test for admission of evidence of other crimes is met when there is \u2018a causal relation or logical and natural connection between the two acts, or they ... form parts of one transaction.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Guill, </em>255 Va. at 140, 495 S.E.2d at 492 (quoting <em>Barber v. Commonwealth, </em>182 Va. 858, 868, 30 S.E.2d 565, 569 (1944)). This test does not distinguish between subsequent or prior bad acts. <em>See also United States v. Whaley, </em>786 F.2d 1229, 1232 (4th Cir.1986) (\u201cThe mere fact that the \u2018other acts\u2019 at issue occurred after the events charged in the indictment does not render them irrelevant.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">In the instant case, Hawkins and Mabry provided testimony that linked appellant to the shotgun introduced as the weapon used in the charged offenses. This evidence tended to prove the identity of appellant as the criminal agent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>in the robbery and malicious wounding counts. In addition, appellant\u2019s possession of the shotgun was an element of the two counts of use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. Consequently, the disputed evidence was sufficiently related to the crimes charged and satisfied this threshold requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Appellant presented an alibi defense, disputing his identity as the criminal agent. The Commonwealth bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was the man who attacked Yuzefovsky and that he used a weapon, the shotgun later found and identified by the victim, when he did so. Evidence tending to establish appellant\u2019s ownership of the weapon used in the shooting was critical to link appellant to the crimes and to corroborate the victim\u2019s identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Detective Mabry testified that the police recovered the shotgun following pursuit and apprehension of a vehicle in which appellant was a passenger. This testimony linked the passengers of the car, including appellant and Hawkins, to the weapon used in the Yuzefovsky shooting. Hawkins testified that he borrowed the shotgun from appellant on December 31, 1996 and that appellant sold him the weapon on January 6, 1997. Both of these facts tended to establish that appellant was in possession and control of the shotgun one month after the shooting. Mabry\u2019s and Hawkins\u2019 testimony, taken together, established a connection between appellant and the shotgun and corroborated Yuzefovsky\u2019s eyewitness identification of appellant as the shooter. There was a \u201c \u2018logical and natural connection between\u2019 \u201d appellant\u2019s subsequent possession of the weapon and the crime charged, <em>Guill, </em>255 Va. at 140, 495 S.E.2d at 492 (citation omitted), and the information was highly probative of appellant\u2019s identity as the criminal agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Appellant next argues that the probative value of the disputed testimony was outweighed by its highly prejudicial nature, because it connected him to an admitted robber, a police chase, providing a gun used in the commission of another felony, and the sale of a gun. We disagree. Although the evidence reflected that appellant was involved with questionable associates in questionable circumstances, which might have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>had an adverse effect on him, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the substantial probative value of the evidence outweighed this incidental prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Appellant also contends that even if the evidence was admissible in some form, the Commonwealth failed to limit the scope of the prejudicial testimony to information necessary to link him with the weapon several weeks after the shooting. Appellant claims the evidence that he had been under surveillance, that Hawkins had used the weapon to rob a drug store, and that Hawkins and appellant had been in a police chase was irrelevant and should have been excluded. Appellant\u2019s contention lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">No witness testified that appellant was the person under surveillance. Mabry testified only that he was conducting surveillance when he became involved in the police chase. Any one of the occupants of the vehicle, or the vehicle itself, could have been the subject of police interest. Hawkins\u2019 reasons for borrowing the shotgun were closely connected to the probative information that he borrowed it from appellant. Hawkins\u2019 and Mabry\u2019s testimony about the police chase explained how the police recovered the shotgun and proved that appellant and the shotgun were both in the vehicle. Appellant \u201chad \u2018no right to have the evidence sanitized,\u2019 and we cannot say that the trial judge abused his discretion in admitting relevant and material evidence.\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 232, 235, 421 S.E.2d 911, 913 (1992) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Finally, appellant contends the challenged evidence was too remote in time from the crime charged and should not have been admitted. \u201c[T]he trial court may consider remoteness as one of the factors in determining evidentiary relevance of prior bad acts evidence, but it should not withhold such evidence solely on the basis of remoteness unless the expanse of time has truly obliterated all probative value.\u201d <em>Lafon v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 411, 419, 438 S.E.2d 279, 284 (1993). We hold that this principle applies equally in cases of subsequent bad acts. <em>See, e.g., Whaley, </em>786 F.2d 1229. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Therefore, any remoteness in time of the contested evidence relates only to the weight it should be given. The disputed testimony concerned events occurring approximately six weeks after the shooting. Under these facts, the evidence was not so remote that its admission was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b300-11\">. Appellant\u2019s photograph was not among the six.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b301-9\">.

In <em>Guill, </em>the Commonwealth introduced evidence of a 1985 burglary and attempted rape which it argued was sufficiently similar to the charged burglary to show the defendant\u2019s intent was to rape. The trial court found the circumstances of the prior crime sufficiently similar to the charged offense and admitted the evidence. The Supreme Court reversed, noting several factual differences and holding that \"evidence of the 1985 crime was inadmissible ... because that offense was not idiosyncratic in relation to the facts of the present offense. As such, the evidence lacked a logical relationship to the offense charged and, thus, was irrelevant and showed only the defendant\u2019s propensity to commit the crime charged.\u201d <em>Guill, </em>255 Va. at 141, 495 S.E.2d at 493.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
