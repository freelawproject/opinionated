He contends the trial court erred when it denied his motion to suppress (1) evidence obtained during a search of his person on the night of his arrest and (2) an incriminating statement he made to police shortly after his arrest. For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">At about 6:00 p.m. on July 25,1996, Officer Jerome D. Hoyt of the Henrico County Police Department received information from a known informant that three people were selling cocaine \u201cat the comer of Second and Virginia\u201d near 101 North Virginia Avenue. The informant identified one of the three sellers as \u201cKenny \u2018Boo\u2019 Jefferson\u201d and described him as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AY\">a black male ... about five ten or five eleven inches tall, thin build, short cropped hair, had big eyes, two gold teeth, wearing a gr[a]y shirt, long blue jeans, and a gold chain around his neck.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The informant told Officer Hoyt that he had seen \u201cKenny \u2018Boo\u2019 Jefferson\u201d exchange money for \u201cactual crack cocaine\u201d several times. Officer Hoyt had known this informant for about a month after arresting him for a misdemeanor charge, which was still pending. The informant was seeking to help himself on the misdemeanor charge by cooperating with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">After completing his phone call with the informant, Officer Hoyt called a second known informant and asked him to \u201cgo by [101 North Virginia Avenue] to see what was going on.\u201d The second informant called Officer Hoyt a little after 6:30 p.m. and told him that he saw \u201cKenny \u2018Boo\u2019 \u201d and two other individuals standing on the corner of Second and Virginia in front of 101 North Virginia Avenue. The second informant stated that these three individuals had \u201ccocaine on their person and for sale\u201d and that he witnessed \u201cKenny \u2018Boo\u2019 \u201d complete at least one sale of crack cocaine. The second informant\u2019s description of \u201cKenny \u2018Boo\u2019 \u201d matched the description of \u201cKenny \u2018Boo\u2019 Jefferson\u201d given by the first informant. Officer Hoyt had known the second informant for \u201capproximately three or four months.\u201d The second informant had a pending traffic charge against him that was punishable by incarceration and was cooperating with the police in several matters in order to obtain leniency in the prosecution against him. Officer Hoyt had worked with the second informant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>\u201cmaybe a dozen times\u201d and information provided by this informant had led to several arrests but no actual convictions as of July 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Based on the information provided by the two informants, Officer Hoyt\u2019s supervisor initiated an operation to locate the three individuals who were purportedly selling cocaine in front of 101 North Virginia Avenue. The police department assembled a team that included both \u201cstrike force\u201d officers and uniformed officers. Prior to leaving the police department, Officer Hoyt conveyed the information provided by the informants to the officers involved in the operation, which included Officer L.D. Harpster. The police did not obtain either arrest warrants for the three individuals spotted at the corner of Second and Virginia or a search warrant for the house at 101 North Virginia Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Officer Harpster, Officer Hoyt, and the other officers involved in the operation arrived at the corner of Second and Virginia at 10:05 p.m. Officer Harpster testified that, by the time he exited his vehicle, several officers had already proceeded to the back of the house at 101 North Virginia Avenue. Officer Harpster then heard some of these officers \u201cyelling,\u201d and he walked to the back of the house to investigate this \u201ccommotion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">When the officer arrived, appellant was inside the house at 101 North Virginia Avenue, which was his residence. Appellant heard a \u201ccommotion\u201d from outside and walked to his back door. When appellant opened his back door, he saw \u201ca whole bunch of police outside [his] house ... in [the] back yard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">At about this time, Officer Harpster saw appellant and realized that he matched the description of \u201cKenny \u2018Boo\u2019 Jefferson\u201d given by Officer Hoyt. Appellant was standing outside of the house \u201cright in front\u201d of the back door. Officer Harpster approached appellant, \u201cput him on the ground[,] ... put handcuffs on him and took him into custody.\u201d The record does not indicate whether appellant had moved from his location by his back door prior to being taken into custody by Officer Harpster. Although he had \u201cno reason\u201d to suspect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>that appellant was armed, Officer Harpster patted down appellant for weapons. The pat-down, which the record established was not a \u201cfall\u201d search of appellant\u2019s person, yielded a \u201csmall bottle of liquor\u201d but no incriminating evidence. Appellant later testified that, at this point, Officer Harpster told him he was under arrest. Officer Harpster later testified that he made no such statement to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Officer Hoyt approached appellant following the pat-down by Officer Harpster. Officer Hoyt told appellant that the police had received information that he was selling drugs and asked appellant, \u201cDo you mind if I search you for drugs?\u201d Appellant replied, \u201cYou might as well, because he\u2019s already done it.\u201d Officer Hoyt searched appellant and retrieved .9 of a gram of crack cocaine and $158 in cash from appellant\u2019s \u201cwatch pocket.\u201d After seizing the cocaine and cash from appellant\u2019s person, Officer Hoyt told appellant he was under arrest. Appellant was placed in the custody of Officer Akita Brown, who transported appellant to \u201cDabbs House.\u201d At about 11:05 p.m., Officer Hoyt arrived at Dabbs House and informed appellant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Appellant signed a \u201crights waiver form\u201d and made an incriminating statement to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Appellant was charged with possessing cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248. Prior to his trial, appellant moved the trial court to suppress the cocaine and cash seized by Officer Hoyt as well as his incriminating statement. Following a hearing, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion. It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-7\">The Court finds that the police had probable cause to arrest [appellant], based on the information from the two informants .... In this case, the Court finds that [appellant] was not in his house when he was arrested, but he was outside in the yard and that Harpster identified him as the person who fit the description. So the Court finds they had probable cause to arrest him and, of course, the search was incident to the arrest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Appellant was subsequently convicted of possession of cocaine in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">WARRANTLESS SEARCH INCIDENT TO ARREST</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Appellant contends the trial court erred when it concluded that Officer Hoyt\u2019s search of his person was conducted inei-\u2019 dent to a lawful arrest. Appellant argues that Officer Harpster\u2019s arrest of him was unlawful because (1) Officer Harpster lacked probable cause to believe that appellant had committed a criminal offense and (2) the arrest was executed within the \u201ccurtilage\u201d of his home without a warrant. Although we find that Officer Harpster possessed probable cause to arrest appellant, we hold that the warrantless arrest of appellant in the curtilage of his home was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">Generally, evidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of a defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights is inadmissible at a criminal trial. <em>See Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 655, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 1691, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961); <em>Weeks v. United States, </em>232 U.S. 383, 391-93, 34 S.Ct. 341, 344, 58 L.Ed. 652 (1914). At a hearing on a defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence allegedly obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment, the defendant has the burden of establishing standing by proving that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the place searched, <em>Barnes v. Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 130, 135, 360 S.E.2d 196, 200 (1987) (citing <em>Rakas v. Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 131 n. 1, 99 S.Ct. 421, 424 n. 1, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978)), and the Commonwealth has the burden of proving that the relevant searches or seizures did not violate the defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. <em>See Simmons v. Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 200, 204, 380 S.E.2d 656, 659 (1989); <em>Alexander v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 671, 674, 454 S.E.2d 39, 41 (1995). On appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>See Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991). We review the trial court\u2019s findings of historical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>fact only for \u201cclear error,\u201d but we review <em>de novo </em>the trial court\u2019s application of defined legal standards to the particular facts of a case, including determinations of probable cause. <em>See Shears v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 394, 398, 477 S.E.2d 309, 311 (1996); <em>see also Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">In this case, Officer Hoyt recovered the cash and cocaine from appellant\u2019s person during a warrantless search that followed Officer Harpster\u2019s warrantless \u201carrest.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although searches conducted without a judicially-issued warrant are <em>per se </em>unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, <em>see Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S.Ct. 507, 514, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967) (citations omitted), one of the established exceptions to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment is for a \u201csearch incident to a lawful arrest.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 224, 94 S.Ct. 467, 471, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973); <em>see also Chimel v. California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 762-63, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 2040, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969). Thus, the constitutional validity of Officer Hoyt\u2019s warrantless search of appellant is contingent upon the constitutional validity of Officer Harpster\u2019s warrantless arrest. <em>See Beck v. Ohio, </em>379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 223, 225, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Appellant first contends he was illegally arrested because Officer Harpster lacked probable cause to believe that appellant had committed a criminal offense. Specifically, appellant argues that the information provided by the two informants that he was selling cocaine could not provide probable cause to arrest him because the reliability of this information was not sufficiently established. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u2018Whether [a warrantless] arrest was constitutionally valid depends ... upon whether, at the moment the arrest was made, the officers had probable cause to make it....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91, 85 S.Ct. at 225.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">Probable cause exists where \u201cthe facts and circumstances within [the arresting officers\u2019] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information [are] sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that\u201d an offense has been or is being committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AW\"><em>Brinegar v. United States, </em>338 U.S. 160, 175-76, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 1310-11, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949) (quoting <em>Carroll v. United States, </em>267 U.S. 132, 162, 45 S.Ct. 280, 288, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1925)). The determination of probable cause by police officers depends upon \u201cpractical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act,\u201d <em>Brinegar, </em>338 U.S. at 175, 69 S.Ct. at 1310, and courts' must view and weigh the evidence supporting probable cause \u201c \u2018as understood by those versed in the field of law enforcement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 231-32, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2328-29, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983) (quoting <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 418, 101 S.Ct. 690, 695, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">When making a warrantless arrest, an officer \u201c \u2018may rely upon information received through an informant, rather than upon his direct observations,\u201d\u2019 so long as the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the informant\u2019s statement is true. <em>Id. </em>at 242, 103 S.Ct. at 2334 (citation omitted); see <em>also Draper v. United States, </em>358 U.S. 307, 312-14, 79 S.Ct. 329, 333, 3 L.Ed.2d 327 (1959). Because the value and reliability of information provided by informants to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>police varies greatly, the veracity of an informant and the basis of his or her knowledge regarding a particular tip are \u201crelevant considerations\u201d in the totality-of-the-circumstances analysis that guides the determination of probable cause. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 232-33,103 S.Ct. at 2329 (quoting <em>Adams v. Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 147, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 1924, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972)); <em>see also Alabama v. White, </em>496 U.S. 325, 330, 110 S.Ct. 2412, 2416, 110 L.Ed.2d 301 (1990) (stating that both the content and reliability of information possessed by the police are considered when determining whether the totality of the circumstances justified an officer\u2019s determination of probable cause). When reviewing an officer\u2019s determination of probable cause based upon information provided by an informant, a court should conduct a \u201cbalanced assessment of the relative weights of all the various indicia of reliability (and unreliability) attending [the] informant\u2019s tip.\u201d <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 234, 103 S.Ct. at 2330; <em>see also White, </em>496 U.S. at 329-30, 110 S.Ct. at 2416.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">We hold that, at the time of appellant\u2019s arrest, Officer Harpster had probable cause to believe that appellant had recently committed a drug offense. Prior to appellant\u2019s arrest, Officer Hoyt told Officer Harpster that a thin African-American male with gold teeth wearing blue jeans, a gray shirt, and a gold chain was seen by two informants selling cocaine \u201cin the area of Second and Virginia\u201d near 101 North Virginia Avenue. Officer Harpster proceeded to the backyard of 101 North Virginia Avenue and arrested appellant after verifying that he matched the description provided by the two informants.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The record indicates that the information provided by the two informants was sufficiently trustworthy to justify Officer Harpster\u2019s belief that appellant had in fact recently sold cocaine. The reliability of the informants\u2019 information was established by their asserted first-hand knowledge, their independent corroboration of each other\u2019s observations, and one of the informant\u2019s history of providing accurate information to the police. The first informant, whom Officer Hoyt had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>known for about one month, gave a detailed description of appellant\u2019s appearance and told Officer Hoyt that he <em>personally </em>saw appellant selling cocaine. Officer Hoyt then called the second informant and told him to \u201csee what was going on\u201d near 101 North Virginia Avenue. The record does not indicate whether Officer Hoyt told the second informant anything about the first informant\u2019s observations. The second informant called back about twenty-five minutes later and corroborated in detail the information provided by the first informant, including his <em>direct </em>observation of appellant engaging in transactions involving cocaine. The veracity of the second informant was bolstered by his previous work with Officer Hoyt during the preceding three or four months that had led to several arrests. Based on the totality of these circumstances, Officer Hoyt and all of the officers whom he briefed prior to the operation, which included Officer Harpster, had probable cause to arrest appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Appellant next contends that, even if Officer Harpster had probable cause to believe that he was selling or had sold cocaine, his arrest was still unlawful because it was executed within the \u201ccurtilage\u201d of his home without a warrant. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">Although the Fourth Amendment permits law enforcement officers to make warrantless arrests in public places upon probable cause, <em>see United States v. Watson, </em>423 U.S. 411, 423-24, 96 S.Ct. 820, 828, 46 L.Ed.2d 598 (1976), warrant-less entries into a suspect\u2019s home in order to arrest a suspect violate the Fourth Amendment unless justified by exigent circumstances or consent. <em>See Payton v. New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 575, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 1374-75, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980). In support of this \u201cwarrant requirement\u201d for entries into the home, the United States Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-9\">In terms that apply equally to seizures of property and to seizures of persons, the Fourth Amendment has drawn a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>firm line at the entrance to the house. Absent exigent circumstances, that threshold may not reasonably be crossed without a warrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-5\"><em>Payton, </em>445 U.S. at 589-90,100 S.Ct. at 1382.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Consistent with the common law understanding of the extent of the \u201chome,\u201d the Supreme Court has held that the Fourth Amendment protections that apply to the house also apply to the \u201ccurtilage\u201d of the house. <em>See Oliver v. United States, </em>466 U.S. 170, 180, 104 S.Ct. 1735, 1742, 80 L.Ed.2d 214 (1984) (stating that the curtilage \u201chas been considered part of the home itself for Fourth Amendment purposes\u201d); <em>United States v.

Thus, absent (1) exigent circumstances and probable cause or (2) consent, law enforcement agents cannot enter the curtilage of a person\u2019s home either to search or seize without previously obtaining a warrant. <em>See Van Dyke, </em>643 F.2d at 993; <em>Walker, </em>154 Wis.2d at 182-83, 453 N.W.2d at 137 (holding that <em>\u201cPayton </em>and <em>Oliver </em>require that police obtain a warrant before entering either the home or its curtilage to make an arrest\u201d unless they have both probable cause and exigent circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">As a general proposition, the curtilage of the home protected by the Fourth Amendment is the area immediately surrounding the home \u201cto which extends the intimate activity associated with the \u2018sanctity of a man\u2019s home and the privacies of life.\u2019 \u201d <em>Oliver, </em>466 U.S. at 180, 104 S.Ct. at 1742 (citation omitted). Although the United States Supreme Court has set forth a general standard defining the extent of the curtilage, whether a particular place is within the curtilage of the home is determined on a case-by-case basis. <em>See Dunn, </em>480 U.S. at 301 n. 4, 107 S.Ct. at 1139 n. 4 (declining the invitation to adopt a \u201cbright-line rule\u201d regarding the extent of the curtilage and stating that a court is required to define the extent of the curtilage by assessing the factors outlined in Dunn). \u201c[T]he extent of the curtilage is determined by factors that bear upon whether an individual reasonably may expect that the area in question should be treated as the home itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300, 107 S.Ct. at 1139; <em>see Wellford, </em>227 Va. at 302, 315 S.E.2d at 238.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">[C]urtilage questions should be resolved with particular reference to four factors: the proximity of the area claimed to be curtilage to the home, whether the area is included within an enclosure surrounding the home, the nature of the uses to which the area is put and the steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observation by people passing by. ,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number><em>Dunn, </em>480 U.S. at 301, 107 S.Ct. at 1139.

First, the proximity of the place where Officer Harpster arrested appellant was extremely close to appellant\u2019s house and could not be viewed by pedestrians and drivers passing in front of the house. The record established that the back door of appellant\u2019s house opened \u201cdirectly\u201d into the backyard. The trial court found that appellant was not in his house when Officer Harpster arrested him, and this factual finding is supported by Officer Harpster\u2019s testimony that appellant was standing \u201cright in front\u201d of this door when Officer Harpster first saw him. The record does not indicate whether appellant moved from this location before Officer Harpster arrested him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Officer Harpster\u2019s testimony indicated that appellant\u2019s back door was not visible from the street and that the officer was required to walk behind appellant\u2019s house before the back door came into his view. Regarding the \u201cnature of the uses\u201d of the location of appellant\u2019s arrest, the area of a residential backyard <em>immediately </em>adjacent to the home\u2019s back door is commonly understood as \u201can area ... to which the activity of home life extends.\u201d <em>Oliver, </em>466 U.S. at 182 n. 12, 104 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>1743 n. 12 (stating that the concept of the curtilage \u201cis a familiar one easily understood from our daily experience\u201d). Based on this evidence, we conclude that the area in which appellant was arrested was so intimately tied to the home that appellant could reasonably expect it to be treated as part of his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Because Officer Harpster\u2019s arrest of appellant was executed after the officer entered the curtilage of appellant\u2019s home without a warrant, we hold that the arrest violated the Fourth Amendment. Although Officer Harpster had probable cause to arrest appellant, nothing in the record indicates that his intrusion into appellant\u2019s curtilage was justified by exigent circumstances. In addition, the record does not prove that appellant consented to the officer\u2019s entry into the curtilage.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">We disagree with the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that this case is controlled by <em>United States v. Santana, </em>427 U.S. 38, 96 S.Ct. 2406, 49 L.Ed.2d 300 (1976). In <em>Santana, </em>the defendant was spotted by the police \u201cstanding in the doorway of her house\u201d after they had probable cause to arrest her. <em>Id. </em>at 40, 96 S.Ct. at 2408. The doorway in question was positioned so that it \u201cexposed [the defendant] to public view, speech, hearing and touch as if she had been standing completely outside her house.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42, 96 S.Ct. at 2409. As the officers approached, the defendant \u201cretreated into the vestibule of her house\u201d where the officers arrested her. <em>Id. </em>at 40-41, 96 S.Ct. at 2408-09. The United States Supreme Court held that the warrantless arrest executed inside the defendant\u2019s home did not violate the Fourth Amendment because it was justified by an exigent circumstance: the arresting officer had \u201chotly pursued\u201d the defendant into her home after spotting her in a \u201cpublic place.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 42-43, 96 S.Ct. at 2409-10. The Supreme Court concluded that the defendant\u2019s doorway was a \u201cpublic place\u201d because its proximity to direct interaction with the public rendered it \u201cnot ... an area where [the defendant] had any expectation of privacy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42, 96 S.Ct. at 2409. In an apparent reference to the curtilage doctrine, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>While it may be true that under the common law of property the threshold of one\u2019s dwelling is \u201cprivate,\u201d as is the yard surrounding the house, it is nonetheless clear that under the cases interpreting the Fourth Amendment [the defendant] was in a \u201cpublic\u201d place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">This case is distinguishable from <em>Santana </em>because it did not involve the hot pursuit of a fleeing felon from a \u201cpublic place\u201d into an area protected by the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although appellant was standing just outside of his back door, his door was not situated so that it exposed him to \u201cpublic view, speech, hearing, and touch.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The record established that appellant\u2019s back door was behind his house and not visible from the street. As previously discussed, appellant was within the curtilage of his home when Officer Harpster first saw him, and the extent of the curtilage is by definition the area surrounding the home that \u201can individual reasonably may expect ... [to] be treated as the home itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300, 107 S.Ct. at 1139. Thus, unlike the defendant in <em>Santana, </em>appellant did not retreat into his \u201chome\u201d following a knowing exposure to the public. He was within his \u201chome\u201d for Fourth Amendment purposes at all times prior to Officer Harpster\u2019s physical intrusion into the curtilage. <em>See Dunn, </em>480 U.S. at 301, 107 S.Ct. at 1140 (stating that areas within the curtilage are \u201cplaced under the home\u2019s \u2018umbrella\u2019 of Fourth Amendment protection\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Because Officer Harpster\u2019s <em>arrest </em>of appellant was unlawful, the warrantless <em>search </em>incident to this arrest per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>formed by Officer Hoyt likewise violated the Fourth Amendment. As such, the trial court erred when it refused to suppress the cocaine and cash seized during this search.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">We also hold that the trial court erred when it declined to suppress appellant\u2019s incriminating statement because its occurrence was not sufficiently attenuated from the unlawful arrest and search to permit its use at trial. Although appellant was given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings and signed a written waiver, it is well established that such a waiver alone does not sever the causal connection between a Fourth Amendment violation and an otherwise voluntary confession. <em>See Brown v. Illinois, </em>422 U.S. 590, 603-05, 95 S.Ct. 2254, 2261-62, 45 L.Ed.2d 416 (1975). Based on the close proximity in time between the unlawful arrest and the confession \u2014 about one hour \u2014 and the lack of intervening circumstances, we conclude that appellant\u2019s confession is rendered inadmissible by its relationship to the initial illegalities. <em>See Dunaway v. New York, </em>442 U.S. 200, 218-19, 99 S.Ct. 2248, 2259-60, 60 L.Ed.2d 824 (1979); <em>Brown, </em>422 U.S. at 604-05, 95 S.Ct. at 2262; <em>Hart v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 283, 287-89, 269 S.E.2d 806, 809-10 (1980); <em>Watson v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 659, 665-66, 454 S.E.2d 358, 362 (1995); <em>Corey v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 281, 286 n. 1, 381 S.E.2d 19, 21 n. 1 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the conviction of possession of cocaine and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b53-6\">. The trial court characterized the initial encounter between Officer Harpster and appellant as an \"arrest.\u201d After reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to appellant, who prevailed on this issue, we cannot say this legal conclusion was erroneous. Although \"[b]rief, complete deprivations of a suspect\u2019s liberty, including handcuffing, \u2018do not convert a stop and frisk into an arrest so long as the methods of restraint used are reasonable to the circumstances,\u2019 \u201d <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 851, 857, 434 S.E.2d 319, 323 (1993), <em>aff'd en banc, </em>18 Va.App. 454, 444 S.E.2d 275 (1994) (citation omitted), appellant\u2019s testimony, if believed by the trial court, was legally sufficient to establish that he was arrested by Officer Harpster. Appellant testified that, after Officer Harpster took him into custody and patted him down for weapons, he told appellant, \"You\u2019re under arrest.\u201d Although Officer Harpster testified that he did not verbally indicate to appellant that he was under arrest after handcuffing him on the ground, the trial court, in its role as fact finder, was entitled to credit appellant\u2019s testimony and discount Officer Harpster\u2019s testimony on this issue. <em>See Mills v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 459, 469, 418 S.E.2d 718, 723 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b57-7\">. The concept that the legal protections afforded to a dwelling house also extend to the curtilage originated at common law. <em>See Dunn, </em>480 U.S. at 300 &amp; n. 3, 107 S.Ct. at 1139 &amp; n. 3. The United States Supreme Court has stated that \"[t]he [curtilage] concept plays a part ... in interpreting the reach of the Fourth Amendment\u201d \u2014 apparently because the common-law understanding of the extent of the home sheds light on the Framers\u2019 intended meaning of the word \"houses\u201d in the text of the Fourth Amendment. <em>See id. </em>at 300, 107 S.Ct. at 1139 (citing <em>Hester v. United States, </em>265 U.S. 57, 59, 44 S.Ct. 445, 446, 68 L.Ed. 898 (1924)); <em>Oliver, </em>466 U.S. at 178-80, 104 S.Ct. at 1741-42; <em>cf.

Although the trial court found that appellant was \"outside in the yard\u201d at the time of his arrest by Officer Harpster, this factual finding is not supported by any evidence in the record and is thus \"clearly erroneous.\u201d Instead, the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, indicates that appellant was \"right in front\u201d of his back door at the time of the arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b61-8\">. After deciding <em>Santana, </em>the Supreme Court has consistently stated that this case represents one of the <em>exceptions </em>to the rule that warrant-less entries into the home or curtilage violate the Fourth Amendment. Specifically, the Court has stated that <em>Santana </em>stands for the proposition that \"hot pursuit of a fleeing felon\u201d from a public place is one of the \"exigent circumstances\u201d justifying a warrantless arrest inside the home. <em>See Segura v. United States, </em>468 U.S. 796, 811-12, 104 S.Ct. 3380, 3389, 82 L.Ed.2d 599 (1984); <em>Welsh v.

The Commonwealth argues in its brief that Officer Hoyt\u2019s search was lawful because it was conducted pursuant to appellant\u2019s consent. However, the record indicates that the Commonwealth did not argue to the trial court that appellant consented to Officer Hoyt\u2019s search, and we will not consider this argument for the first time on appeal. Rule 5A:18. In addition, even assuming that appellant did consent to the search, the cash and cocaine still should have been suppressed because appellant\u2019s consent was \"obtained by exploitation of the illegality of his arrest.\u201d <em>Brown v.
