Romero (wife), also known as Antonia Colbow, appeals from a decree of divorce entered by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Circuit Court of the City of Chesapeake (trial court) that awarded George Allen Colbow (husband) a divorce from wife on the ground of adultery, denied spousal support to wife while reserving that right only to husband, and made equitable distribution awards. For the reasons that follow, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The evidence and issues in this case were presented in person by the parties before a commissioner in chancery. Wife contends the evidence was insufficient to prove she committed adultery and, therefore, the trial court erroneously refused to reserve her right to spousal support. Wife further asserts that the trial court erroneously reduced her marital share to husband\u2019s military pension based upon the unfounded allegation of adultery.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Husband and wife married in 1974 in Spain while husband was in the U.S. Navy. They separated in December 1992. On January 11, 1993, husband filed for divorce, alleging wife had committed adultery.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Only the commissioner heard the testimony of the parties and their witnesses. Husband testified that when he returned from the Gulf War in 1992, he and wife moved into separate bedrooms. He believed wife was having an affair. One evening during the fall of 1992, he went to look for wife at about 1:00 a.m. because she had not returned from her job at a local department store. He located wife\u2019s car and while waiting nearby, he saw wife and a man named Andre Ramirez drive into the parking lot in Ramirez\u2019 car, stop, and begin to kiss. When husband drove up to Ramirez\u2019 vehicle, wife and Ramirez looked at husband, left the parking lot at a high rate of speed, and managed to evade him. When husband returned home, wife was already there. Wife admitted having been with Ramirez that night but claimed he was \u201ca friend\u201d and denied kissing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Husband further testified that by the fall of 1992, he realized wife was no longer storing the parties\u2019 telephone bills in their usual place. He obtained from the telephone company replacement records which showed numerous calls between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>wife\u2019s and Ramirez\u2019 residences from December 1991 to February 1993. He also presented polaroid photographs he found in wife\u2019s car after the separation, one of which showed wife in Ramirez\u2019 place of business wearing a blouse and short, lace-trimmed skirt or slip. That photograph was admitted as exhibit one. Another picture showed wife in Ramirez\u2019 residence, dressed only in a sweater, and she appeared to be removing or putting on underclothes. Husband testified that he had not taken the photos and was not present when they were taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">Ramirez confirmed that the photos depicted his office and his home, but he denied taking them or knowing who did. He admitted that he and wife were friends and that he had spent some time with her daughter, as well, but he denied having sexual relations with wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Wife admitted that she used Ramirez\u2019 credit cards in 1992, signed his name, and picked up his laundry. When asked to identify the individual in the picture designated as exhibit one, wife asserted her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. She testified that she had not had sexual relations with anyone other than husband from before the parties\u2019 separation until the time of the commissioner\u2019s hearing on December 27, 1994; however, she then recanted her denial and again invoked the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">In his report filed June 2,1995, the commissioner found that wife was not a credible witness and that the circumstances were suspicious, but he concluded that husband had not met his burden of proving adultery by clear and convincing evidence. He recommended a no-fault divorce with a reservation of spousal support to wife and an award to wife of fifty percent of the marital share of husband\u2019s non-disability military retirement pay. The commissioner based this award on a finding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">when one spouse is in the service of their country, it places an added burden on the other spouse to perform more parenting obligations, and obligations tending to household responsibilities. Also, evidence in this case is that wife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>worked throughout the marriage, although she never worked very long or full-time in a place, and has no other retirement available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Husband excepted to the commissioner\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The trial court reviewed the transcript and exhibits from the commissioner\u2019s hearing, the memoranda filed by the parties, and heard argument of counsel. By letter opinion of October 29, 1996, the trial court ruled that the photographs, evidence of the car chase, and the inconsistency of wife\u2019s testimony proved wife\u2019s adultery by clear and convincing evidence. Based on the finding of adultery, the court refused to reserve wife\u2019s right to spousal support and stated that in consideration of \u201call the evidence,\u201d wife should receive thirty-three-and-one-third percent of the marital share of husband\u2019s military retirement. It did not expressly link the reduction to the proof of wife\u2019s adultery. The trial court also expressly noted that, in addition to all the evidence and argument and the report of the commissioner, it had considered the statutory factors in Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-107.1, -107.2, and -107.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">On February 19, 1997, the trial court entered a final decree which, contrary to the commissioner\u2019s report and findings, (1) found wife had committed adultery, (2) refused to reserve her right to spousal support as a result, and (3) reduced her marital share of husband\u2019s military pension to thirty-three- and-one-third percent without explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">When the trial court hears the testimony of witnesses <em>ore terms, </em>its findings of fact are reviewed on appeal in the light most favorable to the party who prevailed below. <em>See, e.g., Pommerenke v. Pommerenke, </em>7 Va.App. 241, 244, 372 S.E.2d 630, 631 (1988). However, when the chancellor has referred the matter to a commissioner in chancery, \u201c \u2018[e]ven where the commissioner\u2019s findings of fact have been disapproved [by the chancellor], an appellate court must give due regard to the commissioner\u2019s ability, not shared by the chancellor, to see, hear, and evaluate the witnesses at first hand.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Robinson v. Robinson, </em>5 Va.App. 222, 226, 361 S.E.2d 356, 358 (1987) (quoting <em>Hill v. Hill, </em>227 Va. 569, 577, 318 S.E.2d 292, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>296-97 (1984)). Where the circuit court has rejected the commissioner\u2019s conclusion that the evidence was insufficient to prove a party\u2019s infidelity, \u201cwe must review the evidence and ascertain whether, under a correct application of the law, the evidence supports the findings of the commissioner or the conclusion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Dooley v. Dooley, </em>222 Va. 240, 245, 278 S.E.2d 865, 868 (1981) (citation omitted); <em>cf. Higgins v. Higgins, </em>205 Va. 324, 328-29, 136 S.E.2d 793, 796 (1964) (discussing duties of and deference to commissioner).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The commissioner described wife\u2019s testimony before him as confusing at best when she invoked her Fifth Amendment \u2022rights while simultaneously denying having had sexual relations with anyone but husband. On the allegation of adultery, the commissioner said that, although wife was not a credible witness, the fact that she had exercised her Fifth Amendment rights could not be used against her. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-223.1. Therefore, the evidence \u201cas a whole\u201d justifiably raised suspicion; but it did not equate to clear and convincing evidence of adultery.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">In its letter opinion, the trial court recognized \u201cthe principle that the Commissioner\u2019s findings of facts should be sustained unless it is determined that such findings are not supported by the evidence.\u201d However, after reviewing the evidence, the trial court found that the commissioner \u201cerred when he did not find [wife] guilty of adultery despite clear and convincing evidence.\u201d In its opinion, the trial court said that it \u201cbased its decision on the photographs found by [husband] in [wife\u2019s] car, the evidence of the car chase, and [wife\u2019s] display of inconsistency at the Commissioner\u2019s hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">\u201cTo establish a charge of adultery the evidence must be clear, positive and convincing. Strongly suspicious circumstances are inadequate. Care and circumspection should accompany consideration of the evidence.\u201d <em>Painter v. Painter, </em>215 Va. 418, 420, 211 S.E.2d 37, 38 (1975). Here, as in <em>Painter, </em>wife\u2019s conduct created strong suspicion of an intimate relationship with a person not her husband; but even strongly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>suspicious circumstances are not enough to establish adultery. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\">\u201cA charge of adultery is one of a criminal offense and especially and uniquely damaging to the reputation of the party charged. The general and widely recognized presumption of innocence must be indulged against it, and, while it is not required to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, as in a criminal proceeding, the evidence must be at least clear and positive and convincing. Raising a considerable or even strong suspicion of guilt is not enough.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-6\"><em>Haskins v. Haskins, </em>188 Va. 525, 530-31, 50 S.E.2d 437, 439 (1948) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">This Court must decide whether, on this record, the finding of the commissioner or the trial court is supported by the evidence. We hold that \u201cthe photographs found by [husband] in [-wife\u2019s] car, the evidence of the car chase, and [wife\u2019s] display of inconsistency at the Commissioner\u2019s hearing\u201d are not \u201cclear and positive and convincing\u201d evidence, as required by <em>Haskins </em>and its progeny, to support the charge of adultery.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s finding that the commissioner erroneously concluded the evidence did not clearly and convincingly prove wife committed adultery. Because the trial court applied its finding of adultery in refusing to reserve the right of spousal support to wife and because it may have done so in determining how much of the marital share of husband\u2019s pension to award wife, we also reverse those findings and remand this cause to the trial court for further consideration consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
