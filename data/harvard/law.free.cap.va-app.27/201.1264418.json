Flanary, a former employee of Moose Coal. The Fund contends the commission erred in failing to apportion the award between the Fund and the Virginia Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association, which was statutorily obligated to pay the \u201ccovered claims\u201d of one of Moose Coal\u2019s insolvent insurers. The Fund also contends that because Moose Coal was insured when Flanary was first awarded benefits, the commission erred in holding that the Fund was liable for Moose Coal\u2019s other insurer\u2019s portion of the award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>after that insurer also became insolvent. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Albert Flanary filed a claim with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission on February 20,1990, alleging an occupational disease. The evidence at the hearing proved that Flanary worked as a coal miner for Moose Coal Company until November 6,1986. During Flanary\u2019s final ninety work shifts, Moose Coal was insured by Virginia Coal Producers Group Self-Insurance Association for eighty-five of those work shifts and Rockwood Insurance Company for the remaining five work shifts. On December 28, 1989, Flanary was informed that he suffered from stage three coal-workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Following an evidentiary hearing, the deputy commissioner found that Flanary had contracted stage three coal-workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis as a consequence of exposure to coal dust while employed by Moose Coal. The deputy commissioner awarded Flanary weekly compensation disability benefits commencing December 23,1989 and continuing for 300 weeks until September 22, 1995. The deputy commissioner prorated the award, finding the Coal Producers Group liable for 85/90ths of the award and Rockwood Insurance hable for the other 5/90ths.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The Coal Producers Group, which was insolvent when the commission made the award, did not pay any portion of the award. Instead, by order of the commission, the Coal Producers Group\u2019s liability for 85/90ths of the award was paid by the Fund pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-1203(A). Rockwood Insurance paid its portion of the award as a lump sum. However, after Rockwood Insurance made its payment, it too became insolvent. Although the Virginia Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association would have been obligated to pay \u201ccovered claims\u201d against Rockwood Insurance pursuant to Code \u00a7 38.2-1606, the Guaranty Association made no payments of weekly disability benefits to Flanary because Rockwood Insurance had paid its portion of the award prior to its insolvency.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>On August 22, 1996, Flanary filed with the commission a claim for benefits alleging a change in condition and seeking an award of lifetime benefits. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-504(A)(4). The deputy commissioner found that Flanary had proved a change in condition and awarded him lifetime benefits commencing on September 23, 1995. The deputy commissioner also ruled that liability for that award would not be apportioned between the Fund and the Guaranty Association because the commission \u201ccannot enter any award against the Guaranty [Association] until all benefits from this claim from the ... Fund are exhausted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Finding that Flanary had proved a change in condition and that the award could not be prorated between the Fund and the Guaranty Association, the commission affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s award. The commission relied upon Code \u00a7 38.2-1610 to support its ruling that the Guaranty Association \u201cbecomes liable only in the event that the ... Fund does not fully satisfy the award.\u201d The Fund appeals this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The Guaranty Association was established to \u201cprovide prompt payment of covered claims to reduce financial loss to claimants or policyholders resulting from insolvency of an insurer,\u201d to \u201cassist in the detection and prevention of insurer insolvencies,\u201d and to \u201capportion the cost of this protection among insurers.\u201d Code \u00a7 38.2-1600. The Supreme Court has noted that the statutes limit the obligations of the Guaranty Association.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">[T]he General Assembly did not intend that the [Guaranty] Association merely \u201cstep into the shoes\u201d of the insolvent insurer. Establishment of the [Guaranty] Association affords a mechanism for the timely payment of appropriate claims to avoid financial loss to certain classes of people. But it is not merely a solvent substitute for an insolvent insurance company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-8\"><em>Virginia Property &amp; Cas. Ins. Guaranty Ass\u2019n v. International Ins. Co., </em>238 Va. 702, 705, 385 S.E.2d 614, 616 (1989). Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>although the Guaranty Association was created as an \u201cinsurer of last resort,\u201d its obligations are limited by, among other things, the \u201cexhaustion requirement and set-off provisions contained in [Code \u00a7 38.2-1610].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 704-05, 385 S.E.2d at 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 38.2-1610 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">A. Any person having a claim against an insurer under any provision in an insurance policy, other than a policy of an insolvent insurer under which the claim is also covered, shall be required to first seek recovery under the policy covered by the insurer which is not insolvent. Any amount payable on a covered claim under this chapter shall be reduced by the amount of any recovery under the insurance policy. Al. Any person having a claim or legal right of recovery under any governmental insurance or guaranty program which is also a covered claim, shall be required to exhaust first his right under such program. Any amount payable on a covered claim under this chapter shall be reduced by the amount of any recovery under such program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-6\">B. Any person having a claim that may be recovered under more than one insurance guaranty association or its equivalent shall seek recovery first from the association of the state where the insured resides. However, if it is a first party claim for damage to property with a permanent location, the insured shall seek recovery first from the association of the state where the property is located. For a workers\u2019 compensation claim recovery shall first be sought from the association of the state where the claimant resides. Any recovery under this chapter shall be reduced by the amount of the recovery from any other insurance guaranty association or its equivalent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The Fund argues that the language \u201cgovernmental insurance or guaranty program\u201d in Code \u00a7 38.2-1610(A1) refers to guaranty associations in other states or those governmental insurance programs in other states that have been set up in lieu of a guaranty association. We disagree. Nothing in Code \u00a7 38.2-1610(A1) requires such a limited reading. Indeed, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>statutory language refutes the Fund\u2019s contention. Code \u00a7 38.2-1610(B) establishes an exhaustion procedure whenever a claim is covered by more than one insurance guaranty association, including those in other states. The interpretation suggested by the Fund would render subsections (A1) and (B) redundant. \u201cThe rules of statutory interpretation argue against [such a] reading [of] any legislative enactment.\u201d <em>Jones v. Conwell, </em>227 Va. 176, 181, 314 S.E.2d 61, 64 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">The Fund also argues that it is not a \u201cgovernmental insurance or guaranty program\u201d as contemplated by Code \u00a7 38.2-1610(A1). We disagree. The Fund was created \u201c[f]or the purpose of providing funds for compensation benefits awarded against any uninsured or self-insured employer under the provisions of this chapter.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-1201. To finance the program, the enabling legislation that created the Fund provides that a tax shall be assessed, collected and paid into the state treasury by \u201c[e]very person, partnership, association, corporation, ... company, mutual company or association, the parties to any interindemnity contract or reciprocal plan or scheme, and every other insurance carrier, insuring employers in this Commonwealth against liability for personal injuries to their employees or death caused thereby.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-1000. The commission is authorized to \u201corder payment of any award of compensation benefits ... from the ... Fund\u201d when the commission determines that an employer has failed to acquire the requisite workers\u2019 compensation insurance or cannot satisfy a compensable claim in whole or in part. Code \u00a7 65.2-1203(A). This Court has held that the \u201cpurpose of the Fund is to insure that injured employees will be paid their compensation benefits even though their employer has breached his duty to secure compensation insurance.\u201d <em>A.G. Van Metre, Jr., Inc. v. Gandy, </em>7 Va.App. 207, 213, 372 S.E.2d 198, 202 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The Fund, a statutorily created entity financed by taxes levied upon insurers, functions as a workers\u2019 compensation insurer of last resort under the limited circumstances described in the statute, <em>ie., </em>when an employer fails to be suitably insured as required by Code \u00a7 65.2-801 or otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>fails to satisfy a compensable claim. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-1203(A). <em>See also Gandy, </em>7 Va.App. at 213-14, 372 S.E.2d at 202 (\u201cThe purpose of the Fund is to insure that injured employees will be paid their compensation benefits even though their employer has breached [its] duty to secure compensation insurance.\u201d). Upon payment of a claim, the Fund is statutorily \u201csubrogated to any right to recover damages which the injured employee ... or any other person may have against ... [the] employer or any other party.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-1204. In addition, the statute permits the Attorney General to \u201cdefend any claim against the ... Fund.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-1202.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">Under these statutorily defined circumstances, the Fund pays an award to an injured employee much like a workers\u2019 compensation insurer. Because the Fund characteristically exhibits indicia of a \u201cgovernmental insurance or guaranty program\u201d of limited purpose, Code \u00a7 38.2-1610(A1), the commission properly ruled that the award of lifetime benefits to Flanary should not be prorated between the Guaranty Association and the Fund. The Fund falls within the statutory purview of those entities from which recovery must be exhausted before the Guaranty Association is required to make payments. Thus, the commission did not err in ruling that the Guaranty Association only becomes liable for payment in the event the Fund is unable to fully satisfy the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The Fund also contends the commission erred when it ordered the Fund to pay the portion of the award that was originally assessed against Rockwood Insurance. The Fund argues that, because Rockwood Insurance was solvent on the date Flanary was first awarded weekly compensation benefits and became insolvent only after that award was entered, Moose Coal met the requirements of Code \u00a7 65.2-801.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Code \u00a7 65.2-801(A) provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">Every employer subject to this title shall secure his liability thereunder by one of the following methods:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>1. Insuring and keeping insured his liability in an insurer authorized to transact the business of workers\u2019 compensation in this Commonwealth....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Pertinent to this issue, Code \u00a7 65.2-1203(A) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">Whenever, following due investigation of a claim for compensation benefits, the Commission determines that (i) the employer of record has failed to comply with the provisions of \u00a7 65.2-801 ..., and (ii) the claim is compensable, the Commission shall ... order payment of any award of compensation benefits pursuant to this chapter from the Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The Fund concedes that this issue is governed by <em>Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund v. Mounts, </em>24 Va.App. 550, 484 S.E.2d 140 (1997), <em>aff'd, </em>255 Va. 254, 497 S.E.2d 464 (1998). In <em>Mounts, </em>the employer was insured on the date of the employee\u2019s last injurious exposure but not on the date when the diagnosis of the disease was communicated to the employee. The Fund argued that under those circumstances the employer was \u201cinsured\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 65.2-801 and, therefore, the Fund could not be held liable under Code \u00a7 65.2-1203(A). <em>See Mounts, </em>24 Va.App. at 556, 484 S.E.2d at 142-43. In affirming this Court\u2019s decision and the commission\u2019s award, the Supreme Court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">The \u201ckeeping insured\u201d language has been a part of the workers\u2019 compensation statutes since the Act was adopted in 1918---- [T]he language under scrutiny here means that an employer subject to the Act \u201cmust be and remain insured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-10\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-11\">An employer has potential liability for a claim of coal miners\u2019 pneumoconiosis for \u201cthree years after a diagnosis of the disease\u201d is first communicated to the employee, or for \u201cfive years from the date of the last injurious exposure in employment, whichever first occurs.... \u201d Therefore, given the statutory mandate to insure and keep insured its liability, an employer whose employees are susceptible to pneu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>moconiosis must anticipate that such claims will accrue in the future and must secure its liability for such potential claims as required by \u00a7 65.2-801, even when its insurer has been declared insolvent. When, as here, there has been a failure to do so, the Fund will be liable because the employer has violated its statutory duty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-5\"><em>Mounts, </em>255 Va. at 260, 497 S.E.2d at 466-67 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
