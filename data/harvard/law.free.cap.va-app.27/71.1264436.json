On appeal, appellant contends the trial court erred in admitting a certificate of analysis of the cocaine in violation of the statutory requirements. Finding no error, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>On October 30, 1996, Officer Lloyd Holland observed the driver of a car, later identified as Larry Lewis (buyer), give money to appellant in exchange for a small object. Holland testified that from his vantage point, he \u201ccouldn\u2019t say .that for sure that it was a rock of crack cocaine, but I suspected it to be so.\u201d At Holland\u2019s direction, other officers, including Officer William Hallam, followed and stopped Lewis\u2019 car. After the officers stopped him, Lewis gave the officers some items which the officers believed to be crack cocaine. The officers returned and arrested appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">At trial, Hallam testified that he sent the suspected cocaine to the Bureau of Forensic Science for testing. After establishing the chain of custody, the Commonwealth moved to admit a copy of a certificate of analysis from the Bureau of Forensic Science that certified the substance was cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Appellant objected on the basis that the certificate did not satisfy the requirements of Code \u00a7 19.2-187, governing the admission of certificates of analysis in the absence of the preparer\u2019s testimony. Specifically, appellant argued that the clerk\u2019s date stamp on the certificate was illegible and accordingly did not establish that the certificate was filed with the clerk seven days prior to trial. He also contended that the stamp, which related to the date the certificate was filed in buyer\u2019s file, did not show that the certificate had ever been filed in appellant\u2019s file.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The court overruled his objection, and found that the certificate had been filed under buyer\u2019s name, with no cross-reference- to appellant\u2019s name, \u201con February 21, 1997 in the Clerk\u2019s office of this court.\u201d After admitting the certificate and hearing further evidence, the court found appellant guilty of distribution of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">Evidence of Filing</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">Appellant argues that the court\u2019s admission of the certificate of analysis violated Code \u00a7 19.2-187 because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>stamp on the certificate was illegible and, therefore, failed to establish the date the document was received, by what court it was received, or by whom it was received. Code \u00a7 19.2-187 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-5\">In any hearing or trial of any criminal offense ..., a certificate of analysis of a person performing an analysis or examination ... shall be admissible in evidence as evidence of the facts therein stated and the results of the analysis or examination referred to therein, provided (i) the certificate of analysis is filed with the clerk of the court hearing the case at least seven days prior to the hearing or trial and (ii) a copy of such certificate is mailed or delivered by the clerk or attorney for the Commonwealth to counsel of record for the accused at least seven days prior to the hearing or trial upon request of such counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Generally, a court has discretion to determine whether evidence is admissible. <em>Langhome v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 97, 106, 409 S.E.2d 476, 482 (1991) (citing <em>Blain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 10, 16, 371 S.E.2d 838, 842 (1988)). A certificate of analysis, however, \u201cis not admissible if the Commonwealth fails to strictly comply with the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-187.\u201d <em>Woodward v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 672, 674, 432 S.E.2d 510, 512 (1993) (citing, <em>inter alia, Gray v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 943, 945, 265 S.E.2d 705, 706 (1980)). \u201cUnder familiar principles, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Rosser v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 308, 310, 482 S.E.2d 83, 84 (1997) (citing <em>Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">In <em>Carter v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 156, 157, 403 S.E.2d 360, 361 (1991), the certificate of analysis at issue contained a handwritten notation which read \u201c1988 Feb. 1 (4:40 pm) Filed, E.S.C., Dpty Clerk.\u201d We held that \u201c[t]he notation that the document had been \u2018filed\u2019 and date and initials of the deputy clerk who filed it were sufficient for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>trial court to determine that the certificate had been filed in that court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 158, 403 S.E.2d at 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Here, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the stamp reads, \u201cCIRCUIT CO ... URG, Recei ... 21 ... y of Feb ... 97 ... 11:45 o\u2019clock ... a ... clerk,\u201d followed by the signature of \u201cM. Musselman.\u201d The certificate also bears a stamp reading \u201cA COPY TESTE-SHARRON S. MITCHELL, BY,\u201d also followed by the signature of \u201cM. Musselman.\u201d Finally, the certificate bears the stamp of the Fredericksburg General District Court with the date December 26, 1996. The stamps on the face of the document, therefore, established that the certificate had been filed in the Fredericksburg General District Court on December 26, 1996 and that the certificate had been filed on February 21, 1997 in the Circuit Court of a jurisdiction with a name ending with the letters \u201curg.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The only fact not apparent from the stamps on the face of the document is whether the certificate was filed in the Circuit Court of Fredericksburg or in another circuit court in a jurisdiction with a name ending in the letters \u201curg,\u201d such as Lynchburg. The trial court, as finder of fact, may draw reasonable inferences from the evidence, and we are required to respect the trial court\u2019s reasonable inferences on appeal. <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). The trial court inferred from the evidence before it that the certificate had been filed with the clerk of the Circuit Court of Fredericksburg on February 21, 1997. In addition, appellant concedes on appeal that the certificate was found in the Fredericksburg circuit court file on the day of trial. We hold, therefore, that the evidence, in conjunction with reasonable inferences therefrom, supports the court\u2019s finding that the certificate was received by, and, therefore, \u201cfiled with,\u201d the clerk of the Circuit Court of Fredericksburg on February 21, 1997. <em>See Carter, </em>12 Va.App. at 157, 403 S.E.2d at 361; <em>see also Rhem v. State, </em>820 S.W.2d 946, 947 (Tex.App.1991) (\u201cA document is considered filed when delivered to the clerk for filing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Filing Under the Name of Different Defendant</p>\n<p id=\"At\">Appellant also contends the certificate was inadmissible because no evidence proved that the certificate was filed in defendant\u2019s file seven days prior to trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court found that the certificate was filed under Lewis\u2019 name with no cross-reference to appellant\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">It is well established that the filing requirements of Code \u00a7 19.2-187 must \u201cbe construed strictly against the Commonwealth and in favor of the accused.\u201d <em>Gray, </em>220 Va. at 945, 265 S.E.2d at 706; <em>see also Bottoms v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 466, 469, 457 S.E.2d 796, 797 (1995). By its language, however, \u201cthe statute requires only that the certificate be filed.\u201d <em>Carter, </em>12 Va.App. at 158, 403 S.E.2d at 362. We have repeatedly explained that the purpose of the statute \u201cis to ensure that the certificate to be used in evidence is lodged timely in a secure and appropriate place, accessible to the accused, and available to him on request.\u201d <em>Stokes v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 550, 552, 399 S.E.2d 453, 454 (1991); <em>see also Harshaw v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 69, 72, 427 S.E.2d 733, 735 (1993) (quoting <em>Mostyn v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 920, 923, 420 S.E.2d 519, 521 (1992)); <em>Mostyn, </em>14 Va.App. at 923, 420 S.E.2d at 521 (quoting <em>Stokes, </em>11 Va.App. at 552, 399 S.E.2d at 454).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">In <em>Harshaw, </em>16 Va.App. at 71, 427 S.E.2d at 735, copies of the relevant certificate of analysis were placed in the files of two of three related marijuana offenses that were tried simultaneously. The defendant argued that because the certificate was not filed in the file for one of the offenses, the certificate was inadmissible with respect to that offense. Citing the purpose of the statute, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">Here, the record is clear that the challenged certificate was properly filed with the clerk \u201cat least seven days prior\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>trial in compliance with Code \u00a7 19.2-187. Doubtless, it was thereafter accessible and available to defendant because it was lodged with another certificate which related to simultaneously tried offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 72, 427 S.E.2d at 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">This case is governed by <em>Harshaw, </em>16 Va.App. at 72, 427 S.E.2d at 735. Code \u00a7 19.2-187 \u2018\u201conly [requires] that the certificate <em>b&amp; filed.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>Harshaw, </em>16 Va.App. at 72, 427 S.E.2d at 735 (quoting <em>Carter, </em>12 Va.App. at 158, 403 S.E.2d at 361); <em>Mostyn, </em>14 Va.App. at 922, 420 S.E.2d at 520 (quoting <em>Carter, </em>12 Va.App. at 158, 403 S.E.2d at 361). The statute does not require that the certificates must be filed according to any particular system. As construed by this Court, the statute requires the Commonwealth only to file the certificate in a way which is \u201c \u2018accessible to the accused, and available to him on request.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harshaw, </em>16 Va.App. at 72, 427 S.E.2d at 735 (quoting <em>Mostyn, </em>14 Va.App. at 923, 420 S.E.2d at 521). As in <em>Harshaw, </em>there is no evidence in the record that the Fredericksburg filing system \u201ceffectively denied defendant those protections assured by the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72 n. 2, 427 S.E.2d at 735 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">For these reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b118-8\">. Defendant makes no contention that the Commonwealth failed to provide his counsel with a copy of the certificate of analysis seven days before trial as also required by Code \u00a7 19.2-187.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
