He contends the trial judge erred in finding the knife to be one of the weapons proscribed by the statute. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">The evidence proved that State Police Trooper John Rehme stopped Ricks for driving erratically and arrested him for driving while intoxicated. During a search of Ricks\u2019 vehicle, the officer found a knife beneath the driver\u2019s seat, a pack of beer, a shirt, boots, a cooler, and other trash. Ricks told the officer the knife was his fishing knife. The officer testified that he found no fishing gear in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">The Commonwealth introduced the knife as Commonwealth\u2019s Exhibit 2. The knife has a flexible blade that is four and one-half inches long and one-half inch wide at its widest point; it has a plastic handle. Observing the knife, the trial judge initially stated that \u201c[t]he question is whether or not the knife [which] has an appearance of being a common kitchen steak knife is a weapon that is illegal under [Code \u00a7 ] 18.2-308 when carried in a concealed capacity.\u201d After considering the arguments of counsel, the trial judge concluded the knife was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>\u201cnot something that was being carried for ordinary purposes.\u201d The judge convicted Ricks of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-308 by carrying the knife concealed under the seat of his truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">In accordance with generally accepted principles, \u201cpenal statutes must be strictly construed against the Commonwealth and applied only to those cases clearly falling within the language of the statute.\u201d <em>Branch v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 836, 839, 419 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1992). Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A), a penal statute, provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">If any person carries about his person, hidden from common observation, ... any dirk, bowie knife, switchblade knife, ballistic knife, razor, slingshot, spring stick, metal knucks, or blackjack ... or ... any weapon of like kind as those enumerated in this subsection, he shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">The statute does not prohibit generally the carrying of knives hidden from common observation. It designates specific types of knives, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A)(ii), and knives \u201cof like kind as those enumerated.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A)(v). The knives specified in Code \u00a7 18.2 \u2014 308(A)(ii) are defined by statute or have been described by this Court to have their usual meanings. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-308(N) (defining \u201cballistic knife\u201d as \u201cany knife with a detachable blade that is propelled by a spring-operated mechanism\u201d); <em>Richards v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 242, 245, 246 n. 2, 443 S.E.2d 177, 179, 179 n. 2 (1994) (defining \u201cswitchblade knife\u201d as \u201ca knife with a blade that opens automatically by operation of inertia, gravity, or both upon the release of a spring mechanism\u201d; defining \u201c \u2018dirk\u2019 or weapon of like kind\u201d as \u201cany stabbing weapon having two sharp edges and a point\u201d; and defining \u201c \u2018bowie knife\u2019 or weapon of like kind\u201d as \u201cany stabbing weapon having a single sharp edge, a dull or serrated flat edge and a point\u201d). The Court in <em>Richards </em>also noted that the legislature \u201cintend[ed] to exclude from [the] concealed weapons statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>innocuous household and industrial knives.\u201d 18 Va.App. at 246 n. 2, 443 S.E.2d at 179 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">After finding that the knife had \u201can appearance of being a common kitchen steak knife,\u201d the trial judge convicted Ricks because the knife was \u201cnot ... being carried for ordinary purposes.\u201d The trial judge erroneously relied on the purported purpose of Ricks\u2019 possession of the knife to convict Ricks of the offense. Unless a claim is made that a circumstance specified in Code \u00a7 18.2-308(B) (listing exclusions from coverage) or (C) (exempting certain individuals from coverage) is applicable, the language of the statute does not provide that the purpose for carrying the knife is relevant. Rather, the physical characteristics of the knife determine whether the knife is a weapon contemplated by the statute. Therefore, even if the trial judge believed Ricks did not use the knife for fishing and believed Ricks was not carrying it \u201cfor ordinary purposes,\u201d the knife did not have the physical characteristics of the weapons specified in Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A)(ii) and, thus, could not be deemed a \u201cweapon of like kind as those enumerated.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A)(v).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The trial judge observed the knife and found that it appeared to be an ordinary kitchen steak knife. The knife, which was introduced into evidence, in fact has the appearance and characteristics of an ordinary household steak knife. We hold, therefore, that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction. Accordingly, we reverse the conviction and dismiss the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
