Hutchins (\u201cfather\u201d) appeals the order of the Circuit Court of Prince William County (\u201ccircuit court\u201d) dismissing his appeal of a decision by the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court of Prince William County (\u201cJ &amp; DR court\u201d) regarding the custody and support of his two children. Father contends the circuit court erroneously concluded it lacked jurisdiction over his appeal when the sole reason for his noncompliance with the appeal bond requirement of Code \u00a7 16.1-296(H) was due to the unauthorized early closing of the J &amp; DR court clerk\u2019s office on the last day of the filing period. For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">On May 28, 1997, the J &amp; DR court entered an order denying father\u2019s petition to change child custody and ordering him to pay $1,212.40 per month to Rosana L. Carrillo (\u201cmother\u201d) for the support of their two minor children. The J &amp; DR court also found that father owed a support arrearage of $532.20 to mother and ordered him to pay $300 to a guardian <em>ad litem </em>who had been appointed to represent the parties\u2019 children. On June 6, 1997, father noted his appeal of the J &amp; DR court\u2019s order. On this date, the J &amp; DR court set father\u2019s appeal bond at $832.20. Under Code \u00a7 16.1-296(H), the deadline for father to file his appeal bond was Friday, June 27, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">At 2:00 p.m. on June 27, father arrived at the clerk\u2019s office of the J &amp; DR court to file his appeal bond. The established hours of the J &amp; DR court clerk\u2019s office on this date were 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. <em>See </em>Rules of Sup. Ct. of Va. l:15(d), App. of General Information Relating to the Courts within each Circuit and District in Virginia 119 (1997) (stating the established hours of each court\u2019s clerk\u2019s office). However, the clerk\u2019s office had closed for the day sometime before 2:00 p.m. in order to \u201cprocess a backlog of support petitions.\u201d Because the clerk\u2019s office was closed, father could not file his appeal .bond with the J <em>&amp; </em>DR court that day. Father\u2019s obligations to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>his employer prevented him from returning to the J &amp; DR court until July 3, 1997. On this date, the J <em>&amp; </em>DR court accepted father\u2019s appeal bond and scheduled his trial in the circuit court on July 17,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">On July 17, mother moved the circuit court to dismiss father\u2019s appeal. Mother argued that the circuit court was without jurisdiction to hear father\u2019s appeal because father had failed to file his appeal bond on or before June 27. The circuit court agreed and dismissed father\u2019s appeal. Citing <em>Commonwealth, Virginia Dept. of Soc. Services, Div. of Child Support Enforcement, ex rel. May v. Walker, </em>253 Va. 319, 485 S.E.2d 134 (1997), the circuit court concluded it could not rely upon Code \u00a7 16.1-114.1 to obtain jurisdiction over father\u2019s appeal. Father excepted to \u201cthe dismissal of this appeal, due to the unauthorized closing of the [J &amp; DR court clerk\u2019s office] during the final hours of the time limit set to post bond.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">UNAUTHORIZED EARLY CLOSING OF CLERK\u2019S OFFICE ON LAST DAY OF PERIOD TO FILE APPEAL BOND</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Father contends the early closing of the J &amp; DR court clerk\u2019s office on June 27 was an unauthorized act that \u201cgrievously interfered\u201d with his right to appeal. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">A deprivation of a protected property interest caused by a random, unauthorized act of a state employee is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause if the state \u201cfails to provide an adequate postdeprivation remedy.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Zinermon v. Burch, </em>494 U.S. 113, 115, 110 S.Ct. 975, 977-78,108 L.Ed.2d 100 (1990) (citing <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 533, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 3204, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number><em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 541, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 1916, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981), <em>overruled in part not relevant here by Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 330-31, 106 S.Ct. 662, 664-65, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Applying this principle to the unique facts of this case, we hold that the circuit court erred when it overruled father\u2019s exception to its order dismissing his appeal based upon the unauthorized closing of the clerk\u2019s office on June 27. The early closing of the J <em>&amp; </em>DR court clerk\u2019s office on the last day father was permitted to file his appeal bond was a random, unauthorized act. Furthermore, our review of Virginia law indicates that father had no adequate postdeprivation remedy for the loss of his right to appeal in this manner. As such, father\u2019s right to appeal was deprived without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">UNAUTHORIZED ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">The early closing of the clerk\u2019s office on June 27 was a random, unauthorized act. The legal authority to establish the business hours of a district court clerk\u2019s office is shared by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>two parties: the Committee on District Courts (\u201ccommittee\u201d) and the chief judge of each district.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The committee has adopted a policy that sets forth the extent of each party\u2019s authority to establish the business hours for a particular district court clerk\u2019s office. <em>See </em>Office of the Executive Secretary, Sup. Ct. of Va., <em>Personnel Policy Manual </em>ch. VII (1990). Under the policy, the committee has established a flexible range of hours \u2014 \u201c8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday\u201d \u2014 within which each district court clerk\u2019s office must be open at least eight hours. <em>Id. </em>at VII-1, VII-2. The chief judge determines the exact business hours of his or her court clerk\u2019s office, provided they are within the range set forth by the committee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The only exceptions to the required working hours enumerated in the policy are the occurrence of inclement weather and legal holidays. <em>See id. </em>at VII-2 to VII-3. Significantly, the policy does not authorize the chief judge of a district court to unilaterally close his or her clerk\u2019s office before the expiration of the required eight-hour period on a particular' business day for the purpose of processing a backlog of work.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">In this case, the decision to close the J &amp; DR court clerk\u2019s office on June 27 violated the committee\u2019s policy. The regular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>business hours established for the J &amp; DR court clerk\u2019s office by the chief judge were 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. However, the record indicates that, on June 27, the clerk\u2019s office closed sometime before 2:00 p.m., less than six hours after it opened. Although the record established that the clerk\u2019s office closed in order to \u201cprocess a backlog of support petitions,\u201d neither the chief judge nor any employee of the clerk\u2019s office had legal authority to unilaterally close the clerk\u2019s office for this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Furthermore, the unauthorized early closing of the J &amp; DR court clerk\u2019s office on June 27 caused the deprivation of father\u2019s right to appeal. Code \u00a7 16.1-296(H) provides that, in cases involving support that are adjudicated by a J &amp; DR court, \u201cno appeal shall be allowed\u201d unless and until the appellant \u201cgives bond\u201d which adequately secures \u201cthat portion of any order or judgment establishing a support arrearage or suspending payment of support during pendency of [the] appeal.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-296(H). \u201cAn appeal will not be perfected unless such appeal bond as may be required <em>is filed </em>within thirty days from the entry of the [J &amp; DR court\u2019s] final judgment or order.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-296(H) (emphasis added). The failure to substantially comply with the procedures attendant to filing an appeal bond \u201c \u2018constitutes a jurisdictional defect which cannot be corrected after the expiration of the time within which an appeal may be taken.\u2019 \u201d <em>Walker, </em>253 Va. at 322, 485 S.E.2d at 136 (quoting <em>Parker v. Prince William, County, </em>198 Va. 231, 235, 93 S.E.2d 136, 139 (1956)). Thus, when father was prevented from filing his appeal bond on June 27 \u2014 the thirtieth day of the statutory period \u2014 by the early closing of the J &amp; DR court clerk\u2019s office, his right to appeal under Code \u00a7 16.1-296 was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">POSSIBLE REMEDIES UNDER VIRGINIA LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Next, we consider whether Virginia law provided father with an adequate postdeprivation remedy for the loss of his appeal caused by the unauthorized closing of the J &amp; DR court clerk\u2019s office. \u201c[T]o determine whether a procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>due process violation has occurred, courts must consult the entire panoply of ... postdeprivation process provided by the state.\u201d <em>Fields v. Durham, </em>909 F.2d 94, 97 (4th Cir.1990) (citing <em>Zinermon, </em>494 U.S. at 126, 110 S.Ct. at 983). Our review of Virginia law revealed six avenues of relief potentially available to father\u2014(1) Code \u00a7 16.1-296(H), (2) Code \u00a7 16.1-114.1, (3) a writ of mandamus, (4) a mandatory injunction, (5) a claim for monetary damages under the Virginia Tort Claims Act, and (6) Code \u00a7 1-13.3:1. None of these potential avenues of relief could have remedied the loss of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">\n<em>Code \u00a7 16.1-296(H) and \u00a7 16.1-114.1</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Neither of the two narrow exceptions to the appeal bond requirement of Code \u00a7 16.1-296(H) was available to enable the circuit court to retain jurisdiction over father\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">Virginia jurisprudence regarding the procedures attendant to filing an appeal bond is \u201cclear, unequivocal, and emphatic.\u201d <em>Covington Virginian, Inc. v. Woods, </em>182 Va. 538, 543, 29 S.E.2d 406, 408 (1944). When applicable, the appeal bond requirement of Code \u00a7 16.1-296(H) is mandatory, and noncompliance with it is an incurable defect that deprives the circuit court of jurisdiction over the case. <em>See Walker, </em>253 Va. at 322, 485 S.E.2d at 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">Currently, the Code provides two narrow exceptions to the rule that compliance with the appeal bond requirement must be flawless in order to confer jurisdiction upon the circuit court. The first, which is implicit in Code \u00a7 16.1-296(H), occurs when a party is in \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the statutory requirements. <em>Cf. Brooks v. Epperson, </em>164 Va. 37, 43, 178 S.E. 787, 788 (1935) (stating that \u201csubstantial compliance with statutory [appeal bond] requirements is all that is necessary\u201d). The second, which is provided by Code \u00a7 16.1-114.1, occurs when the noncompliance with the statutory requirements is \u201ca mere defect, irregularity or omission in the proceedings in the district court, or in the form of any such pleading, [that] may be corrected by a proper order of the [circuit court].\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-114.1; <em>see Burks v. Three Hills </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number><em>Corp., </em>214 Va. 322, 323-24, 200 S.E.2d 521, 522 (1973); <em>Jenkins v. Bertram, </em>163 Va. 672, 674-75, 177 S.E. 204, 205 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Neither of these limited exceptions to the appeal bond requirement was available to remedy father\u2019s inability to file his appeal bond before the close of business on June 27. First, father\u2019s right to appeal could not be resuscitated on the ground that he substantially complied with Code \u00a7 16.1-296(H). The express, unambiguous language of Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014296(H) requires that the appeal bond be actually \u201cfiled\u201d with the J &amp; DR court within the prescribed time period. Based on the Virginia Supreme Court\u2019s strict application of the appeal bond requirement in prior cases, we cannot say father\u2019s actions in this case constituted substantial compliance with Code \u00a7 16.1-296(H). In <em>Brooks, </em>the Supreme Court held that filing an appeal bond without surety but with a certified check covering the amount of the judgment was not substantial compliance with the statutory requirement of \u201csufficient surety.\u201d <em>See Brooks, </em>164 Va. at 42-44, 178 S.E. at 789-90. In <em>Covington Virginian, Inc., </em>the Supreme Court held that filing an appeal bond without affixing the appellant\u2019s corporate seal was not substantial compliance even though \u201cthe executed instrument provided ample security for the payment of any judgment in [appelleej\u2019s favor, in that the [appellant] was bound by its written obligation and its surety could not ... deny its liability.\u201d <em>Covington Virginian, Inc., </em>182 Va. at 544, 29 S.E.2d at 409. In both cases, the instrument that was filed was adequate to satisfy the essential function of an appeal bond \u2014 \u201cto protect the [appellee] against any loss or damage he may sustain by reason of the suspension of his right to proceed with the collection of his judgment against the [appellant].\u201d <em>Jacob v. Commonwealth ex rel. Myers, </em>148 Va. 236, 242, 138 S.E. 574, 576 (1927). Nevertheless, in both cases, the appellants\u2019 noncompliance with technical requirements that had no effect on the instruments\u2019 ability to secure the appellees\u2019 judgments rendered the instruments inadequate to satisfy the apparently rigid standard of substantial compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">In this case, father arrived at the courthouse with appeal bond in hand two hours before the clerk\u2019s office was scheduled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>to close on the thirtieth day of the statutory period. However, because the clerk\u2019s office had closed early, he was unable to file his appeal bond with the clerk of the J <em>&amp; </em>DR court. Thus, we cannot say father \u201csubstantially complied\u201d with the requirement of Code \u00a7 16.1-296(H) that the appeal bond be <em>\u201cfiled </em>\u201d within thirty days of the entry of the J &amp; DR court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">In addition, the circuit court correctly concluded that Code \u00a7 16.1-114.1 could not be utilized to cure father\u2019s untimely filing of his appeal bond. The early closing of the J <em>&amp; </em>DR court clerk\u2019s office on the thirtieth day of the statutory period, even when unauthorized, is not among the \u201cirregularities\u201d covered by Code \u00a7 16.1-114.1. By its express terms, Code \u00a7 16.1-114.1 applies only to an \u201cirregularity <em>... in the proceedings </em>in the district court, or in the form of any such pleading.\u201d (Emphasis added); <em>cf. Hurst v. Ballard, </em>230 Va. 365, 367, 337 S.E.2d 284, 285 (1985) (stating that \u201cthe curative provisions of [Code \u00a7 16.1-114.1] ... cannot be used to correct jurisdictional defects\u201d); <em>Scheer v. Isaacs, </em>10 Va.App. 338, 342, 392 S.E.2d 201, 203 (1990) (stating that Code \u00a7 16.1-114.1 \u201cdoes not envision or authorize the exercise of discretion to excuse the total failure to comply with a mandatory statutory requirement for an appeal bond\u201d). As currently written, Code \u00a7 16.1-114.1 does not empower a circuit court to correct an irregularity in the day-to-day operations of a district court clerk\u2019s office that inadvertently causes an appellant to miss the statutory deadline for timely filing an appeal bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">\n<em>Writ of Mandamus</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Father could not obtain a writ of mandamus to remedy the loss of his right to appeal caused by the unauthorized early closing of the J &amp; DR court clerk\u2019s office on June 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">In this case, the \u201cdeprivation\u201d of father\u2019s right to appeal did not occur until he failed to file his appeal bond by 4:00 p.m. on June 27, the end of the J <em>&amp; </em>DR court\u2019s normal business hours. Thus, in order for a writ of mandamus to provide father with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>an adequate posfdeprivation remedy, father must have been able to obtain it <em>after </em>June 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">No writ of mandamus issued after June 27 could have restored father\u2019s right to appeal. \u201cMandamus is an extraordinary remedy which may be used to compel a public official to perform a purely ministerial duty that is imposed upon the official by law.\u201d <em>Town of Front Royal v. Front Royal and Warren County Indus. Park Corp., </em>248 Va. 581, 584, 449 S.E.2d 794, 796 (1994). However, the remedy provided by a writ of mandamus cannot be applied retroactively and is not available \u201cto correct action, however erroneous it may have been.\u201d <em>Board of Supervisors of Amherst County v. Combs, </em>160 Va. 487, 498, 169 S.E. 589, 593 (1933). In order to cure father\u2019s noncompliance with the filing requirement of Code \u00a7 16.1-296(H), the -writ would have to render father\u2019s bond \u201cfiled\u201d on or before June 27. But, any writ obtained by father after June 27 could have a <em>prospective </em>application only. <em>See id. </em>A writ of mandamus \u201cis not granted to undo an act already done.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Regardless of how erroneous the closing of the J &amp; DR court clerk\u2019s office on June 27 may have been, a writ of mandamus could not lie to retroactively correct this error.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Although, in theory, a writ of mandamus did lie on June 27 to compel the clerk\u2019s office to reopen before its official closing time of 4:00 p.m., appellant is not precluded from claiming that his appeal was terminated without due process solely because he failed to utilize this possible predeprivation remedy. As discussed previously, the deprivation in this case was caused by a random, unauthorized governmental act and not an established state procedure. The United States Supreme Court has held that, when a protected interest is deprived by \u201crandom, unauthorized conduct of a state employee,\u201d the state is not constitutionally required to provide any form of predeprivation procedure. <em>See Hudson, </em>468 U.S. at 533, 104 S.Ct. at 3203-04 (discussing the holding of Parratt). The Supreme Court reasoned that the Due Process Clause cannot impose such a requirement because, as a practical matter, \u201cthe state cannot know when such deprivations will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>occur.\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>468 U.S. at 533, 104 S.Ct. at 3203; <em>see also Parratt, </em>451 U.S. at 541, 101 S.Ct. at 1916 (stating that the Due Process Clause does not require predeprivation process for deprivations caused by unauthorized conduct because the state \u201ccannot predict precisely when the loss will occur\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtJy\">In situations where the State feasibly can provide a predeprivation hearing before taking property, it generally must do so regardless of the adequacy of a postdeprivation tort remedy to compensate for the taking. Conversely, in situations where a predeprivation hearing is unduly burdensome in proportion to the liberty interest at stake or where the State is truly unable to anticipate and prevent a random deprivation of a liberty interest, postdeprivation remedies might satisfy due process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-5\"><em>Zinermon, </em>494 U.S. at 132, 110 S.Ct. at 987 (citations omitted). When a deprivation of a protected interest is caused by a random, unauthorized governmental act, the victimized citizen is in a position similar to that of the state. Like the state, a citizen is unable to predict when such deprivations will occur. Just as the state is required to provide predeprivation procedures only when feasible, citizens whose protected interests are lost in this manner should not be deemed to have waived their right to postdeprivation process by failing to seek theoretical predeprivation remedies that a reasonable person would consider unobtainable as a practical matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">In this case, father could not reasonably have expected to obtain a writ of mandamus in the two hours remaining before the J &amp; DR court clerk\u2019s office officially closed for the day. The procedural requirements for obtaining such a writ, particularly the notice requirement of Code \u00a7 8.01-644, made obtaining this remedy impossible as a practical matter in this short period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">\n<em>Mandatory Injunction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">A mandatory injunction could not have remedied the loss of father\u2019s appeal after it was deprived by the unauthorized closing of the clerk\u2019s office on June 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>In a proceeding in equity, a circuit court has the power to \u201cinterfere by injunction with the performance of a ministerial act of a public officer under a valid statute [when] the manner of performance is in violation of the law or is contrary to plain, official duty.\u201d <em>Yoder v.

Through such a suit, a court can compel the government official to restore in the future the right that was illegally withdrawn. <em>See Vaughan, </em>196 Va. at 153, 82 S.E.2d at 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">A mandatory injunction could not help father in this case. Unlike in <em>Vaughan, </em>the state actor responsible for the deprivation of father\u2019s right to appeal has no authority to restore it. The party responsible for the closure of the clerk\u2019s office on June 27 could not be legally ordered to do anything that could effect the restoration of father\u2019s right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Because father\u2019s right to appeal was terminated when he failed to file his appeal bond on June 27, the only mandatory injunction that could conceivably restore father\u2019s right to appeal would be one compelling the J &amp; DR court to treat father\u2019s appeal bond as if it was filed on that date. Such an injunction would effectively order the J &amp; DR court to make a nunc pro <em>tunc </em>entry in the record of father\u2019s case indicating that his appeal bond was filed on June 27 rather than July 3. However, such an injunction could not be issued because it would require the J &amp; DR court to exceed the scope of its power to enter <em>nunc pro tunc </em>orders. The inherent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>power of a court to correct clerical errors in the record \u201cis restricted to placing upon the record evidence of judicial action which has actually been taken\u201d and does not extend \u201cto showing] what the court should have done as distinguished from what actually occurred.\u201d <em>Council v. Commonwealth, </em>198 Va. 288, 292, 94 S.E.2d 245, 248 (1956).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">[T]he purpose of a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>entry is to correct mistakes of the clerk or other court officials, or to settle defects or omissions in the record so as to make the record show what actually took place. It is not the function of such entry by a fiction to antedate the actual performance of an act which never occurred, to represent an event as occurring at a date prior to the time of the actual event, \u201cor to make the record show that which never existed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 293, 94 S.E.2d at 248 (citation omitted). A <em>nunc pro tunc </em>entry by the J &amp; DR court that it received father\u2019s appeal bond on June 27 rather than July 3 would be improper because it would create a fiction that father filed his appeal with the clerk\u2019s office on a date before he actually did so. <em>Cf. Holley v. City of Newport News, </em>6 Va.App. 567, 569, 370 S.E.2d 320, 321 (1988). It is axiomatic that no court can issue an injunction compelling the performance of an unlawful act. Because the only mandatory injunction that could restore father\u2019s right to appeal would compel the chief judge to enter an unlawful <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order, this remedy could not be utilized by father to obtain postdeprivation relief for the loss of this right.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Furthermore, it was just as impractical for father to seek a mandatory injunction after he discovered the closing of the clerk\u2019s office at 2:00 p.m. on June 27 as it was for him to petition for a writ of mandamus. Although a preliminary injunction may be obtained through an ex parte proceeding, <em>see Cohen v. Rosen, </em>157 Va. 71, 75-76, 160 S.E. 36, 37 (1931) (holding that the notice requirement of now-Code \u00a7 8.01-329 is discretionary when necessary to prevent threatened and irreparable damage), we cannot say that having a request for such an injunction adjudicated by a circuit court and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>court\u2019s order executed before the 4:00 p.m. filing deadline passed was a realistic probability. This theoretical predeprivation remedy was not sufficiently practicable under the circumstances presented to father so as to provide him with a meaningful opportunity to prevent the termination of his appeal by the unauthorized closing of the J &amp; DR court clerk\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">\n<em>Virginia Tort Claims Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The Virginia Tort Claims Act (\u201cAct\u201d) also fails to provide father an adequate postdeprivation remedy for the loss of his right to appeal the J &amp; DR court\u2019s decision. Any claim brought by father for the loss of his appeal would be excluded from recovery under the Act because the early closing of the J &amp; DR court on June 27 was the act of a court. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-195.3(3) (expressly excluding compensation of any claims \u201cbased upon an act or omission of any court of the Commonwealth ... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">Moreover, even assuming that father\u2019s claim was not excluded from recovery, the sole remedy available to father under the Act, a claim for \u201cmoney,\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-195.3, is not adequate to compensate him for the nature of his loss \u2014 his inability to appeal a determination regarding which custody and support arrangement is in the best interests of his children. Attempting to redress the loss of this property interest through a suit for monetary damages would be a lengthy and speculative process. <em>Cf. Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., </em>455 U.S. 422, 436-37, 102 S.Ct. 1148, 1158, 71 L.Ed.2d 265 (1982). Furthermore, because the remedies available under the Act do not include reinstatement of a deprived right to appeal, even a suit that successfully established the Commonwealth\u2019s liability could not fully vindicate father\u2019s interest in having the circuit court review his claim that the J &amp; DR court\u2019s decision was not in the best interests of his children. <em>Cf. id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>5.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">\n<em>Code \u00a7 1-13.3:1</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AZD\">Finally, father could not utilize the extension of filing periods provided by Code \u00a7 1-13.8:1 for \u201cauthorized\u201d closings of clerks\u2019 offices.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Code \u00a7 1-13.3:1 extends the filing period for appeal bonds by one day when the clerk\u2019s office is closed \u201cas authorized by statute\u201d on the last day of the filing period. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8V\"><em>When the last day fixed by statute, </em>or by rule of the Supreme Court of Virginia for the commencement of any proceeding, <em>for any paper to be </em>served, delivered, or <em>filed, </em>or for any other act to be done in the course of judicial proceedings <em>falls on </em>a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday, or <em>any day on which the clerk\u2019s office is closed as authorized by statute, </em>the proceeding may be commenced, <em>the paper may be </em>served, delivered or <em>filed </em>and the act may be done <em>on the next day that is not a </em>Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday or <em>day on which the clerk\u2019s office is closed as authorized by statute.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Code \u00a7 1-13.3:1 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">By its terms, the statute was not intended to remedy the situation that confronted father on June 27. Code \u00a7 1-13.3:1 expressly states that it applies only when the closing of a clerk\u2019s office is \u201cauthorized by statute.\u201d As previously discussed, the early closing of the J &amp; DR court clerk\u2019s office on June 27 was unauthorized. The General Assembly intended to limit the application of Code \u00a7 1-13.3:1 to authorized closings of clerk\u2019s offices apparently because a litigant can reasonably expect such a clerk\u2019s office to reopen on the next business day in accordance with the law. Such an expectation does not exist when the closing of a clerk\u2019s office on the last day of a filing period is both unexpected and unauthorized. If Code \u00a7 1-13.3:1 applied to unauthorized closings of clerks\u2019 offices, a clerk\u2019s office could string litigants along by closing early on consecutive days and requiring those needing access to the office to return day-after-day until they found the office open. As long as a particular court paper was filed on the next day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>that the offending clerk\u2019s office decided to operate in accordance with the law, due process would be satisfied. The unambiguous language of the statute indicates that the General Assembly did not intend for Code \u00a7 1-13.3:1 to be utilized to promote such an abuse of authority by those responsible for administering justice in the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Because the early closing of the J &amp; DR court clerk\u2019s office on June 27 was an unauthorized governmental act that caused father to lose his right to appeal and because Virginia law currently provides no adequate postdeprivation remedy for the loss of this constitutionally protected property interest, father\u2019s right to appeal was deprived without due process of law. As such, the circuit court erred when it overruled father\u2019s exception, and we reverse its order dismissing his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">Regarding the remedy in this case, the record indicates that the appeal bond tendered by father on July 3 was in an appropriate amount and that it was accepted by the J &amp; DR court and transferred to the circuit court. In light of these facts, we remand this case to the circuit court with instructions to proceed as if father timely satisfied the appeal bond requirement of Code \u00a7 16.1-296(H).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-10\">.
