Barker (husband) appeals the order of the trial court granting him a divorce from Nancy J. Barker (wife) on the basis that the trial court erred in determining the spousal support and equitable distribution awards. Specifically, husband argues that the court overestimated his earning capacity for purposes of spousal support, improperly applied the tracing doctrine, and failed to properly consider the statutory factors in determining equitable distribution. We affirm in part and reverse in part.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Husband and wife were married on December 10, 1978. Wife\u2019s three children from a previous marriage lived with the parties for a number of years. At the time of the marriage, husband owed his former spouse over $50,000 in spousal support, payable over a period of ten years. Although wife did not work outside the home for the majority of the marriage, both parties contributed funds to buy their first marital home. During the marriage, husband was employed as an upper management business executive.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Husband admits that he committed adultery during the period 1986-1989. After husband told wife of the affair in 1989, the two reconciled and joined an adultery self-help group. In 1990 or 1991, wife discovered evidence that husband had resumed his affair. After her discovery, wife moved out of the marital bedroom, although she remained in the marital home. Husband lost his job in May 1991, although he continued to receive income from his position until May 1992. On January 30, 1993, husband moved out of the marital home, and wife filed for divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The trial court referred the case to a commissioner, who held hearings and filed a report. After the parties filed exceptions to the commissioner\u2019s report, the trial court issued a letter opinion sustaining husband\u2019s exception as to the commissioner\u2019s recommendation for spousal support and related issues and overruling most of husband\u2019s exceptions. After holding an evidentiary hearing, the court awarded wife less spousal support than recommended by the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Spousal Support</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">After taking evidence as to the past and present circumstances of the parties, the commissioner to whom the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>case had been referred noted that, \u201c[w]hile husband is currently unemployed, the commissioner feels that he has the ability to be employed at an income which would warrant an award of spousal support to wife of $2,000.00 per month.\u201d The trial court elected not to follow the commissioner\u2019s recommendation, and held additional hearings on the issue of spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">In its letter opinion of July 17, 1996, the trial court noted that husband, age 62, had been temporarily employed at a rate of $75,000 per year from August 1995 to October 1995, but that husband had virtually no income for 1994, and was currently unemployed. The court also noted that husband had attended real estate school, had obtained a Virginia real estate license, had taken the necessary steps to obtain a New Jersey real estate license, and \u201choped\u201d to earn $2,000 per month. The court explained that wife, in her fifties, earned $300 per week designing jewelry, had been diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome, and could earn a maximum of $25,000 per year as a secretary. The court concluded, \u201c[ljooking first at the considerable resources the parties have resulting from equitable distribution and the pertinent factors under \u00a7 20-107.1 according to the evidence, the court will require that husband pay to the wife ... the sum of $600.00 per month.\u201d The trial court did not find that either party was voluntarily underemployed or unemployed, and did not impute income to husband or wife. Husband argues that the trial court erred in ordering him to pay spousal support to wife because he has no income, actual or imputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Whether and how much spousal support will be awarded is a matter of discretion for the trial court. <em>Jennings v. Jennings, </em>12 Va.App. 1187, 1196, 409 S.E.2d 8, 14 (1991) (citing <em>McGuire v. McGuire, </em>10 Va.App. 248, 251, 391 S.E.2d 344, 347 (1990)). Code \u00a7 20-107.1 requires a court \u201cto consider the circumstances and factors which contributed to the dissolution of the marriage, specifically including adultery,\u201d in determining whether to make an award of spousal support. If the court determines that an award should be made, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>is required to consider all the factors outlined in Code \u00a7 20-107.1. <em>See Rowe v. Rowe, </em>24 Va.App. 123, 139, 480 S.E.2d 760, 767 (1997) (citing <em>Woolley v. Woolley, </em>3 Va.App. 337, 344, 349 S.E.2d 422, 426 (1986)). Among the other statutory factors, the trial court must evaluate the earning capacity of both parties. <em>See Stumbo v. Stumbo, </em>20 Va.App. 685, 691, 460 S.E.2d 591, 594 (1995) (citing <em>Goetz v. Goetz, </em>7 Va.App. 50, 51, 371 S.E.2d 567, 567 (1988)) (requiring the trial court to consider earning capacity); <em>Srinivasan v. Srinivasan, </em>10 Va.App. 728, 734, 396 S.E.2d 675, 679 (1990) (citing <em>McGuire, </em>10 Va.App. at 251, 391 S.E.2d at 347) (emphasizing that the court must consider the earning capacity of both the payor and payee spouse).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Code \u00a7 20-107.1, like its predecessor Code \u00a7 20-107, authorizes courts \u201cto consider not only earnings but also \u2018earning capacity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jacobs v. Jacobs, </em>219 Va. 993, 995, 254 S.E.2d 56, 58 (1979). \u201cAlthough \u2018earning capacity\u2019 necessarily includes actual earnings, it is a broader concept that allows the trial court to consider more than actual earnings.\u201d <em>Frazer v. Frazer, </em>23 Va.App. 358, 378, 477 S.E.2d 290, 300 (1996). The spousal support award, however, \u201cmust be based upon the circumstances in existence at the time of the award.\u201d <em>Payne v. Payne, </em>5 Va.App. 359, 363, 363 S.E.2d 428, 430 (1987). The relevant time period includes the immediate past, <em>Stubblebine v. Stubblebine, </em>22 Va.App. 703, 709, 473 S.E.2d 72, 75 (1996) <em>(en </em>banc), as well as the \u201c \u2018immediate or reasonably foreseeable future.\u2019 \u201d <em>Srinivasan, </em>10 Va.App. at 735, 396 S.E.2d at 679 (quoting <em>Young v. Young, </em>3 Va.App. 80, 81-82, 348 S.E.2d 46, 47 (1986)). A spousal support award may not be \u201cpremised upon the occurrence of an uncertain future circumstance.\u201d <em>Jacobs, </em>219 Va. at 995-96, 254 S.E.2d at 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">We view the evidence in the light most favorable to wife, the prevailing party below. <em>Cook v. Cook, </em>18 Va.App. 726, 731, 446 S.E.2d 894, 896 (1994) (citing <em>Steinberg v. Steinberg, </em>11 Va.App. 323, 325, 398 S.E.2d 507, 508 (1990)). So viewed, the evidence supports the court\u2019s assessment of each of the parties\u2019 earning capacity. The court heard testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>mony that since the separation, wife had worked at a number of low-paying jobs. Wife\u2019s most recent job prior to the separation had been in 1986, and she had attempted but failed to bring her typing and accounting skills up to date. Wife had been diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome in 1980, and had four bones in her hands surgically fused together. At the time of the hearing, wife was performing piecework jewelry design, for which she was'paid up to $300 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The court also heard evidence that husband received his real estate license in January 1995, joined Coldwell Banker real estate company, and earned $8,497 in 1995 before taking a ninety-day position with One Call Medical. Husband worked for One Call Medical until February 12,1996, where he earned approximately $6,000 per month. At the time of the hearing, husband had passed the New Jersey real estate examination, rejoined Coldwell Banker, and had been in training for three weeks. As a real estate agent, husband hoped to earn $2,000 per month selling real estate. This evidence supports the findings of the court, and the court did not abuse its discretion in fashioning a spousal support award of $600 per month based on this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Husband also alleges that the trial court required him to use his portion of the equitable distribution award to pay spousal support. Code \u00a7 20-107.1(8) requires the trial court to consider \u201c[t]he provisions made with regard to the marital property under \u00a7 20-107.3\u201d in fashioning spousal support. As husband argues, however, it is improper for a trial court to treat assets divided in equitable distribution as income. <em>Ray v. Ray, </em>4 Va.App. 509, 514, 358 S.E.2d 754, 757 (1987); <em>see, e.g., Dotson v. Dotson, </em>24 Va.App. 40, 44, 480 S.E.2d 131, 132-33 (1997) (describing the \u201c \u2018distinct difference ... between a spousal support award and a monetary award\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Brown v. Brown, </em>5 Va.App. 238, 246, 361 S.E.2d 364, 368 (1987))). \u201c[A] decree which singles out this factor [regarding distribution of the marital property] to the exclusion of others, and which essentially treats the ... spouse\u2019s marital assets as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>income, cannot withstand scrutiny on appeal.\u201d <em>Zipf v. Zipf, </em>8 Va.App. 387, 399, 382 S.E.2d 263, 270 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The trial court did not abuse its discretion in fashioning the spousal support award. It is important to note that the trial court\u2019s decision turns on husband\u2019s earning capacity rather than imputed income or principal or income from the distribution. The trial court\u2019s letter opinion of July 17, 1996, reveals that the trial court gave primary consideration to the age and earning capacity of the parties. The court reviewed the current earnings and earning prospects of the parties, and considered the testimony of husband, wife, and the vocational expert. The court also considered the expenses claimed by each party. Finally, the court stated that it had considered \u201cthe pertinent factors under \u00a7 20-107.1.\u201d We find that the trial court properly considered the age, expenses, distribution of assets, and earning capacity of the parties, as well as other statutory factors, in fashioning the spousal support award, and thus acted within its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Classification of Property</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">The trial court affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision to trace the contributions of both parties to the first marital home and award both parties a credit for their contributions. The commissioner recommended that \u201cthe proceeds should be divided equally with offsets to each party for their contribution of separate property when the cycle of home buying began in 1978.\u201d The commissioner recommended a credit of $23,500 for husband and a credit of $50,061 for wife to reflect each party\u2019s separate contributions to the purchase of the first marital home on John Drive. Husband excepted to this recommendation, arguing that wife could not trace $20,061 of the $50,000 she was credited to the separate contribution she made to the purchase of the marital property and that he could trace an additional $20,000 as his separate property.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">In affirming the finding of the commissioner, the trial court agreed with wife that, apart from the $23,500, \u201cany other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>contributions cannot be traced directly from 1978 to the current equities or properties of the parties.\u201d The court found, \u201c[t]here is no direct tracing evidence resulting from this sale [of the John Drive home] to the present asset picture to mandate or require any additional credit where there might otherwise be on actual value tracing to current assets.\u201d The court went on to note \u201cthat the proceeds from the sale of the parties\u2019 home in Richmond cannot be directly traced to a specific source [because] the many prior sale proceeds from other homes purchased during the marriage and the commingling of other funds[ ] mak[e] tracing difficult if not impossible.\u201d The trial court concluded that wife\u2019s credit was justified because all of her contribution went to pay marital bills, even though $20,061 was not used to purchase the first marital residence or other identifiable asset.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">A commissioner\u2019s findings of fact which have been accepted by the trial court \u201care presumed to be correct when reviewed on appeal and are to be given \u2018great weight\u2019 by this Court. The findings will not be reversed on appeal unless plainly wrong.\u201d <em>Rowe, </em>24 Va.App. at 140, 480 S.E.2d at 768 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">According to Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(e), \u201c[w]hen marital property and separate property are commingled into newly acquired property resulting in the loss of identity of the contributing properties, the commingled property shall be deemed transmuted to marital property,\u201d unless the contributed property is retraceable and not a gift. We have explained the requirements of tracing under Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">In order to trace the separate portion of hybrid property, a party must prove that the claimed separate portion is identifiably derived from a separate asset. This process involves two steps: a party must (1) establish the identity of a portion of hybrid property and (2) directly trace that portion to a separate asset.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-8\"><em>Rahbaran v. Rahbaran, </em>26 Va.App. 195, 207, 494 S.E.2d 135, 141 (1997) (citing Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(d)-(f)). \u201c[T]he party claiming a separate interest in transmuted property bears the burden of proving retraceability.\u201d <em>von Raab v. von Raab, </em>26 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Va. App. 239, 248, 494 S.E.2d 156, 160 (1997) (citing Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(2)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Assuming without deciding that husband\u2019s $20,000 contribution was separate property when he acquired it, we hold that the trial court did not err in finding that husband failed to present sufficient evidence of tracing to establish his claim that he should be awarded $20,000 as his separate property.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to wife, husband cannot establish the separate identity of any portion of the hybrid property, or directly trace the claimed separate portion to his original contribution of separate property. In <em>Rowe, </em>24 Va.App. at 136, 480 S.E.2d at 766; <em>von Raab, </em>26 Va.App. at 249, 494 S.E.2d at 161; and <em>Rahbaran, </em>26 Va.App. at 209-10, 494 S.E.2d at 142, we addressed the question of \u201cmultiple source tracing,\u201d in which marital and separate property are combined to acquire a single piece of hybrid property. <em>See </em>Brett R. Turner, <em>Equitable Distribution of Property </em>266 (1994). This case, in addition, presents the additional problem of \u201cmultiple destination tracing,\u201d in which only a portion of hybrid property is used to acquire or invest in additional properties, either simultaneously or successively. <em>Id. </em>at 268. To determine whether a party\u2019s separate property can be retraced under such circumstances, courts have adopted widely varying approaches to address the character of withdrawals from hybrid accounts. <em>See </em>J. Thomas Oldham, <em>Tracing, Commingling, and Transmutation, </em>23 Family L.Q. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>219, 230-33 (1989) (describing approaches). Whatever approach. is used, it is clear that in the absence of sufficient evidence establishing the identity of separate funds throughout the multiple investments and withdrawals, the asset in question must be deemed marital. <em>Rahbaran, </em>26 Va.App. at 208-09, 494 S.E.2d at 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">During the time in which the funds used to purchase the houses were placed in various bank and investment accounts, the parties continued to conduct withdrawal and deposit transactions on the accounts. The record contains numerous gaps in recording the simultaneous and sequential uses of the funds husband seeks to trace. The evidence showed that husband contributed the claimed $20,000 to the first marital home in Wheeling, Illinois. Similarly, wife contributed the proceeds of the sale of her separate townhouse to the purchase of the Wheeling house. The parties subsequently placed the proceeds of the sale of the Wheeling home into an account along with the parties\u2019 paychecks, and subsequently invested a portion of the money from the account in a home in Freeland, Michigan. The record does not reveal what proportion of the money in the account represented the proceeds of the Wheeling home, and what proportion represented the parties\u2019 paychecks. When the parties sold the house in Freeland, Michigan, unspecified proceeds of the sale went into an account identified as a predecessor to the parties\u2019 Merrill Lynch Cash Management Account (CMA), which also contained an unknown amount of other marital funds. The parties moved to London, England, and then back to Connecticut. Upon their return to the United States, the parties used a portion of the money in the parties\u2019 CMA to purchase a house in Westport, Connecticut. The record does not establish the proportion of money in the CMA which represents the proceeds of the sale of the Freeland home.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The parties sold the Westport house and used at least some of the proceeds to buy a house in McLean, Virginia, the precise amount of which was not established at trial. During the same time period, the parties also owned a house in Bloomfield, Michigan, although it is unclear what funds were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>used to purchase the Bloomfield house. The parties sold both the McLean and Bloomfield houses, and used proceeds in the amount of $500,000 as a down payment on the Richmond, Virginia home owned at the time of separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Thus, the record makes clear that husband presented insufficient evidence from which the court could determine the identity of his separate funds, and distinguish them from the marital property in the hybrid asset, <em>viz., </em>the parties\u2019 last house in Richmond. Therefore, \u201c \u2018the unknown amount contributed from the separate source transmutes by commingling and becomes marital property.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rahbaran, </em>26 Va.App. at 208-09, 494 S.E.2d at 141 (quoting Turner, <em>supra, </em>at 268); <em>see also Minter v. Minter, </em>111 N.C.App. 321, 432 S.E.2d 720, 725 (1993) (holding that party did not carry his burden to trace transactions made on a marital account).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Applying the same tracing principles to the classification of wife\u2019s contribution, we hold that wife\u2019s evidence of tracing does not support the court\u2019s award to her in the amount of $20,061.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The evidence revealed, and the commissioner noted, that wife contributed $20,061 of the $50,061 credit to pay unspecified \u201cmarital bills.\u201d The evidence fails to establish that wife contributed these funds toward the value of an identifiable asset, or to the acquisition of an identifiable asset. In short, wife has not pointed to any separate or hybrid asset owned at the time of separation to which she claims the $20,061 of her separate funds may be traced. Accordingly, the trial court erred in identifying this portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>wife\u2019s contribution as separate. <em>Rahbaran, </em>26 Va.App. at 208, 494 S.E.2d at 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Equitable Distribution Award</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The trial court affirmed the commissioner\u2019s rulings on the issue of equitable distribution, and issued a final decree setting out the terms of the equitable distribution. Husband contends that the commissioner and court erred in their consideration of the statutory factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">A commissioner\u2019s findings of fact which have been accepted by the trial court \u201care presumed to be correct when reviewed on appeal and are to be given \u2018great weight\u2019 by this Court. The findings will not be reversed on appeal unless plainly wrong.\u201d <em>Rowe, </em>24 Va.App. at 140, 480 S.E.2d at 768 (citations omitted). The amount and form of any equitable distribution award \u201care matters committed to the sound discretion of the trial court, [but] \u2018any division or award must be based on the parties\u2019 equities, rights and interests in the property.\u2019 \u201d <em>Theismann v. Theismann, </em>22 Va.App. 557, 565, 471 S.E.2d 809, 812 (1996) (quoting <em>Alphin v. Alphin, </em>15 Va.App. 395, 403, 424 S.E.2d 572, 577 (1992)), <em>aff'd, </em>23 Va.App. 697, 479 S.E.2d 534 (1996) <em>(en banc) </em>(mem.). In fashioning an equitable distribution award, the trial court must consider each of the statutory factors, but may determine what weight to assign to each of them. <em>Booth v. Booth, </em>7 Va.App. 22, 28, 371 S.E.2d 569, 573 (1988). In challenging the court\u2019s decision on appeal, the party seeking reversal bears the burden to demonstrate error on the part of the trial court. <em>D'Agnese v. D'Agnese, </em>22 Va.App. 147, 153, 468 S.E.2d 140, 143 (1996) (citing <em>Lutes v. Alexander, </em>14 Va.App. 1075, 1077, 421 S.E.2d 857, 859 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">Consideration of Husband\u2019s Support for Former Spouse and for Wife\u2019s Children</p>\n<p id=\"AiP\">Husband contends that the trial court erred in giving consideration to his use of at least $50,000 of marital funds to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>make court-ordered support payments to a former spouse. Husband also contends that the court failed to consider his support for wife\u2019s children during the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Husband brought approximately $50,250 in intangible personal property into the marriage. Husband argued that he should receive a greater portion of the intangible property than the principal owned at the time of marriage because of the earning record of the funds, while wife argued that husband\u2019s share of the intangible property should be reduced by the spousal support paid by husband to his former wife during the marriage, which totalled more than $50,000. The trial court found that the funds husband brought into the marriage were transmuted by commingling into marital property, and could not be treated as his separate property as they could not be traced to a current asset. Thus, in fashioning a monetary award which reflected this contribution, the trial court was guided by the statutory factors for equitable distribution of marital property set forth in Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E). In considering the statutory factors, the court, <em>inter alia, </em>balanced husband\u2019s monetary contributions to the marriage against his use of marital funds to support his former spouse, and awarded husband $44,856 for the intangible personal property, with the remainder of the assets divided equally.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The specific question to be addressed by this Court is whether the payment of separate debt with marital funds may be considered by the trial court as a factor in fashioning, an equitable distribution award. We hold that the court may, in the exercise of its discretion, consider payment of separate debt with marital funds in fashioning an equitable distribution award.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">While the specific question husband raises is a matter of first impression in Virginia, the principles underlying its resolution are well established. It is beyond dispute that the trial court is required to consider all the factors set forth in Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E) in determining the amount of any monetary award and the division of marital property. <em>See, e.g., Taylor v. Taylor, </em>5 Va.App. 436, 444, 364 S.E.2d 244, 249 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>(1988). Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E)(2) requires the court to consider \u201c[t]he contributions, monetary and nonmonetary, of each party in the acquisition and care and maintenance of [the] marital property of the parties.\u201d \u201c[Circumstances that affect the [marital] partnership\u2019s economic condition are factors that must be considered for purposes of our equitable distribution scheme.\u201d <em>Aster, </em>7 Va.App. at 5, 371 S.E.2d at 836. This Court has made clear that both affirmative and negative monetary contributions to the marital partnership are to be considered. <em>See, e.g., O\u2019Loughlin v. O\u2019Loughlin, </em>20 Va.App. 522, 526, 458 S.E.2d 323, 325 (1995); <em>Traylor v. Traylor, </em>19 Va.App. 761, 766, 454 S.E.2d 744, 747 (1995). Indeed, there appears to be general agreement with this principle. Turner, <em>supra, </em>at 565. Those contributions which impact on the value of the marital estate have been of particular concern to this Court. <em>O\u2019Loughlin, </em>20 Va.App. at 528, 458 S.E.2d at 326; <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>18 Va.App. 427, 431, 444 S.E.2d 269, 273 (1994); <em>Gamer v. Gamer, </em>16 Va.App. 335, 341, 429 S.E.2d 618, 623 (1993); <em>Aster, </em>7 Va.App. at 5-6, 371 S.E.2d at 836. A court need not find waste in order to consider negative contributions in fashioning an equitable distribution award. <em>See O\u2019Loughlin, </em>20 Va.App. at 528, 458 S.E.2d at 326; <em>cf. Booth, </em>7 Va.App. at 29, 371 S.E.2d at 573 (holding that unpaid attorneys\u2019 fees constitute debt which the trial court properly considered in fashioning equitable distribution award although the debt was not waste).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">In dual classification states such as Virginia, the use of marital funds for non-marital purposes can be considered as a factor in determining an equitable distribution award. Turner, <em>supra, </em>at 572. For example, where marital funds are used to pay the separate debts of one of the parties, a court may properly consider that fact as a negative monetary contribution to the marital property. <em>Adams v. Adams, </em>115 N.C.App. 168, 443 S.E.2d 780, 781 (1994) (\u201cA reduction in the separate debt of a party to a marriage, caused by the expenditure of marital funds ... is properly considered as a distributional factor.. -..\u201d); <em>Fenske v. Fenske, </em>542 N.W.2d 98, 102-03 (N.D.1996) (holding that trial court did not err in considering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>husband\u2019s premarital debts paid off during the marriage with commingled funds in the equitable distribution award). In addition, we have found that support obligations arising from a prior marriage may constitute such a separate debt. <em>Hayes v. Hayes, </em>21 Va.App. 515, 519, 465 S.E.2d 590, 592 (1996) (finding that debt incurred to pay child support to a former spouse was separate debt); <em>see Orlandi v. Orlandi, </em>23 Va.App. 21, 29, 473 S.E.2d 716, 720 (1996) (indicating that a new spouse is not required to support the other spouse\u2019s children), <em>reh\u2019g en banc granted, appeal withdrawn </em>(1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Based on Virginia\u2019s statutory scheme and the cases which have applied it, we hold that the trial court could properly consider husband\u2019s use of marital funds to pay his prior support obligations as a negative monetary contribution in fashioning its equitable distribution award. <em>Accord Dobbyn v. Dobbyn, </em>57 Md.App. 662, 471 A.2d 1068, 1076-78 (1984); <em>Jensen v. Jensen, </em>877 S.W.2d 131, 135 (Mo.Ct.App.1994); <em>McGee v.

Consideration of the use of marital funds to pay separate debt, such as support to a former spouse, properly falls under the trial court\u2019s consideration of the statutory factors. As such, this case does not turn on the application of the doctrine of \u201cwaste.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In short, under Virginia\u2019s statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>scheme, which encompasses broad directives to the trial court to consider the parties\u2019 monetary and nonmonetary contributions to the marital estate, the trial court properly considered husband\u2019s use of marital funds to pay support to his former spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Husband also contends that the commissioner failed to consider his support for wife\u2019s children by a prior marriage in determining the equitable distribution. After the parties married, they supported three of wife\u2019s children and one of husband\u2019s children in the marital home. The trial court concluded that the commissioner considered husband\u2019s support of wife\u2019s children under Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E)(10), the so-called \u201ccatchall\u201d factor, notwithstanding the absence of any reference to the factor in the commissioner\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The court could consider husband\u2019s support for wife\u2019s children pursuant to two statutory provisions: (1) as a \u201ccontribution[ ], monetary and nonmonetary, of each party to the well-being of the family\u201d; and (2) as an \u201cother factor[ ] as the court deems necessary or appropriate to consider in order to arrive at a fair and equitable monetary award.\u201d Code \u00a7 20\u2014107.3(E)(1), (10); <em>accord Cox v. Cox, </em>882 P.2d 909, 920 (Alaska 1994) (citing <em>Burcell v. Burcell, </em>713 P.2d 802, 805 (Alaska 1986)). Husband\u2019s contribution to support for wife\u2019s children, however, need only be considered under the factors outlined in Code \u00a7 20-107.3; he is not entitled to a dollar-for-dollar credit for contributions he may have made. <em>See Ellington v. Ellington, </em>8 Va.App. 48, 56, 378 S.E.2d 626, 630 (1989). The commissioner heard evidence on husband\u2019s support for wife\u2019s children, and the trial court ruled that the commissioner had considered this factor. Husband does not point to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>evidence that this conclusion is unjustified or unsupported by the record, and we find none.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Consideration of Fault</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\"> Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-107.1 and 20-107.3 require a court to consider \u201cthe circumstances and factors which contributed to the dissolution of the marriage,\u201d including adultery, in determining an equitable distribution award. A party claiming adultery by the other party must prove it by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Seemann v. Seemann, </em>233 Va. 290, 293, 355 S.E.2d 884, 886 (1987). Condonation of adultery nullifies the legal effect of the adultery, but \u201c[c]ondoned adultery is revived where the guilty party resumes his association with his paramour.\u201d <em>Cutlip v. Cutlip, </em>8 Va.App. 618, 621, 383 S.E.2d 273, 275 (1989) (citing <em>McKee v. McKee, </em>206 Va. 527, 532, 145 S.E.2d 163, 166 (1965)).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">In <em>Aster, </em>7 Va.App. at 5-6, 371 S.E.2d at 836-37, this Court held that a trial court must consider fault in terms of its economic impact on the marital estate. In <em>O\u2019Loughlin, </em>20 Va.App. at 528, 458 S.E.2d at 326, however, we held that a court may consider a party\u2019s negative nonmonetary contributions to a marriage arising out of- his or her adultery regardless of its economic impact. We also \u201creaffirmed our holding in <em>Aster </em>that fault could not be used as a \u2018wild card\u2019 to justify an otherwise arbitrary award.\u201d <em>Theismann, </em>22 Va.App. at 569, 471 S.E.2d at 815 (citing <em>O\u2019Loughlin, </em>20 Va.App. at 528, 458 S.E.2d at 326).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">The commissioner found that husband committed adultery during the marriage. The commissioner stated that he had considered the relevant statutory factors in fashioning the equitable distribution award, but did not explicitly rely on the finding of adultery in explaining the award. The trial court granted a divorce on the basis that the parties lived separate and apart for more than one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>After husband excepted to the commissioner\u2019s finding, the trial court reviewed the issue of adultery. The court affirmed the commissioner\u2019s finding, explaining the evidence supported the commissioner\u2019s finding that \u201cthe earlier condonation was eliminated by later conduct even though the later affair may have extended to the time the parties had become separated.\u201d The court also noted that the evidence supported a finding that \u201cwife was reasonably suspect that relations with the first paramour had resumed, contributing to the dissolution of the marriage.\u201d The court stated that although the adultery did not have direct economic impact, the commissioner could consider the adultery as a negative nonmonetary contribution to the marriage, \u201cif indeed he did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Husband argues that the evidence showed that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of uncondoned adultery and that the court should not have considered his adultery for economic impact or as a negative nonmonetary contribution. We do not reach the question of the sufficiency of the evidence because we conclude that the commissioner and trial court did not base their equitable distribution award on husband\u2019s adultery. The commissioner and trial court both referred to the evidence of husband\u2019s adultery, but did not explicitly base any distribution decision on husband\u2019s adultery; upon noting that both parties had made nonmonetary contributions to the marriage, the commissioner merely mentioned that husband had committed adultery during the marriage. In turn, the trial court noted that the commissioner could consider husband\u2019s adultery as a negative nonmonetary contribution under <em>O\u2019Loughlin, </em>but expressed skepticism that the commissioner had actually done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">In the absence of a specific finding by the commissioner or trial court that husband\u2019s adultery affected the distribution of assets, we will not presume that the court improperly relied on husband\u2019s adultery. <em>See Pommerenke v. Pommerenke, </em>7 Va.App. 241, 251, 372 S.E.2d 630, 635 (1988) (\u201cViewing the totality of the evidence as it relates to other factors in Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E), we would be required to speculate to assign merit to [wife\u2019s] argument. The trial court in fashioning the monetary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>award certainly did not state that it was influenced by or attributed any particular weight to the fact that it found [wife] guilty of adultery.\u201d). The brief mention of husband\u2019s adultery among many other factors considered by the commissioner and court does not support an inference that the commissioner and trial court improperly relied on husband\u2019s adultery, particularly in the absence of a specific, express finding that they did so. <em>Id. </em>Husband has not shown otherwise. <em>See D\u2019Agnese, </em>22 Va.App. at 153, 468 S.E.2d at 143 (citing <em>Lutes, </em>14 Va.App. at 1077, 421 S.E.2d at 859) (explaining that the party seeking relief on appeal bears the burden to show reversible error).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Husband also argues that the court erred in adopting the commissioner\u2019s finding that wife was without legal fault in the dissolution of the marriage. In order to constitute legal fault, marital cruelty \u201cmust be so serious that it makes the relationship intolerable or unendurable.\u201d <em>McLaughlin v. McLaughlin, 2 </em>Va.App. 463, 467, 346 S.E.2d 535, 537 (1986) (citing <em>Hoback v. Hoback, </em>208 Va. 432, 436, 158 S.E.2d 113, 116 (1967)). All of the evidence of marital cruelty came from husband, and wife and her three children all contradicted husband\u2019s testimony. Under the governing standard of review, we find that the trial court resolved this conflict in the evidence in wife\u2019s favor, and will not reverse the trial court\u2019s determination. <em>See Farley v. Farley, </em>9 Va.App. 326, 328, 387 S.E.2d 794, 795 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Allocation and Consideration of Marital Debt</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">In determining an equitable distribution award, a court must consider the \u201cdebts and liabilities of each spouse [and] the basis for such debts and liabilities.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E)(7). Husband contends that the commissioner and trial court failed to properly consider the debt associated with the marital property known as Rochester Housing Associates Two Limited Partnership and the preparation of the parties\u2019 joint 1992 tax return by DeLoitte <em>&amp; </em>Touche. Husband introduced evidence that Rochester Housing Associates was en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>cumbered by $22,400 in debt, which he reduced to $17,000 after the parties\u2019 separation, and that he paid DeLoitte &amp; Touche approximately $2,300 to prepare the parties\u2019 joint 1992 tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Husband\u2019s argument is without merit. In allocating the marital liabilities, the commissioner found that husband should receive a credit of $44,856 against the intangible marital assets. In making this recommendation, the commissioner stated that, \u201c[hjusband should not be allowed an offset for the Rochester Housing Associates account or the DeLoitte and Touche bill when making an accounting, the commissioner having already taken these into account in making an equitable distribution of the property.\u201d Similarly, evidence of husband\u2019s $5,400 payment to reduce the debt on the Rochester Housing Associates account was before the commissioner, and there is no reason to believe that the commissioner did not take the payment into account. The trial court addressed husband\u2019s arguments, affirmed the commissioner, and noted that the commissioner properly resolved the conflicts in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">We find no basis in the record in support of husband\u2019s contention that the court failed to consider husband\u2019s debt. Husband is not entitled to a dollar-for-dollar credit for post-separation contributions made to the care, acquisition, or maintenance of marital property, <em>von Raab, </em>26 Va.App. at 249-50, 494 S.E.2d at 161 (citing <em>Ellington, </em>8 Va.App. at 56, 378 S.E.2d at 630). The court was not presented with an issue of valuation, in which debt must be fully considered in establishing value,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but rather with the issue of fashioning an equitable distribution award, in the exercise of its discretion after considering the statutory factors. <em>See Booth, </em>7 Va.App. at 28, 371 S.E.2d at 573. Unless a party can show evidence to the contrary, we presume that the trial court properly applied the law to the facts. <em>Bottoms v.

At trial, the wife argued that, during the course of their nineteen-year marriage, the husband \u201cdepleted the marital estate by $50,000 to pay a separate debt [of court-ordered support to his former spouse].\u201d Apparently believing the evidence proved dissipation, the trial judge agreed with the wife\u2019s argument and \u201cconclude[d] that the commissioner recognized [the wife\u2019s] argument that [the husband\u2019s] contributions to the marriage should be reduced by spousal support he paid to his ex-wife and that ...

I believe both rulings are incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">\u201cCode \u00a7 20-107.3, providing for equitable distribution, is based on the notion that marriage is an economic partnership in which the parties, through varying contributions, monetary and nonmonetary, to the acquisition, maintenance, and care of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>property and to the well-being of the family, may accumulate marital wealth.\u201d <em>Dietz v.

Gamble, </em>14 Va.App. 558, 570, 421 S.E.2d 635, 642 (1992). Thus, we have ruled that \u201cwhat has always been contemplated by the Code \u00a7 20-107.3 scheme for equitable distribution of the marital wealth of the parties ... [is] a distribution which will equitably \u2018compensate a spouse for his or her contribution to the acquisition of property obtained during the marriage.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 569, 421 S.E.2d at 642 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">A trial judge may not apply the statute in a manner that does not further the statute\u2019s purpose and policy. \u201cEvery statute is to be read so as to \u2018promote the ability of the enactment to remedy the mischief at which it is directed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bulala v.

Nothing in the letter or the spirit of the statute authorizes judges to examine the parties\u2019 lifestyle choices and conclude <em>post facto </em>that they could have better used their incomes <em>to accumulate more </em>wealth. Thus, a trial judge may not, under the guise of applying Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E), rotely consider a party\u2019s use of income or marital assets to pay a debt during the course of marriage as a factor in the distribution of marital property or in making a monetary award. We have recognized that the statute is not a license for judges to make a <em>post facto </em>examination of the spending of the husband and wife during the marriage to determine whether they made prudent decisions in using their incomes or marital assets to pay for necessities of life. Thus, we previously have stated that, \u201cat least until the parties contemplate divorce, each is free to spend marital funds.\u201d <em>Booth v.

Marion, </em>11 Va.App. 659, 401 S.E.2d 432 (1991), we noted that the legislative purpose had to be considered in making equitable distributions. <em>See id. </em>at 668, 401 S.E.2d at 438. We held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>that \u201c \u2018Code \u00a7 20-107.3 provides for the equitable distribution of the <em>accumulated </em>marital wealth between the marital parties; it does not contemplate consideration of the <em>future </em>ability of one spouse to accumulate what will be separate property or the <em>future </em>needs of the other spouse.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). <em>See also Stainback v. Stainback, </em>11 Va.App. 13, 21-22, 396 S.E.2d 686, 691-92 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">We also have ruled that not all past conduct of the parties during a marriage affects the equitable distribution of property. In <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>18 Va.App. 427, 444 S.E.2d 269 (1994), the wife contended the trial judge erred by not considering as a factor the \u201chusband\u2019s dissipation of marital assets, which she alleges occurred ... during the course of his fifteen-year extramarital affair.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 430, 444 S.E.2d at 272. In rejecting that contention, we ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">Our case law uniformly holds that the challenged use of funds must be \u201cin anticipation of divorce or separation ... [and] at a time when the marriage is in jeopardy.\u201d Wife is correct in her assertion that the Court in <em>Booth </em>defined waste only \u201cgenerally\u201d and did not purport to set forth \u201can exclusive definition.\u201d Nevertheless, to date, Virginia\u2019s appellate courts have applied this rule only to funds spent contemporaneously with the marital breakdown, and we will not expand the definition to cover expenditures made for a fifteen-year period which were not specifically for the purpose of depleting the marital estate and where there was no evidence that there was an irreconcilable breakdown of the marriage. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err by finding that wife failed to show that husband\u2019s pre-separation expenditures constituted dissipation of marital assets.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 430-31, 444 S.E.2d at 272 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">During the marriage, the parties may at any time properly use marital income that they earn for nonmarital purposes. Only when one party claims an impropriety or improper dissipation of marital assets that impacts a statutory purpose should the court intervene and construct a financial accounting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>of income and expenditures during the marriage. No valid purpose of Code \u00a7 20-107.3 is served by analyzing the debts the parties paid during the marriage to determine which spouse gained the greater benefit from payment of the debt and then using that benefit analysis to support a set-off to the other spouse when making a distribution of property upon divorce. Obviously, if the debt bears some significance to the purpose of the property division, such as dissipation in contemplation of or after marital dissolution, the evidence establishes a nexus to the statutory purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">In this case, the husband\u2019s payment during the marriage of spousal support to a former spouse bears no significant relationship to the statutory purpose of Code \u00a7 20-107.3. It is not unusual that parties enter into marriage with either or both having separate antenuptial debts. The payments of spousal support in this case were not made to obtain or maintain a separate asset that the husband can sell, trade, or transfer for money after the divorce. No inequity justifies the trial judge\u2019s use of these payments to increase the property distributed to the wife on divorce. The husband\u2019s spousal support payments were no different than any other expenditure made during the marriage for a purpose solely benefit-ting the husband, such as dues to a golf association, membership in a racquetball club, contributions to a church building fund, dues at a private club, or expenditures on a hobby that did not result in the acquisition of an asset.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">To authorize a set-off or credit in the distribution of the marital property because certain expenditures made during the marriage benefitted the husband finds no support in the language or purpose of the statute. Indeed, the lack of logic in this decision is doubly manifest because the record contains no indication that the trial judge considered the favorable tax benefits the parties received as a result of the spousal support payments. To the extent the wife contends the husband\u2019s payments deprived her of the ability to spend the money during the marriage for something that directly benefitted her, she ignores the benefit the tax savings provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>No evidence in this record tends to prove the husband\u2019s payment of spousal support to his former spouse pursuant to a court\u2019s order affected any factor contained in Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E). Clearly, the trial judge confused this issue with \u201cdissipation\u201d or \u201cwaste.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">Although not an exclusive definition[,] \u201cwaste\u201d may be generally characterized as the dissipation of marital funds in anticipation of divorce or separation for a purpose unrelated to the marriage and in derogation of the marital relationship at a time when the marriage is in jeopardy. Just as a court may consider positive contributions to the marriage in making an equitable distribution award, it can also consider \u201cnegative\u201d contributions in the form of squandering and [destroying marital resources. The goal of equitable distribution is to adjust the property interests of the spouses fairly and equitably. The mechanism to accomplish that goal is the monetary award. To allow one spouse to squander marital property is to make an equitable award impossible. On the other hand, at least until the parties contemplate divorce, each is free to spend marital funds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-6\"><em>Booth, </em>7 Va.App. at 27, 371 S.E.2d at 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The Virginia cases do not support either the trial judge\u2019s ruling or the majority\u2019s opinion. In <em>Gamer v. Gamer, </em>16 Va.App. 335, 429 S.E.2d 618 (1993), the husband and wife received during the marriage money that should have been sent to the husband\u2019s former spouse. The husband and wife spent the money for living expenses. <em>See id. </em>at 338-39, 429 S.E.2d at 621. The debt, which was created by their receipt and expenditure of money that was not theirs, was reduced to a judgment and became a lien against the marital residence. <em>See id. </em>at 341, 429 S.E.2d at 623. Applying Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E)(7), we ruled that \u201c[w]here the debt was secured by marital assets or was a lien on marital property, the purpose, nature, and character of the debt and who benefitted from it were factors to be considered by the chancellor in distributing the property or in fashioning the monetary award.\u201d <em>Gamer, </em>16 Va.App. at 341, 429 S.E.2d at 623. Obviously, when the husband and wife misappropriated and spent funds during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>marriage that were not theirs and thereby created a debt that resulted in a lien on marital property, that debt was a marital debt created by the husband and the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">In <em>Hayes v. Hayes, </em>21 Va.App. 515, 465 S.E.2d 590 (1996), we did not rule that the husband\u2019s share of the marital estate could be reduced by the amount of child support payments the husband made during the marriage for the child of his prior marriage. Because the wife had made loans to the husband \u201cfor the benefit of the husband\u2019s separate property,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 515, 465 S.E.2d at 591, the trial judge found that the husband\u2019s debt to the wife was separate debt. <em>See id. </em>at 519, 465 S.E.2d at 592. We upheld the trial judge\u2019s finding that the debt was a separate debt, and we ruled that the trial judge erred in not determining pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.3(C) whether the husband was required to repay the borrowed funds. <em>See id. </em>We remanded the matter to the trial judge to determine whether to order the husband to pay the debt that arose from the loan. <em>See id. </em>In the case we decide today, no claim has been made that the husband borrowed funds from the wife or that the husband used the wife\u2019s funds to improve his separate asset.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The decision in <em>Orlandi v. Orlandi, </em>23 Va.App. 21, 473 S.E.2d 716 (1996), has no bearing on the issues that arise in this case. <em>Orlandi </em>concerns issues of child support between two divorced parties. No issue of equitable distribution or the interpretation of Code \u00a7 20-107.3 arose in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">The majority erroneously treats this issue as if the husband\u2019s spousal support payments were a contribution made to enhance a nonmarital asset that is extant at the divorce. It was not. The husband\u2019s payment of court-ordered spousal support was not a ruse to fund a separate asset. Many of the cases cited by the majority were not decided under Virginia law and contain instances in which a spouse spent marital assets to obtain or enhance a separate asset. In those instances, courts of other states have deemed that a diversion of marital funds to enhance a separate asset creates a marital interest in the enhanced property.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>The evidence in <em>McGee v. McGee, </em>277 N.J.Super. 1, 648 A.2d 1128 (A.D.1994), proved that prior to their marriage, the husband purchased the wife\u2019s house to save it from foreclosure and to pay debts the wife owed. <em>See id. </em>at 1129. He paid only $63,000 for the house even though it was valued at $150,000, exclusive of furnishings and the surrounding eleven acres of land. The value of the furnishings and eleven acres was unknown. <em>See id. </em>After the marriage, the husband \u201cdenuded the house of $134,000 of equity\u201d by borrowing against the property, used the borrowed money to pay an obligation to his former spouse, and then conveyed the property to himself and the wife. <em>Id. </em>at 1131. The court ruled that the husband\u2019s conduct effectively used the wife\u2019s separate assets to pay the husband\u2019s pre-existing obligations to his former wife. <em>See id. </em>at 1134. Because of the husband\u2019s misuse of the wife\u2019s house prior to and during the marriage, the court ruled that under New Jersey law, \u201c[t]he case can be viewed from the vantage point of the shared enterprise of marriage beginning before the ceremonial act, or as one in which equitable remedies such as constructive trust, quasi contract or quantum meruit are invocable for equitable reasons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1134. That ruling is not dispositive of issues in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">In <em>Dobbyn v. Dobbyn, </em>57 Md.App. 662, 471 A.2d 1068 (1984), the court was not concerned \"with a party\u2019s payment of support to another spouse during the marriage as a basis for making a monetary award. The issue in <em>Dobbyn </em>was whether the trial judge could consider the divorced husband\u2019s new and future family obligations under Maryland\u2019s statutory requirement to consider \u201c \u2018[tjhe economic circumstances of each spouse at the time the award is to be made.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1077.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">In <em>Jensen v. Jensen, </em>877 S.W.2d 131 (Mo.Ct.App.1994), the court ruled that the husband\u2019s payment of child support to a former spouse and to a former lover <em>after </em>the husband\u2019s separation from his current wife was the husband\u2019s separate debt. <em>See id. </em>at 135. Thus, when the husband liquidated marital assets during the separation to pay those debts, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>court set aside those funds as credits against the husband\u2019s share of marital assets. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">In <em>Fenske v. Fenske, </em>542 N.W.2d 98 (N.D.1996), the trial judge found \u201cthat the parties had paid off their individual and marital debts \u2018by commingling everything they had.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 102. Nothing in the <em>Fenske </em>opinion suggests that the trial judge gave either party a distribution based upon a party paying a pre-marital debt with marital funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">North Carolina courts have ruled that \u201c[a] reduction in the separate debt of a party to a marriage, caused by the expenditure of marital funds, is, in the absence of an agreement to repay the marital estate, neither an asset nor a debt of the marital estate.\u201d <em>Adams v. Adams, </em>115 N.C.App. 168, 443 S.E.2d 780, 781 (1994). Under that state\u2019s law, any such reduction in the separate debt may only be considered as a factor if a justifiable reason exists. <em>See id. </em>(citing N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 50-20(C)(12)).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">In the case before us, the trial judge accepted the commissioner\u2019s recommendation \u201cthat [the husband\u2019s] contributions to the marriage should be reduced by spousal support he paid to his ex-wife.\u201d I believe that the following reasoning, employed in <em>Rosenfeld v. Rosenfeld, </em>597 So.2d 835 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1992), is more pertinent to the issues that arise in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-8\">The wife in this case took the position at the time of the divorce that the trial court should revisit the parties\u2019 expenditures throughout the marriage, and should retroactively decide that certain of the expenditures should not have been made.... [T]his amounted to a request for \u201ca financial accounting of all of the marital years to determine which spouse was the more prudent investor and spender. We do not choose to start down such a path with this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-9\">In the present case the wife complains because the husband paid court-ordered support to his previous wife, and made other payments required by the divorce decree. The wife\u2019s position is entirely without merit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao0\">Payments made to an ex-wife or children pursuant to a court order cannot be considered as waste or misuse of the marital assets of the successor marriage. Those obligations were incurred before the successor marriage, and obviously the subsequent spouse was well aware of them prior to the successor marriage. In any event, a party cannot refuse to make court ordered payments on the grounds that he or she has now remarried. Likewise, payment of expenses incident to a prior dissolution, such as attorneys\u2019 fees, does not constitute waste or misuse of marital funds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 837 (citation omitted) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Using similar reasoning, the court in <em>In re Marriage of Burgess, </em>568 N.W.2d 827 (Iowa App.1997), ruled that, in the division of marital property upon divorce, a wife was not entitled to a set-off or credit for the husband\u2019s payment during the marriage of spousal and child support to his former wife. <em>See id. </em>at 828. The court concluded that it would be inequitable to consider those payments as a distribution factor because \u201cthe payment of the [support] obligation [by the husband] was a reasonable and expected aspect of the particular marriage.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">The majority correctly notes that <em>Bliss v. Bliss, </em>127 Idaho 170, 898 P.2d 1081 (1995), involved a division of property on divorce in a community property state. However, the principles applied to \u201ccommunity\u201d property are not completely unrelated to issues that arise regarding \u201cmarital\u201d property. In <em>Bliss, </em>the court held that the use of community funds to pay antenuptial debts, where such payment is unrelated to the enhancement of a separate asset, is not a basis upon which a party upon divorce may seek reimbursement to the community funds. <em>See id. </em>at 1084. That reasoning is valid when analogized to the issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Simply put, Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E) does not authorize judges to enrich one of the parties based upon the mere finding that the other party, who was the sole source of income during the marriage, used portions of that income to pay debts that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>party incurred prior to the marriage. In particular, no evidence tended to prove that the husband\u2019s payment of spousal support to his former spouse negatively contributed to his marriage to the wife. For these reasons, I would reverse the trial judge\u2019s equitable distribution decision and remand for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">(B)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Although the trial judge expressly noted that he was reducing the husband\u2019s equitable distribution award for payments the husband made under a court order to support the husband\u2019s spouse of a prior marriage, the record contains no indication that in making the monetary award the trial judge gave any consideration to the husband\u2019s support, during the marriage, of his wife\u2019s children from a prior marriage. The trial judge noted that \u201c[tjhere is no mention by the commissioner of these matters [in the report].\u201d Yet, the trial judge assumed the matter was considered because the commissioner \u201cdoes say he has considered all the relevant factors which, of course, includes the catch all one in \u00a7 20-107.3(E).\u201d The irony of the disparity between the treatment of this issue and the issue of the husband\u2019s payment of spousal support to his former wife is palpable.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The evidence proved that when the wife\u2019s former spouse stopped paying child support, the husband supported the three children from the wife\u2019s prior marriage beginning when the oldest child was age fifteen. One of the wife\u2019s children continued living in the house four years past the child\u2019s majority. The husband\u2019s salary was the family\u2019s sole source of financial support.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">On remand, I would direct the trial judge to expressly consider the husband\u2019s payments and conduct which contributed to the well-being of the family. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">(C)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">The evidence proved that the husband paid $5,400 post-separation to reduce a marital debt that was associated with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>an asset that had no value. I find no evidence in the record that the trial judge adjusted the award to consider that payment. Likewise, the evidence proved that the husband paid $2,282 for the preparation of the parties\u2019 joint tax return and received no credit for that payment. I would also require the trial judge to reconsider on remand adjustments for those payments.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
