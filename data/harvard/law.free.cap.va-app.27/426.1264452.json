Piatt (wife) appeals the trial court\u2019s order granting joint custody of the parties\u2019 child but awarding John Piatt (husband) primary physical custody. Wife contends the trial court erroneously: (1) treated her post-separation sexual conduct differently from husband\u2019s post-separation sexual conduct; (2) failed to make findings regarding the statutory factors relating to child custody;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (3) ruled on the admissibili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>ty of certain evidence; and (4) employed a conclusive presumption that homosexual parents are harmful to their children. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Under familiar principles, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to husband, the party prevailing below. <em>See Wilson v. Wilson, </em>12 Va.App. 1251, 1254, 408 S.E.2d 576, 578 (1991). Wife and husband were married in July 1989, and their child was born on January 13, 1993. Both parents worked, and child care was provided by Tara Angyal, who is a professional child care provider and a friend of wife\u2019s, Sharon Piatt, who is husband\u2019s sister-in-law, and both grandmothers. In December 1994, the parties separated while remaining in the marital domicile and entered into a settlement agreement under which they cared for the child on alternate weekdays and weekends. During this time, while husband was at work, his mother or Sharon Piatt often supervised the child and her slightly older female cousin. On wife\u2019s days with the child, child care was provided by Tara Angyal and wife\u2019s mother while wife worked. After wife vacated the marital residence in June 1996, the child spent alternate weeks with her parents, an arrangement both parties agree was unsatisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The parties\u2019 settlement agreement also provided that a custody evaluation would be performed by Dr. Christopher D. Lane. In his report, Dr. Lane recommended that the parties share joint legal custody and that wife have primary physical custody with liberal visitation for husband. Dr. Lane based his recommendation in part on \u201cthe assessment of [wife\u2019s] parenting abilities as being demonstrably broader in scope at this time than those of Mr. Piatt and in the perceived greater responsiveness of [the child] to her.\u201d Dr. Lane also testified that his assessment of both parties\u2019 parenting skills and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>commitment to parenting \u201cwould be consistent with a high level of devotion to the care of [the] child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">At trial, both parents presented evidence concerning their post-separation relationships with third parties. The evidence established that husband had been involved in one heterosexual relationship and wife had participated in two homosexual relationships following the parties\u2019 separation. Husband and his female Mend testified that their involvement was serious, and they planned marriage with the full support of husband\u2019s family. Wife acknowledged that she was \u201cexperimenting\u201d and still dealing with the issue of her sexual orientation, and that as a result, her relationship with her father had been damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Dr. Lane filed a supplemental report in which he reviewed several studies on the effects of homosexuality on children. He testified that \u201c[t]here seems to be no credible documentation of damage to children\u201d from being raised by a homosexual parent. Dr. Lane also indicated that wife \u201cis still struggling with her own sexual identity,\u201d and her \u201cfamily is reverberating\u201d from her \u201cvery angry estrangement from her father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The trial court ruled from the bench, finding that wife \u201cis still in a turmoil, which is continuing and has continued over the last two years. This turmoil is as to her sexual orientation and how her life should go forward.\u201d The court agreed with Dr. Lane that \u201cboth parents have good parenting skills. They both love their daughter, and their daughter loves both of them.\u201d However, the trial court expressed doubt about the credibility of wife\u2019s testimony and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-8\">I have to balance these things out. And there is no easy answer, but I believe that the father is better qualified at this point to be the primary caretaker of the child. I believe there is more stability in his surroundings and in his home. There is support on both sides of the family, but there is probably a little bit more support on the side of the father____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>I am going to make it joint custody, because I do not want anybody to think that they do not have a say in raising the child. The primary custodian will be the father.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The trial court awarded joint legal custody of the child, with husband having primary physical custody and wife having ten days per month visitation plus vacations and alternate holidays.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">II. Post-Separation Sexual Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Wife contends the trial court erred in treating her two post-separation relationships as having an adverse effect upon the child, but not so treating husband\u2019s relationship. However, the record discloses no finding that either party\u2019s post-separation sexual behavior had an adverse effect upon the child. Rather, the trial court treated the parties\u2019 post-separation sexual behavior as evidence supporting its conclusion that husband provided a more stable home environment for the child. Consequently, wife\u2019s contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">In determining child custody, a trial court is required to \u201cgive primary consideration to the best interests of the child.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-142.2(B). Because the trial court heard the evidence at an <em>ore terms </em>hearing, its decision \u201cis entitled to great weight and will not be disturbed unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Venable v. Venable, </em>2 Va.App. 178, 186, 342 S.E.2d 646, 651 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">In general, a court examines the sexual conduct of a parent to determine whether it has had any adverse impact on the child.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Brown v. Brown, </em>218 Va. 196, 199, 237 S.E.2d 89, 91 (1977) (\u201cin determining the best interest of the child, the court must decide by considering all the facts, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>what effect a nonmarital relationship by a parent has on the child\u201d). Here both parents\u2019 relationships were facts for the trial court to consider, but the record does not reflect that those relationships provided the basis for the custody award.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The trial court referred to wife\u2019s post-separation sexual relationships and her \u201cexperimentation\u201d not as having a direct negative impact on the child, but as manifestations of wife\u2019s inner \u201cturmoil\u201d and \u201clack of control.\u201d These characteristics have a direct bearing on wife\u2019s ability to provide a stable home environment and to \u201cmeet the emotional, intellectual and physical needs of the child.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-124.3(3). <em>See Bostick v. Bostick-Bennett, </em>23 Va.App. 527, 478 S.E.2d 319 (1996) (the degree of stability of the home environment is a matter of concern under Code \u00a7 20-124.3(3)).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The evidence supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that wife\u2019s home environment was less stable than husband\u2019s. The record demonstrates that wife often left the child in the care of others while she pursued recreational trips and activities. She occasionally took the child with her without regard to the child\u2019s bedtime or evening routine. Wife was unsure whether she would remain in her condo after the one-year lease ended. She dated several individuals and admitted to two sexual relationships. Furthermore, wife\u2019s family relationships were strained.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The court contrasted the stability of wife\u2019s home environment with that provided by husband. The evidence shows that husband developed a routine for the child. He maintained his residence in the marital home, where the child had lived her entire life. He was involved in a long-term relationship with another woman and was planning for marriage. He had the full support of his parents and his brother and sister-in-law. His relatives provided day care for the child and her young cousin.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">All of these facts led the trial court to conclude that, while it was clear that neither parent was unfit, husband could provide a more stable environment for the child. The trial court recognized the commitment of both parents to the child by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>ordering joint custody, and the physical custody arrangement provided wife with liberal visitation. The parties acknowledged that their previous shared custody arrangement failed. Credible evidence supports the trial court\u2019s award of joint custody with primary placement of the child with husband.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">III. Consideration of Factors in Code \u00a7 20-124.3</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">In its final order, the trial court stated that it had \u201cconsidered each and every factor under \u00a7 20-124.3 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended.\u201d Wife contends the trial court erroneously failed to make findings of fact with regard to each of the statutory factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">In determining the best interests of the child, a court must consider all of the factors set out in Code \u00a7 20-124.3. <em>Sargent v. Sargent, </em>20 Va.App. 694, 701, 460 S.E.2d 596, 599 (1995). It is well established that failure to consider all of the factors is reversible error. <em>See, e.g., Robinson v. Robinson, </em>5 Va.App. 222, 227, 361 S.E.2d 356, 358 (1987). A trial court need not, however, \u201c \u2018quantify or elaborate exactly what weight or consideration it has given to each of the statutory factors.\u2019\u201d <em>Sargent, </em>20 Va.App. at 702, 460 S.E.2d at 599 (quoting <em>Woolley v. Woolley, </em>3 Va.App. 337, 345, 349 S.E.2d 422, 426 (1986)). We find no merit to wife\u2019s claim that the trial court must make specific findings as to each statutory factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Wife also claims the court failed to consider the \u201cage and physical and mental condition of each parent\u201d as required by Code \u00a7 20-124.3(2) by failing to give weight to Dr. Lane\u2019s report. Wife\u2019s argument to the contrary, a trial court is not required to accept the opinion of an expert. <em>See McLane v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number><em>Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 197, 205-06, 116 S.E.2d 274, 281 (1960). \u201cIt is well established that the trier of fact ascertains [an expert] witness\u2019 credibility, determines the weight to be given to their testimony, and has the discretion to accept or reject any of the witness\u2019 testimony.\u201d <em>Street v. Street, </em>25 Va.App. 880, 387, 488 S.E.2d 665, 668 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc) (citing <em>Bridgeman v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 523, 528, 351 S.E.2d 598, 601 (1986)). Thus, the trial court acted within its discretion when it declined to follow Dr. Lane\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">IV. Evidentiary Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Wife contends the court erred in making a number of evidentiary rulings. Given its responsibility to manage often complex and hotly contested litigation, a trial court has broad discretion to determine the admissibility of evidence. <em>See Langhorne v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 97, 106, 409 S.E.2d 476, 482 (1991) (citing <em>Blain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 10, 16, 371 S.E.2d 838, 842 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Wife argues the trial court arbitrarily excluded evidence relevant to the factors outlined in Code \u00a7 20-124.3. Some of the evidence to which wife refers was, in fact, not excluded. The other evidence was excluded as irrelevant, too abstract, or argumentative. \u201cEvidence having rational probative value and which adds force and effect to other evidence will be admitted unless some other rule requires its exclusion.\u201d <em>Peacock Buick v. Durkin, </em>221 Va. 1133, 1136, 277 S.E.2d 225, 227 (1981) (citing <em>Levine v. Lynchburg, </em>156 Va. 1007, 1014, 159 S.E. 95, 97 (1931)). After reviewing the excluded evidence, we conclude the trial court properly exercised its discretion to exclude evidence which it considered too far afield from the issues confronting the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Wife claims the court\u2019s evidentiary rulings were tied to the sexual orientation of the party offering the evidence or asking the question. A litigant is denied due process if his or her case is heard before a judge who harbors \u201c \u2018such bias or prejudice as would deny [the litigant] a fair trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Welsh v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 300, 314, 416 S.E.2d 451, 459 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>(1992) (quoting <em>Justus v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 667, 673, 283 S.E.2d 905, 908 (1981)), <em>aff'd, </em>246 Va. 337, 437 S.E.2d 914 (1993) . The trial judge made no statement that his rulings were based on anything other than the rules of evidence. The fact that the trial court made a number of evidentiary rulings adverse to wife, without more, does not indicate the trial judge was biased against her. <em>See Stevens v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 117, 123, 379 S.E.2d 469, 473 (1989) (finding no bias despite the fact that the defendant lost 36 of 38 objections). The trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings were a proper exercise of its discretion and showed no bias against wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Wife also argues the court erred in admitting a greeting card as evidence, as well as in reading the card to determine whether it contained hearsay. After husband attempted to introduce the card, wife objected on the basis that the contents of the card were hearsay. The court ruled, \u201cIf you are offering it for the contents of the truthfulness of it, sustained.\u201d The premise of wife\u2019s argument is incorrect. As the court\u2019s statement makes plain, the trial court did not admit the card, but ruled it inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Wife\u2019s argument that the trial court erred by reading the card also fails. First, the court had to read the card to rule on its admissibility. Second, the trial court is presumed to have excluded inadmissible evidence from its consideration, and wife has offered nothing to rebut this presumption. <em>See Adams v. Adams, </em>233 Va. 422, 429, 357 S.E.2d 491, 495 (1987) (citing <em>Eckhart v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 213, 216, 279 S.E.2d 155, 157 (1981)). The trial court properly exercised its discretion in ruling on the admissibility of the card.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-16\">. In her brief, wife attempts to enlarge the issues on appeal to encompass a claim that the evidence was insufficient to support the court\u2019s ruling. We limit our review to the questions presented by wife. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number><em>Carbaugh v. Solem, </em>225 Va. 310, 312 &amp; n. *, 302 S.E.2d 33, 34 &amp; n. * (1983). This Court, as well as the opposing party, must be able to rely on a party\u2019s statement of the questions presented. <em>See, e.g., </em>Rule 5A:25(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b474-10\">. This standard applies to both heterosexual and homosexual conduct. <em>See, e.g., Ford v. Ford, </em>14 Va.App. 551, 555, 419 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1992) (upholding custody award to homosexual parent because the child was not exposed to the \"illicit nature\u201d of the relationship); <em>Sutherland v. Sutherland, </em>14 Va.App. 42, 414 S.E.2d 617 (1992) (upholding custody award to heterosexual parent because the evidence did not show that the parent\u2019s sexual conduct had an adverse effect on the children).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b476-9\">. Wife also contends that the court\u2019s disparate treatment of the parties\u2019 sexual conduct in the absence of evidence of an adverse effect of that conduct gives rise to an inference of an unconstitutional \"conclusive presumption that homosexual parents are harmful to their children.\u201d In light of our holding that the trial court made no finding of adverse impact and examined the parties' sexual behavior only as it related to the stability of their homes, wife\u2019s contention is not supported by the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b478-10\">ANNUNZIATA, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AlM\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">In my opinion, the trial judge\u2019s statements make clear that, in awarding husband primary physical custody, he applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>different standards when evaluating the parties\u2019 post-separation sexual conduct. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Viewed in the light most favorable to husband, the record shows that, during the period between the parties\u2019 separation in December 1994 and the hearing in September 1996, husband was involved in a relationship with one woman. Husband\u2019s relationship began in October 1995, and continued through the time of the hearing. Wife was involved in a relationship with a woman from January 1995 to May 1995, and in a relationship with another woman from May 1995 through the time of the hearing in September 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The trial judge\u2019s decision began with his statement that wife was in a \u201cturmoil\u201d over her sexual orientation. Immediately following this statement, the judge assessed wife\u2019s sexual orientation and conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">She admits that she is experimenting.... Within her homosexual side of this experiment and turmoil, she has had two admitted lovers in the last eighteen months; one for four months, and one for over a year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">Speaking of it in the simplest manner, and not so much whether it is homosexual or heterosexual, this is promiscuity while still married. It shows a level of lack of control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-10\">I think Dr. Lane was correct in saying that both parents have good parenting skills. They both love their daughter, and their daughter loves both of them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">The judge then addressed husband\u2019s conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>On the other side, there is no evidence that Mr. Piatt has had any involvement in promiscuity, nor is there any evidence that he has any lack of parenting skills. He scored just about the same score she did on that grounds. There is no question that he has great love and care for his daughter, as does the mother. The mother clearly loves her daughter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ap6\">At this point, the judge made the statements quoted by the majority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">I have to balance these things out. And there is no easy answer, but I believe that father is better qualified at this point to be primary caretaker of the child. I believe there is more stability in his surroundings and in his home. There is support on both sides of the family, but there is probably a little bit more support on the side of the father. I guess they both have used \u2014 Both parents have used the support of these families over the years to help them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeE\">The judge then awarded the parties joint legal custody and awarded husband primary physical custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The trial judge\u2019s statements make clear that the factor he believed he had to \u201cbalance ... out\u201d was the relative \u201cpromiscuity\u201d of wife and husband; his lengthy discussion of the relative \u201cpromiscuity\u201d of husband and wife provides the antecedent for the trial judge\u2019s finding that husband had more \u201cstability\u201d and makes clear that this finding meant more stable sexual behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The evidence shows, as wife contends, that the trial court treated wife\u2019s sexual conduct differently from that of husband. First, the trial court\u2019s finding that wife had engaged in \u201cpromiscuity while still married,\u201d but that husband had not, is not supported by the evidence. XII <em>The Oxford English Dictionary </em>613 (2d ed. 1989), defines \u201cpromiscuous\u201d as \u201cindiscriminate in sexual relations.\u201d Similarly, <em>The Oxford Dictionary and Thesaurus </em>1196 (1996), defines \u201cpromiscuous\u201d as \u201chaving frequent and diverse sexual relationships, esp. transient ones.\u201d Neither party\u2019s relationships could reasonably be described from the record as \u201cindiscriminate,\u201d \u201cfrequent and diverse,\u201d or \u201ctransient.\u201d In fact, the relationship in which wife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>was involved at the time of the hearing had lasted five months longer than husband\u2019s relationship. Wife\u2019s first relationship ended before her second relationship began. The record contains no evidence of other sexual relationships by either party. The court\u2019s assignment of the label of \u201cpromiscuity\u201d to wife\u2019s two serial, monogamous relationships, to distinguish her conduct from that of husband, is not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The other facet of the court\u2019s distinction between wife\u2019s two relationships and husband\u2019s relationship is that wife\u2019s alleged promiscuity took place \u201cwhile still married.\u201d At the time of the hearing, however, both parties were still married. The court had not issued a decree of divorce. Furthermore, no evidence proved that either party had any extramarital relationship prior to their separation. Thus, the court\u2019s distinction between the parties on this basis has no foundation in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Second, the trial court\u2019s consideration of evidence of wife\u2019s sexual conduct, relative to that of husband, as a factor weighing against awarding her primary physical custody was erroneous because the record contains no evidence of any effect on the child. To the extent a finding of adverse effect on the child is implicit in the court\u2019s decision, it is erroneous because no evidence of such an effect was introduced on this point. In <em>Brown v. Brown, </em>218 Va. 196, 199, 237 S.E.2d 89, 91 (1977), the Supreme Court of Virginia established the standard for consideration of sexual conduct of a parent in child custody decisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">In all custody cases the controlling consideration is always the child\u2019s welfare and, in determining the best interests of the child, the court must decide by considering all the facts, <em>including what effect a nonmarital relationship by a parent has on the child. </em>The moral climate in which children are to be raised is an important consideration for the court in determining custody....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">As the majority concedes, this standard is applicable to both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>heterosexual and homosexual sexual conduct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The relevant inquiry, therefore, is whether the evidence supports a finding as to the \u201c \u2018effect a nonmarital relationship by a parent has on the child.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brinkley v. Brinkley, </em>1 Va.App. 222, 224, 336 S.E.2d 901, 901 (1985) (quoting <em>Brown, </em>218 Va. at 199, 237 S.E.2d at 91) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The record contains no evidence that wife\u2019s conduct, comprised of two same-sex relationships in eighteen months, had any effect on the parties\u2019 child. At the time of the hearing, the child was less than four years old, and neither party introduced evidence that the child was aware of wife\u2019s relationships. Husband testified that, to his knowledge, wife had never exposed the child to any intimate relationship with another woman. Indeed, the evidence affirmatively proved that no displays of affection of a sexual nature took place between wife and her partner in front of the child, that wife\u2019s partner did not live at the wife\u2019s home, and that wife had no plans to have her partner live in the home at any time. While the evidence showed that wife was \u201cstruggling\u201d with her sexual identity, no evidence proved that the wife\u2019s \u201cstruggle\u201d affected her ability to parent the child. Indeed, the evidence is to the contrary. Not only did expert testimony establish that wife\u2019s parenting skills were \u201cdemonstrably broader in scope ... than those of [husband],\u201d the court found the wife\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>parenting skills were equal to those of the husband. The absence of evidence showing any effect of wife\u2019s sexual conduct on the child supports wife\u2019s contention that the trial judge applied different standards when evaluating the parties\u2019 post-separation sexual conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Finally, even if, as the majority states, the trial court \u201ctreated the parties\u2019 post-separation sexual behavior [not as evidence of its adverse effect on the child but] as evidence supporting its conclusion that husband\u2019s home was a more stable environment for the child,\u201d I would reverse. To the extent the trial judge\u2019s conclusion about the greater stability of husband\u2019s \u201csurroundings\u201d and \u201chome\u201d was premised on the parties\u2019 sexual conduct, his conclusion is erroneous as having been based on the application of different standards relating to this factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">For the reasons outlined above, I would reverse and remand for a redetermination of custody of the child. <em>See Dooley v. Dooley, </em>222 Va. 240, 247, 278 S.E.2d 865, 869 (1981) (\u201cIn view of our conclusion that the charge of adultery has not been proven, we must reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case ... for a redetermination of custody in light of our holding on the issue of adultery....\u201d); <em>Williams v. Williams, </em>24 Va.App. 778, 785, 485 S.E.2d 651, 654 (1997) (\u201cHolding that Code \u00a7 20-124.2(B) requires a finding that harm or detriment to a child\u2019s health or welfare would result without visitation, before visitation can be ordered over the unified objection of the child\u2019s parents, we reverse and remand for reconsideration of visitation in accord with this opinion.\u201d).</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b479-12\">. The issue before us does not raise a question of the sufficiency of the evidence in support of the court\u2019s custody award, as is suggested by the majority. This issue was not raised by either party. Instead, wife has limited her claim to \"[wjhether the trial court erred when it did not consider the evidence of [husband\u2019s] post-separation adulterous relationship in the same light as it considered [wife\u2019s] post-separation adulterous relationship.\u201d While some review of the evidence is necessary to understand the trial court\u2019s reasoning, a sufficiency analysis ultimately does not answer the legal question which is before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b482-6\">. <em>See, e.g., Bottoms v.
