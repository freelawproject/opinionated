Appellant contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to strike the object sexual penetration charge because the victim\u2019s testimony was legally insufficient to prove penetration. For the following reasons, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, <em>see Phillips v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 144, 155, 487 S.E.2d 285, 240-41 (1997), the evidence adduced at trial established that appellant was the nine-year-old victim\u2019s uncle by marriage, and he lived with the victim and her mother. The victim testified that when she was alone with appellant he \u201ctaught [her] to use a hairbrush ... to make [herself] feel good.\u201d She further testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-8\">Q: And how did you ... just describe for the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what you did with that brush.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-10\">A: I would lay it on the outside of my pookie [a term the victim used for her vagina], and rub it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-12\">Q: Around, back and forth, or what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-13\">A: Back and forth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-14\">The victim also testified that appellant told her to do the same things with her Barbie doll, and when he tucked her in at night he would sometimes use his finger or his tongue and \u201crub my pookie back and forth.\u201d Furthermore, the victim complained that her vaginal area \u201ckept on hurting.\u201d The victim\u2019s mother described her daughter\u2019s vaginal problem as \u201ca nightly routine of screaming and crying, and sitting in sitz baths in the tub because her [vaginal area]\u2019hurt.\u201d The mother said she would examine the victim\u2019s vaginal area and \u201c[i]t would be red and rashed. A lot of times, the clitoris would be very swollen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>At trial appellant moved to strike the charges and later renewed this motion on the ground that the Commonwealth adduced insufficient evidence of penetration of the labia majora. The trial court denied the motion, finding that \u201cwe\u2019ve got a jury question, and I think we can certainly submit the evidence to the jury, on both charges.\u201d The jury convicted appellant, and he was sentenced to ten years imprisonment for each offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Appellant contends the evidence of penetration related to the violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.2 was in equipoise and therefore legally insufficient to sustain the conviction of object sexual penetration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">\u201cOn review, this Court does not substitute its judgment for that of the trier of fact. Instead, the jury\u2019s verdict will not be set aside unless it appears that it is plainly wrong or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>without supporting evidence.\u201d <em>Canipe v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 629, 644, 491 S.E.2d 747, 754 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-67.2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-6\">An accused shall be guilty of inanimate or animate object sexual penetration if he or she penetrates the labia majora or anus of a complaining witness....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">\u201cPenetration may be proved by circumstantial evidence and is not dependent on direct testimony from the victim that penetration occurred.\u201d <em>Morrison v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 300, 301, 391 S.E.2d 612, 612 (1990) (although twelve-year-old victim was not asked whether penetration occurred, her testimony regarding circumstances surrounding incident and medical evidence of penetration were sufficient to prove rape). \u201c[C]ireumstantial evidence may be more compelling and persuasive than direct evidence, and when convincing, it is entitled to as much weight as direct evidence.\u201d <em>Bridgeman v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 523, 526, 351 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1986). For the purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.2, as well as the statutes prohibiting rape and forcible sodomy, penetration \u201c \u2018need be only slight.\u2019 \u201d <em>Horton v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 606, 612, 499 S.E.2d 258, 261 (1998) (citation omitted) (addressing forcible sodomy under Code \u00a7 18.2-67.1). <em>See Love v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 84, 89, 441 S.E.2d 709, 712 (1994) (\u201cthe legislature intended to mandate the same degree of penetration for all of these offenses\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">The anatomical structure of the female genitalia is significant in relation to the element of penetration of the labia majora at issue in this case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-10\">The female external genitalia, starting with the outermost parts, are: \u201cthe mons pubis, the labia majora et minora pudendi, the clitoris, vestibule, vestibular bulb and the greater vestibular glands. The term \u2018vulva\u2019 ... includes all these parts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-11\"><em>Horton, </em>255 Va. at 612, 499 S.E.2d at 261 (quoting Henry Gray, Anatomy, Descriptive and Surgical 1446 (Peter L. Williams et al eds., 37th ed.1989)). The Supreme Court has held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>\u201c[P]enetration of any portion of the vulva, which encompasses the external parts of the female sex organs considered as a whole and includes, beginning with the outermost parts, the labia majora, labia minora, hymen, vaginal opening and vagina ... is sufficient to establish the element of penetration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-5\"><em>Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>254 Va. 184, 190, 491 S.E.2d 739, 742 (1997) (quoting <em>Love v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 84, 88, 441 S.E.2d 709, 712 (1994)). \u201cPenetration of the vaginal opening ... clearly [is] not required.\u201d <em>Love, </em>18 Va.App. at 88, 441 S.E.2d at 712. According to the anatomical description, the clitoris lies within the labia majora; therefore, evidence of penetration or stimulation of the clitoris is sufficient to establish penetration of the labia majora under Code \u00a7 18.2-67.2. <em>Cf. Horton, </em>255 Va. at 613, 499 S.E.2d at 261-62 (evidence of oral stimulation of the vulva or clitoris constituted penetration for the purpose of proving forcible sodomy under Code \u00a7 18.2-67.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">In the instant case, although the victim\u2019s testimony that appellant taught her to rub the hairbrush or the Barbie doll \u201con the outside of my pookie\u201d did not establish penetration, the Commonwealth also introduced circumstantial evidence from which the jury could reasonably conclude penetration had occurred. The child testified that her vagina frequently hint. Her mother testified that the victim\u2019s vaginal area was often red, rashed, and her \u201cclitoris would be very swollen.\u201d On a nightly basis, the child would be \u201cscreaming and crying, and sitting in sitz baths in the tub because her pookie hurt.\u201d The problem was so severe that the victim and her mother sought medical attention \u201cmany times.\u201d The evidence of the victim\u2019s pain and swollen clitoris established the element of penetration. Therefore, we cannot hold that the verdict was unsupported by the evidence or plainly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">Appellant likens the instant facts to those in <em>Moore, </em>where the victim testified that the defendant put his penis \u201con\u201d her vagina, and the Supreme Court overturned the conviction for insufficient evidence of the essential element of penetration. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number><em>See Moore, </em>254 Va. at 189, 491 S.E.2d at 741 (holding proof of penetration is legally insufficient if the evidence is \u201cin a state of equipoise\u201d based on the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief). Appellant contends in the absence of medical or forensic evidence the mere complaint of vaginal discomfort by the victim is insufficient to sustain his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Moore </em>is misplaced, because in <em>Moore </em>the victim, <em>who provided the only evidence of penetration, </em>gave \u201ctwo different accounts of the essential facts relating to\u201d penetration. <em>Id. </em>at 189, 491 S.E.2d at 742. She testified that the defendant\u2019s penis had been \u201cin\u201d her vagina interchangeably with her testimony that it had been \u201con\u201d her vagina. <em>Id. </em>at 189, 491 S.E.2d at 741-42. Furthermore, the minor victim in <em>Moore </em>was unaware of the \u201cintricate structure of her sexual organ,\u201d and it was \u201cclear from the evidence that when she referred to her \u2018vagina,\u2019 she was describing the external part of that portion of her anatomy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190, 491 S.E.2d at 742. In light of the victim\u2019s equivocal testimony and <em>without medical, forensic, or other corroborating evidence </em>to indicate penetration of the victim\u2019s genitalia, the Supreme Court reversed the conviction in <em>Moore.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">The instant victim\u2019s testimony resembled that of the victim in <em>Moore, </em>because she said \u201con the outside of my pookie.\u201d However, here, unlike <em>Moore, </em>the Commonwealth presented additional evidence of penetration, which was uncontradicted within its case-in-chief. The victim\u2019s testimony describing the use of the hairbrush and the doll and her mother\u2019s testimony that the victim required repeated treatment and medical attention for her vaginal pain supported the reasonable inference that penetration had occurred. Testimony from the victim that the hairbrush or doll had penetrated her labia majora was unnecessary in light of her mother\u2019s direct and anatomically specific testimony that the victim\u2019s clitoris was swollen. The combination of direct and indirect evidence of penetration presented here is distinguishable from the equivocal testimony of the child victim in <em>Moore, </em>which was the sole evidence of penetration in that case. The instant evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>was not insufficient as a matter of law, and the jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that penetration occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b804-8\">. At oral argument, appellant raised for the first time the contention that the Commonwealth failed to prove penetration with an inanimate object when the testimony indicated that appellant's finger and tongue were also possible sources of the vaginal and clitoral irritation. However, at trial and in his petition for appeal, appellant \"failed to specifically assert that the evidence was insufficient to prove sexual penetration with an inanimate rather than an animate object, as required to preserve the issue for appeal.\u201d <em>Marshall v. Commonwealth, 26 </em>Va.App. 627, 637, 496 S.E.2d 120, 125 (1998) (Rule 5A:18 barred review of inanimate object penetration conviction that constituted underlying felony for first degree murder conviction). \"Pursuant to Rule 5A:18, this Court will not consider trial court error as a basis for reversal where no timely objection was made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 636, 496 S.E.2d at 125. The record reveals no good cause for appellant\u2019s failure to object in the trial court, nor is it necessary for us to consider the issue in order to attain justice in the case. Furthermore, \"Rule 5A.T2(c) provides that [o]nly questions presented in the petition for appeal will be noticed by the Court of Appeals.\u2019 \u201d <em>Perez v. Commonwealth, 25 </em>Va.App. 137, 139 n. 2, 486 S.E.2d 578, 579 n. 2 (1997). Consequently the question presented on appeal is limited to the following: \"Whether the trial court erred in denying the motion to strike as to the object penetration when the evidence in favor and against penetration in the Commonwealth\u2019s direct testimony of the victim is at equipoise and thus legally insufficient to prove penetration.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b808-7\">BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AH8\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">The conviction in this case was the result of an indictment that charged \u201cRoger Lee Jett did unlawfully and feloniously penetrate the labia majora, of a female child under the age of thirteen, with an inanimate object, in violation of [Code \u00a7 ] 18.2-67.2.\u201d At the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief, the following discussion occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: ... I make a motion to strike, as to both charges. I didn\u2019t hear any testimony or other evidence of any penetration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-10\">THE COURT: Of what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Penetration of the ... [.] Which is a requirement of these offenses. And also I would move to strike on the ground that the Commonwealth has not ... in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, has not made out a <em>prima facie </em>case for either of these offenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8n\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, with respect to the <em>prima facie </em>case, I think there is more than a <em>prima facie </em>case made, Your Honor. There is direct testimony as to the oral sex that took place\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-13\">THE COURT: You don\u2019t have to address the sodomy. I don\u2019t think [defense counsel] will. But on the penetration, I think, maybe that is the one you need to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A90\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, I think that is</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYC\">... [.] And I understand where [defense counsel] is coming from, but I think it is a question ... [.] The testimony is that \u2014 from the mother as well as the daughter \u2014 that the hairbrush was used \u2014 and this is testimony from the daughter \u2014 that the hairbrush was used to massage the top of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>vaginal area, for her to have an orgasm. Or have her feel good, I think was what her testimony was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-5\">The purpose of that evidence, and the use of the hairbrush, requires some type of penetration to get to that very part of the vaginal area, to have an orgasm or penetration, or to feel good....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The trial judge denied the motion to strike the evidence. At the conclusion of all the evidence, defense counsel renewed the motion to strike the evidence for the reasons stated in the earlier motion. The trial judge again denied the motion. Thus, I would hold that Jett is not barred from arguing that the Commonwealth failed to prove penetration by an inanimate object, as charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">The evidence failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the child was penetrated by an inanimate object. The evidence concerning the child\u2019s irritated vaginal area is equally explained by Jett\u2019s use of his tongue on the child\u2019s vaginal area. However, he was convicted of sodomy at this trial for that offense. A reasonable inference that the child\u2019s discomfort was caused by either Jett\u2019s tongue or the child\u2019s use of the inanimate object \u201con the outside\u201d of her vaginal area does not suffice to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the child was penetrated by an inanimate object. <em>See Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>254 Va. 184, 491 S.E.2d 739 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">Because the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt penetration by an inanimate object, I would reverse the conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
