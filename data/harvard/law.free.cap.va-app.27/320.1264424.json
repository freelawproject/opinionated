The Commonwealth contends the trial court erred when it concluded that the warrantless search of defendant\u2019s vaginal cavity was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the order suppressing the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-13\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b365-14\">On August 1,1996, Investigators Richard Pulliam and Howard Powell of the Halifax County Sheriffs Office were working with Christopher New, an undercover informant, to arrange controlled buys of crack cocaine from suspected dealers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Sometime prior to 4:00 p.m., New contacted William Pleas-ants, who agreed to sell crack cocaine to New at New\u2019s home. Prior to Pleasants\u2019 arrival, Investigator Pulliam searched New and gave him four hundred dollars in cash. The investigator had previously recorded the serial numbers of the cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">A short while later, Pleasants drove his automobile into New\u2019s driveway, and New exited his house to meet him. Investigator Powell observed New approach the driver-side of the vehicle, return to the corner of the house, and again approach the driver-side of the vehicle. After New left the driver-side of the vehicle a second time, Pleasants backed his vehicle out of New\u2019s driveway and drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">New re-entered the house and gave Investigator Pulliam 1.405 grams of crack cocaine. Investigators Pulliam and Powell then left the house and pursued Pleasants\u2019 automobile with the \u201cblue lights\u201d of their vehicle flashing. As the investigators neared Pleasants\u2019 automobile, it accelerated and continued onto portions of several roads. As Pleasants traveled over a bridge and beneath an underpass, the investigators \u201csaw a brown object come out of the passenger-side window\u201d of Pleasants\u2019 automobile. Later, Pleasants turned into a parking lot at a restaurant and stopped his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The investigators pulled in next to Pleasants\u2019 vehicle and approached on foot. They saw Pleasants in the driver-seat and defendant in the passenger-seat. The investigators immediately started searching for the cash they had given to New to purchase cocaine from Pleasants. The investigators searched the interior of the vehicle, Pleasants\u2019 person, and eventually had Pleasants\u2019 vehicle \u201ctaken ... apart.\u201d A team from the sheriffs office, assisted by a dog, searched the area where the investigators had seen the brown object jettisoned from Pleasants\u2019 automobile. No object was found. Although the investigators found a small quantity of marijuana in the ashtray of Pleasants\u2019 vehicle, none of their searches produced the missing four hundred dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Investigator Pulliam contacted Deputy Jackie Shields and asked her to proceed to the scene of the stop. When Deputy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Shields arrived, Investigator Pulliam informed her in detail about the unsuccessful efforts to locate the missing money and asked her to search defendant. After some discussion about searching defendant in the restaurant, Deputy Shields transported defendant to the sheriffs department to conduct the search. She took defendant to an \u201cinterrogation room\u201d and told her to remove all of her clothing in preparation for a \u201cstrip search.\u201d After a search of defendant\u2019s discarded clothing and hair failed to reveal any money, Deputy Shields asked defendant if she had the money \u201con her body.\u201d Defendant, who at this point was naked, told the deputy that she \u201cdidn\u2019t have anything.\u201d Deputy Shields replied that she was \u201cgoing to have to be sure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Defendant then informed Deputy Shields that she was currently menstruating and asked to go to the bathroom \u201cto remove her ... personal protection.\u201d Deputy Shields refused defendant\u2019s request, and defendant \u201csquatted down\u201d in front of Deputy Shields and \u201cproceeded to remove her tampon.\u201d Deputy Shields then told defendant to \u201csquat again\u201d and cough three times. While defendant was squatting, Deputy Shields attempted to visually examine the exterior of defendant\u2019s vagina. She then told defendant to stand up against the wall. After putting a glove on her hand, Deputy Shields \u201cstuck her hand inside\u201d defendant\u2019s vagina and \u201cremoved the money from out of there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Deputy Shields testified that she was not a \u201cmedically-trained person.\u201d She was alone with defendant during the entirety of the search. No search warrant was obtained prior to the search of defendant\u2019s vaginal cavity.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The serial numbers on the money retrieved from defendant\u2019s vagina matched the numbers on the money the investigators had given to New to purchase crack cocaine from Pleasants. A short while later, defendant waived her <em>Miranda </em>rights and made an incriminating statement to Investigator Pulliam.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">A grand jury indicted defendant for distributing cocaine in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248 and possessing marijuana in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250.1. Prior to trial, defendant moved to suppress the money obtained during the search of her vaginal cavity and her subsequent statement to Investigator Pulliam on the ground that this evidence was obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Following a hearing, the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the money and her statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The trial court noted that defendant \u201cha[d] not raised any question about the validity of the arrest or ... being held in the custody of the sheriffs office.\u201d It stated that \u201cthe question ... is whether or not this was a reasonable search incident to an arrest.\u201d The trial court then concluded that Deputy Shields\u2019 search of \u201c[djefendant\u2019s body cavity\u201d was \u201can unreasonable search and seizure in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.\u201d It also concluded that to conduct a search of defendant\u2019s body cavity \u201cwithout medically-trained personnel present\u201d was constitutionally \u201cunreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">WARRANTLESS SEARCH OF DEFENDANT\u2019S VAGINAL CAVITY</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">The Commonwealth contends the trial court erred when it concluded that the search of defendant\u2019s vaginal cavity was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. The Commonwealth argues that the search of defendant\u2019s vaginal cavity was within the scope of Deputy Shields\u2019 authority to search defendant incident to her arrest and that the officers involved had reason to believe that the missing four hundred dollars was in defendant\u2019s vagina. In the alternative, the Commonwealth argues that the search of defendant\u2019s vaginal cavity was lawful under the Fourth Amendment because the officers involved had a clear indication that the cash would be found there and they were faced with exigent circumstances.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">This case raises the issue whether the scope of a police officer\u2019s authority under the Fourth Amendment to conduct a \u201cfull\u201d warrantless search of an arrestee\u2019s person incident to a lawful arrest includes the authority to search the arrestee\u2019s body cavities. We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The Fourth Amendment states that \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their <em>persons, </em>houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.... \u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV (emphasis added). Subject to a few specifically established exceptions, \u201csearches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are <em>per se </em>unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S.Ct. 507, 514, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967) (citations omitted). One of the established exceptions to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement is for a \u201csearch incident to a lawful arrest.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 224, 226, 94 S.Ct. 467, 471, 472, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973) (also holding that searches incident to arrest \u201cmeet the Fourth Amendment\u2019s requirement of reasonableness\u201d); <em>see also Chimel v. California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 762-63, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 2039-2040, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">When delineating the permissible scope of a warrantless search incident to arrest, the United States Supreme Court has stated that a lawful arrest of a suspect authorizes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>police to conduct \u201ca full search of the [arrestee\u2019s] person.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>414 U.S. at 235, 94 S.Ct. at 477. In addition, the police may search the area within the arrestee\u2019s immediate control, <em>see Chimel, </em>395 U.S. at 763, 89 S.Ct. at 2040, and seize his or her personal effects that are evidence of the crime. <em>See United States v. Edwards, </em>415 U.S. 800, 804-05, 94 S.Ct. 1234, 1237-38, 39 L.Ed.2d 771 (1974).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Furthermore, a police officer\u2019s decision to conduct a search incident to arrest is largely free from both prior or subsequent judicial scrutiny. The Supreme Court stated in <em>Robinson:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">A police officer\u2019s determination as to how and where to search the person of a suspect whom he has arrested is necessarily a quick <em>ad hoc </em>judgment which the Fourth Amendment does not require to be broken down in each instance into an analysis of each step in the search. The authority to search the person incident to a lawful custodial arrest, while based upon the need to disarm and to discover evidence, does not depend on what a court may later decide was the probability in a particular arrest situation that weapons or evidence would in fact be found upon the person of the suspect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-6\"><em>Robinson, </em>414 U.S. at 235, 94 S.Ct. at 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">However, the authority of the police under the Fourth Amendment to conduct a \u201cfull search\u201d of an arrestee\u2019s person without a warrant is only skin deep. The Supreme Court has stated that the scope of warrantless searches incident to arrest is not free from all constitutional restraint. <em>See Edwards, </em>415 U.S. at 808 n. 9, 94 S.Ct. at 1239 n. 9. It has also held that the considerations that justify the authority to search incident to a lawful arrest \u2014 the need to disarm the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>suspect and to prevent the destruction of evidence under the suspect\u2019s direct control \u2014 \u201chave little applicability with respect to searches involving intrusions beyond the body\u2019s surface.\u201d <em>Schmerber v. California, </em>384 U.S. 757, 769, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 1835, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">The interests in human dignity and privacy which the Fourth Amendment protects forbid any such intrusions on the mere chance that desired evidence might be obtained. In the absence of a clear indication that in fact such evidence will be found, these fundamental human interests require law officers to suffer the risk that such evidence may disappear unless there is an immediate search.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 769-70, 86 S.Ct. at 1835. A search of a body cavity is considered an \u201cintrusion\u201d into the body under <em>Schmerber </em>that falls outside the permissible scope of a search incident to arrest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The warrant requirement re-enters the picture when the police seek to search for evidence <em>inside </em>a suspect\u2019s body incident to arrest. \u201c[T]he police must obtain a warrant when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>they intend to seize an object outside the scope of a valid search incident to arrest....\u201d <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 484, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 2047, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">Search warrants are ordinarily required for searches of dwellings, and absent an emergency, no less could be required where intrusions into the human body are concerned. The requirement that a warrant be obtained is a requirement that inferences to support the search \u201cbe drawn by a neutral and detached magistrate instead of being judged by the officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.\u201d The importance of informed, detached and deliberate determinations of the issue whether or not to invade another\u2019s body in search of evidence of guilt is indisputable and great.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-6\"><em>Schmerber, </em>384 U.S. at 770, 86 S.Ct. at 1835 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Based on these principles, we hold that a warrant-less search involving a bodily intrusion, even though conducted incident to a lawful arrest, violates the Fourth Amendment unless (1) the police have a \u201cclear indication\u201d that evidence is located within a suspect\u2019s body and (2) the police face exigent circumstances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 770-71, 86 S.Ct. at 1835-36; <em>accord Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 87, 91, 455 S.E.2d 280, 282 (1995) (citing <em>Schmerber, </em>384 U.S. at 770, 86 S.Ct. at 1835-36). In addition, because the Fourth Amendment \u201cconstraints] ... against intrusions ... which are made in an improper manner,\u201d the means and procedures employed by the authorities to conduct a search involving an intrusion into the body must also satisfy \u201crelevant Fourth Amendment standards of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Schmerber, </em>384 U.S. at 768, 86 S.Ct. at 1834; <em>see also Winston v. Lee, </em>470 U.S. 753, 759-61, 105 S.Ct. 1611, 1615-17, 84 L.Ed.2d 662 (1985); <em>Edwards, </em>415 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>U.S. at 808 n. 9, 94 S.Ct. at 1239 n. 9; <em>Archer, </em>20 Va.App. at 91, 455 S.E.2d at 282.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">At a hearing on a defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the Commonwealth has the burden of proving that a warrant-less search or seizure did not violate the defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. <em>See Simmons v. Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 200, 204, 380 S.E.2d 656, 659 (1989); <em>Alexander v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 671, 674, 454 S.E.2d 39, 41 (1995). On appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>See Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991). We review the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact only for \u201cclear error,\u201d but we review <em>de novo </em>the trial court\u2019s application of defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>legal standards to the particular facts of a case. <em>See Shears v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 394, 398, 477 S.E.2d 309, 311 (1996); <em>see also Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Turning to the facts of this case, we hold that the warrantless search of defendant\u2019s vaginal cavity violated the Fourth Amendment. The circumstances apparent to the officers at the time of the search did not \u201cclearly indicate\u201d that the missing cash would be found inside defendant\u2019s vagina. Moreover, even assuming the existence of a clear indication, the officers involved were not faced with exigent circumstances that justified their decision to proceed with the search in the absence of a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">At the hearing on her motion to dismiss, the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to defendant indicated that Deputy Shields \u201cstuck her hand inside\u201d of defendant\u2019s vagina causing defendant to experience discomfort. The deputy felt and removed the cash. Because the deputy\u2019s search for the missing money involved an intrusion into defendant\u2019s vaginal cavity, it exceeded the scope of the deputy\u2019s authority to search defendant\u2019s person incident to arrest. Furthermore, the record indicates that the officers involved did not obtain a warrant prior to the search in accordance with <em>Schmerber. </em>Thus, at the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion, the Commonwealth had the burden of proving that the decision to subject defendant to a vaginal cavity search was justified by a \u201cclear indication\u201d and exigent circumstances. <em>See Schmerber, </em>384 U.S. at 770, 86 S.Ct. at 1835; <em>Archer, </em>20 Va.App. at 91, 455 S.E.2d at 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The record in this case does not establish that the officers had a \u201cclear indication\u201d the cash they had given to New to purchase cocaine from Pleasants would be found inside defendant\u2019s vagina. The officers testified that, while they were pursuing the vehicle driven by Pleasants, they saw \u201ca brown object come out of the passenger-side window.\u201d A dog-assisted search of the area failed to locate the object, and the investigators could not confirm that the \u201cbrown object\u201d did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>contain the missing money. In addition, the investigators had little information suggesting that defendant participated in the transaction between New and Pleasants.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Obviously, Pleas-ants could have discarded the \u201cbrown object\u201d by throwing it through the passenger-side window to the side of the roadway. The officers were not aware that defendant was in the vehicle with Pleasants during the transaction at New\u2019s residence, and they did not learn of her presence in Pleasants\u2019 vehicle until after it was stopped. Based upon the circumstances apparent to the investigators in this case, we cannot say they had a \u201cclear indication\u201d that the missing money would be found in defendant\u2019s vaginal cavity. Although the facts known to the investigators may have supported a hunch that defendant was concealing the missing cash inside her vagina, the Fourth Amendment requires the police to have a more apparent basis before subjecting an arrestee to the degrading and humiliating experience of a body cavity search. <em>Cf. Schmerber, </em>384 U.S. at 769-70, 86 S.Ct. at 1835 (stating that the Fourth Amendment forbids intrusions into the body \u201con the mere chance that desired evidence might be obtained\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">We also conclude that the failure of the investigators to obtain a search warrant prior to the search of defendant\u2019s vaginal cavity was not justified by exigent circumstances. The evidence sought by the officers was four hundred dollars in United States currency. No evidence in the record indicates that the evidentiary quality of the cash, such as the legibility of the serial numbers printed on the bills, was likely to be impaired by prolonged exposure to the environment of defendant\u2019s vaginal cavity. <em>See State v. Clark, </em>65 Haw. 488, 654 P.2d 355, 360 (1982) (stating that there was no risk that currency would dissipate by \u201cabsorption or dissolution\u201d while located inside arrestee\u2019s vagina); <em>cf. State v. Fontenot, </em>383 So.2d 365, 367 (La.1980) (stating that there was no danger that capsules enclosed in a pill bottle would be \u201cabsorbed or destroyed\u201d while located inside arrestee\u2019s vagina). Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>during the delay necessary to obtain a search warrant, defendant could have been observed and prevented from destroying the cash. <em>See Clark, </em>654 P.2d at 360; <em>Fontenot, </em>383 So.2d at 367. As such, we cannot say that the officers involved had a reasonable belief that the delay necessary to obtain a search warrant would have resulted in the destruction of the evidence sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Because we conclude that the police violated the Fourth Amendment when they subjected defendant to a warrantless search of her vaginal cavity, we need not address whether the manner in which this search was performed \u2014 by a non-medically-trained person in an interrogation room \u2014 was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Schmerber, </em>384 U.S. at 771-72, 86 S.Ct. at 1836-37. Although the trial court found the search unreasonable because it was conducted outside the presence of a medically-trained person, in light of our analysis of this case, \u201cthe right result reached by the trial court ... will nevertheless be approved.\u201d <em>Thims v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 85, 93, 235 S.E.2d 443, 447 (1977).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s order granting defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-9\">. The Commonwealth also argues that the trial court erroneously granted defendant's motion to suppress on the ground that the search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>of her vagina violated Code \u00a7 19.2-59.1(C). The relevant portion of Code \u00a7 19.2-59.1(C) states that, when a suspect is subject to custodial arrest, \"a search of any body cavity, other than the mouth, shall be conducted either by or under the supervision of medically trained personnel.\u201d The Commonwealth argues that the trial court erred because the suppression of evidence is not available as a remedy when evidence is obtained in violation of this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajt\">However, both the trial court's order and ruling from the bench indicate that its decision to grant defendant\u2019s motion to suppress was based <em>solely </em>on constitutional grounds. Because the trial court did not base its decision on statutory grounds, we need not address the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that suppression is not an available remedy when evidence is obtained in violation of Code \u00a7 19.2-59.1(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b370-8\">. <em>See also Illinois v.

City of Chicago, </em>723 F.2d 1263, 1271 (7th Cir.1983) (stating that \"the <em>Robinson </em>court simply did not contemplate the significantly greater intrusions that occur[]\u201d in a visual search of an arrestee\u2019s anal and vaginal cavities).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">Several state courts have similarly concluded that the broad authority of the police to search an arrestee's person incident to arrest is limited by the principles applicable to bodily intrusions set forth in <em>Schmerber. See State v. Clark, </em>65 Haw. 488, 654 P.2d 355, 361-62 (1982); <em>State v. Fontenot, </em>383 So.2d 365, 367 (La.1980); <em>cf. State v. Milligan, </em>304 Or. 659, 748 P.2d 130, 135 (1988); <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>157 Ill.App.3d 496, 109 Ill.Dec. 577, 579, 510 N.E.2d 445, 447 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>502 A.2d 489, 492 (Me.1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b372-8\">. \"Exigent circumstances\u201d in these situations include an officer\u2019s reasonable belief under the circumstances presented that the delay necessary to obtain a warrant will result in the destruction of evidence. <em>Schmerber, </em>384 U.S. at 770, 86 S.Ct. at 1835-36.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b373-7\">. We disagree with the Commonwealth that this case should be analyzed according to the framework applied by the Supreme Court in <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 558-60, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1884-85, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). In <em>Wolfish, </em>the Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment was not violated by the policy of a correctional facility requiring visual body cavity searches of pretrial detainees following every contact visit with a person from outside the institution. <em>See id. </em>at 558, 99 S.Ct. at 1884. The Supreme Court concluded that the visual cavity searches after contact visits met the \"test of reasonableness\u201d under the Fourth Amendment after balancing \"the significant and legitimate security interests of the [correctional facility] against the privacy interests of the inmates.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 599-60, 99 S.Ct. at 1884\u201485.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">The analytical framework set forth in <em>Wolfish </em>is inapplicable to this case because the searches in <em>Wolfish </em>were initiated under markedly different circumstances. <em>Wolfish </em>addressed the Fourth Amendment rights of pretrial detainees, \"persons who have been charged with a crime but who have not yet been tried on the charge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 523, 99 S.Ct. at 1865. The Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Wolfish </em>was based in part on the premise that \"[a] detainee simply does not possess the full range of [constitutional] freedom of an unincarcerated individual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546, 99 S.Ct. at 1878. Because a person who is searched incident to arrest is not yet incarcerated, he or she has greater constitutional protection than a pretrial detainee. As such, this case is controlled by the principles set forth in <em>Schmerber </em>rather than <em>Wolfish: </em>in order to conduct a lawful body cavity search of an arrestee, the police must (1) have a \"clear indication\u201d that evidence will be found and (2) either obtain a search warrant or face exigent circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b375-6\">. In her motion to suppress, defendant did not challenge the legality of her arrest. As such, we do not address this issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b376-10\">. Authorities who conduct body cavity searches are required to comply with procedures established by the General Assembly in Code \u00a7 19.2-59.1(C). Code\u00a7 19.2-59.1(C) states in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-11\">A search of any body cavity must be performed under sanitary conditions and a search of any body cavity, other than the mouth, shall be conducted either by or under the supervision of medically trained personnel.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b376-8\">COLE, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AiJ\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">I concur in the majority\u2019s decision to affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling to suppress the evidence. However, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the deputy sheriff did not have a \u201cclear indication\u201d that the evidence was located within Gilmore\u2019s body cavity.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>The Supreme Court has consistently held that searches are to be judged on a case-by-case basis and that all searches must be conducted in a reasonable manner. Here, the facts proved that a drug transaction occurred and that marked money had been given to the driver of the car in which the appellee, Gilmore, was a passenger. The police maintained surveillance of the car until it was stopped. A thorough search of the car failed to reveal the money. A non-intrusive search of Gilmore and the driver also failed to produce the money. Eliminating all reasonable explanations as to the whereabouts of the money, the police were faced with only one other possibility: that Gilmore had hidden the money on her person. After the police officer first performed a strip search, the only remaining possibility was that the money was hidden in appellant\u2019s body cavity. Therefore, contrary to the majority\u2019s view, I find, from the evidence a \u201cclear indication\u201d that Gilmore had secreted the money on her person.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">I do not believe, however, that the officers were faced with sufficient exigent circumstances to justify their decision to proceed with the internal body search in the absence of a search warrant. A medically-trained person did not perform the search. The evidence does not disclose that the procedure was performed in a manner reasonably ensuring the safety and health of the suspect. For this reason, I concur in the affirmance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
