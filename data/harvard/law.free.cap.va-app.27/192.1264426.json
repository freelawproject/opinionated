He contends the trial court erred when it (1) sentenced him for possession of cocaine while simultaneously possessing a firearm based on the assumption that he was convicted under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(B) rather than Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(A) and (2) ordered that his sentences for the firearm conviction and the cocaine conviction run consecutively. For the reasons that follow, we reverse in part, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">On January 21, 1997, a grand jury indicted appellant for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute (marijuana charge), possession of cocaine with intent to distribute (cocaine charge), and possession of cocaine while simultaneously possessing a firearm (firearm charge). The indictment for the firearm charge alleged that appellant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ady-\">did unlawfully and feloniously have in his possession or have under his control a certain drug, to-wit: Cocaine, a Schedule II controlled substance, and simultaneously with knowledge and intent did possess a firearm[] against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth of Virginia. \u00a7 18.2-308.4</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">On March 11, 1997, appellant was tried by the trial court and convicted of all three charges. The trial court\u2019s order regarding the conviction of the firearm charge stated that appellant was found guilty of \u201cunlawfully and feloniously [possessing] a certain drug, to-wit: Cocaine, a Schedule II controlled substance, and simultaneously with knowledge and intent did possess a firearm, in violation of Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4, <em>as charged in [the] </em>indictment....\u201d (Emphasis added). The trial court ordered the preparation of a presentence report and scheduled a hearing to sentence appellant on May 19,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">A sentencing hearing was held on May 19. During the hearing, the Commonwealth introduced a \u201csentencing guidelines recommendation\u201d prepared by a probation officer. The sentencing judge, who was not the judge who presided over appellant\u2019s trial, stated that he \u201cassume[d]\u201d that appellant was convicted of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(5). A first violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(B) carries with it a mandatory, nonsuspendable prison sentence of three years. When the probation officer stated that she had calculated appellant\u2019s sentence under the guidelines based on her impression that appellant was convicted of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(A), the sentencing judge ordered her to reapply the guidelines by assuming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>that the firearm conviction was under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(5). The application of the guidelines based on this change caused appellant\u2019s recommended sentence to increase from a range of \u201cten months to one year and eleven months\u201d with a midpoint of one year and nine months to a range of \u201cthree years to three years\u201d with a midpoint of three years. Over appellant\u2019s objection, the sentencing judge sentenced him to serve prison sentences of three years for the firearm conviction and ten years with eight years suspended for the cocaine conviction. Also over appellant\u2019s objection, the sentencing judge ordered the two sentences to run consecutively. The sentencing judge suspended the imposition of any sentence for the marijuana conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">SENTENCE FOR THE FIREARM CONVICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Appellant contends the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge for the firearm conviction was erroneous because the sentencing judge ordered the reapplication of the sentencing guidelines and sentenced appellant based on the faulty assumption that appellant was convicted under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(B). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">It is axiomatic that a convicted criminal defendant must be sentenced according to the range of punishments authorized for the crime of which he was convicted. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-295 (stating that the jury or trial court shall ascertain a convicted defendant\u2019s punishment \u201cwithin the limits prescribed by law\u201d); <em>cf. Brown v. Commonwealth, 8 </em>Va.App. 126, 132, 380 S.E.2d 8, 11 (1989) (stating that \u201cmanifest injustice results when a person is sentenced for a crime other than that for which he was convicted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">Subsections (A) and (B) of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4 constitute separate grades of a criminal offense, each of which carries its own distinct punishment. Under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(A), it is unlawful to possess a firearm while simultaneously <em>possessing </em>a controlled substance \u201cclassified in Schedule I or II of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Drug Control Act.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(A) is punishable as a Class 6 felony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(A). Subsection (A) does not mandate a particular term of incarceration or limit a sentencing court\u2019s discretion either to suspend the sentence it imposes or to order the sentence to run concurrently with jail time imposed for other offenses. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(A). Under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(B), it is unlawful to possess a firearm while simultaneously <em>possessing with intent to distribute </em>a controlled substance \u201cclassified in Schedule I or II of the Drug Control Act.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A violation of subsection (B) is a \u201cseparate and distinct felony\u201d that is punishable by a mandatory \u201cterm of imprisonment of three years for a first conviction and for a term of five years for a second or subsequent conviction.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Significantly, the three-year prison sentence mandated by subsection (B) may <em>not </em>be suspended by a sentencing court and is <em>required </em>to run consecutively with the punishment received \u201cfor the commission of the primary felony.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(B). Thus, if appellant was charged with and convicted of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(A), then it was error for the sentencing judge to sentence him as if he were convicted of violating subsection (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">We hold that the sentencing judge erred when he assumed appellant was convicted of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(B). Instead, the language of the trial court\u2019s conviction order and the grand jury\u2019s indictment establishes that appellant was charged with and convicted of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Appellant could not have been convicted of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(B) because he was not charged with violating this subsection. When considering on appeal whether an indictment charged a particular offense, we limit our scrutiny to the face of the document. When a statute, such as Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4, \u201ccontains more than one grade of an offense and each grade carries a different punishment[,] the indictment must contain an assertion of the facts essential to the punishment sought to be imposed.\u201d <em>Hall v. Commonwealth, 8 </em>Va.App. 350, 352, 381 S.E.2d 512, 513 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Based on our review of the face of indictment No. CR97-1902 and the text of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4, we conclude that the indictment only charged appellant of violating subsection (A) of that code section. The indictment neither makes direct reference to subsection (B) nor alleges all of the material facts necessary to constitute a violation of that subsection. Specifically, the indictment does not allege that appellant had <em>\u201cthe intent to manufacture, sell, or distribute </em>\u201d the cocaine he possessed while simultaneously possessing a firearm. Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(B). Moreover, the language of the indictment is nearly identical to the text of subsection (A). <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(A). Even if the grand jury intended to charge appellant with violating subsection (B), the language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>indictment was inadequate to provide appellant with notice of this charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">The Commonwealth argues that because appellant was charged with possession of cocaine \u201cwith intent to distribute,\u201d that he should have known he was charged under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(B). However, this argument overlooks the principle that the charge set forth in an indictment must be apparent from the <em>face </em>of the document. None of the information that is essential to provide an accused with adequate notice of a particular charge can be added to an indictment by speculating, after the fact, about the possible intention of the writer of the instrument. As this Court has stated in response to a similar argument, \u201c[t]he defendant cannot be expected to have assumed that he was charged with the greater of the two offenses unless it was expressly charged in the indictment.\u201d <em>Hall, 8 </em>Va.App. at 352, 381 S.E.2d at 513. We cannot say without disregarding the express language of the indictment and resorting to inference or surmise that the indictment in question was intended to charge appellant of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Because the trial court stated that it found appellant guilty of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4 \u201cas charged in [the] indictment\u201d and the indictment only charged appellant with violating Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(A), the sentencing judge erred when he sentenced appellant based on a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(5). We cannot say this error was harmless because it is unclear from the record what the sentence would have been but for the trial judge\u2019s faulty assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">CONSECUTIVE PRISON SENTENCES</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Appellant also contends the sentencing judge erred when he ordered appellant\u2019s prison sentences for the firearm conviction and the cocaine conviction to run consecutively. We conclude that the sentencing judge\u2019s faulty assumption that appellant was convicted of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(B) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>necessitates that we vacate his decision to order consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Generally, a sentencing court has discretion under Code \u00a7 19.2-308 to order multiple prison sentences to run concurrently. <em>See Wood v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1257, 1259, 408 S.E.2d 568, 569 (1991). However, the sentencing court lacks this discretion when sentencing a defendant who stands convicted of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(B). Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(B) expressly requires that any prison term imposed for a violation of that subsection run <em>consecutively </em>with the prison sentence that is imposed for the primary felony. Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(A), on the other hand, does not limit the sentencing court\u2019s discretion in this way. Because we cannot say the sentencing judge\u2019s assumption that appellant was convicted of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(B) did not affect his decision to order appellant\u2019s prison sentences to run consecutively rather than concurrently, the trial court shall reconsider this issue following its resentencing of appellant for the firearm conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the sentence imposed upon appellant for his conviction of possession of cocaine while simultaneously possessing a firearm in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(A) and vacate the sentencing judge\u2019s order requiring appellant\u2019s prison sentences to run consecutively.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\n<em>Reversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-5\">. Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(A) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">Any person unlawfully in possession of a controlled substance classified in Schedule I or II of the Drug Control Act (\u00a7 54.1-3400 et seq.) of Title 54.1 who simultaneously with knowledge and intent possesses any firearm, shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b239-7\">. A Class 6 felony is punishable by</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-8\">a term of imprisonment of not less than one year nor more than five years, or in the discretion of the jury, or the court trying the case without a jury, confinement in jail for not more than twelve months and a fine of not more than $2,500, either or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Code \u00a7 18.2 \u2014 10(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b239-10\">. Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(B) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-11\">It shall be unlawful for any person to possess, use, or attempt to use any pistol, shotgun, rifle, or other firearm or display such weapon in a threatening manner while committing or attempting to commit the illegal manufacture, sale, distribution, or the possession with the intent to manufacture, sell, or distribute a controlled substance classified in Schedule I or Schedule II of the Drug Control Act (\u00a7 54.1-3400 et seq.) of Title 54.1 or more than one pound of marijuana. Violation of this subsection shall constitute a separate and distinct felony and any person convicted thereof shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three years for a first conviction and for a term of five years for a second or subsequent conviction under this subsection. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the sentence prescribed for a violation of this subsection shall not be suspended in whole or in part, nor shall anyone convicted hereunder be placed on probation or parole for this offense. Such punishment shall be separate and apart from, and shall be made to run consecutive with, any punishment received for the commission of the primary felony.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b242-7\">. Appellant did not challenge on appeal either the substance of the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge for the cocaine conviction or the sentencing judge\u2019s decision to suspend the imposition of a sentence for the marijuana conviction. As such, these aspects of appellant\u2019s sentence are undisturbed by our decision today.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
