He contends the trial court erred when it refused to instruct the jury on the crime of accessory after the fact to murder. For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">Appellant was charged with three crimes: (1) murder \u201cin the commission of or attempt to commit robbery,\u201d (2) murder, and (3) \u201cuse [of] a shotgun in committing or attempting to commit murder or robbery.\u201d None of the indictments against appellant expressly charged him with being an accessory after the fact to any of these crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">The evidence at appellant\u2019s trial proved that, on December 17, 1995, the body of Clark Aubrey Adkins (victim) was found buried in a shallow grave in a wooded area about two-tenths of a mile from the nearest state road. The victim had been killed by a gunshot wound to his right upper chest. The victim also had been shot a second time in his left side \u201cjust above the belt\u201d after his heart had stopped beating. The Commonwealth produced no \u201cscientific evidence,\u201d such as DNA, blood, or fingerprints, that linked appellant to the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">Three witnesses, Ronald Cassady, Matthew Cassady, and Jimmy Cook, testified that appellant confessed to killing the victim during the week of December 12. Ronald Cassady testified that appellant told him that \u201cwhen [the victim] come down the road, he was laying in the road and jumped up when [the victim] stopped and shot him.\u201d Matthew Cassady testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>fled that appellant told him \u201che met ... [the victim] on his grandma\u2019s road, and somehow he got in the car or something and he shot him.\u201d Matthew Cassady also testified that appellant said he killed the victim \u201cbecause [the victim] raped his sister, Mary Dalton.\u201d Jimmy Cook testified that, after appellant drafted a note confessing to the murder, he explained his reasons for doing so. According to Cook, appellant \u201csaid he wanted to write a note ... because he said he done it all by himself, and he didn\u2019t want to get his sister or Joseph [Smith] [appellant\u2019s sister\u2019s boyfriend], to get neither one of them blamed for something they didn\u2019t do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The Commonwealth also introduced into evidence a note written and signed by appellant in which appellant stated that he \u201cdid in fact kill [the victim] ... and Mary and Jos[e]ph did not have inthing [sic] to do with it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">At trial, appellant denied shooting the victim. Appellant testified that, on December 12, he and Joseph Smith were sitting in the woods watching his sister, Mary Dalton, as she attempted to buy marijuana from the victim while in his car. Appellant testified that after his sister exited the victim\u2019s car, he saw Smith approach the victim and shoot him twice. According to appellant, Smith \u201cshot [the victim] one time through the passenger side door, and he reloaded, and he walked around and he opened the driver\u2019s side door and shot him again.\u201d After the shooting, appellant helped Smith place the victim\u2019s body in the trunk and accompanied Smith as he drove the victim\u2019s car to a remote location in the woods. Appellant testified that, at some point, Smith took \u201cbetween twelve hundred and fifteen hundred dollars\u201d and some \u201cpot\u201d from the victim\u2019s body and distributed it among himself, appellant, and appellant\u2019s sister. \u201cA couple of days later,\u201d appellant helped Smith carry the victim\u2019s body from the trunk of his car to a location in the woods where Smith buried it. Appellant testified that he wrote his confession note \u201c \u2019cause [he] didn\u2019t want [his sister] to go to jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">At the conclusion of the evidence, appellant requested a jury instruction on the crime of being an \u201caccessory after the fact.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>When the trial court refused to give the instruction, appellant asked the trial court to note his exception to this ruling. Appellant argued that an instruction on accessory after the fact was warranted \u201cbased on the evidence in this case.\u201d The trial court stated for the record that it refused appellant\u2019s request for an instruction on accessory after the fact \u201cbecause [it did] not think that accessory after the fact is a lesser included offense to any of the charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The jury convicted appellant of first degree murder but acquitted him of the firearm charge. The trial court subsequently dismissed the indictment charging appellant with murder in the commission of or attempt to commit robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">JURY INSTRUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Appellant contends the trial court erred when it re- \u2022 fused to instruct the jury on the crime of being an \u201caccessory after the fact.\u201d He argues (1) that Rule 3A:17(c) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia entitled him to an instruction on accessory after the fact if more than a scintilla of evidence supported this theory of the case, and (2) that the evidence was sufficient to warrant such an instruction. We agree that the jury should have been instructed that this disposition of the case was an option when it determined its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">As a preliminary matter, we disagree with the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that appellant is precluded by Rule 5A:18 from relying on Rule 3A:17(c) to support his argument on appeal. We have previously held that, in light of the relaxed procedural rule for noting exceptions under Code \u00a7 8.01-384, the tendering of a jury instruction is all that is required to place the trial court on notice that the party requesting the instruction is legally entitled to it and that sufficient evidence supports granting the instruction. <em>See Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 524, 529-30, 414 S.E.2d 401, 404-05 (1992) <em>(en banc). </em>By requesting an instruction on accessory after the fact, appellant fully alerted the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>that the jury should be permitted to convict him of this offense under Rule 3A:17(c) and Code \u00a7 19.2-286. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 530, 414 S.E.2d at 404 (stating that tendered instruction had the effect of notifying trial court that simple assault is a lesser-included offense of attempted capital murder). The record indicates that after the trial court refused to give appellant\u2019s requested accessory-after-the-fact instruction, appellant expressly asked the trial court to note his exception to this ruling and argued that an instruction on accessory after the fact was proper \u201cbased on the evidence in this case.\u201d We hold that appellant preserved for appeal his objection to the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant his tendered jury instruction based on Rule 3A:17(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">This case presents an issue of first impression in Virginia: whether a criminal defendant who has not been expressly charged with the crime of being an \u201caccessory after the fact\u201d has a right to a jury instruction on the offense of being an accessory after the fact to the crime of which he or she was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">\u201cA reviewing court\u2019s responsibility in reviewing jury instructions is \u2018to see that the law has been clearly stated and that the instructions cover all issues which the evidence fairly raises.\u2019 \u201d <em>Darnell v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 485, 488, 370 S.E.2d 717, 719 (1988) (quoting <em>Swisher v. Swisher, </em>223 Va. 499, 503, 290 S.E.2d 856, 858 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Neither the Code nor the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia set forth the jury instructions that the trial court must give upon the request of a defendant at the conclusion of the evidence in a criminal case. However, it is well established as a matter of common law that \u201c[i]t belongs to the [trial] court to instruct the jury as to the law, whenever they require instruction, or either of the parties request it to be given.\u201d <em>Thornton v. Commonwealth, </em>65 Va. (24 Gratt.) 228, 230 (1874). It is equally well established that \u201c[a] defen-, dant is entitled to have the jury instructed only on those theories of the case that are supported by the evidence,\u201d and a trial court errs when it refuses such an instruction that is supported by \u201cmore than a scintilla\u201d of evidence. <em>Frye v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number><em>Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 370, 388, 345 S.E.2d 267, 280 (1986); <em>see also Baylor v. Hoover, </em>123 Va. 659, 660-61, 97 S.E. 309, 310 (1918); <em>Bowles v. Commonwealth, </em>103 Va. 816, 830-81, 48 S.E. 527, 532 (1904).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The scope of the jury instructions that the trial court is required to give upon request of a party is linked to the range of dispositions of a particular case that are available to the jury as a matter of right. For example, \u201cat common law the jury was permitted to find the defendant guilty of any lesser offense necessarily included in the offense charged.\u201d <em>Beck v. Alabama, </em>447 U.S. 625, 633, 100 S.Ct. 2382, 2387, 65 L.Ed.2d 392 (1980); <em>see also Keeble v. United States, </em>412 U.S. 205, 208, 93 S.Ct. 1993, 1995, 36 L.Ed.2d 844 (1973); <em>Hardy v. Commonwealth, </em>58 Va. (17 Gratt.) 592, 616, 618-20 (1867) (stating that under Virginia common law, \u201ca party might be convicted of any offence substantially charged in the indictment, provided it was of the same grade [either felony or misdemeanor] with the principal or total offence charged\u201d). Thus, as a matter of common law, \u201c[i]t is reversible error for the trial court to refuse to instruct the jury on the lesser offenses charged in the indictment if there is any evidence in the record tending to prove such lesser offenses.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>186 Va. 587, 591, 43 S.E.2d 906, 908 (1947) (citations omitted); <em>see also Barrett v. Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 102, 107, 341 S.E.2d 190, 193 (1986); <em>McClung v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 654, 657, 212 S.E.2d 290, 292-93 (1975); <em>Porterfield v. Commonwealth, </em>91 Va. 801, 803, 22 S.E. 352, 353 (1895); <em>Miller v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 22, 24, 359 S.E.2d 841, 842 (1987); 23A C.J.S. <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 1357 (1989) (stating that \u201c[t]he right to a jury instruction on a lesser included offense ... is purely a matter of common law\u201d). Conversely, we have stated as a general proposition that \u201can accused on trial for one offense is not entitled to have the jury instructed on' an offense which is not included as a lesser offense of the one charged.\u201d <em>Simms v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 614, 616, 346 S.E.2d 734, 735 (1986); <em>see also Crump v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 286, 290, 411 S.E.2d 238, 241 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>(1991); <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 649, 651, 400 S.E.2d 794, 795 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">Prior to the amendment of Code \u00a7 19.2-286 in 1960,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a defendant not charged with being an accessory after the fact was not entitled to a jury instruction on this offense because the crime of being an accessory after the fact is not a lesser-included offense of other crimes. \u201cWhether one offense is a lesser included offense of the other depends upon whether the elements of the greater offense necessarily include all elements of the lesser.\u201d <em>Fontaine v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 156, 164, 487 S.E.2d 241, 245 (1997). \u201cA lesser included offense is an offense which is composed entirely of elements that are also elements of the greater offense.\u201d <em>Kauffmann v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 400, 409, 382 S.E.2d 279, 283 (1989). \u201cAn offense is not a lesser included offense of another if each offense contains an element that the other does not.\u201d <em>Walker v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 203, 206, 415 S.E.2d 446, 448 (1992). The elements of being an accessory after the fact are not wholly contained in any other offense. In order to convict a defendant of being an accessory after the fact, the Commonwealth must prove three elements: that the defendant (1) \u201creceive[d], relieve[d], eomfort[ed] or assisted]\u201d a felon (2) after knowing that the felon was guilty of committing a completed felony and (3) that the felony was, in fact, completed. <em>See Manley v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 642, 644, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>283 S.E.2d 207, 208 (1981). The second of these elements\u2014 that the defendant knew that he or she was assisting a felon guilty of a <em>completed </em>felony \u2014 is unique to the crime of accessory after the fact and is not included in any other offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Thornton, </em>65 Va. (24 Gratt.) at 232 (stating that \u201c[a]t common law an accessory could not be convicted on an indictment against him as a principal felon\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">However, the General Assembly has added to the offenses for which an accused felon may request a jury instruction by empowering juries to convict accused felons of both \u201cattempt\u201d and being an \u201caccessory,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> even though neither of these crimes was expressly charged in the felony indictment. Code \u00a7 19.2-286 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">On an indictment for felony the jury may find the accused not guilty of the felony but guilty of an attempt to commit such felony, or of being an accessory thereto; and a general verdict of not guilty, upon such indictment, shall be a bar to a subsequent prosecution for an attempt to commit such felony, or of being an accessory thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">This Code provision has been incorporated into the rules regulating jury verdicts in criminal cases. <em>See </em>Rule 3A:17(c) (stating that \u201c[w]hen the offense charged is a felony, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>accused may be found not guilty thereof, but guilty of being an accessory after the fact to that felony\u201d). Applying this statute, the Virginia Supreme Court has stated that a felony indictment \u201cembraces\u201d as a \u201clesser offense\u201d the crimes listed in Code \u00a7 19.2-286. <em>See Willoughby v. Smyth, </em>194 Va. 267, 271, 72 S.E.2d 686, 638-39 (1952) (applying Code \u00a7 19-227, which was an earlier version of Code \u00a7 19.2-286). Although the crime of being an \u201caccessory after the fact\u201d is technically not a lesser-included offense of any other crime, we hold that a criminal defendant is entitled to an instruction on this crime, if such an instruction is warranted by the evidence, based upon the jury\u2019s statutory power under Code \u00a7 19.2-286. Thus, the trial court erred when it ruled that appellant was not entitled to an instruction on the crime of being an accessory after the fact merely because it was not \u201ca lesser included offense to any of the charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">Turning to the facts of this case, we hold that the evidence was sufficient to mandate a jury instruction on the offense of being an accessory after the fact. When determining whether sufficient evidence warranted a particular instruction, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party requesting the instruction. <em>See Foster v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 380, 383, 412 S.E.2d 198, 200 (1991). Appellant\u2019s testimony provided ample support for his theory that he was only an accessory after the fact to the crimes committed against the victim. Appellant testified that Joseph Smith, his sister\u2019s boyfriend, shot the victim in his car while appellant was sitting nearby in the woods. Appellant testified that after the shooting, he helped Smith place the victim\u2019s body in the trunk and accompanied Smith as he drove the victim\u2019s car to a remote location in the woods. Appellant testified that, at some point, Smith took money and \u201cpot\u201d from the victim\u2019s body and distributed it between himself, appellant, and appellant\u2019s sister. Appellant testified that a few days later he helped Smith carry the victim\u2019s body from the trunk of the car to a location in the woods where Smith buried it. Based on this evidence, a jury could have concluded that appellant was only guilty of being an accessory after the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the conviction of first degree murder and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b431-5\">. The statute that is now known as Code \u00a7 19.2-286 was enacted by the General Assembly in 1848, <em>see </em>1847-48 Va.Acts ch. 120, and has appeared in every subsequent version of the Virginia Code. <em>See </em>Code tit. 55, ch. 208, \u00a7 32 (1849); Code tit. 55, ch. 208, \u00a7 31 (1860); Code ch. 202, \u00a7 31 (1873); Code \u00a7 4044 (1887); Code \u00a7 4044 (1904); Code \u00a7 4922 (1919); Code \u00a7 19-227 (1950); Code \u00a7 19.1-254 (repl. vol. 1960); Code \u00a7 19.2-286 (repl. vol. 1975); Code \u00a7 19.2-286 (repl. vol. 1995). Since its enactment, the text of this statute has been amended only twice \u2014 in 1960 and 1975. See 1960 Va.Acts ch. 366; 1975 Va.Acts ch. 495. In 1960, the General Assembly extended the reach of this statute, which was then codified at Code \u00a7 19.1-254, to include the crime \"of being an accessory after the fact.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-254 (repl. vol. 1960); <em>see </em>1960 Va.Acts ch. 366. In 1975, the General Assembly modified this particular language to \"of being an accessory thereto.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-286 (repl. vol. 1975); <em>see </em>1975 Va.Acts ch. 495.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b432-8\">. In <em>Goodson v. Commonwealth, </em>a panel of this Court indicated that the crime of being an accessory after the fact might be a lesser-included offense of attempted murder and robbery. <em>See 22 </em>Va.App. 61, 78-79, 467 S.E.2d 848, 857 (1996). However, it is clear from the context of this statement in <em>Goodson </em>that it was pure dictum. The Court was not formally addressing the issue of whether accessory after the fact was a lesser-included offense of attempted murder and robbery, and the opinion is devoid of any analysis comparing the elements of these three crimes. Instead, the <em>Goodson </em>court was analyzing whether the record contained more than a scintilla of evidence to support an accessory-after-the-fact instruction. Thus, <em>Goodson </em>does not provide authoritative support for the proposition that the crime of being an accessory after the fact is a lesser-included offense of either attempted murder or robbery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b432-9\">. This Code section does not purport to distinguish between accessories before the fact and accessories after the fact. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-18, - 19, and -21. Because Code \u00a7 19.2-286 recognizes no distinction, we must interpret the provision as applicable to both forms of accessory liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b434-6\">COLE, Senior Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AMj\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">I dissent because the trial judge correctly refused to grant an instruction based upon the appellant being an accessory after the fact. The instruction was neither grounded upon the charged offense of first degree murder, a lesser-included offense to first degree murder, nor upon any offense substantially charged as provided in Rule 3A:17(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">The facts necessary to determine the issue on appeal are not in dispute. Aubrey Adkins was murdered. Appellant was indicted and convicted of first degree murder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although the Commonwealth presented sufficient and credible evidence to the contrary, appellant testified that he did not participate in the killing and had no prior knowledge of it. He admitted being present at the scene at the time of the murder and being aware of its commission. However, he denied that he planned or assisted in the crime in any way prior to or during its commission. He admitted participation after the murder in disposing of the body and sharing in money and marijuana taken from the deceased after the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">On appeal, appellant asserts that an instruction on an accessory after the fact to first degree murder was vital to his defense. He claims that a person accused of a crime is entitled to instructions which present the accused\u2019s defense from his or her point of view. He admits that from the evidence presented, the jury could have found him guilty as charged in the indictment, but the only other option the trial judge gave the jury was to acquit him. He acknowledges that the jury was not likely to do this under the evidence. The jury was not permitted to consider whether he was guilty of being an accessory after the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Citing <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 649, 651, 400 S.E.2d 794, 795 (1991), the Commonwealth defends upon the premise that an accused is not entitled to have the jury-instructed on an offense which is not the charged offense, or a lesser-included offense of the charged offense. It contends that an accessory after the fact is not a lesser-included offense of first degree murder; therefore, appellant was not entitled to the instruction as a matter of law. In its .opinion, the majority finds that an accessory after the fact is not a lesser-included offense to any crime. However, it holds that appellant was entitled to an instruction on the offense of being an accessory after the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The trial court prepared seventeen (17) instructions fully and fairly covering all aspects of the first degree murder charge. The trial judge asked counsel if there were any objections to these instructions, and none were made. The instruction requested by appellant is not a part of the record. Moreover, the record does not show that the instruction was tendered to the court or even existed. The entire record pertaining to the instruction follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">[Defense counsel]: [N]ote our objection to the court\u2019s ruling that they will not grant us an instruction on accessory after the fact. I would submit that based on the evidence in this case, that would be proper to instruct the jury on that, and therefore we would note our exception to the Court\u2019s ruling that they will not grant us an instruction on being an accessory after the fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">[Trial Judge]: [Y]ou have asked that an instruction be given on the defendant as an accessory after the fact, and I have refused to give that instruction. My ruling was because I do not think that is a lesser included offense to any of the charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">The majority holds that this ruling was erroneous and the failure to give an instruction on \u201caccessory after the fact\u201d constitutes reversible error. The majority reasons that the General Assembly when enacting Code \u00a7 19.2-286 and the Supreme Court when adopting Rule 3A:17(c) empowered ju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>r\u00edes to convict an accused charged with a felony as \u201can accessory after the fact to that felony\u201d where the evidence supports such an instruction, even though the accused was not indicted upon the charge or such offense was not substantially charged or necessarily included in the charged offense against the accused. The majority concludes that the trial court was required to give an instruction based upon the evidence that appellant committed certain illegal acts after the crime charged was completed. The majority decision would result in the requirement that a trial court give an accessory after the fact instruction in every case, despite the absence of an indictment or summons for the offense. The Commonwealth did not elect to prosecute appellant as an accessory after the fact but chose to prosecute on other offenses. The Commonwealth would, in many cases, have no notice that a defendant would attempt to divert the attention of the jury from deciding the guilt or innocence on the charged offense or one substantially charged or necessarily included in the charge against the accused and require it to consider an independent offense not charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Because the majority bases its decision upon the authority of Code \u00a7 19.2-286 and Rule 3A:17(c), both of which deal with jury verdicts, I shall consider each of them. But, before doing so, I will review the other required procedures that must have occurred before the jury is instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Under the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution, a criminal defendant must be given clear notification of the offense charged. The Virginia Constitution provides \u201cthat in criminal prosecutions a man hath a right to demand the cause and nature of his accusation.\u201d Va. Const, art. I, \u00a7 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">To carry out these constitutional mandates, the General Assembly has by statute set forth certain procedures. It has provided for grand juries to consider bills of indictment, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-191; it has commanded the use of indictments, presentments, and informations, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-216; and it has made provision for preliminary hearings, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-218. It has directed that an \u201cindictment or information shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>be a plain, concise, and definite written statement, (1) naming the accused, (2) describing the offense charged,\u201d (3) locating where the offense was committed, and (4) reciting the date of the offense. Code \u00a7 19.2-220. Rules of Court require citation of the statute or ordinance that defines the offense. <em>See </em>Rule 3A:6. The General Assembly has provided for an arraignment, which consists of reading to the accused the charge on which he or she will be tried and calling on the accused to plead thereto. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-254. An accused may plead not guilty, guilty or <em>nolo contendere.

Torcia, <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 261, at 121 (13th ed. 1990). The problem surrounding the accusation stage of \u201cattempts\u201d reached the Virginia Supreme Court in <em>Cates v. Commonwealth, </em>111 Va. 837, 69 S.E. 520 (1910). The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\">An intention to commit a felony and the doing of some act towards its commission without actually committing it, an attempt that being the offense of which the accused was found guilty on the former trial, it was necessarily included in the charge of rape, otherwise there could be no conviction for that offense on the indictment for rape, <em>for no one can be convicted of an offense not embraced or included in the charge against him.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">The attempt being included in or a part of, the offense charged, a conviction of the attempt would be an acquittal of the principal or major offense of rape.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 841, 69 S.E. at 521 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">Creating no new authority, but restating what had been the law for years, Code \u00a7 4922 appeared in the 1942 Code as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-9\">On an indictment for felony the jury may find the accused not guilty of the felony, but guilty of an attempt to commit such felony....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">Code \u00a7 4922 was followed by Code \u00a7 19.1-254. In 1960, the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 19.1-254 to read in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-11\">On an indictment for felony the jury may find the accused not guilty of the felony but guilty of an attempt to commit such felony, <em>or of being an accessory after the </em>fact....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqv\">(Emphasis added.).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">Effective October 1, 1975, the General Assembly repealed Title 19.1 and enacted it as Title 19.2. Code \u00a7 19.1-254 was re-written as \u00a7 19.2-286. Only one change was made. The language \u201caccessory after the fact\u201d was replaced with \u201caccessory thereto.\u201d This language remains to date. Accessory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>after the fact is a misnomer because an accessory after the fact is not an accessory at all. To prove someone was an accessory after the fact, the government must prove that the person became involved \u201cafter the commission of a felony.\u201d Thus, the crime of being an accessory after the fact is an independent crime, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-19, and is codified under a separate statute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">An accessory after the fact is not a party to the principal crime. By definition, such an accessory can be guilty of a crime only after the principal crime is an accomplished fact. It follows that an accessory after the fact must be charged as such, and not as a party to the principal crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">2 Torcia, <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Procedure, supra, </em>\u00a7 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The Code of Virginia does not specifically define an accessory after the fact. Hence, we resort to the common law for a definition. Virginia law classifies an accessory after the fact as a Class 1 misdemeanor. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-19. The punishment is confinement in jail for not more than twelve months and a fine of not more than $2,500, either or both. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Case law has defined an accessory after the fact as a person who, knowing a felony to have been committed by another, receives, reheves, comforts or assists the felon. <em>See Manley v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 642, 644-45, 283 S.E.2d 207, 208 (1981). \u201cTo constitute one an accessory after the fact, three things are requisite: (1) The felony must be completed; (2) He must know that the felon is guilty; (3) He must receive, reheve, comfort or assist him.\u201d <em>Wren v. Commonwealth, </em>67 Va. (26 Gratt.) 952, 956 (1875).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">\u201cAn accessory after the fact has not contributed to the commission of a crime; his criminality is found in his post-crime assistance which is hkely to impede the prosecution of the perpetrator.\u201d Roger D. Groot, <em>Criminal Offenses and Defenses in Virginia, </em>at 354 (3d ed. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">By removing the phrase \u201caccessory after the fact\u201d from Code \u00a7 19.1-254, the General Assembly evinced its intent to eliminate accessories after the fact from the purview of the statute. Because an accessory after the fact is not a party to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>the principal crime, has not planned or assisted in it, and is a separate and independent crime that must be charged as such, it does not come within the statutory term \u201caccessory thereto.\u201d Therefore, the words \u201caccessory thereto\u201d could not logically refer to accessories after the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">This interpretation is consistent with Code \u00a7 18.2-18, which provides \u201c[i]n the case of every felony, every principal in the second degree and every accessory before the fact may be indicted, tried, convicted and punished in all respects as if a principal in the first degree.\u201d Accessory after the fact is not placed in this classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Under the annotations to Code \u00a7 18.2-18, crimes are classified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">II. Who are Principals and Accessories.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">A. Principal in First Degree</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-9\">B. Principal in Second Degree</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-10\">C. Accessory Before the Fact</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-11\">D. Capital Murder</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">It is significant that an accessory after the fact is not included in the classification of \u201cprincipals\u201d and \u201caccessories\u201d; because it is a misdemeanor and an independent crime in itself, logic dictates that it be excluded from the classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-13\">At common law, an accessory after the fact was treated as a party to the underlying felony. However, the clear trend today is that the accessory after the fact is no longer treated as a party to the crime. This kind of accessory is now recognized as an \u201c \u2018obstructor\u2019 of justice, the author of a separate and independent offense.\u201d <em>See </em>1 Charles E. Torcia, <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 35, at 535 (15th Ed.1993) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-14\">From the above authority, I conclude that Code \u00a7 19.2-286 has no application to accessories after the fact and the terminology \u201caccessory thereto\u201d refers only to principals in the first degree, principals in the second degree and accessories before the fact. Therefore, appellant\u2019s argument receives no additional support from this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>\n<em>Rule 3A: 17(c)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Part Three A of the Rules of the Supreme Court was adopted June 15, 1971, and made effective January 1, 1972. Former Rule 3A:24(e) substantially tracked Code \u00a7 19.1-254 (now Code \u00a7 19.2-286), which at that time contained the phrase \u201caccessory after the fact\u201d and not \u201caccessory thereto.\u201d Former Rule 3A:24(c), which was changed to Rule 3A:17(c), provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">(c) <em>Conviction of Lesser Offense </em>\u2014 The accused may be found not guilty of an offense charged but guilty of any offense, or of an attempt to commit any offense, that is substantially charged or necessarily included in the charge against the accused. When the offense charged is a felony, the accused may be found not guilty thereof, but guilty of being an accessory after the fact to that felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">In 1975, when the language of Code \u00a7 19.2-286 was changed from \u201caccessory after the fact\u201d to \u201caccessory thereto,\u201d the rule was not changed to conform to the statute and continued to contain the language \u201caccessory after the fact.\u201d However, Rule 3A:17(c) contained the following new language not contained in the statute: <em>\u201cthat is substantially charged or necessarily included in the charge against the accused.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The rules are \u201cintended to provide for the just determination of criminal proceedings. They shall be interpreted so as to promote uniformity and simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration, and the elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay.\u201d Rule 3A:2. \u201cIn the case of any variance between a rule and an enactment of the General Assembly such variance shall be construed so as to give effect to such enactment.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-3(D). <em>See Soliman v. Soliman, </em>12 Va.App. 234, 240, 402 S.E.2d 922, 926 (1991). \u201cIf the several provisions of a statute suggest a potential for conflict or inconsistency, we construe those provisions so as to reconcile them and to give full effect to the expressed legislative intent.\u201d <em>Mejia v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 173, 176-77, 474 S.E.2d 866, 868 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Rule 3A:17 is entitled <em>Jury Verdicts </em>and 3A:17(c) is sub-headed, <em>\u201cConviction of Lesser Offense.\u201d </em>These headings give some indication of the rule-maker\u2019s intent and the subject matter of the rule. The first sentence is a restatement of the law contained in the case law for many years: \u201cThe accused may be found not guilty of an offense charged but guilty of any offense ... that is substantially charged or necessarily included in the charge against the accused.\u201d The requirement that the offense be \u201csubstantially charged\u201d or \u201cincluded in the charge\u201d indicates that an accusation must have been made against the accused sufficient to meet constitutional requirements; namely, that an indictment, presentment, information, warrant or summons has been issued in accordance with law advising the accused of the charge against him and that the grand jury has found probable cause. The rule denotes that the accused may be found not guilty of any offense charged. However, the accused may be found guilty of any charge that is substantially charged or necessarily included in the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">After this rule went into effect in 1972, the Supreme Court has not addressed it specifically, but has decided cases using the terminology of Rule 3A:17(c), namely, \u201csubstantially charged and necessarily included in the charge against the accused.\u201d <em>See Spear v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 450, 454-57, 270 S.E.2d 737, 741-42 (1980) (holding a defendant has a right to demand the complaint against him; the court erred in granting any instruction which permitted the jury to find him guilty of any offense other than the charged offense or a lesser-included offense); <em>Dowdy v.

The only offenses which are lesser included are those which are \u201cin their nature constituent parts of the major offense.\u201d Even if one offense is committed in almost all cases of the commission of another offense, it is not a necessarily included lesser offense of the other one. Neither the facts charged in the indictment nor those proved at trial determine whether an offense is a necessarily included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>offense; the determination, instead, is made by examining the elements of the crimes that must be proved in order to sustain a conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-5\"><em>Taylor, </em>11 Va.App. at 652-53, 400 S.E.2d at 795-96 (quoting <em>Stapleton v.

Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 37, 434 S.E.2d 914 (1993). There, a state trooper stopped a tractor trailer driven by Smith for a traffic violation. <em>See id. </em>at 38, 434 S.E.2d at 914. Smith produced an altered registration card and admitted having altered it. <em>See id. </em>The trooper charged Smith with violating Code \u00a7 46.2-605, which provides that any person who holds or uses a registration card, knowing it to be altered, shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">In a request similar to appellant\u2019s, Smith tendered an instruction that would have permitted the jury to find him guilty of violating Code \u00a7 46.2-613(2), a traffic infraction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Smith \u201cargued that this statute defined a lesser offense included within Code \u00a7 46.2-605, or, alternatively, that the charge specified under Code \u00a7 46.2-605 substantially charged a violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-613(2), and his conviction of the lesser offense was authorized by Rule 3A:17[ (c) ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38-39, 434 S.E.2d at 915. The trial court refused this instruction and held \u201cthat the two Code sections defined the same offense, that neither was included within the other, that the choice of the offense charged was a matter of prosecutional discretion, and that the issue on trial was simply whether the offense charged had been proven.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39, 434 S.E.2d at 915.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">In <em>Smith, </em>we discussed the elements of each offense and found that \u201cproof of either offense does not necessarily prove the other, and neither is included within the other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40, 434 S.E.2d at 915. Therefore, we held \u201cthat Code \u00a7 46.2-613 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>did not define a lesser included offense in the proscription of Code \u00a7 46.2-605, or vice versa.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40, 434 S.E.2d at 915-16. After fully discussing the lesser offense language contained in Rule 3A:17(c) and the matter of prosecutional election, we held that \u201c[b]ecause of the disparity of specified elements, an accusation under Code \u00a7 46.2-605 neither substantially charged nor necessarily includes a charge under Code \u00a7 46.2-613.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40, 434 S.E.2d at 916. Further, we said that \u201c[w]here the evidence supports prosecution under either of two parallel statutes, the Commonwealth has the right to elect under which statute to proceed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41, 434 S.E.2d at 916. We affirmed the trial court\u2019s refusal to give Smith\u2019s requested instruction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">In this case, the accused was not entitled to an instruction on accessory after the fact because it was not an offense specifically charged. It was not an offense composed entirely of elements that are also elements of the greater offense; therefore, it is not a necessarily included offense. It was not proper for the trial court to give the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">It was improper to give the instruction for another reason. Where the evidence supports prosecution under either of two statutes, such as first degree murder or accessory after the fact in this case, the Commonwealth has the right to elect which statute to proceed upon. The selection of the statute under which to prosecute is a matter of prosecutorial election. <em>See Mason v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 321, 323-24, 228 S.E.2d 683, 684 (1976) (affirming Commonwealth\u2019s right to elect between prosecuting crime as misdemeanor or felony).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">\u201c[T]he institution of criminal charges, as well as their order and timing, are matters of prosecutorial discretion.\u201d <em>Bradshaw v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 484, 492, 323 S.E.2d 567, 572 (1984) (citation omitted). <em>See also Kauffmann, </em>8 Va.App. at 410, 382 S.E.2d at 284 (choice of offenses for which appellant will be charged is within Commonwealth attorney\u2019s discretion); <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 27, 30, 353 S.E.2d 905, 907 (1987). If the trial court had granted the instruction requested by the accused, it would have deprived the Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>wealth\u2019s attorney of his discretion in electing what charges to prosecute.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">From the last sentence in Rule 3A:17(c), one could surmise that the trial court may find the accused not guilty of the offense charged, but guilty of being an accessory after the fact. However, the court has this authority only if the previous sentence in the rule has been complied with, namely, that the offense of accessory after the fact has been substantially charged in the pleadings. An accessory after the fact could never be necessarily included in the charge against the accused. In my opinion, this sentence gives the trial court discretion to find the accused guilty of being an accessory after the fact if the pleadings provide for the accusation and the rights of neither the Commonwealth nor the accused will be prejudiced. The parties might consent to an instruction to the jury that they might find the accused guilty as an accessory after the fact. The trial court <em>may </em>find the accused guilty, but this is discretionary with the trial court and must preserve all rights granted to the parties in the Constitution, statutes and rules. In this case, because the trial judge refused to give the instruction, he obviously did not consent to submitting the issue to the jury. I find no abuse of discretion in refusing the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">In this case, it is obvious that the elements of first degree murder and accessory after the fact are not the same. Because of this disparity of elements, the accusation of first degree murder neither substantially charges nor necessarily includes the charge of accessory after the fact under Code \u00a7 18.2-19. The trial judge acted properly in refusing the instruction and directing the jury to decide whether the defendant was guilty of first degree murder or not guilty as he pled. I would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b434-10\">. Appellant was indicted on other charges not involved in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b444-9\">.
