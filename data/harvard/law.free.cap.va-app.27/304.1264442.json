On appeal, he contends the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction and that his sentence was excessive and improp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>er because it was based on stale and unsubstantiated prior convictions. We agree that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction and reverse. Because we reverse the conviction on the sufficiency issue, we need not decide the other issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The evidence is essentially undisputed. On March 24,1996, at about 4:00 a.m., the victim\u2019s car was stopped at a stop sign located at the end of an exit ramp off Interstate 95 near Ashland, Virginia. Forbes drove his car into the rear of the victim\u2019s car, killing the victim. At the scene of the accident, and shortly after the accident occurred, Forbes asked Deputy Wickham \u201cwhere he was, what had happened and why he was there.\u201d On the way to the hospital, Forbes told Wickham that he was diabetic and that he possibly could have \u201cblacked out.\u201d Forbes also said he had experienced black-outs before. A blood alcohol test performed at the hospital after the accident showed no alcohol in Forbes\u2019 blood. No evidence was presented to prove Forbes\u2019 blood sugar level after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">While in the hospital, Forbes told Deputy Smith that he had experienced diabetic black-outs on two or three other occasions \u2014 one in 1995 and one or two in 1994. Forbes said he had experienced no black-outs in 1996 until the accident on March 24, 1996. Forbes also told Smith that he had never experienced a black-out while driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Forbes has been a diabetic for \u201cthirty-some\u201d years. At trial, Forbes testified that, on the morning of March 23, 1996, he awoke, took his insulin, and ate breakfast. He checked his blood sugar level at about 5:00 p.m. and found that it was \u201cokay.\u201d He then took his insulin, ate supper, and drove from his residence in eastern Richmond to a friend\u2019s house on the south side of Richmond.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">Forbes testified that, at about 11:00 or 11:30 p.m., he ate several chicken wings and drank a seven-ounce beer. He fell asleep until about 2:30 a.m., and, when he awoke, he felt \u201ca little woozy.\u201d Forbes testified that he ate \u201ca couple of mints,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>drank a glass of orange juice, and sat down for about fifteen minutes. Forbes stated that he then felt \u201cfine\u201d and entered his car to drive home. As he warmed up his car, his friend, Mozelle Carter, brought him two more mints, which he ate. Forbes again told Carter that he felt \u201cfine,\u201d and he started driving toward his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Forbes recalled driving on Jefferson Davis Highway, crossing the James River on the Lee Bridge, and seeing the Second Street exit. He did not recall anything else until after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Carter testified that she awoke Forbes at about 1:45 a.m. on March 24, 1996 and that Forbes said he felt \u201ca little woozy\u201d when he awoke. She gave Forbes two mints, and he walked to his car. Carter asked Forbes how he was feeling, and he said, \u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine.\u201d He then requested several more mints. Carter testified that Forbes ate the mints, and she gave him two more mints. Forbes again told Carter he felt fine, and he drove away. Carter stated that Forbes \u201cwas driving fine\u201d as he drove away from her house.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Dr. Randolph Palmore, Forbes\u2019 physician since January 1994, testified that he never instructed Forbes not to drive or advised Forbes that it would be hazardous to drive. Dr. Palmore also stated that he had no record that Forbes told him he had suffered black-outs. He did not know whether Forbes had \u201cany diabetic reactions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Forbes\u2019 last visit with Dr. Palmore prior to the accident was on February 21, 1996. At that visit, Dr. Palmore said Forbes\u2019 \u201csugar was stable, and there were no changes made in his insulin.\u201d Dr. Palmore saw Forbes again on March 29, 1996, five days after the accident, and adjusted his insulin at that visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">Dr. John Nestler treated Forbes on March 25, 1996, when Forbes was in the hospital after the accident. Dr. Nestler said Forbes told him he knew he was having a low blood sugar reaction on March 24, 1996 because he felt \u201cconfused\u201d and woozy prior to driving his car. However, Forbes said he felt better after resting and eating mints. Dr. Nestler also testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>fied that most diabetics go through two \u201cstages\u201d when they develop a low blood sugar attack. In the first stage, they release adrenaline, get nervous, have heart palpitations, shakiness and headaches. In the second stage, the patient experiences confusion. Dr. Nestler said that, based on his interview with Forbes concerning his low blood sugar attacks, he \u201cclearly doesn\u2019t have that first phase. So he doesn\u2019t have those warning signs that most diabetic patients have. He goes straight into confusion, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s termed hypoglycemia unawareness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Dr. Nestler also testified that he usually advises his patients to consume mints or drink one-half of a glass of orange juice, wait one-half hour, and check their blood sugar when they experience a low blood sugar episode.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">\u201cTo constitute involuntary manslaughter, the negligence [involved] must be criminal and not ordinary civil negligence. \u2018Inadvertent acts of negligence without recklessness, while giving rise to civil liability, will not suffice to impose criminal responsibility.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tubman v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 267, 274, 348 S.E.2d 871, 875 (1986) (quoting <em>King v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 601, 606, 231 S.E.2d 312, 316 (1977)). In <em>King, </em>the Supreme Court defined involuntary manslaughter in the operation of a motor vehicle as \u201cthe accidental killing which, although unintended, is the proximate result of negligence so gross, wanton, and culpable as to show a reckless disregard of human life.\u201d <em>King, </em>217 Va. at 607, 231 S.E.2d at 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">\u201c \u2018Generally, negligence (whether ordinary, gross, or willful and wanton), contributory negligence, and proximate cause are issues for a jury\u2019s resolution. They only become questions of law to be determined by a court, when reasonable minds could not differ.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tubman, </em>3 Va.App. at 273-74, 348 S.E.2d at 875 (citation omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-9\">[T]he application of the distinctions between these degrees of negligence is frequently difficult to apply and we have not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>hesitated to set aside verdicts predicated upon a finding of the higher degree of negligence where a review of the evidence convinced us that the minds of reasonable men could not differ as to the conclusion that such higher degree had not been shown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-5\"><em>Town of Big Stone Gap v. Johnson, </em>184 Va. 375, 379, 35 S.E.2d 71, 73 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The terms \u201cgross negligence\u201d and \u201cwanton negligence\u201d have been defined by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">\u201cGross negligence is substantially and appreciably higher in magnitude than ordinary negligence.... It is very great negligence, or the absence of slight diligence, or the want of even scant care.... It is a heedless and palpable violation of legal duty respecting the rights of others. The element of culpability which characterizes all negligence is, in gross negligence, magnified to a high degree as compared with that present in ordinary negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 378-79, 35 S.E.2d at 73 (citation omitted). \u201c \u2018[G]ross negligence is that degree of negligence which shows an utter disregard of prudence amounting to complete neglect of the safety of another.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 379, 35 S.E.2d at 73 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">\u201c Wanton negligence\u2019 is of even a higher degree than \u2018gross negligence.\u2019 <em>Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, </em>2d Ed., defines \u201cwanton\u2019 as \u2018[m]arked by or manifesting arrogant recklessness of justice, of the rights or feelings of others, ... merciless; inhumane.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">In <em>Keech v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 272, 386 S.E.2d 813 (1989), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-12\">In determining the degree of negligence sufficient to support a conviction of vehicular involuntary manslaughter, the accused\u2019s conscious awareness of the risk of injury created by his conduct is necessarily a significant factor. Obviously, when the driver proceeds in the face of a known risk, the degree of the negligence is increased, and may turn that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>which would have been ordinary negligence into gross, willful or wanton negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 278, 386 S.E.2d at 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">In <em>Keech, </em>the Court further addressed the question whether to apply an objective or subjective standard when determining what is a \u201cknown risk.\u201d This Court held that an objective standard would apply and the degree of negligence would be \u201cdetermined by the great risk of injury together with the knowledge [a defendant] had or should have had of that risk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 282, 386 S.E.2d at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">The Commonwealth asserts that the record establishes that Forbes had a history of diabetic attacks, resulting in black-outs. The Commonwealth contends that Forbes continued to drive, knowing that he was susceptible to black-outs and that he drove on March 24,1996, knowing his blood sugar was low and disregarding the known risk that he posed to other motorists. Thus, the Commonwealth contends Forbes\u2019 conduct was criminally negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Forbes argues that, because he took precautionary measures and felt \u201cfine\u201d before he drove on March 24, 1996, the evidence did not prove he acted in a criminally negligent manner. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, is seen in the diabetic \u201cwho takes too much insulin, too little food, or both or overexercises.\u201d 4B <em>Lawyers\u2019 Medical Cyclopedia of Personal Injuries and Allied Specialties </em>27 (James G. Zimmerly, M.D., J.D., M.P.H. ed.1984). Corrective measures for the condition include \u201cgiving the sufferer generous amounts of glucose by mouth in the form of sugar, honey, candy, or a sweetened beverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Dr. Nestler testified that he advises his patients to eat mints or drink one-half of a glass of orange juice, wait one-half hour, and check their blood sugar level when they experience low blood sugar. Further, Dr. Nestler testified that Forbes \u201cclearly\u201d did not have the warning signals that most diabetic patients experience when having a low blood sugar attack. Forbes testified that on one prior occasion he had experienced no warning signs prior to his black<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>out. On another occasion, he blacked-out before he could \u201ctreat [him]self.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">On these facts, we find that Forbes\u2019 conduct did not constitute negligence so gross, wanton, and culpable as to show a reckless disregard of human life. For a diabetic to operate a motor vehicle is not negligence <em>per se. </em>Forbes followed the medical directions he had been given to correct an insulin imbalance.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">\u201cThe [factual findings] of the court sitting without a jury will not be set aside unless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. However, a trial court\u2019s conclusion based on evidence that is \u2018not in material conflict\u2019 does not have this binding effect on appeal. The trier of fact must determine the weight of the testimony and the credibility of the witnesses, but it \u2018may not arbitrarily disregard uncontradicted evidence of unimpeached witnesses which is not inherently incredible and not inconsistent with facts in the record.\u2019 A court may not base its findings on a suspicion which is contrary to the undisputed positive testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-6\"><em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 666, 669-70, 418 S.E.2d 346, 348 (1992) (quoting <em>Hankerson v. Moody, </em>229 Va. 270, 274-75, 329 S.E.2d 791, 794 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Forbes checked his sugar level at about 5:00 p.m. on March 23, 1996. He ate breakfast and dinner that day. He took insulin at 5:00 p.m. Forbes also ate a small meal at about 11:30 p.m. on March 23, 1996 before he fell asleep. When he awoke and felt \u201cwoozy,\u201d Forbes ate \u201ca couple of mints,\u201d drank a glass of orange juice, and rested for about fifteen minutes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Forbes stated that he felt \u201cfine\u201d before he drove his car. As he sat in his car, his friend brought him two more mints, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>which he ate. Carter also testified that Forbes \u201cwas driving fine\u201d as she watched him drive away from her house. He had not been advised by his physician to stop operating a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Therefore, the evidence proved, without contradiction, that Forbes took precautionary measures when he felt \u201cwoozy\u201d and suspected he was experiencing a low blood sugar episode. Although Forbes did not check his blood sugar level before he drove, he performed several other acts that are recommended to restore blood sugar level. Further, Forbes testified that he felt \u201cfine\u201d before he drove his car.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, he had experienced black-outs on only two or three occasions in his thirty years as a diabetic, with the last black-out occurring in December 1995. Under these facts, we cannot say Forbes knew or should have known that his conduct created a great risk reasonably calculated to produce injury. Although Forbes\u2019 conduct may have been negligent under these circumstances, his negligence did not amount to wanton negligence so culpable as to show a \u201creckless disregard of human life.\u201d <em>See Tubman, </em>3 Va.App. at 275, 348 S.E.2d at 875.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">For these reasons, we reverse the involuntary manslaughter conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b354-8\">. The Commonwealth contends we cannot consider Forbes\u2019 testimony that he drank a glass of orange juice because, in his statement to the police given after the accident, he did not say he drank orange juice and because Carter did not testify that Forbes drank orange juice prior to driving his car. However, the Commonwealth presented no evidence to contradict Forbes\u2019 positive statement that he drank a glass of orange juice. Therefore, his testimony may be considered by this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b355-8\">.
