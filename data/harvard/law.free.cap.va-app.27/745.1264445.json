He contends the trial court erred by failing to classify as his separate property the portion of the increased value of the home attributable to his separate property contribution. A panel of this Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision, holding that the wife\u2019s testimony was unrebutted that the entire increase in value was marital property because she had contributed marital property and significant personal efforts that resulted in a substantial increase in the value of the marital residence. <em>See Martin v. Martin, </em>25 Va.App. 551, 489 S.E.2d 727 (1997). Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>we hold that the trial court erred by failing to determine the increase in value of husband\u2019s separate property share. We further hold that the evidence failed to prove that wife contributed marital property or significant personal efforts that caused an increase in value of the home. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>ingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s equitable distribution award. Because the evidence failed to prove that the increase in value of the home resulted from the post-purchase expenditure of marital funds or significant personal efforts for home improvements, we hold that the increase in value should be proportionally divided between the separate and marital shares. Therefore, we remand the case for the trial court to determine how to divide the marital share in accordance with the Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Husband and Joyce Kathryn Moses Martin (wife) were married in 1981. Just before their marriage, husband and his former wife owned, as tenants in common, a home which was the subject of a partition sale. Wife, who had been \u201cstudying to be a realtor,\u201d testified that the house which was listed through a real estate agent for $60,100 was, in her opinion, selling too \u201ccheaply.\u201d She testified she persuaded husband to purchase the house and later resell it for a profit. They purchased the home for $60,100 in 1981. Husband contributed $26,634.22 of his separate property to acquire the home. The parties jointly borrowed $30,000 and applied that amount toward the purchase price. Husband claimed the remaining $3,465.78 of the purchase price came from his separate property received from his previous divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">In 1993, wife filed for divorce. The commissioner in chancery to whom the case was referred determined the value of the marital home to be $110,000. The commissioner further found that husband was entitled to be reimbursed $26,634.22, the amount of his separate funds contributed to purchase the home, and that the remaining $83,365.78 was marital property, which should be equally divided. The effect of the commissioner\u2019s finding was to classify as marital property the entire increase in value of the home from $60,100 to $110,000 during the twelve years the parties owned it. The trial court overruled husband\u2019s exceptions to the commissioner\u2019s report and by final decree adopted the commissioner\u2019s findings. On appeal, we review the trial court\u2019s holding that wife\u2019s initial recommendation that the home would be a sound investment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>and her efforts at painting, wallpapering, and carpet installation in the home were significant personal efforts that resulted in a substantial increase in the home\u2019s value.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Code \u00a7 20-107.3, which governs equitable distribution awards, requires a trial court to classify and evaluate the parties\u2019 marital and separate properties. The court is no longer required to classify property as all separate or all marital. <em>See Smoot v. Smoot, </em>233 Va. 435, 357 S.E.2d 728 (1987). Applying Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A), the court may classify the property as separate or marital, or part separate and part marital.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-8\">1. Separate property is ... that part of any property classified as separate pursuant to subdivision A3.... The increase in value of separate property during the marriage is separate property, <em>unless marital property or the personal efforts of either party have contributed to such increases </em>and then only to the extent of the increases in value attributable to such contributions. <em>The personal efforts of either party must be significant and result in substantial appreciation of the separate property </em>if any increase in value attributable thereto is to be considered marital property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-9\">2. Marital property is ... that part of any property classified as marital pursuant to subdivision A3....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-11\">3. The court shall classify property as part marital property and part separate property as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-12\">a. ... In the case of the increase in value of separate property during the marriage, such increase in value shall be marital property only to the extent that <em>marital property or the personal efforts of either party have contributed to such increases, provided that any such personal efforts must be significant and result in substantial appreciation of the separate property.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-13\">For purposes of this subdivision, the non-owning spouse shall bear the burden of proving that (i) contributions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>marital property or personal effort were made and (ii) the separate property increased in value. Once this burden of proof is met, the owning spouse shall bear the burden of proving that the increase in value or some portion thereof was not caused by contributions or marital property or personal effort.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-5\"><em>\u201cPersonal effort </em>\u201d of a party shall be deemed to be labor, effort, inventiveness, physical or intellectual skill, creativity, or managerial, promotional or marketing activity applied directly to the separate property of either party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">Under Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(e), when separate and marital property are commingled to acquire new property, \u201cthe commingled property shall be deemed transmuted to marital property,\u201d except to the extent the property can be retraced and was not a gift. When subsections (1), (2), and (3)(a) of Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A) are read together, they provide that where separate property can be retraced from commingled property, the increased value in that separate property is presumed to be separate, <em>unless </em>the non-owning spouse proves that contributions of marital property or personal effort caused the increase in value. To the extent the non-owning spouse claims that the increase in value was attributable to personal efforts, the non-owning spouse must prove that the personal efforts were \u201csignificant\u201d and resulted in \u201csubstantial appreciation\u201d of the owning spouse\u2019s separate property interest. Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(1), 20-107.3(A)(3)(a). Once the non-owning spouse overcomes the presumption of separateness of the increase in value, the burden shifts to the owning spouse to prove that the increase in value or some portion thereof was not caused by contribution of marital property or significant personal effort. Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">In the present case, the parties agreed and the trial court found that husband had retraced from the commingled funds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>used to purchase the house, $26,634.22 as his separate property. The evidence proved that $30,000 in marital funds were used to acquire the house. The trial court treated the remaining $3,465.78 of the purchase price as marital property. Thus, pursuant to Code \u00a7 20\u2014 107.3(A)(3)(e), the trial court found that $26,634.22 of the commingled funds used to purchase the home was retraceable to separate property, and the remaining $33,465.78 of the purchase price was traceable to marital property. Although, on appeal, husband asserts that the trial court erred in not classifying the $3,465.78 as separate property, husband did not object to the findings of the commissioner or the trial court classifying and valuing husband\u2019s separate interest at $26,634.22. We will not consider for the first time on appeal an issue that was not preserved in the trial court. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">However, the trial court erred in failing to determine the extent to which husband\u2019s separate property interest in the home increased in value during the twelve years of marriage. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(1) (\u201cThe increase in value of separate property during the marriage is separate property... .\u201d). The trial court ruled that the husband was only entitled to a return of his $26,634.22 separate funds used to purchase the home.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court did not determine wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>er any portion of the $49,000 increase in value was attributable to a passive appreciation in market value of property, exclusive of improvements or additions resulting from marital property contributions, or significant personal effort. The question we decide here is whether the wife has overcome the presumption that the increase in value of the separate property is separate.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Code \u00a7 20 \u2014 107.3(A)(1) expressly provides that the increase in value of the retraceable separate funds shall be separate unless the non-owning party proves that all or a portion of the increase was due to the contribution of marital funds or significant personal effort. The trial court erred by fading, as an initial matter, to determine whether and to what extent husband\u2019s separate share increased in value.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">We have not adopted an exclusive method for determining how to apportion the increase in value of retraced separate property. In <em>Hart v. Hart, </em>27 Va.App. 46, 65-66, 497 S.E.2d 496, 505 (1998), we approved the \u201cBrandenburg formula\u201d as one method for ascertaining the value of the separate and marital components of hybrid property in relation to the original contributions. Although other methods may be equally acceptable, where the separate and marital funds were commingled into \u201cnewly acquired\u201d property, by applying the \u201cBrandenburg formula,\u201d which we deem appropriate on these facts, we hold that the husband\u2019s presumptive separate share in the hybrid property valued at $110,000 is $48,748.16.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the increase in value of husband\u2019s retraceable separate funds is $22,113.88.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under the provisions of Code \u00a7 20-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>107.3(A), the $22,113.88 increase in husband\u2019s separate share is presumed to be separate property. The trial court should have applied the Brandenburg method, or another acceptable method, to initially calculate the increase in value of husband\u2019s separate property share of the marital residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">We next consider whether the wife, as non-owning spouse, proved that all or a portion of the increase in value of the retraced separate property was transmuted to marital property. Wife contends she contributed marital property and significant personal efforts that resulted in the substantial increase in value of the home by (1) applying her real estate acumen and persuading husband to purchase the home and (2) \u201cfixing up\u201d the home with new \u201ccarpet, paint, [and] wallpaper\u201d purchased with marital funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">\n<em>A. Wife\u2019s Real Estate \u201cAcumen\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">At the commissioner\u2019s hearing, wife testified that she was \u201cstudying to be a realtor\u201d when the parties purchased the marital home. Wife testified that she determined that purchasing the house for $60,100 was a \u201cgood deal\u201d and \u201cfelt like [the house] was worth maybe $79,000.\u201d She encouraged husband to invest in the home using his $26,634.22 equity from the partition sale. In this regard, wife contends that applying her \u201creal estate knowledge and acumen\u201d and urging husband to invest in the house were \u201csignificant\u201d personal efforts that resulted in the immediate appreciation of the parties\u2019 $60,100 investment to $79,000, thereby proportionately increasing the value of husband\u2019s separate interest in the house. Wife\u2019s argument fails for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">First, wife failed to prove that her real estate knowledge and efforts to persuade husband to acquire the property resulted in an increase in the value of husband\u2019s separate property. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(a)(ii). The parties purchased the house for $60,100 through a court-approved partition sale. Wife offered no evidence as to the value of the property before or after the parties purchased the house. She offered no appraisal, tax records, or proof of comparable sales <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>to establish the value. She offered no evidence that she had training or experience in real estate valuation, or that she was capable of appraising real estate or preparing a market study or comparison of sales to determine the fair market value of the property. Wife\u2019s unsubstantiated assertion that she \u201cfelt\u201d the house was worth $79,000 should be accorded no weight. Other than her conclusory assertion that she had some real estate \u201cacumen,\u201d wife offered no evidence to prove the property was more valuable than the price paid or that husband relied upon her \u201cpersonal efforts\u201d in investing in the property. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(a) (\u201cpersonal efforts must ... <em>result </em>in substantial appreciation\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">Second, even if wife possessed \u201csome real estate knowledge and \u2018acumen,\u2019\u201d her suggestion to purchase the property was not a contribution of a \u201csignificant personal effort\u201d as required by Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A). The statute contemplates a <em>significant </em>personal effort that substantially affects the value of property, not merely a joint decision that may have been influenced by one spouse. \u201cSignificant\u201d is defined as \u201chaving or likely to have influence or effect; deserving to be considered; important, weighty, notable.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, </em>2116 (1981). Wife\u2019s efforts were not \u201csignificant\u201d factors affecting the value of the property. Accepting her assertion and according it its greatest evidentiary value, the evidence proves nothing more than that she and her husband decided to purchase the property because she thought it would be a good investment. Moreover, her estimation that buying the house was a sound financial decision was not a \u201cpersonal effort\u201d as contemplated by the statute. She failed to prove that her \u201cintellectual skill, creativity, or managerial, promotional or marketing activity [was] applied directly to the separate property.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(a) (defining \u201cpersonal effort\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">\n<em>B. Painting, Wallpapering, and Carpeting</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Wife also contends the house appreciated in value from $79,000 on the date of purchase to $110,000 because she \u201cfixed [it] up\u201d over the course of the twelve-year marriage. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>attributes none of the increase in value to a passive increase in market value but rather claims that the entire increase was due to her personal efforts. Wife testified that she was actively involved in painting, wallpapering, and installing carpet and that she expended $5,000 of marital funds to make such \u201cimprovements.\u201d She argues the substantial increase in value of the home, including husband\u2019s separate property interest, was attributable to contributions of marital property and her significant personal efforts in fixing up the home. We find no merit in her argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">A party does not meet the burden of proving that \u201ccontributions of marital property ... were made\u201d by merely establishing that marital funds were expended for customary maintenance and upkeep of the property. The term \u201ccontribution of marital property\u201d within the meaning of the statute contemplates an improvement, renovation, addition, or other contribution which, by its nature, imparts intrinsic value to the property and materially changes the character thereof. <em>See Spindler v. Spindler, </em>207 Wis.2d 327, 558 N.W.2d 645, 650-51 (Ct.App.1996). By contrast, although the customary care, maintenance, and upkeep of a residential home may preserve the value of the property, it generally does not add value to the home or alter its character and no evidence to the contrary was presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Here, wife\u2019s vague claim that over the years she expended $5,000 for paint, wallpaper, and carpet proved nothing more than that she used marital funds for the home\u2019s customary care, maintenance, and upkeep. She proved neither when the expenditures were made nor the amounts she spent for paint, wallpaper, or carpet. Although installing the carpet may, in some instances, be an addition or improvement that constitutes a \u201ccontribution of marital property,\u201d wife\u2019s evidence failed to prove when and the extent to which carpet was added, the amount of marital funds expended for the carpet, or that installing carpet significantly increased the value of the home, including husband\u2019s separate property interest. Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>cordingly, wife failed to prove that \u201ccontributions of marital property ... were made\u201d to the marital home.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Wife further failed to prove that her personal efforts in fixing up the house were \u201csignificant\u201d and \u201cresulted in a substantial appreciation\u201d of value to the home. For personal labor contributed to property to be \u201csignificant\u201d and to cause or result in a substantial increase in value, without proof to the contrary, the personal labor must amount to more than customary care, maintenance, and upkeep. Wife\u2019s evidence that at some time during the twelve years of marriage she personally painted, wallpapered, and carpeted parts of the house does not prove a \u201csignificant\u201d personal effort under the facts of this case. These activities constitute part of the customary maintenance and upkeep that homeowners typically perform in order to <em>preserve </em>the home\u2019s value; they do not by their nature <em>impart </em>value to the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">There is no credible evidence in the record which supports a finding that wife\u2019s efforts in painting, wallpapering, or carpeting the home \u201cresulted in [the] substantial appreciation\u201d in the value of the house. Wife\u2019s evidence consisted of the following statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-7\">Q: And you did the fixing up of the house; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-8\">A: I bought the carpet, paint, the wallpaper, did the labors, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-10\">Q: All of those things?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-11\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-12\">Q: And then, apparently, it increased through your efforts to $110,000?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-14\">A: I feel like that is a fair price, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-15\">As noted, wife had the initial burden to prove that her personal efforts <em>\u201cresulted </em>\u201d in the increase in value of the home. Wife\u2019s claim that her efforts in \u201cfixing up the house\u201d caused the home to appreciate in value from $79,000 to $110,000 is unsupported by the evidence and fails to meet her burden under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that wife failed to meet her burden of proving that either contributions of marital property or significant personal efforts resulted in the increase in value of the marital residence, including husband\u2019s separate property interest. The trial court erred in failing to determine the increase in value of the husband\u2019s separate property and in classifying the total increase in value-of the marital home as marital property. We hold that husband\u2019s separate property interest in the home is $48,748.16. The remaining $61,251.84 value in the marital home is marital property and must be allocated between the parties in accordance with the factors specified in Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E). Although the trial court previously allocated the marital share equally between the parties, the court did so after having erroneously found wife\u2019s customary efforts in the care, maintenance, and upkeep sufficiently \u201csignificant\u201d to have caused the substantial increase in value. Notwithstanding wife\u2019s failure to meet her burden of proving that the increase in value of husband\u2019s separate property was transmuted to marital property, she is entitled to consideration under Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E)(2) in determining whether her \u201ccontributions, monetary and nonmonetary ... [to the] care and maintenance of the marital property\u201d preserved the value of the marital home. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision and remand the case to the trial court with directions to enter judgment for husband in the amount of $48,748.16 for his separate property interest and to reconsider its equitable distribution of the $61,251.84 marital share of the home in accordance with the Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b793-9\">. Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(1), (2), and (3)(a) provide, in effect, that when commingled property has been retraced to separate property, the sepa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>rate property interest and the increase in value of that interest shall retain the classification of separate property unless transmuted into marital property by the addition of marital property or funds or by the contribution of significant personal efforts that substantially increase the value of the separate property interest. However, once the non-owning spouse has proven that the increase in value of the separate property interest is transmuted to marital property by additions of marital funds that caused the increase in value and/or significant personal efforts that resulted in \"substantial appreciation,\u201d the owner of the separate share shall be entitled to that portion of the increase in value that the owner can prove was attributable to passive market forces and not caused by the addition of marital property or expenditure of marital funds and not by the non-owning spouse's personal efforts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b794-7\">.

The trial court misconstrued the holding in <em>Hauger. </em>In <em>Hauger, </em>we merely rejected the wife\u2019s claim that the trial court erred by awarding to husband as his separate property the retraceable separate funds that he had contributed to purchase the marital home.
