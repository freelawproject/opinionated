He contends: (1) the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress marijuana discovered in a search incident to an unlawful arrest, and (2) the evidence is insufficient to prove he possessed cocaine. We disagree and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-13\">\n<em>I. BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b217-14\">City of Lynchburg Police Officers Kevin Hollyfield, J.P. Stokes, and another officer were patrolling in an unmarked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>vehicle in a high crime area also known to be an open-air drug market. Hollyfield observed appellant and two other men sitting on a low wall, approximately eighteen inches high, facing the street with their backs to a parking lot. The two men were sitting approximately three feet from the appellant. Hollyfield saw appellant place his left hand, which was clenched in a fist, behind his back, keeping his hand close to his body as he placed it behind him. When appellant brought his hand back in front, Hollyfield saw that it was unclenched. Neither of the other two men made any motions with their hands. Hollyfield alerted the other officers, and they pulled their vehicle up to the curb where appellant was sitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Appellant stood up and began to walk away as Hollyfield exited the car. Stokes walked over to the wall and found a small brown paper bag containing crack cocaine lying on the ground directly below the spot where appellant had been sitting. Stokes testified that the bag of drugs was lying six to twelve inches \u201cunderneath\u201d where appellant\u2019s \u201cleft thigh\u201d had been when he was sitting on the wall. Stokes also testified that there was no debris within the immediate area where he found the drugs. Stokes did not field test the substance, but, based upon his training and experience in investigating nearly two hundred cocaine cases, he testified that it had the appearance of cocaine. Stokes alerted Hollyfield that he had found cocaine behind the wall where appellant had been sitting, and Hollyfield arrested appellant. Upon searching appellant incident to the arrest, Hollyfield discovered a marijuana cigarette in appellant\u2019s right front shirt pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\n<em>II. SEARCH INCIDENT TO ARREST</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Appellant contends the marijuana was seized pursuant to an unlawful arrest because the officers lacked probable cause to arrest him for possessing the cocaine. His contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">\u201c[T]he test of constitutional validity [of a warrantless arrest and incidental search] is whether, at the moment of arrest, the arresting officer had knowledge of sufficient facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>and circumstances to warrant a reasonable man in believing that an offense has been committed.\u201d <em>Bryson v. Commonwealth, 211 </em>Va. 85, 86-87, 175 S.E.2d 248, 250 (1970) (citing <em>Brinegar v. United States, </em>338 U.S. 160, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949)). To establish probable cause, the Commonwealth must show \u201c \u2018a probability or substantial chance of criminal activity, not an actual showing\u2019\u201d that a crime was committed. <em>Ford v. City of Newport News, </em>23 Va.App. 137, 143-14, 474 S.E.2d 848, 851 (1996) (quoting <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 243 n. 13, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2335 n. 13, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983)). \u201cIn determining whether probable cause exists courts will test what the totality of the circumstances meant to police officers trained in analyzing the observed conduct for purposes of crime control.\u201d <em>Hollis v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 874, 876-77, 223 S.E.2d 887, 889 (1976) (citation omitted). The issue of whether probable cause existed to make a warrantless search involves questions of both law and fact and is reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal. <em>See McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 197-98, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc) (citing <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 691, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1659, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">In this case, Hollyfield observed appellant, who was sitting in an area known to be an open-air drug market, make a furtive hand gesture, as if discarding something from a clenched fist, then stand up and walk away as the officers approached. Stokes found a bag on the ground immediately behind where appellant had been sitting and recognized the contents as having the appearance of crack cocaine. He alerted Hollyfield that he had found cocaine. Under the circumstances, it was reasonable for Stokes, drawing upon his training and experience, to conclude that the substance was probably cocaine and for Hollyfield, based on Stokes\u2019 communication that he found cocaine and his own observation of appellant\u2019s conduct, to determine that appellant probably possessed the cocaine before dropping it behind the wall when the officers approached. Accordingly, we find that Hollyfield had probable cause to arrest appellant for possession of cocaine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>and that the marijuana was legally seized in a search pursuant to a lawful arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\n<em>III. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">When the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged on appeal, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The present case is factually similar to <em>Collins v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 177, 409 S.E.2d 175 (1991). In <em>Collins, </em>police officers approached the defendant as he sat sidesaddle in the front seat of his car in a dimly lit parking lot. <em>Id. </em>at 178, 409 S.E.2d at 175. Upon seeing the officers, Coffins got up from his car and \u201cmade a throwing motion under the vehicle with his right arm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Immediately thereafter, an officer illuminated the area under the car with a flashlight and discovered a plastic baggie of cocaine. <em>Id. </em>No other items were found beneath the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>Despite the fact that the record contained no evidence that the officers saw any contraband or other object leave Collins\u2019 hand, we held that the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that Coffins threw the drugs under the car. <em>Id. </em>at 179-80, 409 S.E.2d at 176. We found Coffins\u2019 argument unpersuasive \u201cthat the cocaine might have already been under his car,\u201d noting that the drugs were \u201csomething of significant value and not something that one is likely to have abandoned or carelessly left in the area there.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 180, 409 S.E.2d at 176. Accordingly, we found the evidence sufficient to prove that Coffins constructively possessed the cocaine found under his vehicle. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Here, as in <em>Collins, </em>the circumstantial evidence is sufficient to prove that appellant possessed the cocaine. Hollyfield testified that appellant placed his clenched left hand behind his back and that the hand was unclenched when he returned it back in front of him. Appellant\u2019s suspicious hand movement and the fact that cocaine was found precisely where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>appellant would have dropped an object from his left hand behind his back, support the inference that appellant possessed the bag of cocaine and discarded it on the ground behind him when the officers approached.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The facts in <em>Gordon v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 298, 188 S.E.2d 735 (1971), are distinguishable from the facts in this case. There, a police officer approached Gordon on a busy, public street while the latter carried a small, manila envelope. <em>Id. </em>at 299, 183 S.E.2d at 736. Gordon left the street and ran down several narrow passageways abutting the street. <em>Id. </em>As the officer chased Gordon through the passageways, the officer momentarily lost sight of Gordon on a couple of occasions. <em>Id. </em>When the officer eventually captured him, Gordon was no longer carrying the envelope. <em>Id. </em>Another officer arrived on the scene and found a small, manila envelope lying near one of the passageways on a grass plot separated from the public street by a perforated wall. <em>Id. </em>at 300, 183 S.E.2d at 736. At trial, the officer <em>\u201cconceded that he did not see Gordon dispose of the envelope.\u201d Id. </em>at 299, 183 S.E.2d at 736 (emphasis added). No evidence established that Gordon made any sort of throwing or dropping motion during his flight. <em>See id. </em>The Supreme Court reversed the conviction, holding that there was a \u201cfatal gap in the circumstantial evidence adduced against Gordon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301, 183 S.E.2d at 737. Because \u201c[n]o witness was produced who saw Gordon dispose of the manila envelope which he carried,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 300-01, 183 S.E.2d at 737, the evidence failed to exhibit an \u201cunbroken chain of circumstances\u201d proving \u201cto the exclusion of any other rational hypothesis\u201d that Gordon possessed the drugs in the envelope that was found. <em>Id. </em>at 300, 183 S.E.2d at 737 (citation omitted). Although highly suspicious because the officers found an envelope that was similar in size, color, and shape to the one that Gordon had earlier possessed, the evidence did not prove that Gordon had discarded the envelope or where he may have done so. The Court found that the officer could have reasonably recovered another manila envelope left by one of the several persons gathered along the public street. <em>Id. </em>at 301,183 S.E.2d at 737. Accordingly, the Court concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>\u201cthere was a break in the chain of evidence\u201d which rendered the evidence insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Gordon possessed the drugs and paraphernalia. <em>Id. </em>at 300-01,183 S.E.2d at 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">In the present case, unlike as in <em>Gordon, </em>there is no \u201cbreak in the chain of [the] evidence.\u201d Hollyfield observed appellant place his clenched hand behind his back and bring his open hand back to his front. Upon learning of Hollyfield\u2019s observation, Stokes immediately walked to the wall and found the bag of drugs directly below where appellant had been sitting. Thus, there was no \u201cfatal gap\u201d in the officers\u2019 observing appellant\u2019s hand gesture as if discarding an object from a clenched fist and the officer finding the bag of drugs directly behind where appellant was sitting. Accordingly, we cannot say the trial court\u2019s conclusion that appellant possessed the cocaine was plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">For these reasons, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b222-8\">BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AJ_\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">The principle is well established that whenever \u201ca conviction is based on circumstantial evidence, \u2018all necessary circumstances proved must be consistent with guilt and inconsistent with innocence and exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Garland v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 182, 184, 300 S.E.2d 783, 784 (1983) (quoting <em>Inge v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 360, 366, 228 S.E.2d 563, 567 (1976)). Thus, the Supreme Court has ruled that \u201ccircumstances of suspicion, no matter how grave or strong, are not proof of guilt sufficient to support a verdict of guilty ... [because the] actual commission of the crime by the accused must be shown by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt to sustain ... [a] conviction.\u201d <em>Clodfelter v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 619, 623, 238 S.E.2d 820, 822 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">Although no evidence in this case proved that Tremayne Powell ever possessed the bag of cocaine found behind the wall, the majority infers from the circumstances that Powell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>must have placed it there. The majority draws that inference even though the police officer testified that he did not see anything in Powell\u2019s hand. The officer merely suspected that Powell\u2019s closed hand contained something. The lack of evidence proving that Powell possessed any item in his hand is a \u201cfatal gap in the circumstantial evidence,\u201d <em>Gordon v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 298, 301, 183 S.E.2d 735, 737 (1971), and manifestly establishes that the evidence in this case was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Powell ever possessed the bag of cocaine found behind the wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The majority asserts that the facts in <em>Gordon </em>are distinguishable from the facts in this case. I agree. Indeed, the facts in <em>Gordon </em>are more inculpatory than the facts in this case. In <em>Gordon, </em>a police officer saw the accused retrieve \u201ca brownish color, manila color envelope\u201d from between bushes and a concrete fence. <em>Id. </em>at 299,183 S.E.2d at 736. After the accused began to run, the officer chased him and saw that he was still carrying the envelope. During the chase, the accused discarded the envelope. While the officer was capturing and arresting the accused, another officer found an envelope on the route of the chase. The arresting officer testified that the envelope \u201cwas the \u2018same color, size and shape\u2019 as the envelope which he had seen [the accused] pick up [and hold].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300, 183 S.E.2d at 736. Although the arresting officer saw the accused retrieve and run with an envelope that was the \u201csame color, size and shape\u201d as the envelope that contained the drugs, the Supreme Court held that the trier of fact impermissibly drew an inference that the accused had disposed of the envelope that was recovered. <em>Id. See also Craig v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 260, 262, 208 S.E.2d 744, 746 (1974) (holding that an officer\u2019s suspicion that a bag of marijuana was thrown from a truck when the truck stopped at the bag\u2019s location was \u201cnot sufficient to ... exclude all reasonable conclusions inconsistent with ... guilt\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The evidence in this case is more speculative. From a distance of a half block, a police officer saw Powell and two other men sitting on a wall at the intersection of two streets. The two men were sitting to the left of Powell. Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>officer testified that Powell moved his closed left hand behind his back, the officer saw no object in Powell\u2019s hand. Powell denied that the cocaine was his or that he put it behind the wall. The police officer exited his vehicle, told the two men who had been on the wall with Powell to leave, and did not question them.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The only evidence offered by the Commonwealth that did not require the trier of fact to speculate, conjecture, or surmise while assessing Powell\u2019s guilt or innocence was evidence of opportunity. Yet, it is well established that \u201cmere opportunity to commit an offense raises only \u2018the suspicion that the defendant may have been the guilty agent; and suspicion is never enough to sustain a conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Christian v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 1078, 1082, 277 S.E.2d 205, 208 (1981) (quoting <em>Simmons v. Commonwealth, </em>208 Va. 778, 783, 160 S.E.2d 569, 573 (1968)). \u201cSuspicious circumstances, including proximity to a controlled drug,, are insufficient to support a conviction.\u201d <em>Behrens v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 131, 135, 348 S.E.2d 430, 432 (1986). \u201c[E]ven probability of guilt is not sufficient\u201d to support a conviction. <em>Gordon, </em>212 Va. at 300, 183 S.E.2d at 737. The two men sitting on the wall beside Powell, \u201cassuming they possessed illegal drugs, would have had the same motive and the same opportunity, as did [Powell], to rid themselves of the drugs\u201d by placing them behind the wall. <em>Craig, </em>215 Va. at 262, 208 S.E.2d at 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Furthermore, where, as here, the evidence \u201c \u2018is equally susceptible of two interpretations one of which is consistent with the innocence of the accused, [the trier of fact] cannot arbitrarily adopt that interpretation which incriminates [the accused].\u2019 \u201d <em>Harrell v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 1, 11, 396 S.E.2d 680, 685 (1990) (quoting <em>Corbett v. Commonwealth, </em>210 Va. 304, 307, 171 S.E.2d 251, 253 (1969)). The officer who detained Powell testified that the corner where the three men were sitting on the wall was an \u201copen air drug market.\u201d Thus, a reasonable hypothesis flows from the evidence that someone other than Powell placed the bag of cocaine on the ground behind the wall. \u201cThere ... exists the possibility that the bag was present [on the ground] prior to the\u2019 time\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>officers arrived. <em>Craig, </em>215 Va. at 262, 208 S.E.2d at 745. Certainly, the evidence does not establish the innocence of the two other men who also were sitting on the wall within three feet of the bag of cocaine in an area known to be an \u201copen air drug market.\u201d This evidence falls short of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the drugs found behind the wall were ever actually or constructively possessed by Powell. \u201cWhenever the evidence leaves indifferent which of several hypotheses is true, or merely establishes only some finite probability in favor of one hypothesis, such evidence does not amount to proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Sutphin v. Commonwealth, </em>1 Va.App. 241, 248, 337 S.E.2d 897, 900 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Collins v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 177, 409 S.E.2d 175 (1991), cannot overcome the deficiency of proof that is demonstrable under the <em>Gordon </em>standard. The <em>Collins </em>decision fails to address <em>Gordon\u2019s </em>holding. Moreover, for the reasons I have previously stated in <em>Collins, see </em>13 Va.App. at 180-81, 409 S.E.2d at 176-77 (Benton, J., dissenting), I believe that decision was wrongly decided. In addition, if <em>Collins </em>must be distinguished, the absence of evidence in <em>Collins </em>proving that the accused was in an \u201copen air drug market\u201d and in the presence of other people is sufficient to distinguish the <em>Collins </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Because this conviction is impermissibly based on speculation and conjecture, <em>see Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 669, 670, 232 S.E.2d 733, 734 (1977), it should be reversed. I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
