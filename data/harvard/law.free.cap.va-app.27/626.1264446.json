Loflin (appellant) appeals the trial court\u2019s order denying his petition to restore his driving privilege. Appellant was previously adjudged an habitual offender and filed his petition based on the provisions of Code \u00a7 46.2-361(B). He contends that, in denying his petition, the trial court erroneously modified its prior order adjudicating him to be an habitual offender, in violation of Rule 1:1. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">On September 18, 1995, the trial court conducted a show-cause proceeding pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-352 and adjudged appellant to be an habitual offender. At the time of this proceeding, appellant had four convictions chargeable under the Habitual Offender Act that occurred on two separate dates. A transcript of appellant\u2019s driving record from the Department of Motor Vehicles indicated he was convicted of \u201cdriving while intox, 1ST\u201d and of \u201cdriving under revocation or suspension\u201d and that the offense date of these two convictions was February 3, 1991. The transcript also indicated appellant was convicted of \u201cdriving under revocation or suspension\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>that he committed this offense twice on April 9, 1995. In its order, the trial court stated it was \u201cof the opinion that [appellant] ... is an \u2018habitual offender\u2019 under the definition contained in \u00a7 46.2-351 of the Code of Virginia (1950), as amended.\u201d The trial court ordered that appellant \u201cshall not operate a motor vehicle on the highways of the Commonwealth of Virginia for a period of ten (10) years from the date of this Order and until the privilege of said person has been restored by an order of a Court of record entered in a proceeding as provided by law____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">On February 26,1997, appellant filed a \u201cpetition for restoration of driving privilege habitual offender.\u201d His petition was grounded solely upon Code \u00a7 46.2-361(B), which includes the requirement that the underlying adjudication of habitual offender \u201cwas <em>based entirely </em>upon convictions as set out in subdivision 1 c of \u00a7 46.2-351.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The offense of driving while intoxicated is not listed in Code \u00a7 46.2-351(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">At a hearing on his petition, appellant argued the determination he was an habitual offender was based solely on his convictions of driving under suspension or revocation and not on his conviction of driving while intoxicated. He argued that, because his offense of driving while intoxicated occurred within six hours of his offense of driving under suspension or revocation on February 3, 1991, and because that was the first occasion he had committed simultaneous multiple traffic offenses, the last paragraph of Code \u00a7 46.2-351 required these two offenses to be treated as one offense. Moreover, he argued the last paragraph of Code \u00a7 46.2-351 required the trial court to treat these two offenses as one offense <em>of driving under suspension or revocation </em>and to so indicate in the habitual offender order. Based on this interpretation of the last paragraph of Code \u00a7 46.2-351, appellant argued his habitual offender adjudication was not based on his conviction of driving while intoxicated. He also argued he met all of the other requirements for restoration set forth in Code \u00a7 46.2-361.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>The trial court rejected appellant\u2019s argument and denied his petition. It reasoned the last paragraph of Code \u00a7 46.2-351 did not require it to specify which of the offenses committed by appellant on February 3, 1991, was the basis for its determination that he was an habitual offender. It further reasoned that, because appellant was previously convicted of driving while intoxicated, the determination he was an habitual offender was not based entirely on the offenses set out in Code \u00a7 46.2 \u2014 351(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The trial court also found that appellant still posed a safety threat to other drivers. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-6\">I\u2019m more concerned that if he gets his license back, he\u2019s got a very poor driving record to start with. I\u2019m very concerned not necessarily about him as much as I am everybody else who is out on the highway with him.... I want to make sure that if he\u2019s shown the bad judgment that he\u2019s shown and the disregard for the laws of the highways of the Commonwealth of Virginia and disregard for the safety of other people out on the highway with him, I want to make sure that I know that he doesn\u2019t have an alcohol problem when he goes back out there to operate a motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">RESTORATION OF DRIVING PRIVILEGE UNDER CODE \u00a7 46.2-361(B)</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">Appellant contends the trial court abused its discretion when it denied his petition for restoration. He argues the trial court modified his habitual offender order in violation of Rule 1:1 when it indicated that his habitual offender adjudication was based in part on his prior conviction of driving while intoxicated. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">In order to obtain restoration of the privilege to operate a motor vehicle under Code \u00a7 46.2-361(B), an habitual offender has the burden of proving (1) that the determination he or she was an habitual offender \u201cwas based entirely upon convictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>as set out in [Code \u00a7 46.2-351(1)(c) ]\u201d for failure to pay fines and costs, furnish proof of financial responsibility, or satisfy a judgment, (2) that he or she has made \u201cpayment in full of all outstanding fines, costs and judgments relating to [the] determination,\u201d (8) that he or she has attained \u201cfinancial responsibility, if applicable,\u201d and (4) that he or she \u201cdoes not constitute a threat to the safety and welfare of himself or others with respect to the operation of a motor vehicle.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-361(B) to (D).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The issue in this case is whether the trial court\u2019s prior adjudication that appellant was an habitual offender was <em>\u201cbased entirely </em>upon convictions as set out in [Code \u00a7 46.2-351(1)(c)].\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-361(B) (emphasis added). The convictions listed in Code \u00a7 46.2-351(1)(c) are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-6\">[d]riving a motor vehicle while his license, permit, or privilege to drive a motor vehicle has been suspended or revoked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-272, 46.2-801/46.2-302, or former \u00a7 46.1-350 or \u00a7 46.1-351.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Under Code \u00a7 46.2-351(1), a person is an habitual offender if an examination of his or her driving record reveals \u201cthree or more\u201d prior convictions within the past ten years of the offenses enumerated in that subsection. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-351(1); <em>Dicker v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 658, 661, 472 S.E.2d 655, 657 <em>(1996). </em>Under this framework, a determination that an individual is an habitual offender is \u201cbased\u201d in part on <em>all </em>of the relevant prior convictions listed in the individual\u2019s driving record. <em>Cf. Dorn v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 110, 115, 348 S.E.2d 412, 415 (1986) (holding that, where the defendant was adjudged an habitual offender in 1978, his privilege to drive was restored in 1983, and in 1985 he was again adjudged an habitual offender, the Commonwealth was not estopped from using in the 1985 proceeding two of the convictions previously used in the 1978 proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">We hold that the trial court did not violate Rule <em>1:1 </em>at the hearing on appellant\u2019s petition. Although the trial court stated at the hearing that the determination appellant was an habitual offender in 1995 was based on appellant\u2019s conviction of driving while intoxicated, this statement did not constitute a modification of its prior habitual offender order.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">Rule 1:1 prohibits a trial court from modifying a final order more than twenty-one days after its entry. <em>See Davis v. Mullins, </em>251 Va. 141, 148-49, 466 S.E.2d 90, 94 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">Appellant correctly contends that the two offenses he committed on February 3, 1991 \u2014 driving while intoxicated and driving under suspension \u2014 were required to be treated as one offense for the purpose of counting his prior convictions. Code \u00a7 46.2-351, which defines who is an habitual offender, provides an exception to the method used to count prior convictions when multiple offenses are committed within a six-hour period by a first-time offender. The last paragraph of this statute states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>[w]here more than one offense included in subdivision 1, 2 or 3 is committed within a six-hour period, multiple offenses shall, on the first such occasion, be treated for the purposes of this article as one offense provided the person charged has no record of prior' offenses chargeable under this article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Code \u00a7 46.2-351; <em>see Commonwealth v. Stanley, </em>232 Va. 57, 59, 348 S.E.2d 231, 232-33 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">However, the unambiguous language of this paragraph of Code \u00a7 46.2-351 merely dictates how offenses committed simultaneously or in rapid succession by a first-time offender are <em>counted, </em>not how they are classified. Contrary to appellant\u2019s argument, when this provision applies, it does not require a trial court adjudicating a person to be an habitual offender to either choose among the multiple offenses or to specify in its final order which offense provided the basis for the court\u2019s determination. Regardless of how the last paragraph of Code \u00a7 46.2-351 required the trial court to count appellant\u2019s offenses on February 3, 1991, the trial court\u2019s determination in 1995 that appellant was an habitual offender was based in part on his conviction of driving while intoxicated because this offense was included in his driving record at that time. Thus, the trial court\u2019s statements at the hearing on appellant\u2019s petition did not constitute a modification of its prior order.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">We also hold that the trial court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s petition for restoration of his driving privilege based on Code \u00a7 46.2-361(B) was not an abuse of discretion. The record does not indicate that appellant\u2019s prior habitual offender adjudication was \u201cbased entirely\u201d on convictions set forth in Code \u00a7 46.2 \u2014 351(1)(c). Driving while intoxicated is listed in subsection (1)(b) of Code \u00a7 46.2-351, not subsection (1)(c). Because appellant\u2019s habitual offender adjudication in 1995 was partially based on his prior conviction of driving while intoxicated, the trial court did not err when it concluded that appellant failed to meet the threshold requirement for restoration of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>driving privilege under Code \u00a7 46.2-361(B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the order denying appellant\u2019s petition for restoration of his driving privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-7\">. Code \u00a7 46.2-361(B) states in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-8\">Any person who has been found to be an habitual offender, where the determination was based entirely upon convictions as set out in subdivision 1 c of \u00a7 46.2-351, may, after payment in full of all outstanding fines, costs and judgments relating to his determination, and furnishing proof of financial responsibility, if applicable, petition the court in which he was found to be an habitual offender, or the circuit court in the political subdivision in which he resides, for restoration of his privilege to drive a motor vehicle in the Commonwealth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">Code \u00a7 46.2-361(C) states in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-10\">This section shall apply only where the conviction resulted from a suspension or revocation ordered pursuant to (i) \u00a7 46.2-395 for failure to pay fines and costs, (ii) \u00a7 46.2-459 for failure to furnish proof of financial responsibility or (iii) \u00a7 46.2-417 for failure to satisfy a judgment provided the judgment has been paid in full prior to the time of filing the petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">Code \u00a7 46.2-361(D) states in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-12\">On any such petition, the court, in its discretion, may restore to the person his privilege to drive a motor vehicle, on whatever conditions the court may prescribe, if the court is satisfied from the evidence presented that the petitioner does not constitute a threat to the safety and welfare of himself or others with respect to the operation of a motor vehicle, and that he has satisfied in full all outstanding court costs, court fines and judgments relating to determination as an habitual offender and furnished proof of financial responsibility, if applicable.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b676-16\">. We also note that, even if appellant\u2019s habitual offender adjudication had been based entirely on convictions of driving while his license was suspended or revoked, he was still not entitled to restoration of his driving privilege under Code \u00a7 46.2-361(B). In order to restore a petitioner\u2019s driving privilege under this statute, the trial court must find \"from the evidence presented that the petitioner does not constitute a threat to the safety and welfare of himself or others with respect to the operation of a motor vehicle....\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-361(D). In this case, the trial court expressly found that appellant still posed a threat to the safety of other drivers. Appellant\u2019s prior driving record, which included ten convictions of traffic-related offenses within a seven-year period, one of which was for driving while intoxicated, amply supports that finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
