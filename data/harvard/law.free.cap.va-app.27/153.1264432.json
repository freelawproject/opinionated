The Commission contends the circuit court erred when it (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>concluded that Porter-Blaine Corporation\u2019s service of its petition for judicial review upon the Commissioner of the VEC satisfied the \u201cservice\u201d requirement of Code \u00a7 60.2-500(B) and (2) concluded that Porter-Blaine Corporation had met its burden of proof to qualify for the exemption from tax liability found in Code \u00a7 60.2-212(C). For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Porter-Blaine Corporation (\u201cPorter-Blaine\u201d) is in the business of installing drywall for general contractors engaged in the construction of residential and commercial buildings. It has twenty-eight employees, including \u201claborers, secretarial staff, superintendents, [and] repair people.\u201d In some of its residential projects, Porter-Blaine uses between twenty and thirty workers on a job-by-job basis to hang and finish drywall boards and to apply plaster to walls (\u201cdrywall installers\u201d). Porter-Blaine considered these drywall installers to be independent contractors. As such, it excluded the remuneration paid to these workers from its calculation of its tax liability under the Unemployment Compensation Act (\u201cAct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">In 1994, the Commission conducted an audit of Porter-Blaine\u2019s payroll for the years 1991, 1992, and 1993. On November 10,1994, the Commission determined that the work performed by the drywall installers was \u201cemployment\u201d under Code \u00a7 60.2-212 and that Porter-Blaine was required to pay taxes on the remuneration it paid to these workers. Porter-Blaine appealed this determination. Following a hearing, a special examiner made extensive factual findings and concluded that the service performed by the drywall installers for Porter-Blaine was \u201cemployment\u201d under Code \u00a7 60.2-212. Specifically, the special examiner concluded that Porter-Blaine failed to prove that the drywall installers were either free from its control as required by Code \u00a7 60.2-212(0(1) or independently established businesses under Code \u00a7 60.2-212(C)(2). Regarding the issue of control, the special examin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>er found that Porter-Blaine possessed the right to terminate the services of drywall installers \u201cat will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">On June 18, 1996, Porter-Blaine filed a timely petition for judicial review of the special examiner\u2019s decision. The petition contained a certificate of service signed by Porter-Blaine\u2019s counsel stating that \u201ctwo copies of the [petition were] sent via overnight delivery, this <em>12th </em>day of <em>June, </em>1996 to Dr. Thomas J. Towberman, Commissioner, Virginia Employment Commission .... \u201d (Emphasis in original). The Commission concedes that the Commissioner received these copies of the petition within the statutorily prescribed time period. On August 13, William D. Hester, Sr., who was an authorized process server, personally delivered two copies of Porter-Blaine\u2019s petition to the Commission. On October 3, the Commission moved to dismiss Porter-Blaine\u2019s petition for judicial review on the ground that Porter-Blaine had failed to comply with the \u201cservice\u201d requirement of Code \u00a7 60.2-500(B)(1). The circuit court overruled the Commission\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The circuit court then reversed the decision of the special examiner. It first concluded that \u201call of the Commission\u2019s findings of fact are supported by the record.\u201d However, it then held that the special examiner\u2019s legal analysis was erroneous. The circuit court concluded that the evidence offered by Porter-Blaine was sufficient as a matter of law to prove that \u201cit [did] not control the installers in their performance of their work\u201d and that the drywall installers were engaged in independently established businesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">\u201cSERVICE\u201d UNDER CODE \u00a7 60.2-500(B)(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">The Commission first contends the circuit court erred when it refused to dismiss Porter-Blaine\u2019s petition for judicial review due to insufficient service. It argues that Porter-Blaine\u2019s mailing of two copies of its petition to the Commissioner, although timely, was not sufficient to effect \u201cservice\u201d under Code \u00a7 60.2-500(B)(1). It also argues that, although it was eventually served with two copies of the petition by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>statutorily authorized process server, this personal service was untimely because it was effected more than two months after Porter-Blaine filed its petition with the circuit court. Because two copies of Porter-Blaine\u2019s petition reached the Commissioner within the time prescribed by law, we conclude that the circuit court did not err when it denied the Commission\u2019s motion to dismiss for insufficient service.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">Under Code \u00a7 60.2-500(B)(1), an employer may seek judicial review of a determination by the Commission regarding the employer\u2019s tax liability for particular services.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the proceedings for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decisions are governed by statute, the mandatory requirements for perfecting a judicial review must be met in order to confer jurisdiction upon the circuit court. <em>See </em>73A C.J.S. <em>Public Administrative Law and Procedure </em>\u00a7 208 (1983); <em>cf. Mayo v. Dept. of Commerce of the Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 520, 522-23, 358 S.E.2d 759, 761 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Regarding the requirement for service of an employer\u2019s petition upon the Commissioner, Code \u00a7 60.2-500(B)(1) does not prescribe any particular method of delivery. Instead, the statute merely states that \u201c[sjervice of two copies of such petition upon the Commissioner shall be deemed completed service.... \u201d Code \u00a7 60.2-500(B)(1). Moreover, the language of the statute regarding the service requirement is ambiguous. That statute refers only to \u201cservice,\u201d a term that is capable of being reasonably understood as permitting various modes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>delivery. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1368-69 (6th ed. 1990) (stating that, in the procedural context, \u201cservice\u201d can refer to personal service, substituted service, service by publication, or service by mail).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Although Code \u00a7 60.2-500(B)(1) does not prescribe the permissible methods for serving petitions for judicial review upon the Commissioner, Code \u00a7 8.01-287 does. Code \u00a7 8.01-287 states that \u201c[u]pon commencement of an <em>action, </em>process shall be served in the manner set forth in [Chapter 8 of Title 8.01 of the Code] and by the Rules of the Supreme Court.\u201d (Emphasis added). The General Assembly defined \u201caction\u201d when used in Title 8.01 to \u201cinclude all civil proceedings whether at law, in equity, or <em>statutory in nature </em>and whether in circuit courts or district courts.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-2 (emphasis added). Petitions for judicial review under Code \u00a7 60.2-500(B) are statutory creations and, as such, they are included among the \u201cactions\u201d covered by Code \u00a7 8.01-287. Thus, the \u201cservice\u201d of a petition for judicial review under Code \u00a7 60.2-500(B)(1) must comply with the requirements of Chapter 8 of Title 8.01 of the Code and Rule 2A of the Rules of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Although Chapter 8 of Title 8.01 imposes restrictions upon how personal service of civil proceedings may be validly effected, the Chapter also contains a \u201ccuring statute.\u201d <em>Garritty v. Virginia Dept. of Soc. Services, 11 </em>Va.App. 39, 42 n. 2, 396 S.E.2d 150, 151 n. 2 (1990) (citing Code \u00a7 8.01-288). Code \u00a7 8.01-288 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">[ejxcept for process commencing actions for divorce or annulment of marriage or other actions wherein service of process is specifically prescribed by statute, <em>process which has reached the person to whom it is directed within the time prescribed by law, if any, shall be sufficient although not served or accepted as provided in this chapter.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">(Emphasis added). Code \u00a7 8.01-288 applies to the service of petitions for judicial review under Code \u00a7 60.2-500(B)(1) because, as previously discussed, Code \u00a7 60.2-500(B)(1) does not \u201cspecifically prescribe\u201d a particular method of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Applying these principles to this case, we hold that the circuit court did not err when it denied the Commission\u2019s motion to dismiss Porter-Blaine\u2019s petition for judicial review due to insufficient service. Although Porter-Blaine\u2019s service of its petition upon the Commissioner by overnight mail failed to comply with the requirements for personal service set forth in Chapter 8 of Title 8.01, the Commission conceded in its brief that the Commissioner actually received the two copies of the petition \u201cby mail within the time limits prescribed by law.\u201d Thus, because the two copies of Porter-Blaine\u2019s petition reached the Commissioner in a timely fashion, its service of the petition was \u201csufficient\u201d under Code \u00a7 8.01-288.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u201cEMPLOYMENT\u201d UNDER CODE \u00a7 60.2-212</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The Commission contends the circuit court also erred when it concluded that the work performed by the drywall installers for Porter-Blaine was not \u201cemployment\u201d under Code \u00a7 60.2-212(C). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Code \u00a7 60.2-212(0 delineates the services that are considered \u201cemployment\u201d for the purpose of calculating an employer\u2019s tax liability under the Act. Code \u00a7 60.2-212(0 states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-9\">Services performed by an individual for remuneration shall be deemed to be employment subject to this title unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-10\">1. Such individual has been and will continue to be free from control or direction over the performance of such services, both under his contract of service and in fact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>2. Such service is either outside the usual course of the business for which such service is performed, or such service is performed outside of all the places of business of the enterprise for which service is performed; or such individual, in the performance of such service, is engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Service that satisfies <em>both </em>Code \u00a7 60.2-212(0(1) and (C)(2) does not constitute \u201cemployment\u201d under the Act, and employers are not required to include the remuneration paid for such service as \u201cwages payable for employment\u201d when calculating their tax liability to the Unemployment Compensation Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">In a proceeding to determine whether particular service performed by an individual is \u201cemployment\u201d for tax purposes under the Act, the burden is initially on the Commission to prove that service was performed for remuneration. <em>See Virginia Employment Comm\u2019n v. Thomas Regional Directory, Inc., </em>13 Va.App. 610, 612, 414 S.E.2d 412, 414 (1992). Once the Commission satisfies this burden, the burden shifts to the alleged employer to prove that the service falls outside the statutory definition of employment. <em>See id.; Life &amp; Casualty Ins. Co. of Tennessee v. Unemployment Compensation Comm\u2019n, </em>178 Va. 46, 57, 16 S.E.2d 357, 361 (1941). The alleged employer must \u201cestablish that it meets both the criteria of subsections (C)(1) and one of the three exceptions of subsection (C)(2).\u201d <em>Thomas Regional Directory, Inc., </em>13 Va. App. at 612, 414 S.E.2d at 414. If the employer fails to meet this burden of proof, then \u201can \u2018employment\u2019 relationship exists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 612, 414 S.E.2d at 414-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">On appeal, the Commission\u2019s findings of fact are conclusive \u201cif supported by the evidence and in the absence of fraud.\u201d Code \u00a7 60.2-500(B)(1). In addition, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the findings made by the Commission. <em>See Virginia Employment Comm\u2019n v. Peninsula Emergency Physicians, Inc., </em>4 Va.App. 621, 626, 359 S.E.2d 552, 554 (1987). Unless the Commission\u2019s factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>findings are erroneous, our jurisdiction is confined to questions of law. Code \u00a7 60.2-500(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">In considering whether Code \u00a7 60.2-212 was correctly applied in a particular case, we are guided by several well established tenets of our jurisprudence under the Act. First, because the Act is a public welfare measure intended \u201cto assure a measure of security against the hazard of unemployment in our economic life,\u201d it is liberally construed. <em>Unemployment Compensation Comm\u2019n v. Collins, </em>182 Va. 426, 438, 29 S.E.2d 388, 393 (1944). In accordance with this rule of construction, employment is found to exist in \u201cborderline cases,\u201d <em>id., </em>and \u201c[e]xemptions in the Act should be strictly construed against the alleged employer.\u201d <em>Virginia Employment Comm\u2019n v. A.I.M. Corp., </em>225 Va. 338, 346, 302 S.E.2d 534, 539 (1983). Second, the statutory definition of employment under the Act is \u201cbroader and more inclusive than in the common-law context of master and servant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>178 Va. at 57, 16 S.E.2d at 361). Finally, whether a particular relationship constituted employment is determined more from the actual practice of the parties in their day-to-day interactions than by any formal understanding between them. <em>Collins, </em>182 Va. at 434, 29 S.E.2d at 391. \u201c[T]he individual\u2019s status in relation to the alleged employer is to be determined from all the facts and circumstances adduced by the evidence, including the provisions of any written agreement.\u201d A.I<em>.M. Corp., </em>225 Va. at 347, 302 S.E.2d at 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Turning to the facts of this case, we hold that the circuit court erred when it concluded that the evidence offered by Porter-Blaine was sufficient as a matter of law to prove that the service performed by the drywall installers fell outside the statutory definition of \u201cemployment.\u201d Specifically, Porter-Blaine\u2019s evidence did not prove that the work performed by the drywall installers was free from its control or direction. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 60.2-212(0(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>In determining whether an alleged employer has proven that an alleged employee is \u201cfree from control or direction\u201d under Code \u00a7 60.2-212(0(1), we consider whether the alleged employer had either \u201cactual\u201d or \u201cpotential\u201d power of control over the performance of the services. <em>A.I.M. Corp., </em>225 Va. at 347, 302 S.E.2d at 539-40. Under the statute, an alleged employer had the \u201cright of control\u201d and an alleged employee was not \u201cfree\u201d from control if the evidence regarding the parties\u2019 contract or their daily interactions indicates that the alleged employer had <em>both </em>(1) the power to specify the result to be accomplished <em>and </em>(2) power \u201cover the performance\u201d of the work. <em>See id. </em>at 347, 302 S.E.2d at 540 (quoting former version of Code \u00a7 60.2-212(0(1)); see <em>also Brothers Constr. Co. v. Virginia Employment Comm\u2019n, </em>26 Va.App. 286, 295, 494 S.E.2d 478, 483 (1998). Because the result to be accomplished is specified in most contracts, the power over how the work is performed is frequently the dispositive element.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-4\">If the party for whom the work is to be done has the power to direct the means and methods by which the other does the work, an employer-employee relationship exists; if the latter is free to adopt such means and methods as he chooses to accomplish the result, he is not an employee but an independent contractor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-5\"><em>A.I.M. Corp., </em>225 Va. at 347, 302 S.E.2d at 540 (citing <em>Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Gill, </em>224 Va. 92, 93, 294 S.E.2d 840, 843 (1982)). An alleged employee is not \u201cfree from control or direction over the performance of such services\u201d if the record indicates that the alleged employer may instruct the alleged employee regarding the means and methods chosen to accomplish the result and such instructions \u201chave to be obeyed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 347, 302 S.E.2d at 540 (citing <em>Texas Co. v. Zeigler, </em>177 Va. 557, 565, 14 S.E.2d 704, 707 (1941)). Similarly, if the alleged employer had the power to discharge the alleged employee from its service because of disobedience, then the alleged employer had the legal right of control and the service is \u201cemployment\u201d under the statute. <em>See Zeigler, </em>177 Va. at 569, 14 S.E.2d at 709 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>The evidence offered by Porter-Blaine was insufficient as a matter of law to prove that it was completely without power to designate the manner in which the drywall installers performed their work. Although Samuel L. Porter, the president of Porter-Blaine, testified that Porter-Blaine had no \u201cright to direct the manner or the [means] in which the [drywall installer] performs his services,\u201d the evidence in the record regarding the day-to-day interactions between Porter-Blaine and the drywall installers proved otherwise. The Commission expressly found that Porter-Blaine possessed the right to terminate the services of drywall installers \u201cat will,\u201d and the evidence in the record, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commission, is sufficient to support this finding. Porter testified that Porter-Blaine told at least one drywall installer that \u201che didn\u2019t ... need [to] finish\u201d a particular project because he \u201cwasn\u2019t doing a good job.\u201d Because, in practice, Porter-Blaine had the potential right to discharge installers for disobedience with the company\u2019s standards while work was in progress, it legally had the \u201cright to control\u201d the performance of the drywall installers\u2019 work. <em>See Zeigler, </em>177 Va. at 569, 14 S.E.2d at 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">On the issue of control, this case is virtually indistinguishable from <em>Brothers Constr. Co., </em>a case decided after the circuit court reviewed the Commission\u2019s decision in this case. Like the alleged employer in <em>Brothers Constr. Co., </em>Porter-Blaine had the power to terminate the drywall installers at will, dictated the materials they used, and retained authority after the job was finished to scrutinize the quality of the work and require improvements. <em>See Brothers Constr. Co., </em>26 Va.App. at 296, 291, 494 S.E.2d at 488, 481 (applying Code \u00a7 60.2-212(C) to arrangements between a company who obtained contracts to install siding on buildings and \u201csiding installers\u201d who performed the actual installation). The dispositive element in both of these cases is the potential power to terminate the installers prior to the completion of the work that was the subject of the parties\u2019 contract, which is a mechanism that has the effect of regulating the performance of the installers\u2019 work. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Zeigler, </em>\u201c \u2018[the] power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>of discharge made obligatory any instructions given, for it gave to [the employer] the power to require obedience to those instructions and insured their being carried out.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Zeigler, </em>177 Va. at 565, 14 S.E.2d at 707 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Because Porter-Blaine failed to prove as a matter of law that the drywall installers were \u201cfree from [its] control or direction,\u201d the service performed by these installers was within the Act\u2019s definition of employment, and Porter-Blaine was required to pay taxes on the remuneration it paid to them. For this reason, we need not consider whether Porter-Blaine proved that these installers were independently established businesses under Code \u00a7 60.2-212(0(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the order of the circuit court reversing the Commission\u2019s decision and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b201-6\">. Code \u00a7 60.2-500(B)(1) states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">Judicial review of [the Commission\u2019s decisions regarding the tax liability of an employer] may be initiated within thirty days after mailing notice of such findings and determination to the employing unit or, in the absence of mailing, within thirty days after delivering such notice and determination, in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond. Such judicial review shall be commenced by the filing of a petition, which need not be verified but which shall state the grounds upon which a review is sought. <em>Service of two copies of such petition upon the Commissioner shall be deemed completed service </em>and such petition shall be filed with the clerk of the court within five days after service thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b203-11\">. Because we hold that Porter-Blaine effected sufficient service of its petition upon the Commissioner in June 1996, we need not address whether the personal service of the petition by an authorized process server more than two months after it was filed in the circuit court was \"untimely.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
