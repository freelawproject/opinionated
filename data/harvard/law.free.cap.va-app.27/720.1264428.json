On appeal, defendant complains that the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions. We agree and reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">Under familiar principles, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"A2M\">On January 1,1997, Lynchburg Police Officer M.R. Gillispie was dispatched to a single car accident at 12th and Federal Streets. Upon arrival, Gillispie found an automobile crashed into a utility pole and medical personnel treating a passenger for \u201csevere head injuries.\u201d Neither the driver nor other occupants of the vehicle were at the scene, but Gillispie soon learned that another officer had detained a suspect a \u201ccouple blocks from the accident.\u201d Gillispie proceeded immediately to that location and encountered defendant, bleeding from a \u201cvisible cut to his face and nose and ... complaining of chest pain,\u201d injuries \u201cconsistent with the crushed steering wheel and the face print on the driver\u2019s side windshield.\u201d Gillispie also observed that defendant\u2019s eyes were \u201cglassy,\u201d he was \u201cunsteady on his feet,\u201d and emitted \u201ca strong odor of alcohol.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>When defendant was unable to successfully perform a series of field sobriety tests, Gillispie arrested him for driving under the influence of alcohol.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Subsequent to arrest, defendant stated he drove the vehicle at the time of the accident, \u201cbecause the others were too drunk,\u201d and \u201chad been an habitual offender for about ten years.\u201d Although he denied drinking alcohol after the accident, defendant admitted consuming \u201cabout four beers and two shots of liquor\u201d sometime previously, at an unnamed location on Federal Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">At trial, the court, after accepting defendant\u2019s guilty plea to leaving the scene of the accident in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-894, convicted him upon pleas of not guilty to reckless driving and felonious endangerment by an habitual offender, the instant offenses. On appeal, defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the latter convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">\n<em>I. Reckless Driving</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">Code \u00a7 46.2-852 provides, in pertinent part, that \u201cany person who drives a vehicle on any highway recklessly or at a speed in a manner so as to endanger the life, limb, or property of any person shall be guilty of reckless driving.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-852. \u201cThe word \u2018recklessly\u2019 as used in the statute imparts a disregard by the driver of a motor vehicle for the consequences of his act and an indifference to the safety of life, limb or property.\u201d <em>Powers v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 386, 388, 177 S.E.2d 628, 630 (1970). \u201cThe essence of the offense ... lies not in the act of operating a vehicle, but in the manner and circumstances of its operation.\u201d <em>Id.; Hall v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 352, 355, 488 S.E.2d 651, 653 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>(1997). Thus, \u201c[t]he mere happening of an accident does not give rise to an inference of reckless driving.\u201d <em>Powers, </em>211 Va. at 388, 177 S.E.2d at 630. To convict, the Commonwealth must \u201cprove every essential element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d with evidence which excludes \u201cevery reasonable hypothesis of innocence and ... consistent only with ... guilt....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 388, 177 S.E.2d at 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">In <em>Hall, </em>we considered the import of intoxication evidence in a prosecution for reckless driving. Hall was discovered by police \u201c\u2018passed out\u2019 behind the wheel\u201d of an automobile stopped in a heavily traveled roadway, with \u201cignition switch and headlights ... on and ... indicator lights ... illuminated.\u201d Hall smelled of alcohol, was confused, unsteady, slurred in speech and admitted \u201cdriving\u201d the vehicle. However, the record was silent with respect to the \u201cmanner and circumstances\u201d of Hall\u2019s driving. <em>Hall, </em>25 Va.App. at 355, 488 S.E.2d at 653. Guided by <em>Powers, </em>we concluded that such \u201ccircumstances ... do not give rise to an inference that [defendant] drove ... in a reckless manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In reversing the conviction, the panel noted that \u201c \u2018evidence of intoxication is a factor that might bear upon proof of dangerousness or reckless driving in a given case,\u2019 \u201d but \u201c \u2018does not, of itself, prove reckless driving.\u2019 \u2018 \u201cOne may be both drunk and reckless ... [or] reckless though not drunk ... [, or] under the influence of intoxicants and yet drive carefully.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 355 n. 3, 488 S.E.2d at 653 n. 3 (quoting <em>Bishop v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 206, 210, 455 S.E.2d 765, 767 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Here, assuming, without deciding, that the evidence proved defendant had been driving the car while intoxicated at the time of the collision, it establishes little else. The record does not disclose the time of the accident, the manner in which defendant drove the car, his blood alcohol level, the road conditions, weather, traffic controls, or other circumstances probative of a Code \u00a7 46.2-852 violation. Reckless driving is not a status offense, and defendant cannot be convicted upon \u201cspeculation and conjecture as to what caused [him] to lose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>control of the car.\u201d <em>Powers, </em>211 Va. at 389, 177 S.E.2d at 630. Thus, under the instant facts, we find the evidence insufficient to support a conviction for reckless driving.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">\n<em>II. Habitual Offender Endangerment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(2) elevates driving by an habitual offender from a misdemeanor to a felony when \u201csuch driving <em>... of itself </em>endangers the life, limb, or property of another,\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-357 (emphasis added), \u201clanguage virtually identical to that found in the statute defining reckless driving.\u201d <em>Bishop, </em>20 Va.App. at 211, 455 S.E.2d at 767; Code \u00a7 46.2-852. Hence, we also find the evidence insufficient to support a finding of felonious habitual offender endangerment and reverse the conviction. However, because the record clearly establishes that defendant violated Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(1), the misdemeanor offense, we remand for further proceedings, if the Commonwealth be so advised. <em>See Gorham v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 673, 678-79, 426 S.E.2d 493, 497 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b765-9\">. Defendant was found not guilty of driving under the influence by the general district court. Although evidence of intoxication was presented during the instant trial for reckless driving, the record does not disclose defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content, and the trial court did not find that he was intoxicated either at the time of the accident or arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b767-8\"><em>. </em>The Commonwealth mistakenly relies upon <em>Kennedy v. Commonwealth, </em>1 Va.App. 469, 339 S.E.2d 905 (1986), as support for the inference that proof of defendant\u2019s intoxication sufficiently explained the accident. In <em>Kennedy, </em>the evidence clearly supported the inference that the accused \"fell asleep at the wheel,\u201d resulting in a collision. <em>Id. </em>at 472, 339 S.E.2d at 907. Manifestly, driving a vehicle while sleeping evinces the disregard for the life, limb and property contemplated by Code \u00a7 46.2-852.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
