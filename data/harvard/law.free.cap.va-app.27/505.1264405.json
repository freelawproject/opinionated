Marable (appellant) appeals from his bench trial conviction by the Circuit Court of Lunenburg County (trial court) for burning an occupied dwelling in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-77(A). Appellant contends the evidence was insufficient to prove (1) that the burning was intentional and (2) that he was the criminal agent. He also contends the evidence was insufficient to prove that the burned building was \u201coccupied\u201d and that, as a consequence he was subject, at most, to the lesser punishment contained in Code \u00a7 18.2-77(B) for the burning of an unoccupied dwelling. Finding no error, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Stated in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom, the evidence discloses that appellant lived with Gloria Folks in her rented residence in Chase City, Virginia. After an argument on August 16, 1996, Folks told him to leave. Appellant stayed the night of August 16 and left the morning of August 17, but returned, intoxicated, around 8:00 p.m. that evening. Folks refused appellant\u2019s demand for food and again told him to leave. While cursing her, appellant told Folks that he was \u201cstaying right here,\u201d was \u201cgoing to eat,\u201d and that there was \u201cnothing [she] can do about it.\u201d When Folks pushed appellant to try to make him leave, he became violent and said, \u201cI\u2019m tired of you and your sister and your friend____ I\u2019m going to kill all of you m-fs.\u201d When Folks attempted to leave, appellant tried to force her back into the house. She broke free and ran into the house. Appellant followed, assaulted Folks, and then threatened to kill her and burn her house.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">Folks managed to escape and drove to appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s house to call the police. Denise Jones, Folks\u2019 next door <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>neighbor, observed the confrontation and Folks\u2019 departure. Within three or four seconds of Folks\u2019 departure, Jones saw fire coming from a window of Folks\u2019 house. When informed by Jones that the house was afire, Folks returned and found appellant sitting on his car watching her house burn. Appellant was yelling, \u201c[L]et it burn,\u201d and said, \u201cIf I can\u2019t live in it, ain\u2019t nobody going to live in it.\u201d In addition, when fire fighter Whitaker arrived, appellant cursed him and said, \u201cLet it burn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Appellant admitted to Deputy Sheriff Stokes that he caused the fire but claimed it was accidental. Appellant said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">I lit a cigarette and dropped a match on the gas that was on the porch. There were two containers of gas on the porch. I was putting gas in the lawn mower, when I dropped a match ... and it caught fire____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">Gloria Folks and I had an argument. She slapped and choked me. I grabbed her and ripped her shirt. She left and went down the road. I tried to stop her, but could not. I said, I\u2019d better finish cutting the grass. And that\u2019s when I lit ... the cigarette and dropped the match on the porch. And that\u2019s when the gas caught on fire.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">State police arson expert Danny Beamon testified that the burn pattern disclosed the fire started inside the house in a loveseat and that the fire was very hot and spread rapidly, shattering windows. He eliminated as a cause any electrical malfunction, lightning, or lawn mower gas as sources. Beam-on said the only fire outside the house originated from inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">Under familiar principles of appellate review, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>See Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). The credibility of a witness and the inferences to be drawn from proven facts are matters solely for the fact finder\u2019s determination. <em>See Long v. Commonwealth, 8 </em>Va.App. 194, 199, 379 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1989). In its role of judging witness credibility, the fact finder is entitled to disbelieve the self-serving testimony of the accused and to conclude that the accused is lying to conceal his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>guilt. <em>See Speight v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 83, 88, 354 S.E.2d 95, 98 (1987) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">\u201cCircumstantial evidence is as competent and is entitled to as much weight as direct evidence, provided it is sufficiently convincing to exclude every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 31, 53, 307 S.E.2d 864, 876 (1983). \u201c[T]he Commonwealth need only exclude reasonable hypotheses of innocence that flow from the evidence, not those that spring from the imagination of the defendant.\u201d <em>Hamilton v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 751, 755, 433 S.E.2d 27, 29 (1993). Whether a hypothesis of innocence is reasonable is a question of fact. <em>See Cantrell v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 269, 290, 373 S.E.2d 328, 339 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">I. Proof of Arson and Criminal Agency</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The Commonwealth had the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt both that the fire was incendiary and that the accused was the criminal agent. <em>See Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>103 Va. 1012, 1019, 49 S.E. 663, 666 (1905). Although fires are presumed to be accidental, that presumption is rebuttable. <em>See Knight v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 85, 89, 300 S.E.2d 600, 601-02 (1983). Here, as in <em>Knight, </em>the presumption of accident was clearly negated by the expert testimony of State Police Officer Beamon. No evidence proved that any potential arsonist other than appellant was present when the fire broke out. With \u201cthe testimony of a qualified expert ... negating] every reasonable possibility that a fire was of accidental origin,\u201d the fact finder was entitled to reject any conflicting evidence relative to accidental cause. <em>See Cook v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 427, 432, 309 S.E.2d 325, 328 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Beamon\u2019s testimony, coupled with other evidence, rebutted appellant\u2019s claim that the burning was accidental and showed arson as its cause. Appellant was angry with Folks, had threatened to burn the house just minutes before Folks fled, and said that no one would live in the house if he could not. He told fire fighters to \u201clet it burn.\u201d Appellant admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>starting the fire but claimed it started accidentally outside on the deck. However, based on evidence that the fire started inside the house in the loveseat rather than outside on the deck, the court was entitled to conclude that appellant also lied when he said the fire was accidental. The evidence, including appellant\u2019s lack of veracity, effectively overcame the presumption of accident and is sufficient to support the fact finder\u2019s conclusion that appellant was the criminal agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">II. Occupancy</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The indictment charged that, \u201con or about the 17th day of August, 1996, in the County of Lunenburg, Virginia, [William Marable] did unlawfully, feloniously and maliciously burn the occupied dwelling house of Gloria Fowlkes [sic], against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth of Virginia,\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-77, which proscribes arson as a felony. Appellant contends Code \u00a7 18.2-77(B) reduces the penalty for arson when the dwelling is unoccupied and that \u201cthe Commonwealth\u2019s own evidence\u201d proved \u201cthere wasn\u2019t anybody in that house.\u201d The record proved that Folks and appellant lived in the house, which Folks rented from her brother-in-law. Folks fled the residence immediately prior to the fire, but no direct evidence proved whether anyone else was present in the house when the fire was set.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The portion of Code \u00a7 18.2-77(A) relevant to the indictment provides that if \u201cany person maliciously (i) burns ... or causes to be burned ... any dwelling house ... or other house in which persons usually dwell[,] ... he shall be guilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment for life or for any period not less than five years and ... a fine of not more than $100,000.\u201d Subsection (B) of Code \u00a7 18.2-77 provides that \u201c[a]ny such burning or destruction when the building or other place mentioned in subsection A is unoccupied, shall be punishable as a Class 4 felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Appellant asks us to construe \u201coccupied\u201d and \u201cunoccupied\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 18.2-77 to require proof that a person was physically on the premises burned before an accused may be found guilty under subsection (A) of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>statute. We decline the request. \u2018When the legislature has spoken plainly, it is not the function of courts to change or amend its enactments under the guise of construing them.\u201d <em>Winston v. City of Richmond, </em>196 Va. 403, 407-08, 83 S.E.2d 728, 731 (1954). \u201c \u2018The province of construction lies wholly within the domain of ambiguity,\u2019 \u201d and that which is plain needs no interpretation. <em>Almond v. Gilmer, </em>188 Va. 1, 14, 49 S.E.2d 431, 439 (1948) (quoting <em>Hamilton v. Rathbone, </em>175 U.S. 414, 421, 20 S.Ct. 155, 158, 44 L.Ed. 219 (1899)). <em>Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary </em>2505 (3d ed. 1986) (emphasis added), defines \u201cunoccupied\u201d as \u201cnot occupied by inhabitants\u201d or \u201crelating to ... premises on which no one is <em>living </em>although the furniture and fixtures have not been removed\u201d and suggests comparison with \u201cvacant.\u201d When pertaining to \u201cpremises,\u201d vacant means \u201cpremises which are not lived in and from which the furniture and fixtures have been removed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2527. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1379 (5th ed. 1979), states that the temporary absence of occupants of a dwelling house does not render the dwelling \u201cunoccupied.\u201d This same principle applied at common law. <em>See Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 6, 8, 427 S.E.2d 441, 442 (1993) (citing <em>State v. Gulley, </em>46 N.C.App. 822, 266 S.E.2d 8, 8 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Our holding in <em>Davis </em>further shows the clear meaning of the word \u201cunoccupied.\u201d In <em>Davis, </em>this Court considered an earlier version of Code \u00a7 18.2-77. The earlier version of the statute reduced arson from a Class 2 to a Class 3 felony if the dwelling burned was \u201ctemporarily unoccupied.\u201d We held that when the dwelling was burned at a time when all its occupants were out of the house merely to rent a movie, the words \u201ctemporarily unoccupied\u201d did not exempt the arsonist from being punished as a Class 2 felon. If the legislature had intended \u201cunoccupied\u201d to mean \u201cwhen no person is in the building,\u201d we concluded, it would have said so as it did when enacting Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-79 and 18.2-80. <em>See </em>16 Va.App. at 7-8, 427 S.E.2d at 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Appellant argues that, because the legislature subsequently deleted the word \u201ctemporarily,\u201d we should construe Code \u00a7 18.2-77 to require proof that one or more people were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>physically present in the dwelling at the time of the burning. We disagree. In <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 441, 446-47, 444 S.E.2d 559, 562 (1994), we said that the term \u201cdwelling house\u201d means a place which human beings regularly use for sleeping even though the occupants are temporarily absent, <em>see Rash v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 22, 26-27, 383 S.E.2d 749, 751 (1989), and that the legislature\u2019s use of the adjective \u201coccupied\u201d to modify \u201cdwelling house\u201d did not require contemporaneous physical occupation. <em>See Johnson, </em>18 Va.App. at 447, 444 S.E.2d at 562. Although <em>Johnson </em>involved an interpretation of Code \u00a7 18.2-92, a breaking and entering statute, we find no reason to distinguish between the two statutes. Therefore, we hold that the legislature\u2019s use of the term \u201cunoccupied\u201d was not intended to reduce the punishment for violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-77 where the occupant or occupants are merely temporarily absent but continue to reside there. The record here proved that the burned premises was a dwelling house \u201coccupied\u201d by Folks within the meaning of the statute and that her absence was temporary at most. For these reasons, the evidence is sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-77(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
