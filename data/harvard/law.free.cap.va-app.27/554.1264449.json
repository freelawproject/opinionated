Harris, Jr. (appellant) appeals his conviction of possession of cocaine in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250. He contends the trial court erred when it (1) denied his motion to suppress evidence obtained during a traffic stop of a car in which he was a passenger and (2) admitted into evidence a police officer\u2019s testimony regarding out-of-court statements made by the car\u2019s driver. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"A70\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b600-13\">The evidence in the record, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, proved that, on June 7, 1996, Trooper John A. Jones of the State Police was patrolling Interstate 95 in a marked police cruiser. At around 11:00 a.m., Trooper Jones noticed a vehicle that was both speeding and making improper lane changes. The car was driven by Tony Maurice Horne, and appellant was a passenger in the front seat. Trooper Jones stopped the vehicle. As Trooper Jones exited his cruiser, appellant opened the passenger side door and leaned over as if he was reaching for something. Appellant then exited the vehicle, appeared \u201cnervous and jittery,\u201d and took \u201ca step or two\u201d in the direction of Trooper Jones\u2019 cruiser. Trooper Jones, who by this time had exited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>his cruiser, commanded appellant to stay where he was and to show his hands. When appellant failed to comply with the trooper\u2019s request, Trooper Jones drew his weapon, pointed it at appellant, and again ordered him to show his hands. Appellant continued moving around and did not display his hands to Trooper Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">\u201cLess than a minute\u201d after Trooper Jones first ordered appellant to show his hands, Trooper Scott Luddy arrived at the scene. Shortly after Trooper Luddy\u2019s arrival, Trooper Jones put away his weapon. Trooper Luddy approached appellant, told him to \u201ccalm down,\u201d and escorted him to the side of the vehicle. Trooper Luddy neither drew his weapon nor pushed appellant to the side of the car. At this point, Trooper Jones walked over to the driver side of the vehicle to investigate whether Horne, the operator, was driving under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Trooper Luddy remained with appellant. Appellant appeared agitated and continued shifting his weight back and forth and moving his hands. At about this time, Trooper Paul D. Watts arrived at the scene and approached Trooper Luddy and appellant. Appellant continued to fidget and appeared excited and argumentative. Trooper Watts, who was qualified as an expert in drug investigations and drug paraphernalia, testified that, based on appellant\u2019s demeanor and behavior, he believed appellant was \u201chigh on crack.\u201d According to Trooper Watts, appellant was neither free to turn around nor to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Appellant consented to Trooper Luddy\u2019s request to conduct a pat-down of appellant\u2019s clothing. During the pat-down, Trooper Luddy felt a \u201cpipe-like device\u201d in appellant\u2019s front pocket. One of the troopers asked appellant to retrieve the object from his pocket, and appellant complied. Appellant pulled out a corn cob pipe and handed it to Trooper Luddy. Trooper Watts examined the pipe and concluded it was a \u201ccrack pipe\u201d because it contained metal meshing typical of such pipes.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">After examining the pipe, Trooper Watts asked appellant a series of questions. Trooper Watts asked appellant if he used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>the pipe to \u201csmoke crack.\u201d Appellant replied that he did not smoke crack cocaine. Trooper Watts then asked appellant where his tobacco was located. Appellant replied that it was in the car and offered to show it to the trooper. Appellant entered his car and retrieved a pouch from the front seat. When appellant opened the pouch, Trooper Watts saw a clear vial with a green cap that is typically used to store illegal drugs. The vial was \u201csitting right on top of the tobacco.\u201d Trooper Watts watched as appellant manipulated the tobacco in the pouch until it covered the vial. Appellant then said, \u201cthis is my tobacco\u201d and handed the pouch to Trooper Watts. Trooper Watts recovered the vial from the bottom of the pouch. The vial contained crack cocaine. Within minutes of this discovery, at 11:20 a.m., Trooper Watts arrested appellant and placed him in handcuffs. Six minutes later, Trooper Watts first informed appellant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">After a grand jury indicted appellant for possessing cocaine in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250, appellant moved the trial court to suppress the cocaine retrieved by Trooper Watts. Following a hearing, the trial court made extensive factual findings and denied appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">At trial during the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief, Trooper Jones testified about an exchange he had with the driver, Horne, after the trooper learned that crack cocaine had been retrieved from appellant. Trooper Jones testified that he asked Horne what he knew about \u201cthe crack in the car.\u201d Trooper Jones testified that Horne made the following statement: \u201cWe went together to buy it last night so we could give it to some whores for sex, but we didn\u2019t use any.\u201d Trooper Jones also testified that Horne stated that he and appellant intended to use the remaining amount to \u201cget a bitch when we get to the beach.\u201d Appellant objected to the admission of Horne\u2019s out-of-court statements on the ground they were inadmissible hearsay. The trial court overruled appellant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Following the presentation of the evidence, the trial court found appellant guilty of possession of cocaine. During its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>ruling from the bench, the trial court stated that it would not consider Horne\u2019s out-of-court statements when determining appellant\u2019s guilt. The trial court subsequently sentenced appellant to serve three years in prison with all but ninety days suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">MOTION TO SUPPRESS</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Appellant contends the trial court erred when it denied his motion to suppress. First, appellant argues the trial court erred when it concluded he was lawfully detained after he exited the vehicle. Second, appellant argues Trooper Watts subjected him to custodial interrogation before he was given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings and that his subsequent responses to this unlawful interrogation resulted in the discovery of the crack cocaine in the tobacco pouch. We disagree with both contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">On appeal from a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, the burden is on the appellant to show that the trial court\u2019s decision constituted reversible error. <em>See Stanley v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 873, 874, 433 S.E.2d 512, 513 (1993). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>See Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991). We review the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact only for \u201cclear error,\u201d but we review <em>de novo </em>the trial court\u2019s application of defined legal standards to the particular facts of a case. <em>See Shears v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 394, 398, 477 S.E.2d 309, 311 (1996); <em>see also Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 697, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1662, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">We first hold that appellant was not unlawfully detained by the troopers after he exited the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>It is well established that \u201cstopping an automobile and detaining its occupants constitute a seizure within the meaning [of the Fourth Amendment] even though the purpose of the stop is limited and the resulting detention quite brief.\u201d <em>Delaware v. Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 653, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 1396, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979) (citations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">A police officer may stop the driver or occupants of an automobile for investigatory purposes if the officer has \u201ca reasonable articulable suspicion, based on objective facts, that the individual is involved in criminal activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-6\"><em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 519, 522, 484 S.E.2d 125, 126 (1997) (citations omitted). Following a lawful traffic stop, the Fourth Amendment permits the police to order the passengers to get out of the car pending the completion of the stop.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Maryland v. Wilson, </em>519 U.S. 408,-, 117 S.Ct. 882, 886, 137 L.Ed.2d 41 (1997). Although the United States Supreme Court has yet to address the issue, <em>see id. </em>at - n. 3, 117 S.Ct. at 886 n. 3, this Court has previously held that police officers may also detain passengers beside an automobile until the completion of a lawful traffic stop. <em>See Hatcher v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 487, 491-92, 419 S.E.2d 256, 259 (1992). This authority over passengers at a lawful traffic stop is deemed a \u201creasonable\u201d seizure under the Fourth Amendment because the \u201cweighty [public] interest in officer safety\u201d during traffic stops, which \u201cmay be dangerous encounters,\u201d sufficiently outweighs the minimal additional intrusion upon the private interests of passengers, who \u201care already stopped by virtue of the [lawful] stop of the vehicle.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>519 U.S. at ---, 117 S.Ct. at 885-86; <em>see also Hatcher, </em>14 Va.App. at 490-92, 419 S.E.2d at 258-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-13\">When the troopers detained appellant, they acted reasonably, as required by the Fourth Amendment, to protect their safety and maintain the status quo during the course of the investigatory traffic stop. Trooper Jones lawfully stopped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>the vehicle for investigatory purposes after observing Horne drive the car in excess of the speed limit and make improper lane changes. After appellant exited the car and failed to comply with Trooper Jones\u2019 order to show his hands, Trooper Jones drew his gun upon appellant. This show of authority effectively prevented appellant from leaving the scene of the traffic stop. Troopers Luddy and Watts arrived within minutes and detained appellant at the front of the car while Trooper Jones investigated Horne. Although appellant was initially detained beside the car through the display of a drawn weapon rather than, as in <em>Hatcher, </em>by a verbal show of authority, appellant\u2019s detention by this means was reasonable under the circumstances and lawful under the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Hatcher, </em>14 Va.App. at 489, 491-92, 419 S.E.2d at 257, 259. During <em>Terry </em>stops, the police are permitted to use methods of restraint that are reasonable under the circumstances. <em>See Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 851, 857, 434 S.E.2d 319, 323 (1993), <em>aff'd en banc, </em>18 Va.App. 454, 444 S.E.2d 275 (1994). Trooper Jones\u2019 display of his firearm for less than a minute prior to the arrival of the other troopers was a reasonable response to appellant\u2019s failure to show his hands while moving in the trooper\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">We also hold that Trooper Watts did not unlawfully interrogate appellant because appellant was not \u201cin custody\u201d prior to his formal arrest, which occurred <em>after </em>the crack cocaine was discovered in the tobacco pouch.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">In order to protect the privilege against compelled self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment against the \u201cinherently compelling pressures\u201d of custodial interrogation, \u201cwhich work to undermine the individual\u2019s will to resist and ... compel him to speak where he would otherwise not do so freely,\u201d the United States Supreme Court established the procedural safeguards enumerated in <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>384 U.S. 436, 467, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1624, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). \u201c[I]f the police take a suspect into custody and then ask him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>questions without informing him of the rights enumerated [in <em>Miranda </em>], his responses cannot be introduced into evidence to establish his guilt.\u201d <em>Berkemer v. McCarty, </em>468 U.S. 420, 429, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 3144, 82 L.Ed.2d 317 (1984). However, \u201cpolice officers are not required to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings to everyone whom they question,\u201d and <em>Miranda </em>warnings are not required when the interviewee\u2019s freedom has not been so restricted as to render him or her \u201cin custody.\u201d <em>Oregon v. Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 495, 97 S.Ct. 711, 714, 50 L.Ed.2d 714 (1977).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">Fidelity to the doctrine announced in <em>Miranda </em>requires that it be enforced strictly, but only in those types of situations in which the concerns that powered the decision are implicated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-8\"><em>Berkemer, </em>468 U.S. at 437, 104 S.Ct. at 3148-49. Although a person temporarily detained pursuant to an \u201cordinary traffic stop[ ]\u201d is not \u201cin custody\u201d for the purposes of <em>Miranda, </em>a detained motorist will be entitled to the protections set forth in <em>Miranda </em>if he or she \u201cthereafter is subjected to treatment that renders him \u2018in custody\u2019 for practical purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 440, 86 S.Ct. at 1610.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">Whether a suspect is \u201cin custody\u201d under <em>Miranda </em>is determined by the circumstances of each case, and \u201cthe ultimate inquiry is simply whether there is a \u2018formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement\u2019 of the degree associated with formal arrest.\u201d <em>California v. Beheler, </em>463 U.S. 1121, 1125, 103 S.Ct. 3517, 3520, 77 L.Ed.2d 1275 (1983) (citation omitted). The determination \u201cdepends on the objective circumstances of the interrogation, not on the subjective views harbored by either the interrogating officers or the person being questioned.\u201d <em>Stansbury v. California, </em>511 U.S. 318, 323, 114 S.Ct. 1526, 1529, 128 L.Ed.2d 293 (1994). If a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s position would have understood that he or she was under arrest, then the police are required to provide <em>Miranda </em>warnings before questioning. <em>See Cherry v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 135, 140, 415 S.E.2d 242, 244-45 (1992); <em>see also Stansbury, </em>511 U.S. at 325, 114 S.Ct. at 1530 (indicating that the objective circumstances \u201care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>relevant to the extent they would affect how a reasonable person in the position of the individual being questioned\u201d would perceive his or her freedom to leave). Among the circumstances to be considered when making the determination of whether a suspect was \u201cin custody\u201d are (1) the manner in which the individual is summoned by the police, (2) the familiarity or neutrality of the surroundings, (3) the number of officers present, (4) the degree of physical restraint, (5) the duration and character of the interrogation, and (6) the extent to which the officers\u2019 beliefs concerning the potential culpability of the individual being questioned were manifested to the individual.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Bosworth v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 567, 572, 375 S.E.2d 756, 759 (1989); <em>Lanier v.

No single factor is dispositive of the issue. <em>See </em>Wass <em>v. Commonwealth, 5 </em>Va.App. 27, 33, 359 S.E.2d 836, 839 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Regarding the degree of physical restraint, \u201c[t]here is no \u2018litmus-paper test for distinguishing ... when a seizure exceeds the bounds of an investigative stop.\u2019 \u201d <em>DePriest v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 577, 586, 359 S.E.2d 540, 544 (1987) (quoting <em>Florida v. Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 506, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 1329, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983)). <em>Terry </em>stops are not distinguished from custodial interrogation by the absence of any restriction upon the suspect\u2019s liberty. <em>See United States v. Leshuk, </em>65 F.3d 1105, 1109 (4th Cir.1995). Indeed, a brief but complete restriction of a suspect\u2019s liberty is valid under <em>Terry, </em>and the police are permitted to use methods of restraint that are reasonable under the circumstances. <em>See Thomas, </em>16 Va.App. at 857, 434 S.E.2d at 323.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">[D]rawing weapons, handcuffing a suspect, placing a suspect in a patrol car for questioning, or using or threatening to use force does not necessarily elevate a lawful stop into a custodial arrest for <em>Miranda </em>purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-7\"><em>Leshuk, </em>65 F.3d at 1109-10. Rather, <em>\u201cTerry </em>stops differ from custodial interrogation in that they must last no longer than necessary to verify or dispel the officer\u2019s suspicion.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1109.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">The record indicates that appellant\u2019s encounter with the troopers occurred on the side of a busy interstate highway in broad daylight and lasted about twenty minutes. Trooper Jones had his weapon drawn upon appellant for \u201cless than a minute\u201d before Trooper Luddy arrived and escorted appellant to the side of the car. Appellant waited with Trooper Luddy for the next several minutes while Trooper Jones investigated Horne. Appellant was not handcuffed, although he was ordered to place his hands on the hood of the car, and was not free to leave. Trooper Luddy did not ask appellant any questions. After Trooper Watts arrived, appellant consented to a pat-down search of his clothing, voluntarily removed the pipe from his pocket, and gave it to the troopers. At this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>point, a reasonable person in appellant\u2019s position would have believed he or she was the focus of Trooper Watts\u2019 investigation to confirm or dispel his suspicions that the person so-detained was engaged in criminal activity involving illegal drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The record indicates that Trooper Watts\u2019 questioning lasted no longer than a few minutes. Until Trooper Watts retrieved the vial of crack cocaine from the tobacco pouch at the <em>conclusion </em>of the questioning, appellant was not confronted with any evidence, with the possible exception of the corn cob pipe he voluntarily displayed, indicating that he was guilty of possessing crack cocaine. Moreover, it was apparent that probable cause did not exist to arrest appellant until after Trooper Watts retrieved the vial. Significantly, appellant was formally arrested and informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights within minutes after Trooper Watts\u2019 discovery of the crack cocaine. With the exception of Trooper Jones\u2019 service revolver, no other weapons were drawn prior to the time appellant received his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and appellant was not told he was under arrest prior to Trooper Watts\u2019 questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">We conclude that appellant was not entitled to <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to the questioning by Trooper Watts that led to the discovery of the cocaine. At the time of Trooper Watts\u2019 questioning, appellant\u2019s detention had been transformed from one whose purpose was to protect officer safety and maintain the status quo during a traffic stop to a <em>Terry </em>stop whose purpose was to investigate appellant for suspected drug-related criminal activity. However, the means employed by the troopers to detain appellant were reasonable under the circumstances, and the entirety of the brief exchange between appellant and Trooper Watts occurred within the time \u201cnecessary to verify or dispel the officer\u2019s suspicion.\u201d <em>Leshuk, </em>65 F.3d at 1109. The nature of appellant\u2019s public encounter with the troopers in broad daylight was not so \u201cpolice-dominated\u201d that a reasonable person would have felt \u201ccompletely at the mercy of the police.\u201d <em>Berkemer, </em>468 U.S. at 438, 104 S.Ct. at 3149. Moreover, the existence of minimal inculpatory evidence to confirm Trooper Watts\u2019 suspicions during the entire<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>ty of the questioning fostered a reasonable expectation that the detention would be temporary and brief. Under these circumstances, we cannot say a reasonable person in appellant\u2019s position would have believed that his encounter with the troopers had escalated from an investigative detention to an arrest during the time Trooper Watts questioned appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">ADMISSION OF HORNE\u2019S OUT-OF-COURT STATEMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Appellant next contends the trial court erred when it admitted the out-of-court statements of Horne. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Assuming the trial court erred when it admitted Horne\u2019s statements, we hold that this error was harmless. A non-constitutional error, such as the erroneous admission of evidence, is harmless \u201cwhen it plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at the trial that the parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached.\u201d <em>Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991) (quoting Code \u00a7 8.01-678).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-9\">[A] criminal conviction must be reversed unless \u201cit plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at the trial that\u201d the error did not affect the verdict. An error does not affect a verdict if a reviewing court can conclude, -without usurping the [trial court\u2019s] fact finding function, that, had the error not occurred, the verdict would have been the same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">In this case, it plainly appears from the record that the admission of Horne\u2019s out-of-court statements did not affect the trial court\u2019s determination of appellant\u2019s guilt or his sentence. During its ruling from the bench regarding appellant\u2019s guilt, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-12\">I let that [Horne\u2019s statements] in.... But I\u2019m going to ignore that, I\u2019m going to set that aside and not take that into consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>It then concluded that appellant\u2019s knowledge of the cocaine in the tobacco bag could be inferred from evidence independent of Horne\u2019s statements, and this finding is supported by the record.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">A judge, unlike a juror, is uniquely suited by training, experience and judicial discipline to disregard potentially prejudicial comments and to separate, during the mental process of adjudication, the admissible from the inadmissible, even though he has heard both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-6\"><em>Eckhart v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 213, 216, 279 S.E.2d 155, 157 (1981). Although we will not assume a judge has disregarded inadmissible evidence when the judge\u2019s rulings indicate otherwise, <em>see Wilson v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 213, 223, 429 S.E.2d 229, 235-36, <em>aff'd en banc, </em>17 Va.App. 248, 436 S.E.2d 193 (1993), the trial court\u2019s comments indicate that, despite its initial ruling to admit Horne\u2019s hearsay statements, it disregarded this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the conviction of possession of cocaine in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-14\">. At such traffic stops, the police may also order the driver to exit the car. <em>See Pennsylvania v.

This last factor encompasses the degree to which it was conveyed to the suspect that he or she was the focus of a criminal investigation and includes circumstances such as the appearance of probable cause to arrest and the extent to which the individual is confronted with evidence of guilt. In <em>Stansbury, </em>the United States Supreme Court clarified \u25a0the role that this factor plays in the overall analysis of whether a suspect was \"in custody;\u201d The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">It is well settled, then, that a police officer\u2019s subjective view that the individual under questioning is a suspect, if undisclosed, does not bear upon the question whether the individual is in custody for purposes of <em>Miranda. </em>The same principle obtains if an officer\u2019s undisclosed assessment is that the person questioned is not a suspect. In either instance, one cannot expect the person under interrogation to probe the officer\u2019s innermost thoughts. Save as they are communicated or otherwise manifested to the person being questioned, an officer\u2019s evolving but unarticulated suspicions do not affect the objective circumstances of an interrogation or interview, and thus cannot affect the <em>Miranda </em>custody inquiry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">An officer\u2019s knowledge or beliefs may bear upon the custody issue if they are conveyed, by word or deed, to the individual being questioned. Those beliefs are relevant only to the extent they would affect how a reasonable person in the position of the individual being questioned would gage the breadth of his or her \" \u2018freedom of action.\u2019 \" Even a clear statement from an officer that the person under interrogation is a prime suspect is not, in itself, dispositive of the custody issue, for some suspects are free to come and go until the police decide to make an arrest. The weight and pertinence of any communications regarding the officer\u2019s degree of suspicion will depend upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Au9\"><em>Stansbury, </em>511 U.S. at 324-25, 114 S.Ct. at 1529-30 (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b611-9\">BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AMx\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">I would hold that the scope of the detention exceeded a <em>Terry </em>stop and that the ensuing questioning constituted custodial interrogation for <em>Miranda </em>purposes. A reasonable person, who was detained in the manner James E. Harris, Jr., was detained, would have believed he or she was \u201cin custody\u201d prior to the time the officers questioned Harris about the corn cob pipe found in his pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">\u201c[S]topping an automobile and detaining its occupants constitutes a \u2018seizure\u2019 within the meaning of [the Fourth Amendment] even though the purpose of the stop is limited and the resulting detention quite brief.\u201d <em>Delaware v. Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 653, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 1396, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979). A person \u201cwho has been detained pursuant to a traffic stop [and is] thereafter ... subjected to treatment that renders him \u2018in custody' for practical purposes, [is] entitled to the full panoply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>of protections prescribed by <em>Miranda.\u201d Berkemer v. McCarty, </em>468 U.S. 420, 440, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 3150, 82 L.Ed.2d 317 (1984). The seizure becomes custodial for purposes of <em>Miranda </em>whenever the person has his or her \u201cfreedom of action ... curtailed to a \u2018degree associated with formal arrest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Furthermore, whether a person is \u201cin custody\u201d within the meaning of <em>Miranda </em>turns upon \u201chow a reasonable [person] in the suspect\u2019s position would have understood his situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 442, 104 S.Ct. at 3151. \u201cThus, a suspect is \u2018in custody\u2019 when the objective circumstances would lead a reasonable person to believe he was under arrest, thereby subjecting him or her to pressure impairing the free exercise of the privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d <em>Cherry v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 135, 140, 415 S.E.2d 242, 245 (1992). \u201c[T]he initial determination of custody depends on the objective circumstances of the interrogation, not on the subjective views harbored by either the interrogating officers or the person being questioned.\u201d <em>Stansbury v. California, </em>511 U.S. 318, 323, 114 S.Ct. 1526, 1529, 128 L.Ed.2d 293 (1994).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">Among the factors that must be considered are whether a suspect is questioned in familiar or neutral surroundings, the number of police officers present, the degree of physical restraint, and the duration and character of the interrogation. Whether or when probable cause to arrest exists and when the suspect becomes the focus of the investigation are relevant facts to consider. \u201c[T]he language used by the officer to summon the individual, the extent to which he or she is confronted with evidence of guilt, the physical surroundings of the interrogation, the duration of the detention and the degree of pressure applied to detain the individual\u201d may be significant factors as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Wass <em>v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 27, 32-33, 359 S.E.2d 836, 839 (1987) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">The traffic stop occurred at 11:00 a.m. on a heavily travelled interstate highway. When the driver stopped the automobile, Trooper Jones exited his vehicle and yelled, \u201cLet me see your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>hands.\u201d Harris opened the passenger side door, leaned down and bent forward. According to Trooper Jones, Harris appeared to be reaching under the seat, reaching outside the automobile, or reaching to drop something at the side of the automobile. Later, Trooper Jones found a paper cup of beer on the ground next to the passenger side door. Harris admitted the beer was his.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Because Trooper Jones could not see Harris\u2019 hands, Trooper Jones drew his weapon. He pointed it in Harris\u2019 direction and repeatedly yelled, \u201clet me see your hands.\u201d The evidence proved that the noise from the highway made hearing difficult. Harris then exited the automobile and took \u201cmaybe one or two steps\u201d toward Trooper Jones. Trooper Jones testified that Harris was \u201cnot [acting] in a threatening manner, by any means. He just seemed very agitated in what was happening.\u201d The driver complied with Trooper Jones\u2019 order by sticking his hands out the driver\u2019s side window.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Trooper Luddy arrived and approached the automobile. As Trooper Luddy approached, Trooper Jones holstered his weapon. Trooper Luddy testified that he placed his hand on Harris\u2019 arm or shoulder and escorted Harris to the front of the automobile. However, Trooper Jones said Trooper Luddy \u201cactually took Mr. Harris from behind and pushed him toward the [automobile].\u201d Both agreed that Harris offered no physical resistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Trooper Luddy told Harris to place his hands on the hood of the automobile. When Harris placed his hands on the hood of the automobile, Trooper Luddy \u201chad a foot probably on the inside of [Harris\u2019] foot touching his shoe and a hand, either on [Harris\u2019] shoulder or on his back.\u201d Harris repeatedly removed his hands from the hood and complained to Trooper Luddy that the hood of the automobile was \u201chot.\u201d Although the testimony established that the stop occurred on a bright sunny day in June after the automobile had been travelling on the interstate highway, Trooper Luddy ordered Harris to keep his hands on the hot hood.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Trooper Watts then arrived and approached Trooper Lnddy and Harris. When Trooper Watts arrived, Harris was leaning against the automobile with his hands on the hood. Trooper Watts testified that Trooper Luddy was repeatedly telling Harris to stand still, keep his hands on the automobile, and not to move. Trooper Watts said he told Harris the same things because Harris seemed excited and argumentative. Trooper Watts also was unresponsive to Harris\u2019 complaint that the hood of the automobile was hot. Watts did not know Trooper Jones had aimed his weapon at Harris. Trooper Watts testified that Harris was not free to turn around or to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The totality of the objective circumstances in this case would lead a reasonable person in Harris\u2019 position to believe he or she was under arrest. <em>See Cherry, </em>14 Va.App. at 139, 415 S.E.2d at 245. Harris was \u201csubjected to restraints comparable to those associated with a formal arrest.\u201d <em>Berkemer, </em>468 U.S. at 441, 104 S.Ct. at 3151. The seizure involved three police officers. The first officer drew his weapon on Harris. The second officer physically grabbed Harris, forced him to lean with his hands on the heated hood of the automobile, and restrained Harris in that position by his commands and force. The third officer also participated in this restraint, repeating the instructions that Harris was to stand still and remain facing the automobile with his hands on the hood. Moreover, the stop in this case was not of a short duration but lasted approximately twenty minutes. <em>See Berkemer, </em>468 U.S. at 441 n. 34, 104 S.Ct. at 3151 n. 34 (citing <em>Commonwealth v. Meyer, </em>488 Pa. 297, 412 A.2d 517, 518-19, 522 (1980) (driver who was detained for over one-half hour was in custody for the purposes of <em>Miranda </em>by the time the driver was questioned concerning the circumstances of an accident)). A reasonable person in Harris\u2019 position would clearly feel that he or she was unable to leave and that he or she was, in fact, \u201cin custody.\u201d This detention was the \u201cfunctional equivalent of formal arrest,\u201d <em>Berkemer, </em>468 U.S. at 442, 104 S.Ct. at 3151, and created a custodial situation requiring appropriate <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Trooper Watts testified that he asked Trooper Luddy if he had conducted a pat-down search of Harris. Trooper Luddy said that when he asked Harris if he would consent to a pat-down search of his clothing for weapons, Harris consented. Trooper Luddy testified that he felt a pipe-like device in one of Harris\u2019 front pants pockets. Trooper Watts also felt the pipe and told Harris to remove the pipe from his pocket. When Harris removed the pipe, it was \u201ca corn cob pipe.\u201d Although Trooper Luddy testified that the pipe was one that he usually associated with marijuana, he did not detect an odor of cocaine or marijuana when he smelled the pipe. Indeed, the laboratory analysis reported no cocaine in the pipe. However, Trooper Watts told Trooper Luddy the pipe was a crack pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">When Trooper Watts asked Harris if he had used the pipe to smoke crack, Harris responded that he did not use crack cocaine. Trooper Watts then asked Harris where his tobacco was located. Harris responded that the tobacco was in the automobile and asked Trooper Watts if he wanted to see the tobacco. Harris went to the passenger side of the automobile and removed a small tobacco pouch and opened it. According to Trooper Watts, a small clear vial with a green top was clearly visible on top of the tobacco. Trooper Watts testified that Harris picked up a chunk of tobacco and twisted it so that the vial fell to the bottom of the pouch. When Trooper Watts asked to see the pouch, Harris handed it to him. Trooper Watts removed the vial, saw chunks of matter that appeared to be cocaine inside the vial, and arrested Harris. Only then did the troopers inform Harris of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">A person in the custody of police \u201cmust be warned that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney.\u201d <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1612, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Statements made by an accused during custodial interrogation and without proper <em>Miranda </em>warnings are inadmissible as evidence. <em>See Dean v. Commonwealth, </em>209 Va. 666, 667-68, 166 S.E.2d 228, 230 (1969). \u201c[C]ustodial interrogation ... [is] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. at 1612 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">This is not a case where, during a routine traffic stop, \u201ca single police officer asked [the defendant] a modest number of questions,\u201d <em>Berkemer, </em>468 U.S. at 442, 104 S.Ct. at 3151, or where the defendant\u2019s \u201cfreedom of action was not restrained in any significant way.\u201d <em>Cherry, </em>14 Va.App. at 141, 415 S.E.2d at 245. This is also not a case where there was \u201cno indication that [the officer] employed any physical force or engaged in any outward displays of authority that indicated that [the officer] was detaining [the defendant].\u201d <em>United States v. Sullivan, </em>138 F.3d 126, 132 (4th Cir.1998) (no custodial interrogation where officer questioned defendant, who was seated in his own automobile throughout the dialogue, after a lawful traffic stop had ended). Harris was subject to \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d at the time the troopers questioned Harris about the pipe Harris possessed. <em>See Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 1689, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980) (holding that \u201cthe term \u2018interrogation\u2019 under <em>Miranda </em>refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police ... that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d). The circumstances clearly established that Harris reasonably did not feel free to decline the officer\u2019s questioning and request. Furthermore, the circumstances certainly proved that Harris was not free to terminate the encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Because Harris was not warned of his <em>Miranda </em>rights prior to the questioning that led to the discovery of incriminating evidence, I would hold that the statements were obtained in violation of Harris\u2019 Fifth Amendment rights and that all the evidence derived from his statements was tainted under the rule of <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 488, 83 S.Ct. 407, 417-18, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963). The statements and evidence should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>I would also hold that the trial judge\u2019s decision to admit in evidence the driver\u2019s statement was a denial of Harris\u2019 Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him. <em>See Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980). The Commonwealth called the driver as its witness at trial. The driver denied any knowledge of the cocaine and denied seeing Harris purchase or possess the cocaine. When the Commonwealth made an oral motion \u201cto strike the entirety of [the driver\u2019s] testimony,\u201d the trial judge granted the motion. After the driver left the courtroom, the Commonwealth proved through Trooper Jones a hearsay statement attributed to the driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">I believe the statement was inadmissible and that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991). For this additional reason, I would reverse the conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
