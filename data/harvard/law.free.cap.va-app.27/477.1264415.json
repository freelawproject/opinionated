Prior to sentencing, defendant learned that the Commonwealth had failed to disclose certain exculpatory evidence, and unsuccessfully moved the trial court for leave to withdraw the pleas and grant a new trial. He argues on appeal that the disputed pleas were improvidently tendered, and the court erroneously denied the requested relief. We disagree and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">A grand jury indicted defendant for the instant offenses on May 22,1995. The court ordered the Commonwealth, on June 26, 1995, to disclose, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[a]ll evidence or information in [its] possession or control ... which tends to exculpate\u201d defendant. Responding, the Commonwealth provided defendant with summarized portions of several statements given to police by witnesses which conflicted with the recollections of other, unnamed witnesses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No mention was made of a police interview with witness Letitia King conducted on September 19,1994, during which she was unable to provide details of the incident, including the identity of the perpetrator, explaining, \u201cI can\u2019t see, I need glasses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">On June 29,1995, defendant appeared before the court, pled not guilty to the indictments, and requested trial by jury. At trial on July 18, 1996,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> defendant initially pled \u201cno contest\u201d but, within minutes, changed his pleas to \u201cnot guilty\u201d on both indictments and demanded a jury trial. During the attendant colloquy with the court, defendant complained, \u201cwe\u2019re not ready,\u201d because his attorney was unprepared and his witnesses were not present. However, following further inquiry, the court ordered \u201cthat the case proceed,\u201d and defendant then requested rearraignment to permit pleas of <em>nolo contendere, </em>only to once again plead not guilty and demand a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">During the first day of trial, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence established that Vernon Lee Jones (victim) died from \u201cMultiple gunshot wounds with internal bleeding.\u201d Forensic examination of the body revealed eight \u201cseparate gunshot tracks\u201d which could be \u201cexplained by a minimum of six shots.\u201d The medical examiner described the wounds, which included two to the front, one to the side, and one to the left hand, noting that \u201cmost of the gunshots were to the back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Several witnesses to the homicide also testified for the Commonwealth. Shortly before the offenses, Sheldon Jones (Sheldon) had seen defendant in the neighborhood, heard him shout, \u201cthere go [sic] June [Vernon Jones, the victim], everybody get back in the car,\u201d and quickly leave in an automobile. According to Sheldon, the vehicle soon returned, \u201csomebody jump [sic] out [sic] the car\u201d that \u201clooked like\u201d defendant, and \u201cfive or six\u201d gunshots sounded as Sheldon fled to a nearby residence. Moments later, Sheldon saw the victim wounded and \u201claying on the ground.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Commonwealth witness Vernon Artis (Artis) observed defendant exit a vehicle and \u201cpoint [a] gun towards Kevin [Jones]\u201d and the victim, both of whom were unarmed and \u201cstanding next to\u201d a parked car. Artis quickly \u201cgot down,\u201d heard gunshots, and watched defendant flee, leaving the wounded victim. Kevin Jones corroborated Artis\u2019 testimony, adding that he was \u201c[j]ust standing there talking\u201d to the victim when defendant \u201cjumped out of the [vehicle] hatch[back] with a [sic] AK\u201d and \u201cshot [the victim] several times\u201d at a range of approximately six feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The Commonwealth concluded the opening day of trial with witness Letitia King (King). Contrary to her earlier statement to police, King testified that, while seated in a parked car, she saw defendant \u201cjump out of the back\u201d of another car, aim and repeatedly fire \u201ca very large gun\u201d directly at the unarmed victim \u201cstanding there talking\u201d to her. She noticed \u201cthe backfire from the gun\u201d and detailed the victim\u2019s movements while \u201cgetting shot\u201d by defendant, then \u201cabout fifteen feet away.\u201d Despite the manifest inconsistencies between King\u2019s pretrial statements to police and her testimony, the Commonwealth did not disclose to defendant the contents of the earlier interview, and trial recessed for the evening.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>When trial reconvened the following morning, defendant\u2019s counsel advised the court that defendant wished to \u201cwithdraw his plea [sic] of not guilty and enter a plea [sic] of no contest.\u201d Defendant was then rearraigned and pled <em>nolo contendere </em>to the indictments. Before accepting the pleas, the trial court advised defendant that a <em>nolo contendere </em>plea \u201cis the same as a guilty plea\u201d and constituted a waiver of his \u201cright to defend himself\u2019 in trial. Asked if he was \u201centering those pleas ... because [he] was guilty,\u201d defendant answered, \u201cI think it\u2019s in my best interest to do so.\u201d After further inquiry, the court accepted the pleas, found defendant guilty of the offenses, and ordered a presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">In reviewing the presentence report, defendant first learned of King\u2019s pretrial statements to police and moved the court, prior to sentencing, to allow withdrawal of the <em>nolo contendere </em>pleas and grant a new trial. In support of his motion, defendant asserted that he decided upon the pleas at the conclusion of King\u2019s testimony, arguing that the \u201coutcome would have been different\u201d had he been aware of the opportunity to impeach her. The trial court denied the motions, finding that any consequences of \u201cinformation\u201d withheld from defendant, when considered with the other evidence, was \u201charmless at most.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">During the ensuing sentencing hearing, defendant testified that he approached the victim and Kevin Jones to discuss some \u201cconflicts with Kevin,\u201d not to engage the victim. However, because the victim had repeatedly robbed him at \u201cgunpoint,\u201d \u201cabducted ..., and kidnapped\u201d him and \u201cthreatened\u201d his family, defendant was \u201cscared for [his] life when it came to\u201d the victim and armed himself. Defendant testified that he saw the victim \u201cgo for [his] gun\u201d and fired at the victim to \u201ckeep him from shooting me.\u201d Although acting in \u201cself defense,\u201d defendant explained that he \u201cpleaded no contest ... because [he] felt like [his] testimony alone wouldn\u2019t ... be strong enough for a jury after hearing all those negative false statements that the witnesses was [sic] giving.\u201d At the conclusion of the proceedings, the court sentenced defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>life imprisonment for murder and three years for the related firearm offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Shortly thereafter, defendant\u2019s appellate counsel moved the court to reconsider its rulings. Accordingly, the court \u201csuspended\u201d the sentencing order and conducted a rehearing, during which counsel proffered, without objection, that defendant \u201chas a substantial defense ... of self defense\u201d but pled <em>nolo contendere </em>after concluding that his testimony could not overcome the \u201cfalse statements\u201d of Commonwealth witnesses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant, therefore, reasoned that ignorance of King\u2019s prior inconsistent statements had resulted in uninformed and misguided pleas, to his severe prejudice. In once again denying defendant\u2019s motions, the court acknowledged that defendant may have established a \u201cplea of self defense,\u201d but, \u201cconsidering the totality\u201d of the record, King\u2019s impeachable testimony did not sufficiently influence the disputed pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The Commonwealth concedes that the inconsistency between King\u2019s earlier statements to police and later testimony was exculpatory and properly subject to the discovery order. The Commonwealth argues, however, that any error attributable to nondisclosure had no objectively reasonable effect on defendant\u2019s pleas and, therefore, was immaterial to the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-254 provides that the accused in a criminal proceeding \u201cmay plead not guilty, guilty or nolo contendere\u201d upon arraignment for the offense \u201con which he will be tried.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-254. A plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>is neither \u201ca confession of guilt\u201d nor a \u201cdeclaration of innocence equivalent to a plea of not guilty.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Jackson, </em>255 Va. 552, 555, 499 S.E.2d 276, 278 (1998) (citation omitted). It allows an accused, \u201c Thinking it best ... not to submit to trial,\u2019 \u201d but \u201c \u2018unwilling to confess the truth of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>charge, [and] ... plead guilty,\u2019 \u201d to \u201c \u2018throw[ ] himself on the mercy of the court ... without confessing or denying ... guilt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Roach v. Commonwealth, </em>157 Va. 954, 958, 162 S.E. 50, 51 (1932) (quoting <em>Honaker v. Howe, </em>60 Va. (19 Gratt.) 50, 53 (1869)). \u201cNonetheless, by entering [the] plea ..., the defendant \u2018implies a confession ... of the truth of the charge ... [and] agrees that the court may consider him guilty' for the purpose of imposing judgment and sentence.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>255 Va. at 555, 499 S.E.2d at 278 (quoting <em>Honaker, </em>60 Va. (19 Gratt.) at 52). \u201c[I]n misdemeanor and felony cases, the court [must] accept a plea of <em>nolo contendere,\u201d </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-254, once satisfied \u201cthat the plea is made voluntarily with an understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea.\u201d Rule 3A:8.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">An accused may seek to withdraw both a plea of guilty and <em>nolo contendere, </em>previously tendered and received by the court, upon motion \u201cmade only before sentence is imposed or imposition of a sentence is suspended, but to correct manifest injustice, the court within twenty-one days after entry of a final order may set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the defendant to withdraw his plea.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-296. Thus, Code \u00a7 19.2-296 treats pleas of guilty and <em>nolo contendere </em>alike in the context of a motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Generally, \u201cwhether or not an accused should be allowed to withdraw a plea of <em>[nolo contendere </em>] for the purpose of submitting one of not guilty is a matter that rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Parris v. Commonwealth, </em>189 Va. 321, 324, 52 S.E.2d 872, 873 (1949); <em>Hoverter v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 454, 463-64, 477 S.E.2d 771, 775 (1996).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">\u201cAs in other cases of discretionary power, no general rule can be laid down as to when a defendant will be permitted to withdraw his plea. The decision in each case must depend ... on the particular ... circumstances. Generally, however, it may be said that the withdrawal of a plea of <em>[nolo contendere </em>] should not be denied ... where it is in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>the <em>least </em>evident that <em>the ends of justice </em>will be subserved by permitting not guilty to be pleaded in its place.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-5\"><em>Pams, </em>189 Va. at 325, 52 S.E.2d at 874 (emphasis added) (quoting 14 Am.Jur. <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 287); <em>Manning v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 252, 254, 468 S.E.2d 705, 706 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Resolution of this issue by the trial court \u201crequires an examination of the circumstances confronting [the] accused immediately prior to and at the time he pleaded to the charge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 322, 52 S.E.2d at 872.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">\u201cThe <em>least </em>surprise or influence causing a defendant to plead <em>[nolo contendere </em>] when he has <em>any defense at all </em>should be sufficient grounds for permitting a change of plea from <em>[nolo contendere </em>] to not guilty. Leave should ordinarily be given to withdraw [the] plea ... if ... entered by mistake or under a misconception of the nature of the charge; through a misunderstanding as to its effect; through fear, fraud, or official misrepresentation; ... made involuntarily for any reason; or even where it was entered inadvisedly, if any reasonable ground is offered for going to the jury.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 325, 52 S.E.2d at 874 (quoting 14 Am.Jur. <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 287) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">It is well established that evidence which impeaches the credibility of a witness is exculpatory, <em>Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 142, 150, 341 S.E.2d 159, 164 (1986), and suppression of exculpatory evidence, material to either guilt or punishment, violates due process. <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 1196-97, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963); <em>Stover v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 789, 795, 180 S.E.2d 504, 509 (1971). \u201c[E]vidence is material, \u2018only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hughes v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 510, 525, 446 S.E.2d 451, 460-61 (1994) <em>(en </em>banc) (citations omitted). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>\u201c \u2018 \u201cA \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome [of the trial].\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Knight v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 207, 212, 443 S.E.2d 165, 168 (1994) (citations omitted). To prevail on appeal, defendant must \u201cdemonstrate that the undisclosed evidence was [both] exculpatory and material\u201d beyond mere speculation or possibility. <em>Goins v. Commonwealth, </em>251 Va. 442, 456, 470 S.E.2d 114, 124 (1996); <em>see Hooper v. Garraghty, </em>845 F.2d 471, 475 (4th Cir.1988) (accused must establish likelihood of different plea had exculpatory evidence been available).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Thus, defendant was entitled to withdraw the disputed plea if the record established <em>\u201cany </em>defense <em>at all </em>\u201d to the indictments, <em>and </em>it was reasonably probable that nondisclosure of the exculpatory impeachment evidence had the <em>\u201cleast </em>... influence\u201d on such plea. This highly remedial principle recognizes that a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>constitutes a waiver of trial, together with \u201cmany important constitutional rights,\u201d including \u201cthe privilege against self-incrimination, the right to a trial by jury, the right to confront witnesses, the right to demand that the prosecution prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and the right to object to illegally obtained evidence.\u201d <em>Dowell v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1145, 1148-49, 408 S.E.2d 263, 265 (1991), <em>aff'd en banc, </em>14 Va.App. 58, 414 S.E.2d 440 (1992). Such fundamental guarantees may be abandoned only by an accused fully advised of all relevant considerations, thereby ensuring the exercise of informed judgment to a just result.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Guided by <em>Parris, </em>we review the trial court\u2019s decision in this instance for abuse of discretion, a \u201cstrict legal term\u201d \u201csynonymous with a failure to exercise a sound, reasonable and legal discretion,\u201d a \u201cclearly erroneous conclusion and judgment \u2014 one ... clearly against logic[,] ... [and] the reasonable and probable deductions to be drawn from the facts disclosed.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>10 (6th ed.1990 (citations omitted)). \u201c \u2018[T]he discretion of the able, learned and experi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>enced trial judge ... will not be interfered with upon review of this Court, unless some injustice has been done.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bell v. Kirby, </em>226 Va. 641, 643, 311 S.E.2d 799, 800 (1984) (quoting <em>Temple v. Moses, </em>175 Va. 320, 337, 8 S.E.2d 262, 269 (1940)). Thus, we should reverse only upon \u201cclear evidence that [the decision] was not judicially sound\u201d and not simply to substitute our \u201cdiscretion for that rendered below.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Linen Serv. v. Parker, </em>21 Va.App. 8, 19, 461 S.E.2d 404, 410 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Following defendant\u2019s proffer, together with a thorough argument of his counsel, which included controlling legal principles, the court correctly considered the merits of his motions under the circumstances prevailing at the time of the disputed plea and recognized that defendant could conceivably prevail on a \u201cplea of self defense.\u201d However, when viewed with the entire record, the court was unconvinced of the reasonable probability that nondisclosure of the exculpatory evidence had the requisite \u201cleast ... influence\u201d on the result in issue, defendant\u2019s pleas of <em>nolo contendere. </em>This conclusion was not clearly erroneous, without support in the evidence, or judicially unsound, and visited no injustice on defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Through the unimpeached testimony of three eyewitnesses, excluding King, the Commonwealth established that defendant killed the unarmed victim, without provocation, willfully, deliberately and with premeditation, by repeatedly shooting him at close range. Faced with such overwhelming evidence of guilt, nothing in the record, save defendant\u2019s post-trial assertions, suggests a reasonable probability that nondisclosure of King\u2019s pretrial statements had even the \u201cleast\u201d influence on his decision to plead <em>nolo contendere. </em>Thus, the record does not demonstrate that such exculpatory evidence was material to defendant\u2019s pleas, and the trial court correctly overruled his motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Accordingly, the court did not abuse its sound discretion, and we aflirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-7\">.
