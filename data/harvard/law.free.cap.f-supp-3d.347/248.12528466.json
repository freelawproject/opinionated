App'x 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2016). Plaintiffs' Complaint centers on an insurance policy issued by Defendant Nationwide Life Insurance Company (\"Nationwide\"). They allege that Nationwide violated various laws by allowing Koresko to raid the policy. Specifically, they allege that Nationwide: (1) breached its fiduciary duties and participated in prohibited transactions in violation of Section 1132(a)(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"); (2) knowingly participated in fiduciary breaches and in prohibited transactions in violation of Section 1132(a)(3) of ERISA; (3) conducted the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity in violation of Section 1962(c) of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"); and (4) violated Section 1962(d) by conspiring to violate Section 1962(c) of RICO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending now are Nationwide's Motion to Dismiss and Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. In its Motion to Dismiss, Nationwide argues, among other things, that Plaintiffs' ERISA claims are time-barred, and that Plaintiffs do not allege sufficient facts to support their RICO claims. Plaintiffs oppose both these arguments, and further move for summary judgment on the ERISA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons that follow, Nationwide's motion shall be granted in full, and Plaintiffs' motion shall be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiffs' Interactions with the Koresko Arrangement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Between 2002 and 2013, John Koresko and others operated a multiple\n   employer welfare arrangement (the \"Arrangement\" or the \"Koresko Arrangement\") that allowed employers to purchase cash value life insurance policies and take a tax deduction for the premiums as a business expense. Koresko systematically converted and misused the assets of the participating welfare benefit plans. Because the Arrangement and Koresko's defalcations have already been comprehensively recounted in\n   <em>\n    Perez v. Koresko, supra\n   </em>\n   , only the facets of the scheme relevant to the claims raised here will be described below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Arrangement was nominally run by PennMont, a corporation whose officers were John Koresko and his brother Lawrence. PennMont played a public-facing role in recruiting participants. It explained to prospective participants that in order to take advantage of the Arrangement's purported tax benefits, an employer needed to sign an adoption agreement that established the employer's own welfare benefit plan according to terms dictated by Koresko, and the employer also needed to agree to the terms pre-defined by Koresko. Employers then paid insurance premiums into a trust, and the trustee passed those payments on to insurance companies. The trustee, importantly, was named as the owner and beneficiary of the policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff Energy Alternative Studies Inc. Health and Welfare Plan (the \"EAS Plan\") was a participating plan; Plaintiff Energy Alternative Studies was the sponsoring employer; and Plaintiff James Corman was a participant in the EAS Plan whose life was insured by a policy purchased through the trust and issued by Defendant Nationwide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs joined the Koresko Arrangement in early 2000, at which time an insurance policy was purchased from Nationwide insuring the lives of Plaintiff James Corman and his wife Mary Corman. The Complaint alleges that Nationwide allowed a Koresko-related entity to change the owner and beneficiary from the EAS Plan to the Koreskos' REAL VEBA trust.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Complaint suggests-although it does not explicitly state-that Community Trust Company (\"CTC\"), took over as the trustee at this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Over the following 12 years, the EAS Plan contributed $865,000 to CTC, which\n   used the money to pay premiums on the Policy. In 2009, Nationwide loaned a Koresko-related entity\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   $578,777.52 collateralized by the cash value that had accumulated in the policy. The loan has accrued $276,953 in interest, and has not been repaid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Three months after the loan was made, Plaintiffs requested information from Nationwide and Koresko-related entities about the status of the policy, but they never received any meaningful response. Plaintiffs only learned of the 2009 loan sometime after September 2013 when Koresko was removed from his position of fiduciary authority, and they filed this lawsuit on August 31, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Key Documents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   According to the Complaint, the relationships among these parties were governed by four documents: the Plan Documents, the insurance policy (the \"Policy\"), the Verifications, and the Custodial Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Plan Documents established the EAS Plan, and stated that insurance policies purchased under the Plan and the cash value contained in those policies \"shall be owned by the Trustee.\" The Plan Documents also granted wide-ranging authority to the trustee to control those policies:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The Trustee may purchase Policies on each Participant.... The policy shall be a contract between the Trustee and the Insurer and shall reserve to the Trustee all rights, options and Benefits provided by the Policy and permitted by the Insurer, except that the right to name and change the Beneficiary shall be exercised ... in writing pursuant to a power of attorney or other document.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Policy, although it insured the Cormans' lives, made clear that it was \"a legal contract between the Owner [the trustee of the Plan] and Nationwide,\" that \"all rights in [the] Policy belong to [the Owner],\" and that the Owner \"may assign any or all rights under [the] Policy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The last two documents that appear to play an important role are the \"Verifications\" and the \"Custodial Agreement,\" both of which were purportedly executed by CTC. The Verifications designated Jeanne Bonney, a Koresko associate, as \"Appointed Signator\" to sign Arrangement-related Documents on behalf of CTC, and further stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The trust empowers the trustee to exercise any and all rights associated with owning life insurance policies and the trustee can exercise these rights without the consent of the insured. These rights include but are not limited to: surrendering the policy, withdrawing policy values, borrowing against the policy, transferring ownership, and changing the beneficiary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Custodial Agreement designated the Koresko Law Firm as CTC's agent, and apparently also stated that the trustee had the same powers listed in the Verifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To overcome a motion to dismiss, \"a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v. Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 678,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). \"A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513990\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/996/617/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In determining whether a complaint satisfies this standard, a court must first outline the required elements, then strip away legal conclusions from the complaint, and finally decide whether the well-pled factual allegations plausibly entitle the plaintiff to relief.\n   <em>\n    Bistrian v.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs make two sets of claims: those alleging liability under ERISA, and those alleging liability under RICO. The ERISA claims will be dismissed because they are time-barred. The RICO claims will be dismissed because Plaintiffs failed to sufficiently plead that Nationwide engaged in a \"pattern of racketeering activity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A. ERISA Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff filed this lawsuit on August 31, 2017. Ordinarily, ERISA actions must \"be commenced ... after the earlier of\" either \"six years after ... the date of the last action which constituted a part of the breach or violation\" or \"three years after the earliest date on which the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the breach or violation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201113\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs allege that the only action constituting a violation-the $578,777.52 loan-occurred on approximately August 26, 2009, but they contend they developed actual knowledge of the violation no earlier than September 2013. Therefore, to have complied with the standard statute of limitations, they needed to have filed this action by approximately August 26, 2015-more than two years before they did. Thus, absent anything more, their ERISA claims are time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   However, the statute includes an exception: \"[I]n the case of fraud or concealment, such action may be commenced not later than six years after the date of discovery of such breach or violation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201113\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In their briefing Plaintiffs do not contend that they satisfy the standard requirements, but instead focus on this \"fraudulent concealment\" exception. To wit, they claim that \"PennMont and Nationwide took affirmative steps to hide their breach by refusing plaintiffs' requests for the status of the funds invested through the Policy.\" More specifically, Plaintiffs contend that they requested information from Nationwide and Koresko-related entities about the status of the policy, but they never received any meaningful response. Plaintiffs only learned of the 2009 loan sometime after September 2013 when Koresko was removed from his position of fiduciary authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Neither PennMont nor Nationwide triggered the exception here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    i. PennMont\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Fraudulent concealment \"applies the federal common law discovery rule to ERISA breach of fiduciary duty claims,\" which the Third Circuit has repeatedly explained means that the exception may be invoked only \"when a lawsuit has been delayed because\n   <em>\n    the defendant itself\n   </em>\n   has taken steps to hide its breach of fiduciary duty.\"\n   <em>\n    Kurz v.

Nationwide\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiffs' argument that Nationwide itself triggered the exception is also foreclosed by binding Third Circuit precedent.

But Plaintiffs point to no such affirmative steps, instead alleging in their Complaint only that Nationwide \"refus[ed] to provide any information.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiffs try to show affirmative steps in two ways. First, they explain that Nationwide refused to provide information when Plaintiffs asked for it. This fact does little to help Plaintiffs because, as Defendants note, the Policy \"does not include any provisions permitting ... Nationwide to share information with someone other than the policy owner,\" and although the Policy insured Plaintiff Corman, neither he nor any of his co-Plaintiffs own it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Simply complying with the requirements of the contract does not rise to the level of a \"trick or contrivance\" to hide information from Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs reference\n   <em>\n    Glaziers and Glassworkers Union Local No. 252 Annuity Fund v.

As a preliminary matter, Plaintiffs provide no citation to the Complaint to support their argument. And even upon the Court's independent review of the Complaint, discussed below, there appears to be no basis for Plaintiffs' assertions: The Complaint does not contain factual allegations that Nationwide engaged in an \"unauthorized taking.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Complaint states that CTC was \"the trustee as of April 15, 2002,\" and that the trustee was the owner of the Policy. It also states that CTC \"executed\" or \"entered\" both the Verifications and the Custodial Agreement, which designated Jeanne Bonney and the Koresko Law Firm as CTC's \"Appointed Signator\" and agent, respectively. The Verifications and the Custodial Agreement also \"certified\" that the trustee-that is, CTC-could \"exercise any and all rights associated with owning life insurance policies,\" and that those rights \"include but are not limited to: surrendering the policy, withdrawing policy values, borrowing against the policy, transferring ownership, and changing the beneficiary.\" The Complaint then asserts the legal conclusion that \"the trust documents ... did not give the trustee any such power.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Assuming that the Complaint means to allege that Nationwide improperly issued loans at the request of either Bonney or the Koresko Law Firm, the dispositive issues-on which Plaintiffs' briefing does\n   not shed any light-become (1) whether the Plan Documents grant the trustee the powers represented by CTC in the Verifications and in the Custodial Agreement (most critically, whether they grant the power to borrow against the Policy), and (2) whether CTC was within its rights to assign \"Signator\" authority to Bonney and agency power to the Koresko Law Firm. If the Plan Documents do grant those powers, and if the assignments were permissible, then Plaintiff will have alleged no basis on which Nationwide could have refused the loan request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As to the first question, the powers represented in the Verifications and Custodial Agreement, Nationwide directs the Court's attention to the Plan Documents themselves, which expressly state that any policy purchased under the Plan, along with the cash value contained in those policies, \"shall be owned by the Trustee,\" and moreover that those policies \"shall be a contract between the Trustee and the Insurer and shall reserve to the Trustee all rights, options and Benefits.\" The Policy also supports Nationwide's argument, making clear that it \"is a legal contract between the Owner (you, your) and Nationwide Life Insurance Company (we, our, us, the Company),\" and that \"[w]hile either Insured is living, all rights in your Policy belong to you.\" Most importantly, the Policy explicitly provides the owner authority to \"request a loan at any time while your Policy is in force,\" to be \"made upon the sole security of the Policy and proper assignment of your Policy to us.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Read together, the Plan Documents and the Policy demonstrate that CTC, as the Plan's trustee, owned the Policy, and at least by the terms of these documents the trustee could exercise almost unlimited control over Policy assets and could request loans collateralized by the Policy. Plaintiffs have pointed to no reason to believe that \"the trust documents ... did not give the trustee\" the powers listed in the Verifications and Custodial Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As to the second question, CTC's assignment of \"Signator\" or agency power, the Policy again proves helpful. It states that \"[w]hile either Insured is living, you may assign any or all rights under your Policy,\" subject only to the condition that the assignment \"is in a written form acceptable to us and is recorded at our Home Office.\" Moreover, the parties have not pointed to any language, either in the Plan or in the Policy that suggests designating a \"Signator\" or an agent falls outside the scope of the broad powers of the trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In sum, the Complaint, the Plan Documents, and the Policy do not provide a basis for Plaintiffs' arguments that loans \"were not made to [CTC]\" and that the \"authorization was facially bogus.\" Rather, these documents indicate that CTC had wide-ranging authority, as the owner of the Policy, to take out loans, designate agents, assign rights, and more. Plaintiffs' flat assertions to the contrary offer no reason to think otherwise. As a result, Plaintiffs have not adequately pleaded that Nationwide engaged in any \"unauthorized ... taking,\"\n   <em>\n    Mehling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9479597\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/163/502/#p508\">\n    163 F.Supp.2d at 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20664\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which in turn means that Plaintiffs have not pleaded the \"predicate acts\" required to show a \"pattern of racketeering activity\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) and (d).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Counts III and IV will therefore be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.

Two of those documents are attached to Nationwide's Motion to Dismiss, which are the \"Plan Documents\" that established EAS's Health Welfare Benefit Plan and the insurance policy (the \"Policy\") that insured Plaintiff James Corman and his wife Mary Corman's lives. Although on a motion to dismiss it is generally improper to consider extraneous documents, the Court may nevertheless consider \"undisputedly authentic document[s] that a defendant attaches as an exhibit to a motion to dismiss if the plaintiff's claims are based on the document[s].\"\n    <em>\n     Pension Ben.

Plaintiffs do not dispute the authenticity of the attached documents, and each document is integral to Plaintiffs' claims. Therefore, the Policy and the Plan Documents will be considered.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The other two documents, referred to as the Verifications and Custodial Agreement, purported to delegate certain authority from a trustee to agents. Unlike the Plan Documents and the Policy, these documents are neither attached to the Complaint nor to the Motion to Dismiss. As a result, the Court can only assess the pieces of these documents quoted by Plaintiffs in the Complaint. However, reliance on these quoted portions does not convert a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Alban v. BMW of N.

At most, this footnote left the door open to the possibility that \"some special connection\" could allow a third party's fraudulent concealment to be attributed to a defendant.

They assert that (1) \"Nationwide knows it did not pay out the loan funds to [CTC]\" because \"[CTC] did not exist\" at the time the loan was made; (2) Nationwide actually \"paid the loan proceeds to the 'Single Employer Welfare Plan C O Pennmont Benefit SRVC,\"; and (3) \"Nationwide did not even inform [CTC] or its successor, F &amp; M, that the loan was requested or made.\" That is to say, Plaintiffs are arguing that Nationwide exercised discretionary control by issuing a loan to a stranger to the plan.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Even if these facts were true, and even if they would show fiduciary control, Plaintiffs face a threshold problem: They have not pleaded these facts in their Complaint. In their briefing, they do not direct the Court to any specific paragraph in the Complaint in support of these facts, and even on the Court's independent review, there do not appear to be facts pleaded that support these claims. In fact, the Complaint in some instances seems to contradict the argument in the briefing. The Complaint states that \"[f]rom April 15, 2002 until January 2010, CTC served as the trustee,\" which encompasses the time-approximately August 26, 2009-when the improper loan was purportedly made; this suggests that CTC did indeed exist at the time of the loan. In short, Plaintiffs have not pointed to facts pleaded in the Complaint that support the legal conclusion that Nationwide exercised discretionary control over the relevant aspects of the Plan.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    It is also conceivable that Plaintiffs mean to suggest that CTC was not the true owner of the Policy because Nationwide wrongfully allowed Koresko to change the owner and beneficiary of the Policy.
