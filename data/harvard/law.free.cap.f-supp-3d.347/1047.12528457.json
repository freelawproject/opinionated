Hence, CVDJBA argues that SJVC's claims against it are misplaced because CVDJBA has had no contact with the state of Florida warranting its jurisdictional power over CVDJBA. CVDJBA Motion at 8, 10-28. Additionally, CVDJBA raises substantive challenges to the sufficiency of SJVC's trade secrets claim. First, CVDJBA asserts that SJVC's claim for damages or attorney's fees is misplaced.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n    at 28-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

SJVC also argues that in its SA Complaint it has sufficiently alleged that CVDJBA, through the actions of Heinz in conjunction with the StreamlineMD Defendants, stole its trade secrets.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n    at 14-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

With this statutory construction in place, the Court turns to SJVC's loss allegations in its SA Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   SJVC's SA Complaint is by no means a model of clarity, and contains many allegations that do not fall within the scope of the CFAA. Throughout the facts section of SJVC's SA Complaint, SJVC details its initial business relationship with StreamlineMD, and the terms of the Service Agreement between the two. SA Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 14-17. In the facts section of the SA Complaint, SJVC also details interactions between SJVC and the Defendants in the course of the parties' attempt to enter into a new business venture, along with multiple actions SJVC took to facilitate its integration into the new company, many at the behest of the Defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 19-21, 26, 29, 32, 36, 39, 41. However, the only statement within the facts section that references any direct action SJVC took upon discerning that the Defendants had allegedly accessed SJVC's information in an unauthorized manner is that SJVC \"complained and asked [Mullen and Curley] not to use its Protected Information to compete.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38. Otherwise, the facts section of the SA Complaint does not contain any specific allegations regarding the losses SJVC suffered as a result of the StreamlineMD Defendants' alleged unauthorized access of its information, or the actions SJVC took in response to that alleged unauthorized access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   However, within its specific allegations for Counts I and II, SJVC provides additional allegations. In relation to Count I, SJVC asserts that it has suffered damages and losses\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   in excess of $5,000 over a one-year period, among other reasons, because, the integrity of Plaintiff's computer system, its license to use StreamlineMD's software, and its property interest in its Protected Information therein were impaired by StreamlineMD, Curley and Mullen's unauthorized access to the Protected Information and use of it for their own personal gain.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47. SJVC further asserts its\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   damages include money Plaintiff paid at the direction of [Mullen and Curley], lost time and effort and distraction from Plaintiff's practice, lost time and effort needed to take subsequent remedial measures to prevent a breach of access from occurring again, lost Protected Information, damages to Plaintiff's reputation, and the loss of future income to Plaintiff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48. Likewise, in relation to Count II, SJVC describes that its losses exceeded $5000 over a one year period because\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff's work through its primary doctor, Dr. St. George, was interrupted for weeks in trying to understand and work with [Mullen and Curley]; [Mullen and Curley] requested changes to Plaintiff's billing practices asking Plaintiff to move all of Plaintiff's billing to StreamlineMD, which Plaintiff did; and where, because of the complexity of the licensed software StreamlineMD provided, and the disruption to Plaintiff from the intended participation in [the new business venture], Plaintiff's revenues diminished; Plaintiff needed to obtain new experts and software licenses; and the day-to-day of Plaintiff's practice was and is disrupted and interfered with due to [Mullen and Curley's] unauthorized access to the Protected Information and use of it for their own personal gain.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiff had to devote substantial resources to managing its financial data, including appointment scheduling, paying accountants, service identification, HIPPA protected records, and billing, and suffered impairment to its reputation and goodwill, lost revenues, and lost or delayed critical data as a result of StreamlineMD and [Mullen and Curley's] unauthorized access to Plaintiff's Protected Information. [Mullen and Curley] and CVDJBA insisted that Plaintiff transfer its billing practices to StreamlineMD, and thereafter, clearly having reviewed those client files in some form, proposed changes and clarifications. In doing so, Heinz of CVDJBA worked with StreamlineMD to obtain and manipulate the data from Plaintiff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiff incurred substantial expenses both in its internal changes made because of these incursions and unauthorized access, and in other expenses in responding to the Defendants' unauthorized access and use and assessing the scope of intrusion and extent of damages to its computer systems (and Plaintiff's management practices contained therein) caused by the Defendants' actions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 53-55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   First, it is important to note that nowhere within SJVC's allegations does it assert that it suffered an interruption of service as a result of the StreamlineMD Defendants' alleged intentional and unlawful access of SJVC's Protected Information on its computers. Therefore, SJVC's claimed losses must fall within the first category of losses described in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(11) : \"any reasonable cost to any victim, including the cost of responding to an offense, conducting a damage assessment, and restoring the data, program, system, or information to its condition prior to the offense ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(11) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown Jordan Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12140250\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/1167/\">\n    846 F.3d at 1174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Upon review of SJVC's SA Complaint, the Court observes that many of SJVC's claimed losses have nothing to do with the costs it may have incurred in responding to the StreamlineMD Defendants' alleged offenses under the CFAA, or in conducting a damage assessment, or in restoring its data, programs, systems, and information to their condition prior to the offense.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(11). Indeed, most of SJVC's claimed losses address the actions it took in its attempt to enter into the new business venture with the Defendants, which for whatever reason, ultimately were in vain. These include the \"money Plaintiff paid at the direction of [Mullen and Curley]\" pursuant to the MOU, \"lost time and effort and distraction from Plaintiff's practice,\" \"damages to Plaintiff's reputation, and the loss of future income to Plaintiff.\" SA Complaint at \u00b6 48. Also included within this category of losses are SJVC's allegations regarding work interruptions for St. George, who spent\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   weeks in trying to understand and work with [Mullen and Curley]; [Mullen and Curley] requested changes to Plaintiff's billing practices asking Plaintiff to move all of Plaintiff's billing to StreamlineMD, which Plaintiff did; and where, because of the complexity of the licensed software StreamlineMD provided, and the disruption to Plaintiff from the intended participation in [the new business venture] Plaintiff's revenues diminished.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    at \u00b6 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nothing in the allegations of SJVC's SA Complaint suggests that the StreamlineMD information management system falls within the definition of an electronic communication system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   As noted earlier, in its SA Complaint, SJVC describes the StreamlineMD information management system as a \"cloud-based integrated software platform [to which a physician can] ... upload a physician's financial and performance data, which the physician can then use to generate reports and other documents on practice management, revenue cycle management, and billing in order to enhance his or her practice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.

Additionally, SJVC alleges that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   StreamlineMD's clinical electronic medical record software and services, along with related practice management software, helped and managed all aspects of\n   Plaintiff's practice, except patient billing. With the license afforded by the Service Agreement, Plaintiff used the software and services to generate reports containing significant confidential data and trade secret information belonging to Plaintiff, including, without limitation, the following: confidential patient information, procedures per month, finances (including reimbursement), insurance payment schedules, and patient demographics (collectively, the \"Protected Information\"). All aspects of Plaintiff's financial, patient/patient scheduling, medical record and referring physician data were contained within the software and system licensed to Plaintiff by StreamlineMD.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   SJVC's allegations regarding the StreamlineMD information management system describe a service through which SJVC was able to gain access to its information which was stored in electronic databases managed and maintained by StreamlineMD. However, nothing within these allegations suggests a system through which SJVC transmitted or received electronic communications. Rather, all the allegations discuss SJVC's electronic access and use of information, rather than the transmission or receipt of information. Further, while SJVC suggests that aspects of the StreamlineMD information management system included \"electronically billing patients, scheduling patient appointments, and patient online bill pay,\" SJVC Response to StreamlineMD at 6, SJVC does not allege how this aspect of the StreamlineMD information management system resulted in electronic communications. In sum, SJVC does not allege any facts suggesting that the StreamlineMD information management system is the equivalent or similar to \"traditional electronic communication services.\" Nor has it identified any legal authority suggesting that an information management system like that of StreamlineMD constitutes an electronic communication service. Moreover, the authority cited by the Court above directs a contrary conclusion. As such, the Court is not persuaded that SJVC has sufficiently alleged the existence of an electronic communications service that could have been accessed by the named Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Finally, to the extent that SJVC alleges that Mullen and Curley \"obtain[ed] access to electronic communications information while such communications were in electronic storage in that database,\" SA Complaint at \u00b6 57, this allegation is purely conclusory and merely paraphrases the statutory language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (\"[w]however intentionally accesses without authorization a facility through which an electronic communication service is provided ... and thereby obtains ...\n   <em>\n    access to ... electronic communication while it is in electronic storage\n   </em>\n   in such system shall be punished ...\") (emphasis added). SJVC alleges no facts indicating that Mullen or Curley, through the StreamlineMD information management system, gained access to electronic communications that were stored within that system. Thus, it fails to provide a basis for a plausible claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   With regard to Count III of the SA Complaint, the Court determines that SJVC has failed to allege the requisite elements of a claim under the ECPA. Therefore the StreamlineMD Motion is due to be granted to the extent that Count III of the SA Complaint will be dismissed for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Counts IV and V: Theft and Misappropriation of Trade Secrets claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In Counts IV and V, SJVC alleges theft and misappropriation of trade secrets\n   claims. Specifically, in Count IV, SJVC asserts that all of the Defendants (the StreamlineMD Defendants and CVDJBA) stole its trade secrets in violation of Florida Statutes section 812.081.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, in Count V, SJVC asserts that StreamlineMD misappropriated SJVC's trade secrets in violation of the Florida Uniform Trade Secrets Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FLA.

Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE, Civil 2d \u00a7 1351, at 243-44 (1990) ). Here, however, the very nature of CVDJBA's personal jurisdiction challenge nevertheless requires the Court to evaluate the question of whether SJVC has pled sufficient facts to plausibly support its theft or misappropriation of trade secrets claims, which ultimately will be dispositive of both Counts IV and V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In seeking to dismiss Count IV, CVDJBA asserts, in part, that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over it. Generally, CVDJBA argues that SJVC mistook any communications and meetings it had with Heinz regarding the new business\n   venture as exercised on behalf of CVDJBA, a company for which Heinz serves as President and CEO, rather than on behalf of two other business entities for which Heinz was in fact acting. CVDJBA Motion at 8-9. Otherwise, CVDJBA asserts that it has no connections whatsoever with the state of Florida, has no business activities in the state, has not committed any tortious act in Florida, and thus cannot be haled into courts in Florida. CVDJBA Motion at 10-28. In response, SJVC counters that Heinz's presence and contacts with the state of Florida were on behalf of CVDJBA and were sufficient to warrant the Court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over the company. SJVC Response to CVDJBA at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As referenced earlier in the Order, in ruling on a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, a district court has discretion to conduct an evidentiary hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Delong Equip.

Here, upon consideration of CVDJBA's Motion, SJVC's Response to CVDJBA, and CVDJBA's Reply, the Court determines that an evidentiary hearing is not warranted. Thus, the Court turns to the question of whether SJVC has made a\n   <em>\n    prima\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    facie\n   </em>\n   showing of facts sufficient to warrant the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the CVDJBA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In order to determine whether personal jurisdiction exists over CVDJBA, the Court must engage in a two-part inquiry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mut.

Fla. 1992). As such, SJVC's allegations take a first step in asserting the existence of a trade secret. However, SJVC's allegations do not go far enough and are missing other critical facts necessary to support a claim that the Protected Information at issue in this controversy falls within the ambit of a trade secret.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Significantly, SJVC's SA Complaint is devoid of any allegations that SJVC took \"measures to prevent [its Protected Information] from becoming available to persons other than those selected by the owner to have access thereto for limited purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FLA. STAT. ANN . \u00a7 812.081(1)(c). At most, SJVC alleges that neither the limited license it gave StreamlineMD for use of certain data \"nor any other provision in the Service Agreement or the Business Associate Agreement afforded StreamlineMD, Mullen, Curley, or any other StreamlineMD employee authorization to access Plaintiff's Protected Information.\" SA Complaint at \u00b6 17. Likewise, it asserts that \"[n]othing in the MOU granted the Defendants access to any of the Protected Information or allowed the Defendants to use the Protected Information.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28. The Court is not convinced that the language in the Service Agreement or the MOU supports an inference that SJVC took \"measures to prevent [its Protected Information] from becoming available ....\" FLA. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 812.081(1)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   While SJVC suggests that it did not authorize the StreamlineMD Defendants to access its Protected Information, SJVC fails to allege what steps it took to prohibit access or to protect against inadvertent disclosure of its Protected Information stored on StreamlineMD's software. Moreover, in focusing solely on whether the language of the Service Agreement or the MOU allowed the StreamlineMD Defendants to access SJVC's Protected Information, SJVC fails to address the critical question of what efforts it undertook to maintain the secrecy of its Protected Information. In this context, the Court further notes that SJVC willingly shared much of the data it designated as \"Protected Information\" in an effort to further the new consolidated medical practice, as well as in accordance with the MOU. Nowhere does SJVC allege that in the course of sharing this information with the Defendants, it placed additional restrictions or limits on how the Defendants could use or access that information. Nor does SJVC indicate any restrictions it may have placed on the Defendants' access to that information, should the business venture between the parties fail to be actualized, as was in fact the case here. Additionally, SJVC sets forth no facts regarding how it sought to protect its information in terms of its own employee's access to the same, or in regard to other organizations with which SJVC might have business interactions. Without such allegations, a claim asserting the existence of a trade secret cannot succeed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Advice Interactive Group, LLC v.

STAT. ANN . \u00a7 812.081(1)(c). Therefore, having carefully reviewed the allegations of the SA Complaint, the Court concludes that SJVC has failed to sufficiently allege the existence of a trade secret entitled to protect under Florida law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In light of this conclusion, SJVC's assertion of specific personal jurisdiction over CVDJBA quickly dissembles. This is so because without plausibly alleging the existence of a trade secret, SJVC cannot allege that CVDJBA committed a theft of a trade secret.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FLA. STAT.

(emphasis added). SJVC's inability to assert a claim of theft of trade secrets forecloses its argument that CVDJBA has committed a tortious act within this state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2048.193\">\n    Fla.
