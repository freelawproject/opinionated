BROWNING, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court on: (i) the Plaintiff's Motion for Default Judgment Against Defendant Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, filed February 21, 2018 (Doc. 15)(\"Judgment Motion\"); and (ii) Defendant New Penn Financial, LLC DBA Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing's Motion to Quash Service of Summons on Complaint, filed August 20, 2018 (Doc. 52)(\"Motion to Quash\"). The Court held a hearing on August 22, 2018. The primary issues are: (i) whether Plaintiff Leonard Martinez properly served Defendant Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing with the Summons on Complaint for Violation of the Unfair Practices Act, Violation of the Real Estate Settlement Procedure Act (\"RESPA\"), Breach of Contract, Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, filed January 25, 2018 (Doc. 8)(\"Summons\"), and Complaint for Violation of the Unfair Practices Act, Violation of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (\"RESPA\"), Breach of Contract, and Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, D-202-CV-2017-07661 (Second Judicial District Court, County of Bernalillo, State of New Mexico, filed October 25, 2017), filed in federal court December 5, 2017 (Doc. 1-1)(\"Complaint\"), when he sent those documents via certified mail to the general payment address that was listed on the monthly mortgage statements that Shellpoint Mortgage gave Martinez; and (ii) if there was proper service, whether the Court should enter default judgment against Shellpoint Mortgage. The Court concludes that Martinez did not properly serve the Summons and the Complaint, because sending the Summons and Complaint to a general payment address does not satisfy rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or rule 4 of the New Mexico Rules of Civil Procedure. Accordingly, the Court will not enter default judgment against Shellpoint Mortgage, it will deny the Judgment Motion, and it will grant the Motion to Quash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court takes its facts from the Complaint. The Court provides these facts for background. It does not adopt them as the truth, and it recognizes that these facts are largely Martinez' version of events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Martinez is a homeowner in Bernalillo County, New Mexico.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 5,\n   7, at 2. A mortgage mote secures the property Martinez owns at 34 Vallecitos, Tijeras New Mexico 87059.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 9, at 2.

In April, 2016, however, Martinez received a letter from CitiMortgage, Inc. stating that the \"Repayment/Forbearance plan on your account has been removed.\" Complaint \u00b6 19, at 3. CitiMortgage, Inc. subsequently transferred Martinez' loan to Ditech Financial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 20-23, at 3. Although Martinez made several mortgage payments to Ditech Financial, Ditech Financial informed Martinez that he was not eligible for a loan modification and initiated foreclosure proceedings on Martinez' home.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 25, at 3. Despite those proceedings, Ditech Financial transferred the loan to Shellpoint Mortgage, which began servicing the loan on June 16, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 26, at 4.

He argues, under similar theories, that CitiMortgage, Inc., Ditech Financial, and Shellpoint Mortgage breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and that CitiMortgage, Inc. violated the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202601\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 17 (\"RESPA\") and the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2057-12-1\">\n    N.M.

CitiMortgage, Inc. removed the case to federal court, asserting that the Court had jurisdiction, because the Complaint presents a federal question. Notice of Removal \u00b6 2, at 1, filed December 5, 2017 (Doc. 1)(\"Notice of Removal\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     The Judgment Motion\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On February 21, 2018, Martinez filed the Judgment Motion, arguing that the Court should enter a default judgment against Shellpoint Mortgage, because he served Shellpoint Mortgage via certified mail on November 7, 2017, and Shellpoint Mortgage did not timely respond to that service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Judgment Motion \u00b6\u00b6 2-4, at 1-2. According to Martinez, \" '[w]hen a party ... has failed to plead or otherwise defend, and that failure is shown by affidavit or otherwise, the clerk\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   enter the party's default.' \" Judgment Motion \u00b6 5, at 2 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(a) (emphasis in Judgment Motion) ). Martinez concludes, thus, that, because Shellpoint Mortgage has not defended and because Martinez presents an affidavit attesting that Shellpoint Mortgage has not defended, the Court should enter default judgment against Shellpoint Mortgage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Judgment Motion \u00b6 6, at 2.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Ortiz Aff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Motion to Quash\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Shellpoint Mortgage moves to quash service of the Summons and Complaint, arguing that the address Martinez used for service is used \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     solely\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to collect mortgage payments in its regular course of business as a mortgage servicer.\" Motion to Quash at 2 (emphasis original). According to Shellpoint Mortgage, Martinez' use of that mailing address does not satisfy the federal or state servicing rules, because Martinez did not deliver the Summons and Complaint on an officer, manager, general agent, or any other agent authorized to accept service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Quash at 5-6 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)(1), (h)(1) ; N.M. Rules Ann. 1-004(G)(1)(a)-(G)(3) ). Shellpoint\n   Mortgage adds that it was not aware of this action until August 14, 2018, when Ditech Financial contacted Shellpoint Mortgage about it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Quash at 6. It concludes that, because service was improper and because it did not have actual notice of the lawsuit until six days before it filed the Motion to Quash, the Court should quash service, and deny the requests in the Judgment Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Quash at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Motion to Quash Response\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Martinez responded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Quash Response. He contends that his service on Shellpoint Mortgage is proper, because he served it in a \"manner reasonably calculated ... to apprise the defendant of the existence and pendency of the action.\" Motion to Quash Response at 1 (citing N.M. Rules Ann. 1-004(E)(1) ). He argues that he is authorized to complete service \"by mail\" as long as: (i) the \"envelope is addressed to the named defendant\"; and (ii) \"the defendant signs a receipt for the envelope containing the summons and complaint.\" Motion to Quash Response at 1-2 (citing N.M. Rules Ann. 1-004(E)(3), (G)(3) ). He contends that he satisfies both of those requirements, because he mailed an envelope with the Summons and Complaint to the named Defendant -- Shellpoint Mortgage -- and because someone from Shellpoint \"signed for it.\" Motion to Quash Response at 2. Martinez also asserts that Shellpoint Mortgage regularly receives mail at the address to which he sent it, so according to Martinez, he served Shellpoint Mortgage in a manner reasonably calculated to alert it to the lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Quash Response at 2. He argues that, contrary to Shellpoint Mortgage's representations, he did not need to mail the Summons and Complaint to a registered agent, because service by mail suffices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Quash at 3. He concludes by asking the Court to deny the requests in the Motion to Quash and to grant the Judgment Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Quash at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     The Hearing\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court held a hearing on August 22, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Clerk's Minutes at 1, filed August 21, 2018 (Doc. 54). The Court noted that default is a two-step process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Transcript of Hearing at 4:11-12, taken August 22, 2018 (Court)(\"Tr.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   It asked whether it should deny the Judgment Motion, because the Clerk of the Court had not filed a Certificate of Default.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 4:6-21. Martinez stated that he understood the Clerk of the Court had filed a certificate of default.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 4:23-25 (Gonzales.) The Court noted that it did not have a Certificate of Default from the Clerk of the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 5:20-23 (Court).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Civil Docket for Case #: 1:17-cv-01195-JBLF\n   </em>\n   , CMECF, https://ecf.nmd.circ10.dcn/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?902308060071476-L_1_0-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Martinez contended that New Mexico requires that service occur \"in a manner reasonably calculated under all circumstances to apprise a defendant of the existence and pendency of the action and to afford a reasonable opportunity to appear and defend.\" Tr. at 7:20-26 (Gonzales)(citing N.M. Rules Ann. 1-004(E)(1) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under Martinez' interpretation, rules 1-004(E)(3)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   and 1-004(G(3) authorize service by certified mail when the defendant signs a receipt for the delivery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 9:8-10 (Gonzales)(citing N.M. Rules Ann. 1-004(E)(3), (G)(3) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Martinez argued that he satisfied New Mexico law, because he sent service through certified mail to an address that Shellpoint Mortgage regularly checked and the envelope was stamped, indicating that Shellpoint Mortgage received the delivery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 8:14-16 (Gonzales);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2057-12-1\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2057-12-1\">\n    at 9:18-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Gonzales).

Shellpoint Mortgage explained that, in\n   <em>\n    Hukill v.

The Court asked for the language that the Tenth Circuit used.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 23:15-25:15(Court). Shellpoint Mortgage explained that, in that case, a corporation was \"served via unauthorized people.\" Tr. at 3:16 (Edwards). The Tenth Circuit held that, because \"Ms. Hukill's attempted service by mail was accepted by an unauthorized person, it did not substantially comply with the statute and wasn't\n   valid.\" Tr. at 15-17:16 (Edwards)(citing\n   <em>\n    Hukill v.

The Court returned the discussion to rule 1-004, and asked whether rule 1-004(G)(1) had to be satisfied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 15:17-17:17 (Court). Shellpoint Mortgage concluded that service had to satisfy rule 1-004(G)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 19:17-25:17 (Edwards). The Court then asked whether Shellpoint Mortgage read\n   <em>\n    Hukill v. Oklahoma Native American Domestic Violence Coalition\n   </em>\n   to mean that due process requires a plaintiff to mail a summons and complaint to an authorized person, and Shellpoint Mortgage agreed that it read the case in that manner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. \u00b6\u00b6 19:17-25:17 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Shellpoint Mortgage contended that Martinez sent a Summons and Complaint to an address that Shellpoint Mortgage used only to receive payments, and that address was not used for litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 11:22-24 (Edwards). Shellpoint Mortgage admitted that there is a return stamp on the envelope with which Martinez tried to serve Shellpoint Mortgage, but no person authorized to accept service signed the envelope.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 2:1-6 (Edwards). Shellpoint Mortgage contended that such service does not suffice under federal or New Mexico rules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 13:7-9 (Edwards). Shellpoint Mortgage further noted that Martinez could have discovered that New Penn Financial LLC does business as Shellpoint Mortgage and that Martinez could have discovered the registered agent by searching for New Penn Financial LLC on the New Mexico Secretary of State's website.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 19:5-11 (Edwards).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Martinez reiterated that New Mexico does not require that the summons and complaint be mailed to a registered agent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 21:6-8 (Gonzales). He asserted that New Mexico requires only that they be mailed to an address at which the defendant regularly receives mail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 21:9-12 (Gonzales). The Court asked Martinez about\n   <em>\n    Hukill v.

The Court looked at rule 1-004(G) and explained that the Court reads the statute by beginning with rule 1-004(G)(1)(a), which describes on whom a plaintiff may serve the summons and complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 27:4-14 (Court)(citing N.M.

Rules Ann. 1-004(G)(1)(c) ). The Court stated: \"So you've got to go back up to paragraph 1, by mail, or it gives some other provisions.\" Tr. at 27:14-18 (Court). Following a review of rule 1-004(G), the Court looked to rule 1-004(E)(3) for directions on mailing the summons and complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 28:3-8 (Court)(citing N.M. Rules Ann. 1-004(E)(3) ).

If the addressee is a registered agent, Martinez may use mail to serve to that person.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.M. Rules Ann. 1-004(G)(1)(a).
