Dkt. 29. Following this Court's order on a prior motion to dismiss, BSI is the only remaining defendant. Dkt. 23. Plaintiff has filed a response in opposition to the instant motion. Dkt. 35. The Court hereby GRANTS in part BSI's Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court outlined this case's factual and procedural background in its Order on a prior motion to dismiss. Dkt. 23 at 1-3. Essentially, Plaintiff brought claims in federal court following entry of a Florida state court judgment for foreclosure on a mortgage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finding that some of these claims were inextricably intertwined with the state court's foreclosure judgment and that Plaintiff had an opportunity to raise them in the prior proceeding, the Court dismissed with prejudice claims relating to the validity of the debt under the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. 23 at 13.

Dkt. 24 at 8, 10. One is a letter from BSI titled \"Mortgage Statement\" and dated July 18, 2016.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20559.55\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20559.55\">\n    at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff claims that this letter \"misleads [her] about the legal status of the debt by failing to inform her the loan has been accelerated, the loan was in foreclosure, and the loan was reduced to judgment,\" that it \"add[s] additional amounts due for costs and fees after a judgment was already entered [that] were not authorized expressly by the document creating the debt,\" and that it \"seeks to collect an amount of debt to bring her loan current, but the amount stated was not accurate.\" Dkt. 24 \u00b6 \u00b6 15-17. Plaintiff also argues that the letter improperly sought to collect debt from her directly, though BSI knew or should have known she had counsel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20559.55\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20559.55\">\n    \u00b6 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The second attached document is a Form 1099-C Cancellation of Debt that lists BSI as the creditor and an \"[a]mount of debt discharged\" of $354,354.47. Dkt. 24 at 10. Plaintiff contends that this was misleading and a false representation of the legal status of the debt because, first, no money is owed to BSI, and second, McCormick 106, LLC continued to \"pursue [Plaintiff] for a personal judgment for a deficiency judgment on the note in August of 2017.\" Dkt. 24 \u00b6 \u00b6 19-20.

She instead alleges the 1099-C represents a discrete violation of the FDCPA should the Court find BSI engaged in debt collection.

In spite of the filing of a 1099-C, the court first noted that the record contained \"no allegation that [the collector] was seeking the payment of\n   any money in connection with the cancelled debt,\" and that the claimant did not \"offer[ ] any facts to support his allegations that [the collector] used false, unconscionable, or deceptive forms in the collection of a debt.\"\n   <em>\n    Gorbaty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3996497\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/355/580/\">\n    355 F.

The court went on to hold that the \"mailing and receipt of a [1099-C] by itself, without any indication that the notice was used in connection with the collection of a debt, does not state a claim for violation of the FDCPA.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3996497\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/355/580/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3996497\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/355/580/\">\n    at 581-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Here, there is similarly no indication that BSI's 1099-C was filed in connection with the collection of a debt. While the Court need not reach Plaintiff's underlying claim about the misleading nature of the 1099-C, it does note that both the above case law and Internal Revenue Service opinion suggest that a 1099-C does not by itself extinguish debt or even preclude a creditor from pursuing collection.\n   <em>\n    In re Zilka\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5895541\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/407/684/#p688\">\n    407 B.R. 684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 688-89 (Bankr.
