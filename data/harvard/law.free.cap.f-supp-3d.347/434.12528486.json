Plaintiffs also allege that Apple failed to adequately disclose that the iOS updates would affect the performance of their iPhones and, more broadly, that Apple made representations and omissions regarding the capacity of iPhone and iPad devices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Apple moves to dismiss claims in the Consolidated Amended Complaint (\"Complaint\") under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The Court finds that some of Plaintiffs' allegations are at full capacity, but others need to be recharged. The Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Apple's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case primarily concerns Apple's response to software capability and battery capacity issues in certain older-model iPhones and iPads. The following facts are drawn from Plaintiffs' Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Beginning in late 2015, consumers began reporting that their iPhone and iPad devices were experiencing unexpected shutdowns despite showing more than 30% remaining charge on the battery. CAC \u00b6\u00b6 2-3. When the device shut down, it would remain dead until the user reconnected the device to power.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. The number of complaints increased through the fall of 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2-3. At the end of 2016, Apple suggested that a remedy would be forthcoming in the next round of software updates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 23, 2017, Apple released iOS 10.2.1, an update to its iOS 10 operating system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 359, 398. The update was sent directly to users' iPhone and iPad devices, and users had the option of downloading and installing the update on their\n   devices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 359, 386-87. The alert that accompanied the update stated that the \"update include[d] bug fixes and improve[d] the security of [the user's] iPhone or iPad.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 360, 399. In February 2017, Apple added more information in a \"Read Me\" section which stated: iOS 10.2.1 \"improves power management during peak workloads to avoid unexpected shutdowns on iPhone.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 400. In a statement issued at the end of February 2017, Apple explained that \" \"[w]ith iOS 10.2.1, Apple made improvements to reduce occurrences of unexpected shutdowns that a small number of users were experiencing with their iPhone.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 401.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 19, 2017, Apple released a new version of its operating system, iOS 11.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 406. When consumers with older-model iPhone and iPad devices downloaded iOS 11, they experienced a marked decrease in battery life from the prior iOS 10 operating system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 407-08. On December 2, 2017, Apple released iOS 11.2.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 363. Like the iOS 10.2.1 update, the iOS 11.2 update was sent directly to users' iPhone and iPad devices, and the update was available for immediate download and installation on their devices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 363, 386-87. The alert accompanying the update stated, among other things, that the update \"include[d] bug fixes and improvements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 363.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In mid-December 2017, independent research was published online \"demonstrating the marked degradation of performance in a large sampling of ... Devices after installation of the [iOS 10.2.1 and 11.2] Updates.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. For example, software engineer John Poole \"published a report based on an analysis of 100,000 iPhones and conclud[ed] that the decrease in performance of the affected iPhones was caused by the iOS 10.2.1 and iOS 11.2 updates, and not the normal decreased function that would be caused by an aging battery.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 410. On December 20, 2017, Apple released a statement about the iOS 10.2.1 and 11.2 updates:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Last year we released a feature for iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE to smooth out the instantaneous peaks only when needed to prevent the device from unexpectedly shutting down during these conditions. We've now extended that feature to iPhone 7, with iOS 11.2, and plan to add support for other products in the future.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Apple also asserted that \"another contributor to these user experiences is the continued chemical aging of the batteries in older iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s devices, many of which are still running on their original batteries.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 415.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Then, on December 28, 2017, Apple released another statement that confirmed some consumers' suspicions that the iOS updates had intentionally slowed down the processing speeds of iPhone 6 and iPhone 7 models.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Apple's statement read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   iOS 10.2.1 (released January 2017) includes updates for previous models of iPhone to prevent them from unexpectedly shutting down. This includes a feature for iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and iPhone SE to dynamically manage the instantaneous performance peaks, only when needed, to prevent the device from unexpectedly shutting down. This capability was also extended to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus with iOS 11.2, and we will continue improving our power management feature in the future. This feature's only intent is to prevent unexpected shutdowns so that the iPhone can still be used. This power management feature is specific to iPhone and does not apply to any other Apple products.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   This power management works by looking at a combination of the device temperature, battery state of charge, and\n   battery impedance. Only if these variables require it, iOS will dynamically manage the maximum performance of some system components, such as the CPU and GPU, in order to prevent unexpected shutdowns. As a result, the device workloads will self-balance, allowing a smoother distribution of system tasks, rather than larger, quick spikes of performance all at once. In some cases, a user may not notice any differences in daily device performance. The level of perceived change depends on how much power management is required for a particular device.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Apple also admitted that in extreme cases, the user may notice effects such as longer launch times, lower frame rates, backlight dimming, and lower speaker volume.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The iOS updates impaired the functioning of Plaintiffs' iPhones by substantially slowing their processing speed (by as much as 50%).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 405, 409-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, Apple's iOS updates were symptomatic of a greater defect that was present in older-model iPhone and iPad devices from the date of purchase.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that Apple was attempting to conceal the \"mismatch between the Devices' hardware, including their processing chips and rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, and the ever-increasing demands placed on the Devices via Apple's constantly-updating iOS software platform.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 370 (noting \"an inherent mismatch between battery performance and the operational needs of the Devices\"). Whereas faster and more powerful processing units \"require more power from the phone's battery,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 391, \"[a] lithium-ion battery's capacity is degraded over time by discharge/recharge cycles, elevated temperatures, and aging,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 380. Eventually, a phone may shut down when \"the battery ages and is unable to deliver the peak power demanded by the phone's processor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 396. Apple allegedly knew about this phenomenon but did not design the devices to ensure that the battery would \"be capable of meeting the processor's peak power demands for years to come.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 393.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A number of class action lawsuits were filed by consumers against Apple. These lawsuits generally alleged that Apple's conduct violated federal and state computer-intrusion laws, as well as state consumer-protection laws and common law. In early 2018, one of the plaintiffs who filed a class action in this district moved to centralize pretrial proceedings in a single judicial district.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201407\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (\"When civil actions involving one or more common questions of fact are pending in different districts, such actions may be transferred to any district for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.\"). On April 4, 2018, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (\"JPML\") issued a transfer order selecting the undersigned judge as the transferee court for \"coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings\" in the multidistrict litigation (\"MDL\") arising out of Apple's conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

Claims Brought By Non-U.S. Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Apple first seeks to excise from this case all claims brought by non-U.S. Plaintiffs. Mot. at 7. Apple advances four arguments in this respect: (1) allowing non-U.S. Plaintiffs to pursue claims would raise practical and constitutional problems, (2) the non-U.S. Plaintiffs may not invoke California law, (3) the federal and California laws at issue do not apply extraterritorially, and (4) the Court should exercise its discretion to dismiss the claims under U.K. law under the doctrine of international comity or forum non conveniens.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-18.

Practical and Constitutional Problems\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Apple's opening, and most amorphous, contention is that multiple significant practical and constitutional concerns will arise from the adjudication of claims by consumers in 40 foreign countries.

Thus, the relevant question here is whether the non-U.S. Plaintiffs' causes of action arise from or relate to Apple's software license agreement. The Court has no trouble concluding that they do. Apple does not actually sell its iOS software to consumers, but instead licenses that software for consumers' use under the software license agreement. CAC, Ex. 5 \u00b6 1(a). As Plaintiffs allege, without the iOS software, their Apple devices cannot operate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 446. Thus, with every purchase of an Apple device, Apple binds consumers to the software license agreement as a condition of using the iOS software.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 5 at 1. And Plaintiffs' claimed injuries-which underlie each cause of action and give rise to this entire lawsuit-are allegedly caused by this very software. Indeed, the iOS updates form a central component of Plaintiffs' case, and the software license agreement grants users the right to download iOS updates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 5 \u00b6 2(b). The non-U.S. Plaintiffs' causes of action fall within the scope of the choice-of-law clause because, at a minimum, the claims relate to the software license agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In arguing to the contrary, Apple gets its wires crossed.

However, Apple does not even acknowledge\n   <em>\n    Nedlloyd\n   </em>\n   in making this argument. Instead, Apple falls back on the general proposition that \"choice-of-law agreements have no effect in a class action if the trial court determines that ... class claims fall outside their scope.\"\n   <em>\n    Wash.

While that statement is true as far as it goes, it simply begs the question here. The Court's analysis above confirms why the claims at issue here fall within the scope of the choice-of-law provision in Apple's software license agreement. Finally, Apple attempts to shoehorn the non-U.S. Plaintiffs' claim into Apple's hardware warranty, which is \"governed by and construed under the laws of the country in which the Apple Product purchase took place.\" ECF No. 177-1 at 8. Even if the Court were inclined to take judicial notice of Apple's hardware warranty, Plaintiffs' claims cannot be said to arise therefrom or relate thereto because the warranty explicitly exempts \"consumable parts, such as batteries\" from its coverage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.

In the instant case, California has a substantial relationship to defendant Apple because Apple has its principal place of business in California, Apple conducted much of the conduct relevant to the lawsuit in California, and Apple seeks to apply California law to its sales transactions. CAC \u00b6\u00b6 280-84. Additionally, the Court has not located or been pointed to a fundamental policy of a foreign jurisdiction that would be undermined by applying California law in this case. Thus, the Court also concludes that the choice-of-law clause in Apple's software license agreement is enforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Court's decision that the non-U.S. Plaintiffs may bring claims under California law comes with one caveat, however. As the Ninth Circuit has held, \"[w]hen a law contains geographical limitations on its application, ... courts will not apply it to parties falling outside those limitations, even if the parties stipulate that the law should apply.\"\n   <em>\n    Gravquick A/S v.

As Apple aptly notes, the California False Advertising Law (\"FAL\") contains such a geographical limitation. Mot. at 14. Specifically, the FAL prohibits false or misleading statements made \"before the public in\n   <em>\n    this state\n   </em>\n   \" or \"before the public in\n   <em>\n    any state\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2017500\">\n    Cal.

The parties are not permitted to contract\n   around this geographical limitation, and Plaintiffs have not pled that this element is satisfied. Accordingly, while the Court agrees that the non-U.S. Plaintiffs may invoke California law with respect to most of the claims at issue, the non-U.S. Plaintiffs' FAL claim must be dismissed.

The Court begins with \u00a7 1030(a)(5)(A). There is no disagreement that Apple \"knowingly cause[d] the transmission of a program, information, code, or command\" by sending iOS updates. Rather, the dispute here centers on whether Apple, \"as a result of [its knowing transmission], intentionally cause[d] damage without authorization\" to Plaintiffs'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   iPhones. Thus, the relevant question is whether Plaintiffs have adequately pled that Apple caused damage to their iPhones without permission and did so intentionally. The Court concludes that Plaintiffs' allegations are sufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Under the CFAA, \"damage\" is defined as \"any impairment to the integrity or availability of data, a program, a system, or information.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(8). The Complaint's allegations that the iOS updates slowed processor speeds in Plaintiffs' iPhones readily fit that definition. CAC \u00b6\u00b6 402-03. Moreover, based on the present allegations, Apple caused this damage without authorization. Specifically, the Complaint states that \"[n]either the software update notification nor the software update release notes made any mention of this severe throttling effect.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    \u00b6 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this way, even though Plaintiffs voluntarily installed the iOS updates, they never gave permission for Apple to cause damage to their iPhones. That result is not changed for those Plaintiffs who were exposed to Apple's February 2017 disclosures about power management because those disclosures never mentioned the reduction in processor speeds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 400-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, Plaintiffs plausibly plead intentionality by alleging that Apple designed the iOS updates to slow processing speed and concealed this effect.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    \u00b6 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Unlike in \u00a7 1030(a)(5)(A), the phrase \"without authorization\" in \u00a7 1030(a)(5)(C) modifies \"access.\" In the statute's words, liability attaches if Apple \"intentionally accesses a protected computer without authorization.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5)(C). Here, Apple had permission to access Plaintiffs' iPhones. Indeed, Plaintiffs gave Apple permission by choosing to voluntarily download and install the iOS updates. CAC \u00b6\u00b6 386-89.

Although the Court does not necessarily foreclose a \u00a7 1030(a)(5)(C) claim based on ill-gotten consent, Plaintiffs do not sufficiently plead such a claim here. Plaintiffs do not, for example, allege that Apple posed as someone else or blatantly\n   misdescribed the nature of the iOS updates in order to gain access to Plaintiffs' iPhones. Rather, Apple's message stated that the updates \"include[d] bug fixes and improve[d] the security of [the] iPhone\" or \"include[d] bug fixes and improvements,\" and Plaintiffs allowed the update.

Here, Plaintiffs' allegations fit that paradigm. Plaintiffs allege that the iOS updates were designed to slow their iPhones' processing speed. CAC \u00b6\u00b6 359, 364. And they allege that Apple did not inform consumers that the updates would do so.

Although the asserted defects affect the operation of the processors in Plaintiffs' devices and can cause those devices to shut down and remain dead until reconnected to power, CAC \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4, Plaintiffs do not satisfactorily plead the circumstances necessary to trigger Apple's duty to disclose. As discussed in more detail below, the Complaint does not provide a sufficient basis to conclude either that Apple's omission is material or that Apple concealed material facts unknown to Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   First, Plaintiffs do not adequately allege that Apple's omission was material.\n   <em>\n    Hodsdon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517150\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/891/857/#p861\">\n    891 F.3d at 863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because the test focuses on the \"reasonable consumer,\" Plaintiffs cannot overcome this requirement with their uniform allegation that all Plaintiffs \"would not have purchased the Device, or would have paid substantially less for it\" had they been told about the defects.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , CAC \u00b6\u00b6 30, 32, 34. Instead, Plaintiffs must plead facts sufficient to raise the plausible inference that Apple's disclosure of the alleged defects would be important in the reasonable consumer's decision about whether to purchase the Apple device at the stated price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Although the Court is mindful that materiality is typically a question of fact that should not be decided at the motion to dismiss stage,\n   <em>\n    In re Tobacco II Cases\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3896287\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/46/298/\">\n    46 Cal.4th 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20559\">\n    93 Cal.Rptr.3d 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=207%20P.3d%2020\">\n    207 P.3d 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 39 (2009), both common sense and Plaintiffs' own allegations here undercut the materiality element. Importantly, Plaintiffs plead that Apple was required to inform customers about the \"Defects and Battery Issues.\" CAC \u00b6\u00b6 488, 499, 514. However, Plaintiffs have not defined those terms in a way that disclosure would affect a reasonable consumer's decision about whether to purchase the product at the stated price. The Complaint broadly\n   defines the \"Defects\" as the alleged \"mismatch between the Devices' hardware, including their processing chips and rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, and the ever-increasing demands placed on the Devices via Apple's constantly-updating iOS software platform.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 370 (\"Apple developed and sold Devices that contained an inherent mismatch between battery performance and the operational needs of the Devices.\"). Relatedly, the Complaint defines \"Battery Issues\" as \"the limitations of the batteries to provide enough power current to keep pace with the new demands.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. In other words, Plaintiffs' theory appears to be that Apple was duty-bound to disclose that their batteries will eventually need replacement because increasing software capability puts more demands on hardware and battery capacity degrades over time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 397 (\"[T]he battery was not designed with enough power to meet the peak demands of the phone's processor as the battery aged.\"). Plaintiffs' contention is far too sweeping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   As Plaintiffs' own allegations demonstrate, consumers are fully aware of the facts regarding software capability and battery capacity. For years, consumers have had to replace batteries in their cell phones and other devices. Indeed, before the Apple iPhone came on the market, \"cell phones without user-replaceable batteries were almost unheard of.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 378. Replacing batteries is a natural consequence of the fact that \"[a] lithium-ion battery's capacity is degraded over time by discharge/recharge cycles, elevated temperatures, and aging.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 380;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 392 (\"[T]he impedance of lithium-ion batteries used in iPhones increases as the cells age, resulting in both a reduction in overall battery capacity and a reduction in the battery's ability to produce peak power output.\"). Plaintiffs even allege that \"[i]t is\n   <em>\n    well known\n   </em>\n   to smartphone manufacturers, including Apple, that lithium-ion batteries degrade over time as the number of discharge/recharge cycles increases.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 381 (emphasis added). Similarly, Plaintiffs' Complaint explains the natural phenomenon that as \"processing units become faster and more powerful,\" \"they also require more power from the phone's battery.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 391. Eventually, a phone may \"switch off\" when \"the battery ages and is unable to deliver the peak power demanded by the phone's processor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 396.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In addition to consumers' baseline awareness of the inevitably of battery decay, Apple's representations made that point even more salient with respect to the devices at issue. For example, Plaintiffs acknowledge that Apple, like other smartphone manufacturers (including Samsung, LG, and Google), warranties its batteries for a limited amount of time. CAC \u00b6 416. Specifically, Apple provides a \"one-year warranty,\" which includes \"service coverage for a defective battery.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In that warranty, Apple explicitly notes that the iPhone \"battery is designed to retain up to 80% of its original capacity at 500 complete charge cycles.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 416 n.60 (stating that the iPad \"battery is designed to retain up to 80% of its original capacity at 1000 complete charge cycles\"). These statements make clear that consumers cannot realistically expect their batteries to last for the lifetime of their devices (or even necessarily for more than a year). No Plaintiff alleges that the battery in his or her device did not live up to the standards actually communicated by Apple. Even if Apple's later statements about the iOS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   updates designed to fix the battery-capacity issue omitted key information, Plaintiffs tie their claims and alleged harm to the point of sale, not to the point at which Apple slowed the processing speed of their devices.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30, 32, 34. Without a solid factual underpinning, Plaintiffs have not adequately alleged that the omitted information would have influenced a reasonable consumer's decision about whether to purchase the Apple device at the stated price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs do not adequately allege that Apple was Plaintiffs' fiduciary, had exclusive knowledge of material facts not reasonably accessible to Plaintiffs, concealed a material fact from Plaintiffs, or made partial representations while suppressing other material facts.\n   <em>\n    Hodsdon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517150\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/891/857/#p861\">\n    891 F.3d at 862\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs do not contend that Apple had any fiduciary role. Instead, Plaintiffs argue that the other three circumstances relating to suppression of materials facts are adequately alleged in the instant case. Again, the disclosures that Plaintiffs wish Apple to have made are so far-reaching that they do not fit within any of the recognized circumstances triggering the duty to disclose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   For example, Plaintiffs have not adequately pled that Apple \"ha[d] exclusive knowledge of material facts not known or reasonably accessible to the plaintiff\" or \"actively conceal[ed] a material fact from the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517150\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/891/857/#p861\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=134%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20588\">\n    134 Cal.Rptr.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   593 ). The Court has already detailed above that common sense and Plaintiffs' own allegations demonstrate that consumers know about the degradation of batteries and the increasing capability of software. Plaintiffs admit that their \"iPhones worked as expected when new.\" CAC \u00b6 397. Their real concern is that \"even after a few months or years, [the devices] began to cease functioning, i.e., switching off at random intervals, when the iPhone processor required too much power of its flagging iPhone battery.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=134%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20588\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, Plaintiffs do not plead that Apple knew that the devices would cease functioning within \"a few months.\" Rather, Plaintiffs generally assert that Apple was on notice that the software would eventually outpace the hardware (as the software improved and the battery degraded).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 393-97. Framed in this way, Plaintiffs' allegations are insufficient because these facts were not in Apple's exclusive knowledge but were readily accessible to the public, including Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Nor have Plaintiffs adequately alleged that Apple \"ma[de] partial representations that [we]re misleading because some other material fact ha[d] not been disclosed.\"\n   <em>\n    Hodsdon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517150\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/891/857/#p861\">\n    891 F.3d at 862\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a preliminary matter, Plaintiffs flunk the standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) because they fail to pinpoint which of Apple's representations were rendered misleading by the identified omission.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swartz v.

To the extent that Plaintiffs rely on Apple's general advertising statements evincing the speed and long battery life of the devices, Plaintiffs do not explain precisely how those statements are misleading when consumers know about the problem of declining battery performance. That conclusion has added force because Apple's \"one-year warranty\" on its batteries expressly notes that the iPhone \"battery is designed to retain up to 80% of its original capacity at 500 complete charge cycles.\" CAC \u00b6 416;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3762332\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/476/756/#p764\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 416 n.60 (listing battery life for iPad). At this juncture, the Court need not address whether Apple's statement that the iOS updates included only \"bug fixes\" and \"improvements\" was misleading when Apple designed the updates to inhibit the processing speed of the devices because\n   Plaintiffs regard these updates as a means of hiding the defects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   In reality, Plaintiffs apparently seek to hold Apple liable for failing to provide a battery that lasted as long as Plaintiffs preferred.
