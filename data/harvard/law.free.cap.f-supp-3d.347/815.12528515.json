Holmes contends that the Grant County Sheriff and a Grant County Sheriff Deputy violated New Mexico criminal statutes and her \"Natural Rights\" and \"Common Law Rights\" when they cited and arrested Holmes, and towed her automobile, allegedly in response to discovering Holmes driving her vehicle without a driver's license, automobile registration, or car insurance. Defense Answer Received on April 3, 2018 Response to Defense Counsel at 7:21-23, filed April 6, 2018 (Doc. 17)(\"Response\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint at 5:23-7:11; Supp. Complaint at 3:25-4:3.

The MTD was fully briefed on April 24, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Notice of Completion of Briefing, filed April 25, 2018 (Doc. 20).

On July 31, 2018, Magistrate Judge Wormuth submitted his PFRD recommending that the Court dismiss Holmes' Complaint for failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PFRD at 1. Specifically, Magistrate Judge Wormuth concluded that, even construing Holmes' claims liberally, none of the statutes on which Holmes expressly or impliedly relies\n   for her claims affords a private right of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Holmes filed objections to the PFRD on August 16, 2018, arguing that the Court should not dismiss her Complaint on a number of grounds, including, among other things, that she has the fundamental right to travel, that the Defendants waived the right to assert immunity by filing a MTD rather than an Answer in response to her Complaint, that she is properly seeking civil damages for the Defendants' alleged violations of criminal laws, and that the Defendants -- and police officers generally -- lack jurisdiction over Holmes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objections at 5:8-8:6, 8:23-27.

The Tenth Circuit has explained that brief district court orders that \"merely repeat[ ] the language of \u00a7 636(b)(1) to indicate its compliance\" are sufficient to demonstrate that the district court conducted a de novo review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   It is common practice among district judges in this circuit to make such a statement and adopt the magistrate judges' recommended dispositions when they find that magistrate judges have dealt with the issues fully and accurately and that they could add little of value to that analysis.

Construing Holmes' Objections liberally, the Court concludes that Holmes' primary Objection is that she has standing to seek civil damages for criminal violations and to sue directly pursuant to FSIA. As an initial matter, the Court notes that Holmes does not object to the portion of the PFRD in which Magistrate Judge Wormuth outlined the three potential statutory underpinnings of Holmes' claims.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Objections. The Court, therefore, now addresses de novo these three potential bases for the claims that Holmes brings, as Magistrate Judge Wormuth determines them: (i) enforcement of a constitutional right pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (ii) New Mexico criminal statutes N.M.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 30-28-2, 30-16D-1, 30-4-3, and 30-3A-2 ; and (iii) the FSIA, and concludes that all three bases lack a sound basis in the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Holmes' Complaint cannot be saved from dismissal on the first base, because, as Magistrate Judge Wormuth noted in his PFRD, Holmes underscores that she is not pursuing claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 7:19-21 (noting that Holmes does not sue under \u00a7 1983, because \"[a] non U.S. citizen [cannot] sue under Title 42 at section 1983, as Defense Counsel alleges\").\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fair v.

Objections at 4:21-5:6. None of the criminal statutes that Holmes cites, however, affords a private right of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.M.S.A. \u00a7 30-28-2 (conspiracy); N.M.S.A. \u00a7 30-16D-1 (unlawful taking of a vehicle or motor vehicle); N.M.S.A. \u00a7 30-4-3 (false imprisonment); and N.M.S.A. \u00a7 30-3A-2 (harassment). These criminal statutes, therefore, cannot properly serve as the basis for any civil lawsuit, whether a licensed attorney or a pro se plaintiff filed this case. Holmes has pointed to no authority to suggest that an attorney could file a civil suit on a client's behalf pursuant to a New Mexico criminal statute that does not provide for a private right of action. State tort law certainly may provide a valid basis for a cognizable civil claim stemming from conduct that the state also criminalizes, but Holmes has not brought tort claims against the Defendants; rather, as she reiterates in her Objections, \"Plaintiff is asking for civil penalties for violating criminal acts.\" Objections at 5:7. Yet, as Magistrate Judge Wormuth properly concluded, private citizens lack standing to maintain criminal actions even if licensed attorneys represent them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Andrews v. Heaton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5743421\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/483/1070/#p1076\">\n    483 F.3d at 1076\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that criminal statutes which do not provide for a private right of action are not enforceable through a civil action);\n   <em>\n    Higgins v.

This lack of standing is unrelated to Holmes' pro se status, such that Holmes' reliance on the Taft-Hartley Act to argue that Magistrate Judge Wormuth has effectively created a \"closed shop\" for licensed attorneys to bring such claims lacks a sound basis in the law. The Court will, therefore, overrule Holmes' Objection on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Next, the Court agrees with Magistrate Judge Wormuth's conclusion that Holmes does not state a claim pursuant to the FSIA in her capacity as an alleged diplomat of the foreign state of the Bradford Republic.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Complaint at 2:23-26; Federal Question Pursuant to Treaties the United States is Party To at 2:6-16,\n   filed April 25, 2018 (Doc. 21); Response to Defendants Reply (Received on April 27, 2018) at 8:26-9:1, filed May 2, 2018 (Doc. 22). Holmes offers no express argument regarding this conclusion in her Objections.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Objections. Nonetheless, construing Holmes' pleadings liberally, the Court affirms Magistrate Judge Wormuth's conclusion that the FSIA confers only immunity. Like the New Mexico criminal statutes, it does not provide any private right of action. Therefore, even if the Court accepts Holmes' argument that she falls within the ambit of the FSIA's definition of \"foreign state,\" such that she qualifies for FSIA immunity, the statute would still not permit her to sue in federal court. At best, it would serve as a defense in the criminal cases that the state prosecutes against her in state court. The FSIA, therefore, does not confer on Holmes a private right of action, and the Court overrules any Objection to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Finally, Holmes objects to the PFRD on various other grounds, including: (i) Holmes does not consent to the Magistrate Judge; (ii) the Defendants waived their right to move to dismiss Holmes' Complaint, because they \"never pleaded that Plaintiff was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   illegally arrested without a warrant, or that Plaintiff's auto was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   stolen,\" Objections at 3:24-25; (iii) Holmes has the fundamental right to travel unencumbered by vehicle licensing and registration requirements; and (iv) the Defendants are not immune from suit and are incompetent. As to the first of these Objections, rule 72(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires a Magistrate Judge, upon the Court's order of reference, to enter proposed findings of fact and a recommended disposition on dispositive pretrial matters \"without the parties' consent.\" Of course, such a recommended disposition is subject to the Court's de novo review and ultimate determination, and the Court must review any Objections that the parties file.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2). This Memorandum Opinion and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss constitutes the de novo review to which Holmes is entitled, and thus her Objection that she does not consent to Magistrate Judge Wormuth pursuant to rule 73(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) lacks a sound basis in the law, and the Court overrules the Objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As to the second of these Objections, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require the Defendants to assert a 12(b)(6) defense of failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted by motion \"before pleading if a responsive pleading is allowed.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b). The Defendants, therefore, properly comply with federal procedure by filing the MTD in lieu of an Answer to the Complaint, and Holmes' Objection that this decision should be taken as an admission of all the Complaint's allegations lacks a sound basis in the law, and the Court hereby overrules Holmes' second Objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As to the third Objection, again, Holmes does not overcome the fundamental barrier to her claims, which is that she has not pointed to any statute or constitutional provision that provides a private right of action to vindicate any \"right to travel\" unencumbered by vehicle licensing and registration requirements. Moreover, Holmes does not raise either of these arguments in her Response to the Defendants' MTD, meaning that Holmes has waived both of these arguments and may not raise them for the first time in her Objections, even if they had merit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Garfinkle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9497698\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/261/1030/#p1031\">\n    261 F.3d at 1031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, with regard to Holmes' Objection that the Defendants are\n   not immune from suit, the Court need not decide that issue to rule on the MTD. Holmes must first state a claim upon which relief may be granted before the Court must decide whether the Defendants are immune to such a claim. For the reasons already explained in this Memorandum Opinion and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss, Holmes has not stated any claim upon which relief may be granted. Thus, her Complaint is subject to dismissal pursuant to rule 12(b)(6) notwithstanding the proper resolution of the Defendants' asserted affirmative defense of immunity. Nevertheless, the Court will briefly address this Objection, because, \"[a]lthough pro se plaintiffs are usually allowed to amend their complaints, dismissal with prejudice for failure to state a claim is proper 'where it is obvious that the plaintiff cannot prevail on the facts [she] has alleged and it would be futile to give [her] an opportunity to amend.' \"\n   <em>\n    Avington v. Indian Health Care Res. Ctr. of Tulsa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12412058\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/712/825/#p826\">\n    712 F.

The Court does not intend to allow Holmes an opportunity to amend her Complaint in part because any such amendment would be futile in light of the Defendants' entitlement to immunity. For example, if Holmes were to amend her Complaint to assert \u00a7 1983 claims stemming from the same facts already alleged, the individual Defendants would be entitled to qualified immunity because of Holmes' failure to point to any case law clearly establishing that it violates the Constitution of the United States of America or any federal statute to detain a person driving an unregistered vehicle without a driver's license.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pearson v.

Further, none of the Objections raised by Holmes refutes Magistrate Judge Wormuth's conclusion. As a result, the Court agrees with Magistrate Judge Wormuth's conclusion that Holmes does not bring any claims for which relief can plausibly be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Moreover, notwithstanding Holmes' pro se status, the Court shall not grant her leave to amend her Complaint to remedy her failure to state a claim, because the Court concludes that Holmes cannot prevail on any possible constitutional or other federal claim based on the facts alleged.\n   <em>\n    Avington v.
