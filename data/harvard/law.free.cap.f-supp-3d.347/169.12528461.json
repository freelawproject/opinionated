Plaintiff has brought a number of claims against five officers of the Rochester Police Department (\"RPD\"), arising out of his arrest on June 18, 2014. Defendants have moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint (Dkt. # 36).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On the evening of June 18, 2014, plaintiff was released from jail in Buffalo, New York. He had been arrested for a parole violation. Williams Depo. (Dkt. # 36-1 Ex. B) at 16-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff testified at his deposition in this case that his \"baby mother,\" Keya Thompson-White (\"Keya\"), bailed plaintiff out of jail. After his release, plaintiff was driven back to Rochester by Keya, his cousins and his brother.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Later that day, the RPD received a call of a man with a gun who had menaced someone in front of a house on North Goodman Street in Rochester. Defendant RPD Officer Cody Goodfriend responded to the call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Upon arriving at the house, Goodfriend spoke to the victim, Lakesha Jenkins, who told him that she had gotten into an argument with Keya in front of the house. Goodfriend states in an affidavit (Dkt. # 36-2) that Jenkins said that while she was arguing with Keya, she saw plaintiff exit a car parked across the street. He walked over, began yelling at her and accused her of \"setting up\" his brother (who had been shot by someone a few nights earlier). Goodfriend states that Jenkins told him that plaintiff pulled out a handgun and yelled at her, \"You gonna die tonight Kesha!,\" but two men who had been in the car with plaintiff pulled him away from the scene, and he left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Goodfriend, accompanied by defendant Officer Salvatore Amato, then went to a house on Keller Street, which Jenkins had identified as plaintiff's residence. When they arrived, Goodfriend and Amato found a crowd of people in the front yard. Plaintiff testified at his deposition in this case that \"[t]here was a ton\" of people at his house, mostly relatives, who were there to welcome him home from jail. Plaintiff's Depo. (Dkt. # 36-1 Ex. B) at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants state that shortly after their arrival, they began talking with plaintiff's mother, who was standing outside in the yard. She told them that plaintiff was inside the house. At this point, the parties' versions of the details diverge to some extent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendants contend that as this conversation was going on, outside the house, plaintiff came out of the front door of the house and asked what was going on. Defendants assert that when he was told that he was under arrest, plaintiff yelled, \"Hell no! I ain't going nowhere,\" and ran back into the house. (Dkt. # 38 \u00b6 16.) Defendants assert that they immediately pursued him into the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff testified at his deposition that he was in his second-floor bedroom when he heard some commotion downstairs, and that he came downstairs to find his mother and police officers, inside the house. He testified that the officers attempted to persuade him to come outside, but that he responded that if he was not under arrest, he would not do so. (Dkt. # 36-1 Ex. B at 29-30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   What is undisputed is that a physical altercation broke out between plaintiff and defendants, inside the house. Defendants admit that they used force against plaintiff. They state that based on Jenkins's statements about plaintiff brandishing a gun, they decided, and attempted, to arrest plaintiff, but he ran into the house. The officers pursued him, and inside the house they were confronted by several other people (presumably guests of plaintiff, who were there to join in the welcome-home celebration) who began making hostile comments toward the officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants state that they tried to apprehend plaintiff, who resisted their attempts. During the ensuing scuffle, plaintiff allegedly backed himself into a corner and assumed a \"fighting stance.\" According to defendants, defendant Amato then struck plaintiff with a closed fist, and as the two men grappled, Amato used his knee to hit plaintiff in the forehead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At some point, three other officers arrived: Timothy Pancoe, Paul Helfer, and Richard Rodriguez. Eventually, plaintiff ended up on the floor. According to defendants, they attempted to handcuff him, but he continued to resist. After defendant Goodfriend struck plaintiff in the face,\n   plaintiff rolled onto his stomach. Defendant Helfer used his taser against plaintiff, while defendants Rodriguez and Goodfriend continued to strike plaintiff, until they were able to get plaintiff's right arm behind his back and handcuff him. Plaintiff was then taken to a nearby police station, and later to Rochester General Hospital, where he received medical treatment. Def. R. 56 Statement (Dkt. # 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   That, in a nutshell, is defendants' version of what happened. According to plaintiff, he was upstairs, and when he heard yelling coming from the first floor, he went downstairs, with his two-year-old son in his arms, and found defendants in a confrontation with plaintiff's mother and some of his other relatives. Plaintiff alleges that the officers pushed his mother aside, and that Officer Goodfriend lunged at plaintiff. Plaintiff instinctively attempted to block Goodfriend's punch, and in the ensuing struggle, plaintiff was struck and tased, and eventually lost consciousness. Plaintiff's Depo. Tr. (Dkt. # 36-1 Ex. B.) at 49-57. Plaintiff testified that his next memory is of waking up in the back of a police car.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff has submitted a photograph, apparently taken by an RPD officer, of plaintiff in the back of a police car, with blood stains over much of his face and on his upper right thigh. (Dkt. # 42-2.) Again, defendants do not deny that they used a significant amount of force against plaintiff; they simply contend that it was reasonable, under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following plaintiff's arrest, Goodfriend executed an accusatory instrument, accusing plaintiff of menacing in the second degree (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20L.%20%C2%A7%20120.14\">\n    N.Y.

Penal L. \u00a7 240.26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Goodfriend Aff. \u00b6 40 and Ex. C. Goodfriend later executed a felony complaint adding a charge of assault in the second degree (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20L.%20%C2%A7%20120.05\">\n    N.Y. Penal L. \u00a7 120.05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3) ), and plaintiff was subsequently indicted on those four charges. (Indictment # 2014-0925.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On March 23, 2015, shortly after the start of his jury trial, plaintiff accepted a plea offer, and pleaded guilty to attempted assault in the second degree, in satisfaction of all the charges against him. (Dkt. # 36-1 Ex. C.) The statutory basis for the charge was\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20L.%20%C2%A7%20120.05\">\n    N.Y.

Again, defendants state that Jenkins had told Goodfriend that plaintiff had brandished a pistol and threatened to kill her a short time earlier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In support of their motion for summary judgment, each defendant has submitted an affidavit recounting his recollection of the events. Goodfriend and Amato state that they saw plaintiff come out of the house, and that they pursued him back into the house. (Dkt. # 36-2, # 36-3). Pancoe and Helfer state that when they arrived on the scene, in response to calls for backup, plaintiff, Goodfriend and other people were already inside the house. (Dkt. # 36-4, # 36-6.) Rodriguez states that when he arrived, he \"observed officers attempting to arrest Marlon Williams while other people in the house crowded around the arrest location,\" so apparently his testimony is that the other officers and plaintiff were inside the house when he arrived. (Dkt. # 36-5 \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In support of their motion for summary judgment, defendants note that at his plea allocution, plaintiff was asked by the prosecutor, \"you retreated back into your house, correct?\" (referring to the moment when the officers attempted to arrest him), and he responded, \"Yes.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 36-1 Ex.

He was pleading to an attempted-assault charge, and exactly where he or the officers were standing when he first saw them was not an element of the charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Second, the question itself was not crystal clear.

Goodfriend and Amato then got hold of plaintiff, and during the ensuing struggle,\n   Amato \"struck Mr. Williams in the face twice with a closed fist,\" and \"used his knee to strike Mr. Williams in the forehead two times.\" Goodfriend \"used a straight arm-bar to bring Mr. Williams to the ground,\" and after plaintiff was taken to the ground, Goodfriend \"delivered a downward hammer fist strike to the center of Mr. Williams's face.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Officer Helfer then arrived, and used his taser on the exposed skin of plaintiff's right shoulder. At the same time, Rodriguez, who had joined in the fray, \"delivered three knee strikes to Mr. Williams's outer right thigh, while Officer Goodfriend delivered a single straight punch to Mr. Williams's forehead ....\" (Dkt. # 38 \u00b6\u00b6 21-35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   According to defendants, all of these measures were reasonably necessary to bring plaintiff under physical control, because he was resisting their efforts to handcuff him. Defendants allege that after plaintiff swung and missed at Goodfriend, he retreated into a corner and assumed a \"fighting stance,\" and that even after plaintiff was taken down to the floor, he refused to put his arms behind his back so that he could be handcuffed. But they do not dispute that they used a significant degree of force against plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiff's account of these events is considerably different. He alleges that after Goodfriend and Amato had been in his house for several minutes, trying unsuccessfully to persuade plaintiff to come outside, the officers \"became impatient and lunged towards the plaintiff ....\" (Dkt. # 42 \u00b6 28.) Plaintiff states that he put one arm up, in an attempt to protect himself, but it appears that by his account, the encounter quickly turned chaotic, and he soon lost consciousness, from the force used against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   On defendants' motion for summary judgment, the Court cannot simply credit defendants' version of the events. \"Assessments of credibility and choices between conflicting versions of the events are matters for the jury, not for the court on summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Ivery v.

According to Pancoe, when he arrived at the house, at about 9:30 p.m., several officers were already inside. He states that a neighbor directed him to a side door, which he used to enter the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Once he was inside, Pancoe states, he saw Goodfriend, who told him that the officers were attempting to arrest plaintiff for menacing someone with a gun, which they thought might be somewhere in the house. Pancoe then tried to stop or dissuade others in the house from getting involved, while his fellow officers were engaged in arresting plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Plaintiff does not allege that Pancoe was directly involved in his arrest, or the physical altercation leading up to his arrest. Plaintiff's claim against Pancoe appears to be based solely on Pancoe's status as a sergeant, and his presence at the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The mere fact that Pancoe held a higher rank than the other officers is not enough to render him liable for the other officers' alleged use of excessive force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allah v. Poole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3663657\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/506/174/#p193\">\n    506 F.Supp.2d 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 193 (W.D.N.Y.2007) (defendants' supervisory status alone was not enough to establish their personal involvement in alleged constitutional violation). And even giving plaintiff's account of the events the most generous reading, there is no indication in the factual record that Pancoe participated in the officers' use of force, or that he was in a position to intervene. The evidence shows only that Pancoe was attempting to deal with the other people in the house during plaintiff's arrest, and that his attention was focused on those individuals, not on what was happening with plaintiff. The claim against Pancoe must therefore be dismissed, for lack of personal involvement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Qualified Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Defendants also argue that they are entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity.

The Court in\n   <em>\n    Kisela\n   </em>\n   reversed a court of appeals' decision holding that a police officer was not entitled to qualified immunity, where the officer shot a woman who was holding a large kitchen knife, had taken steps toward another woman, and had refused officers' commands to drop the knife. The Supreme Court stated that this was \"far from an obvious case in which any competent officer would have known that shooting [the knife-wielder] to protect [the other woman] would violate the Fourth Amendment.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610446\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1148/#p1152\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   But as the Court in\n   <em>\n    Kisela\n   </em>\n   pointed out, \"[u]se of excessive force is an area of the law 'in which the result depends very much on the facts of each case ....' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610446\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1148/#p1152\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mullenix\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12599545\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/305/#p308\">\n    136 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   309 ). Viewing the record in this case in the light most favorable to plaintiff, defendants Goodfriend and Amato rushed at him while he was standing on the stairs in his home, he instinctively raised one arm in self-defense, and then four officers pummeled and tased him until he lapsed into unconsciousness. If that is what happened, it is difficult to see how a reasonable officer could have thought that his actions were permissible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Merrill v.

But for the Court to grant summary judgment for defendants on this ground would require the Court to invade the province of the jury by making findings of fact. That, the Court may not do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Defendants' motion for summary judgment (Dkt. # 36) is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Plaintiff's claims for false arrest and malicious prosecution are dismissed. All of his claims against defendant Pancoe are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In all other respects, defendants' motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Plaintiff originally named the RPD as a defendant as well. His claims against the RPD were dismissed by the Court on June 22, 2016. (Dkt. # 7.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    To the extent that defendants' motion is based on the doctrines of collateral estoppel and res judicata, I reject those arguments for essentially the same reasons stated regarding their arguments based on\n    <em>\n     Heck v. Humphrey\n    </em>\n    . Plaintiff's guilty plea in the criminal proceeding does not bar, as a matter of law, his civil claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Though any plaintiff has the right to proceed\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    , and there is no constitutional right to appointed counsel in civil cases, plaintiff might be well advised to seek counsel to represent him, going forward. It appears that this case will proceed to trial, and plaintiff might be well served by having the benefit of counsel. The Monroe County Bar Association's Lawyer Referral Service might be a good place to start.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
