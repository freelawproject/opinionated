Crabtree, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Susan Miles's lawsuit arises from her discharge as a teacher at McKinley Elementary School in Kansas City, Kansas. Plaintiff filed suit against two defendants: Unified School District No. 500, Kansas City, Kansas (\"the District\") and Valerie Castillo. Doc. 1. Ms. Castillo is the Principal of McKinley Elementary School. Relevant here is the single claim plaintiff brings against Ms. Castillo: Plaintiff alleges that Ms. Castillo discriminated and retaliated against plaintiff for taking leave under the Family Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Ms. Castillo has moved to dismiss plaintiff's FMLA claim against her under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Doc. 17. She makes four arguments supporting dismissal. First, she contends that the Complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to show that she was plaintiff's \"employer,\" as defined by the FMLA. Second, she asserts that the Complaint does not allege facts capable of establishing that plaintiff engaged in an FMLA-protected activity. Third, Ms. Castillo argues that the Complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to show that Ms. Castillo took materially adverse action against her. Fourth, Ms. Castillo contends, even if plaintiff pleaded a sufficient FMLA claim, qualified immunity protects her from suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff then filed a Response. Doc. 27. And Ms. Castillo filed a timely Reply. Doc. 30. After considering the arguments and authorities presented in the parties' papers, the court denies Ms. Castillo's Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts come from plaintiff's Complaint. Doc. 1.

This contract automatically renewed every year. In 2016, plaintiff worked at McKinley Elementary School. Ms. Castillo was McKinley's Principal. Ms. Castillo supervised plaintiff's work and had the ability to make decisions affecting the terms and conditions of plaintiff's employment with the District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 8, 2016, a McKinley student tripped plaintiff while she was teaching. Plaintiff fell, knocking her unconscious. As a result, plaintiff suffered a concussion, occipital nerve damage, a back sprain, a neck sprain, and a foot fracture. She was diagnosed with occipital neuralgia and post-concussive syndrome, which caused vision problems, severe headaches, confusion, and dizziness. On May 11, 2016, plaintiff applied for FMLA leave because of her occipital neuralgia. The District approved plaintiff's request and gave her medical leave for the remainder of the 2015-16\n   school year. Later that month, Ms. Castillo directed plaintiff to complete all her lesson plans for the next school year before she began her FMLA leave. And, in May 2016, while plaintiff was on FMLA leave, Ms. Castillo made plaintiff return to school and clean out her classroom at the end of the school year. While plaintiff completed these tasks, Ms. Castillo implored plaintiff to return to work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff and the District allowed plaintiff's contract to renew automatically for the 2016-17 school year. On August 16, 2016, the District approved plaintiff's second FMLA request extending her leave through November 2, 2016. At the end of this leave, the District then approved an unpaid leave of absence from November 3, 2016, to January 4, 2017. In December 2016, the District's worker's compensation physician released plaintiff to return to work, effective January 4, 2017. Plaintiff then went to McKinley to deliver the doctor's work release forms to Ms. Castillo. While she was there, plaintiff asked Ms. Castillo what she had missed while she was gone. Ms. Castillo responded, \"Half a year of school.\" Ms. Castillo later told plaintiff, \"[Y]ou need to get out of here so our people can work.\" On January 4, 2017, Ms. Castillo, either individually or in concert with the District, discharged plaintiff's employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
