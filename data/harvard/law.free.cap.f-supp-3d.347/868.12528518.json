The Court held a hearing on June 20, 2018. The primary issue is whether Plaintiff Shirley Walker may sue Great West Casualty Company as an injurer's insurer under\n   <em>\n    Raskob v.

The Court concludes that a\n   <em>\n    Raskob\n   </em>\n   action lies, even against an out-of-state resident, so long as: (i) the law mandates the insurance coverage; (ii) the law is meant to benefit the public; and (iii) the law does not express an intent to deny joinder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Raskob\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"827419\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/126/394/\">\n    1998-NMSC-045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"827419\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/126/394/\">\n    126 N.M. 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"827419\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/126/394/\">\n    970 P.2d at 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, the Court grants the Motion, and Walker may amend her complaint to add Great West as a defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court takes its facts from Walker's Complaint for Personal Injuries and Damages (First Judicial District Court, County of Santa Fe, State of New Mexico), filed December 23, 2016, filed in federal court September 29, 2017 (Doc. 1-1)(\"Complaint\"). The Court provides these facts for background. It does not adopt them as the truth, and it recognizes that the facts are largely Walker's version of events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 23, 2015, Defendant Gregory J. Spina was speeding on U.S. Highway 84/285 in a commercial vehicle that Defendant Valley Express, Inc. owned.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, at 2. As Spina approached a red light, he realized that he was going too fast to brake, so, instead of hitting the vehicles stopped side by side in front of him, he attempted to slip between them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 7, at 2. Rather than avoiding the stopped vehicles, however, he sideswiped both of them, causing both cars to roll into the intersection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 7, at 2-3. Walker was driving one of the sideswiped vehicles and, as a result of Spina's actions, suffered physical and emotional injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 7, 11, at 2-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Walker sues Spina and Valley Express, asserting negligence,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and sues Defendant Dixon Insurance Company, asserting that she has a claim for benefits against it under the NMFRA and\n   <em>\n    Raskob\n   </em>\n   for injuries that Spina's negligence caused.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 8-13, at 3-5. Spina and Valley Express removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal to the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico at 1, filed September 29, 2017\n   (Doc. 1)(\"Notice of Removal\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dixon Insurance has not yet been served with the Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Draft Transcript of Motion Proceedings at 6:1-2 (taken June 20, 2018)(Beaulieu)(\"Tr.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     The Motion\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Walker moves to amend the Complaint so she can substitute Great West for Dixon Insurance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 1. She argues that, based on recent disclosures from Spina and Valley Express, she learned that Great West and not Dixon Insurance issued the relevant insurance policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion \u00b6 2, at 2. She argues, thus, that, under rule 15(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court should grant the amendment, because there is no evidence of \"undue delay, bad faith, dilatory tactics,\" or prejudice to Spina and Valley Express. Motion \u00b6\u00b6 5-7, at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The Response\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Spina and Valley Express respond.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Gregory J. Spina and Valley Express, Inc.'s Response to Plaintiff's Motion to Amend at 1, filed February 16, 2018 (Doc. 25)(\"Response\"). They argue that the Court should not allow the amendment, because commercial motor carriers, such as Great West, are exempt from the NMFRA, so, according to Spina and Valley Express, there is no basis to hold Great West liable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 1-2. Spina and Valley Express contend that the NMFRA does not apply to Great West, because the NMFRA's purpose applies to New Mexico residents, which Spina, Valley Express, and Great West are not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 3. They also assert that the NMFRA does not apply to commercial motor vehicles, so the NMFRA would not apply here, because the car at issue is a commercial motor vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 3-4 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2066-5-207\">\n    N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 66-5-207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D) ). Finally, Spina and Valley Express argue that\n   <em>\n    Raskob\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable, because, according to them, the Supreme Court of New Mexico held there that an insurer could be held liable if they issued a policy in accordance with the NMFRA, but here, the policy was not issued in accordance with the NMFRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     The Reply\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Walker replies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Reply to Defendants Gregory J. Spina's and Valley\n   Express, Inc.'s Response to Her Motion to Amend Her Complaint, filed February 20, 2018 (Doc. 26)(\"Reply\"). She asserts that\n   <em>\n    Raskob\n   </em>\n   allows Great West's joinder, notwithstanding the NMFRA, because \" 'where the insurance coverage is mandated by law for the benefit of the public, generally the insurance company is a proper party.' \" Reply at 1-2 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Raskob\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"827419\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/126/394/\">\n    1998-NMSC-045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"827419\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/126/394/\">\n    126 N.M. 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"827419\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/126/394/\">\n    970 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   581 ). She argues that, because the rights of persons injured in automobile accidents are determined under the law where the accident happened, New Mexico law applies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 2. Thus, according to Walker, \"if insurance coverage for the Valley vehicle Spina was driving is mandated by law, benefits the public and no language of the law expresses an intent to deny joinder, Walker may join Great West as a defendant.\" Reply at 2. She concludes that, even if the NMFRA does not apply, North Dakota and federal law require insurance to cover the vehicle driven, so\n   <em>\n    Raskob\n   </em>\n   applies and Great West is a proper defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     The Hearing\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court held a hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 1:5-6 (Court). Walker argued that\n   <em>\n    Raskob\n   </em>\n   is on all fours, so Great West's joinder is proper and the Court should grant leave to amend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 2:19-4:2 (Ayala). Spina and Valley Express countered that\n   <em>\n    Raskob\n   </em>\n   cannot cover this case, because\n   <em>\n    Raskob\n   </em>\n   analyzes the NMFRA, which, according to Spina and Valley Express, does not apply here, because the NMFRA targets New Mexico residents, whereas Spina and Valley Express are North Dakota residents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 6:13-17 (Beaulieu);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:11-13 (\"[T]he Raskob opinion and analysis is very specific to the New Mexico Laws [such] that the overbreadth of language would be in reference to those laws.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15:17-16:16 (Beaulieu, Court). They also argue that Great West is not a proper party, because Walker is not in privity with Great West.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 7:1-2 (Beaulieu). Spina and Valley Express conceded, however, that both New Mexico and North Dakota law mandate insurance coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 9:2-4 (Beaulieu, Court). The Court commented that\n   <em>\n    Raskob\n   </em>\n   appears to be saying that, \"if the insurance coverage is mandated, then the insurance company is a proper party.\" Tr. at 9:19-21 (Court). The Court noted that there might be good reasons to create exceptions to the\n   <em>\n    Raskob\n   </em>\n   rule, but that the Supreme Court of New Mexico, not a federal court sitting in diversity, ought to address those reasons in the first instance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 10:18-21 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Spina and Valley Express contended that, should the Court allow the amendment, it would request a bifurcation, separating Great West from the rest of the matter, because there is not a direct cause of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 12:24-13:4 (Beaulieu). Should the Court determine that there is a direct cause of action here, Spina and Valley Express argued that a bifurcation would still be proper, because they would be prejudiced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 13:11-19 (Beaulieu). Walker agreed that there should be bifurcation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 14:4-7 (Ayala).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     LAW REGARDING RULE 12(b)(6)\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Rule 12(b)(6) authorizes a court to dismiss a complaint for \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Fed.

The Complaint's sufficiency is a question of law, and, when considering a rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court must accept as true all well-pled factual allegations in the complaint, view those allegations in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and\n   draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tellabs, Inc. v.

If the Court adheres too rigidly to Tenth Circuit case law, ignoring changes undergone by a state's law in the ensuing years, then parties litigating state-law claims will be subject to a different body of substantive law, depending on whether they litigate in state court or federal court. This result frustrates the purpose of\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , which held that federal courts must apply state court interpretations of state law, rather than their own, in part so that parties achieve a consistent result regardless of the forum. This consideration pulls the Court toward according Tenth Circuit precedent less weight and according state court decisions issued in the ensuing years more weight. On the other hand, when the state law is unclear, it is desirable for there to at least be uniformity among federal judges as to its proper interpretation. Otherwise, different federal judges within the same circuit-or even the same district, as district courts' decisions are not binding, even upon themselves-would be free to adopt differing interpretations of a state's law. This consideration pulls the Court towards a stronger respect for vertical stare decisis, because a Tenth Circuit decision on point-regardless whether it accurately reflects state law-at least provides consistency at the federal level, so long as federal district judges are required to follow it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    The Court must decide how to weigh Tenth Circuit case law against more-recent state court decisions, choosing a point on the spectrum between the two extremes: rigidly adhering to Tenth Circuit precedent unless there is intervening case law directly on point from the state's highest court, on one end; and independently interpreting the state law, regarding the Tenth Circuit precedent as no more than persuasive authority, on the other. In striking this balance, the Court notes that it is generally more concerned about systemic inconsistency between the federal courts and the state courts than it is about inconsistency among federal judges. Judges, even those within a jurisdiction with ostensibly identical governing law, sometimes interpret and apply the law differently from one another; this inconsistency is part and parcel of a common-law judicial system. More importantly, litigants seeking to use forum selection to gain a substantive legal advantage cannot easily manipulate such inconsistency: cases are assigned randomly to district judges in this and many federal districts; and, regardless, litigants cannot know for certain how a given judge will interpret the state law, even if they could determine the identity of the judge pre-filing or pre-removal. All litigants know in advance is that whomever federal district judge they are assigned will look to the entirety of the state's common law in making his or her determination-the same as a state judge would. Systemic inconsistency between the federal courts and state courts, on the other hand, not only threatens the principles of federalism, but litigants may more easily manipulate the inconsistency. When the Tenth Circuit issues an opinion interpreting state law, and the state courts subsequently shift away from that interpretation, litigants-if the district courts strictly adhere to the Tenth Circuit opinion-have a definite substantive advantage in choosing the federal forum over the state forum, or vice versa.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The Court further notes that district courts may be in a better position than the Tenth Circuit to be responsive to changes in state law. Tenth Circuit decisions interpreting a particular state's law on a specific issue are further apart in time than the collective district courts' decisions are. More importantly, the Tenth Circuit does not typically address such issues with the frequency that the state's courts themselves do. Accordingly, Tenth Circuit precedent can lag behind state law developments-developments that the district courts may be nimble enough to perceive and adopt. Additionally, much of the benefit of having a consistent Tenth Circuit-wide interpretation of a particular state's law is wasted. Other than Oklahoma, every state encompassed by the Tenth Circuit contains only one federal judicial district, and there is relatively little need for federal judges in Wyoming and Kansas to have a uniform body of New Mexico law to which to look. Last, the Court notes, respectfully, that district courts may be in a better position than the Tenth Circuit to develop expertise on the state law of the state in which they sit. Every federal judicial district in the nation, except the District of Wyoming, covers at most one state. It is perhaps a more workable design for each district court to keep track of legal developments in the state law of its own state(s) than it is for the Tenth Circuit to monitor separate legal developments in eight states. The Tenth Circuit used to follow this rationale in applying a clearly erroneous standard of review to district judge decisions of state law with no controlling state Supreme Court precedent.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Weiss v. United States\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1560510\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/787/518/#p525\">\n     787 F.2d 518\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 525 (10th Cir. 1986) ;\n    <em>\n     Rawson v.

Since the mid-1980s, however, the Tenth Circuit has abandoned that rationale and applied a de novo standard of review to district judge decisions applying state law with no governing state Supreme Court precedent.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Rawson v.

The Court regrets the Tenth Circuit's retreat from the clearly erroneous standard.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Having outlined the relevant considerations, the Court thinks the proper stance on vertical stare decisis in the context of federal court interpretations of state law is as follows: the Tenth Circuit's cases are binding as to their precise holding-what the state law was on the day the opinion was published-but lack the positive precedential force that its cases interpreting a federal statute or the Constitution of the United States of America possess. A district court considering a state law issue after the publication of a Tenth Circuit opinion on point may not come to a contrary conclusion based\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    on state court cases available to and considered by the Tenth Circuit, but it may come to such a conclusion based on intervening state court cases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    When interpreting state law, the Tenth Circuit does not and cannot issue a case holding that\n    <em>\n     x\n    </em>\n    is the law in New Mexico; it holds that the\n    <em>\n     proper interpretation\n    </em>\n    of New Mexico law, at the time the opinion is released, is\n    <em>\n     x\n    </em>\n    . Its holdings are descriptive, not prescriptive-interpretive, not normative. Because federal judicial opinions lack independent substantive force on state law issues, but possess such force regarding federal law issues, the Court thinks the following is not an unfair summary of the judicial interpretive process: (i) when interpreting federal law, the federal appellate courts consider the existing body of law, and then issue a holding that both reflects and influences the body of law; that holding subsequently becomes a part of the body of law; but (ii) when interpreting state law, the federal appellate courts consider the existing body of law, and then issue a holding that only reflects the body of law; that holding does not subsequently become a part of the body of law. The federal district courts are bound to conclude that the Tenth Circuit's reflection of the then-existing body of law was accurate. The question is whether they should build a doctrine atop the case and use the existence of the Tenth Circuit's case to avoid any responsibility to independently consider the whole body of state law that exists when the time comes that diversity litigants raise the issue in their courtrooms. Giving such effect to the Tenth Circuit's interpretations of state law is at tension with\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , giving independent substantive effect to federal judicial decisions-\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , applying federal law-in a case brought in diversity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    The purpose of\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    is well-known and simple, and the Court should not complicate it beyond recognition: it is that the same substantive law governs litigants' cases regardless whether they are brought in a federal or state forum. For simplicity's sake, most courts have settled on the formulation that \"the federal court must attempt to predict how the states' highest court would rule if confronted with the issue.\"\n    <em>\n     Moore's\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 124.22[3] (citing\n    <em>\n     Comm'r v.

This statement may not be the most precise formulation if the goal is to ensure identical outcomes in state and federal court-the Honorable Milton I. Shadur, United States District Judge, looks to state procedural rules to determine in which state appellate circuit the suit would have been filed were it not in federal court, and then applies the state law as that circuit court interprets it,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Abbott Laboratories v.

Ill. 1983) (noting that the approach of predicting the state supreme court's holdings will often lead to litigants obtaining a different result in federal court than they would in state court, where only the law of the circuit in which they filed-and certainly not nonexistent, speculative state supreme court law-governs)-but it is a workable solution that has achieved consensus.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Allstate Ins.

This formulation, built out of ease-of-use, does not relieve courts of their Supreme Court-mandated obligation to consider state appellate and trial court decisions. To the contrary, even non-judicial writings by influential authors, statements by state supreme court justices, the closeness of the vote on a prior case addressing the issue, and personnel changes on the court-considerations that would never inform a federal court's analysis of federal law-may validly come into play. The question is whether the district courts must abdicate, across-the-board, the \"would decide\" aspect of the\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    analysis to their parent appellate courts when the Court of Appeals has declared an interpretation of state law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    The\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    doctrine results in federal cases that interpret state law withering with time. While cases interpreting federal law become more powerful over time-forming the groundwork for doctrines, growing upward from one application (Congress may create a national bank) to many (Congress may set quotas on wheat-growing for personal consumption), expanding outward from the general (states must grant criminal jury trials) to the specific (the jury need not be twelve people, nor must it be unanimous)-federal cases interpreting state law often become stale. New state court cases-even when not directly rebuking the federal court's statement of law-alter the common-law legal landscape with their dicta, their insinuations, and their tone. The Supreme Court, which picks its cases sparingly and for maximum effect, almost never grants certiorari to resolve issues of state law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The Court's views on\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , of course, mean little if the Tenth Circuit does not agree. In\n    <em>\n     Wankier v. Crown Equipment Corp.\n    </em>\n    , the Tenth Circuit said that,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n    [w]here no controlling state decision exists, the federal court must attempt to predict what the state's highest court would do. In performing this ventriloquial function, however, the federal court is bound by ordinary principles of\n    <em>\n     stare decisis\n    </em>\n    . Thus, when a panel of this Court has rendered a decision interpreting state law, that interpretation is binding on district courts in this circuit, and on subsequent panels of this Court, unless an intervening decision of the state's highest court has resolved the issue.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    <em>\n     Wankier v.

From this passage, it seems clear the Tenth Circuit permits a district court to deviate from its view of state law only on the basis of a subsequent case \"of the state's highest court.\"\n    <em>\n     The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language\n    </em>\n    1402 (William Morris ed., New College ed. 1976)(defining \"unless\" as \"[e]xcept on the condition that; except under the circumstances that\"). A more aggressive reading of the passage-namely the requirement that the intervening case \"resolv[e] the issue\"-might additionally compel the determination that any intervening case law must definitively and directly contradict the Tenth Circuit interpretation in order to be considered \"intervening.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    It is difficult to know whether Judge McConnell's limitation of \"intervening decision\" to cases from the highest state court was an oversight or intentional.
