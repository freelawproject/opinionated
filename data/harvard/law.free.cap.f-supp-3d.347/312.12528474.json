When the officers reached the DPW headquarters, two DPW supervisors showed them a photograph of a torso with a gun tucked into the waist-band of a pair of jeans. Therssen BodyCam at 3:23; Def. Ex. 2. The torso in the photograph was tattooed with a distinctive cartoon doll. Def. Ex. 2. The picture also reveals that the subject of the photograph is wearing a blue braided belt and a green safety vest.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The supervisors told the officers where to find the employee who was alleged to be carrying a pistol, and noted that she would \"probably [be] wearing a backpack.\" Therssen BodyCam at 11:03. The officers then drove to the public park where Defendant Williams was working. When Ms. Williams approached the officers and identified herself, Officer Therssen immediately frisked her by pulling up her shirt and turning her around.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at. 25:10-20. Upon finding no weapon, he asked, \"Where's that weapon you had on you?\" Ms. Williams replied, \"I never had no weapon on me.\" The officer then asked, \"where's your backpack?\" and Ms. Williams replied, \"I don't have no backpack with me.\" Id at. 25:17. She then pulled up her shirt to demonstrate he had no gun on her person, revealing a blue braided belt and a tattoo of a similar size and shape as the one in the photograph.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at. 25:29; Def.

She told the officers she took the bus to work but was then corrected by Ms. Hill, who said that she took the bus to the DPW yard but then drove to the worksite at the park. Jones Bodycam 2 at 1:00. Upon being asked which car was Ms. Williams,' Ms. Hill pointed at one of the parked trucks and exclaimed, \"she drives it, it one of the pickups...the one right there.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Officer Therssen then walked over to the truck, opened the front door, and searched the driver's compartment.

Gov't Ex. C. The Government argued at the hearing that such an expectation of privacy cannot lie in contraband, but this position fails to appreciate the core Fourth Amendment principle that illegal searches do not become legal just because contraband is recovered from a person's personal effects.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8918520\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/426/838/#p848\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To accept this contention would be to say that the ends justify the means, which is the antithesis of the exclusionary rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   There is a question of whether, by denying that she had a backpack with her, Ms. Williams abandoned the backpack and with it her Fourth Amendment standing.

But there is no reason to think lying about the whereabouts or existence of a container would constitute abandonment. However, Ms. Williams' denial of having a backpack \"with her\" was ambiguous, especially given the distance between the stop-and-frisk and the vehicle. Critically, at no point during that encounter did she disclaim ownership over the backpack in the vehicle. Ms. Williams therefore has standing to challenge the search of her backpack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    II.

The officer's guess that the gun would be in the backpack turned out to be a good one, but it was not supported by the tip from which the Government seeks to prove probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Second, an uncorroborated anonymous tip cannot provide officers with probable cause.\n   <em>\n    Padro,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7411040\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/52/120/#p122\">\n    52 F.3d at 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The informant's anonymity and failure to state the basis of her knowledge severely undercuts the reliability of the information.\"). Here, the cell-phone photograph relied on three assertions from an unknown third party: that the figure in the photograph is Ms. Williams, that the photograph was taken that day, and that the photograph\n   represented an actual concealed carry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   There was no tip that the gun was in her backpack. By the time they reached the police, those assertions had passed up the chain of command to the DPW Human Resources Department and back down again to the supervisors who met the officers in the yard. Therssen BodyCam 3:21-3:54. The supervisors' statements to the officers made no distinction between the contents of the tip and their own personal assumptions. By the time the officers received the tip they had no way of knowing how it compared to version relayed by the original tipster.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7411040\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/52/120/#p122\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   An anonymous tip alleging what might only be workplace misconduct, paraphrased by an indeterminate number of intermediaries, cannot provide the high level of reliability demanded by\n   <em>\n    Padro\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Third, the anonymous tip is unsupported by sufficient indicia of reliability. Anonymous tips may establish probable cause when they are corroborated by the facts on the scene.\n   <em>\n    Padro,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7411040\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/52/120/#p122\">\n    52 F.3d at 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that tips become credible when they accurately predict \"future actions of third parties not easily predicted\"). Here, rather than corroborating the tip, the officers' initial investigation of the scene undermined the tipster's assertion that the photograph was taken earlier that day. No gun was found on Ms. Williams' person. Even if the officers had reasonable suspicion to frisk her based on the tip, such suspicion diminished once they discovered that Ms. Williams was not carrying a pistol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   There was no showing that the police could not have secured the scene and sought a warrant to search the backpack. However, they may have recognized that they did not have sufficient probable cause to convince a magistrate judge to issue such a warrant. Indeed, the search of the vehicle and the backpack within was unsupported by probable cause, and the warrantless search of Defendant's backpack was therefore illegal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The officers' conduct was of the sort the exclusionary rule is designed to deter. They made a deliberate decision to circumvent the warrant requirement. Evidence ascertained from the search of the backpack will therefore be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendant's Motion to Suppress Evidence [17] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    It is unclear from the Record whether the officers had probable cause, or even a suspicion, that Ms. Williams was a felon. Openly carrying a firearm is legal in Michigan. The Government made much of the fact that DPW did not permit its employees to carry firearms, but police officers are not empowered to undertake warrantless searches to enforce work-place requirements.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
