Bianco, United States District Judge\n   Plaintiff Elk Associates Funding Corporation (\"Elk\"), by and through its court-appointed receiver, the U.S. Small Business Administration (\"the SBA,\" and as receiver for Elk, \"plaintiff\"), brings this action against former Elk officers and directors Michael Feinsod, Silvia Mullens, Richard Feinstein, Gary Granoff, Steven Etra, John Laird, Ivan J. Wolpert, Howard Sommer, Murray Indick, Elliott Singer, and Peter Boockvar (collectively, \"defendants\") for breach of fiduciary duty,\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   acts, waste of assets, conversion, negligence, aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty, civil conspiracy, and gross negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Presently before the Court are defendants' motions to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants the motions in part and denies the motions in part. More specifically, defendants' motions to dismiss are granted as to plaintiff's claim for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, and defendants Feinsod's, Feinstein's, and Mullens' motions to dismiss are granted as to plaintiff's claim for conspiracy. Defendants' motions to dismiss are denied in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A. Facts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court takes the following facts from the complaint (ECF No. 1), unless indicated otherwise herein. The Court assumes these facts to be true in deciding the motion to dismiss, and construes them in the light most favorable to plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   1. Regulatory Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (\"SBIA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20661\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   was enacted to stimulate the national economy by promoting small businesses in need of financing.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20661\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To that end, the SBIA authorizes the SBA to license small business investment companies (\"SBICs\") to invest in qualified small businesses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20661\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 681. The SBA then makes favorable loans to the SBICs for investment in the small businesses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20661\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 683, 685. SBICs also receive funding from private parties. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Section 687(c) of the SBIA authorizes the SBA to enact regulations governing SBICs. These regulations are codified at Title 13 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 107. The following two regulations are relevant to this action:\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20107.730\">\n    13 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 107.730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 107.885.

The Parties\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Elk, a New York corporation, became licensed as an SBIC on July 24, 1980. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 26.) Elk's Certificate of Incorporation states that \"[t]he corporation is organized and chartered solely for the purpose of performing the functions and conducting the activities contemplated under the Small Business Act of 1958, as amended from time to time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants are former officers and directors of Elk. Defendants Feinsod, Feinstein, and Mullens served as officers of Elk. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-13.) Feinsod also served as a director of Elk, and Feinstein participated in Board of Director meetings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 128.) Defendants Granoff, Etra, Laird, Wolpert, Sommer, Indick, Singer, and Boockvar (collectively, \"the Independent Director defendants\") served as directors of Elk, but did not hold management roles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-21.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants, as Elk's officers and directors, were required to undergo a background check and submit a Statement of Personal History (Form 182) to the SBA, in which defendants acknowledged that they were providing the information \"for the purpose of determining [their] eligibility for the Small Business Investment Company Program.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   3. Elk and the SBA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In September 1993, Elk received a loan from the SBA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) In connection with the loan, Elk and the SBA entered into several agreements, which the complaint refers to as the \"SBA Security Agreement,\" the \"SBA Agreement,\" the \"Intercreditor Agreement,\" and the \"Custodian Agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-40, 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Custodian Agreement appointed Israel Discount Bank (\"IDB\") as custodian of Elk's assets for the benefit of the SBA and the other private lenders. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.) Pursuant to the Custodian Agreement, Elk was required to assign and deliver to IDB \"Custodian Collateral,\" including Elk's \"notes, security agreements, financing statements, assignments of financing statements, and other instruments and securities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45-46.) Elk had the discretion to sell its \"interest in any note or other evidence of indebtedness,\" as long as it delivered to IDB a \"written certification\" that the net proceeds from such sale would be used immediately to pay down Elk's \"Senior Indebtedness.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.) However, in the event that Elk intended to use the net sale proceeds for another purpose, Elk was required to provide the SBA and the other lenders advance notice of the proposed sale and an opportunity to object. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   4. Elk and Ameritrans\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In 1998, Elk was reorganized as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ameritrans Capital\n   Corporation (\"Ameritrans\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20107.730\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20107.730\">\n    \u00b6 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Ameritrans was not licensed as an SBIC, and, therefore, had \"greater flexibility in its investment and lending business activities than the investment policies of Elk.\" (Decl. of Justin Shur in Supp. of Defs. Omnibus Mot. (\"Shur Decl.\") Ex. A at 9, ECF No. 47-2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Elk sought approval from the SBA and the SEC to reorganize as a wholly-owned subsidiary under Ameritrans. (Compl. \u00b6 61; Shur Decl. Exs. B-D.) In order to secure SEC approval, Elk and Ameritrans filed an application for an order granting certain exemptions from SEC regulations that might otherwise apply. (Shur Decl. Exs. B, C.) In the application, Elk and Ameritrans detailed how the corporations would be organized. Specifically, the application disclosed that Elk and Ameritrans would operate as \"one company\" (Shur Decl. Ex. C at 14); that \"Ameritrans [would] engage directly and/or through its principal subsidiary [Elk] primarily in the business of making loans to small businesses\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5); and that the companies would share a Board of Directors (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The application also sought exemptions to allow the following transactions: (1) \"making of loans or advances by any of Elk or any Future Subsidiary to Ameritrans or to any other of Elk or any Future Subsidiary,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18); (2) \"lending of money or other property by Elk ... to Ameritrans or another Subsidiary\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 30); (3) \"borrowing of money or other property by Ameritrans from Elk\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ); and (4) financial reporting by \"Ameritrans, Elk, and Future ... Subsidiaries ... on a consolidated basis\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The SBA approved Ameritrans' acquisition of Elk on September 21, 1999, after receiving confirmation that Elk's assets could not be used to collateralize any indebtedness to Ameritrans. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 61-67.) On December 7, 1999, the SEC granted the application for exemptions. (Shur Decl. Ex. D.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants, aside from Mullens and Feinstein, served as directors of Ameritrans (Feinstein participated in meetings). (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13-21, 128.) Defendants, aside from Feinstein and Indick, were also shareholders of Ameritrans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, 14-18, 20-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   5. Financial Difficulties and Alleged Improper Transactions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Following the Great Recession, Elk and Ameritrans faced financial difficulties. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20107.730\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20107.730\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 84-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Board of Director meeting minutes in 2009 reflect that Ameritrans, in particular, was suffering, and that the directors recognized that SBA funding was critical to Ameritrans' survival. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20107.730\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) For example, minutes from a May 26, 2009 meeting indicate that defendant Sommer asked whether \"it was correct that there were two scenarios for Ameritrans: (i) with SBA financing of Elk, Ameritrans would have various alternatives; or (ii) without SBA funding there was only an Ameritrans liquidation scenario\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87), to which defendant Feinsod responded that, without an SBA leverage commitment, Ameritrans would look for merger opportunities before proceeding to liquidate (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In September 2009, the SBA approved a commitment of $9,175,000 for Elk. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20107.730\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20107.730\">\n    \u00b6 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Elk took the SBA funds in one draw in December 2009. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After learning that the SBA had approved additional funding for Elk, defendant Etra helped facilitate a private placement for Ameritrans. Elk issued approximately $3 million in notes (\"the Etra-affiliated notes\"), including $650,000 to Etra personally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 93-96; Decl. of Keith R. Murphy in Supp. of Etra Mot. (\"Murphy Decl.\") Ex. B, ECF No. 33-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Starting in or around this time, in 2009, Ameritrans also received significant financial support from Elk, including through (1) Elk's payment of Ameritrans' expenses; (2) cash transfers; and (3) a $4.5 million board-approved loan. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 82, 97-158.) More specifically, from 2009 until 2013, when the SBA took over as receiver, Elk paid $7,491,139 of Ameritrans' expenses and transferred Ameritrans $6,779,898 in cash (including the above-mentioned loan), ultimately depleting Elk's bank account to $17,415.85. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 73, 82, 153.) These transactions form the bases of plaintiff's causes of action. Plaintiff alleges that defendants \"repeatedly and improperly used Elk's funds to operate and conduct business for the benefit of Ameritrans and its shareholders\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78) and gave Ameritrans over $14 million \"for no consideration\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82). Plaintiff alleges that Elk was insolvent as of December 31, 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105.) The Court discusses each transaction in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   a. Alleged Improper Payment of Expenses\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   After Elk received SBA funding in 2009, Elk's payment of Ameritrans' expenses increased, while reimbursements from Ameritrans decreased. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97.) Elk's financial statements filed with the SBA (\"Form 468s\"), as well as Elk's general ledger, reflect that Ameritrans' liability to Elk grew from $418,595 in 2009 to $10,901,847 in 2012, the majority of the liabilities being unpaid expenses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 100-09.) In the last nine months of 2012, Elk also paid an additional $2,800,000 of Ameritrans' expenses without any reimbursement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 110.) Further, between April 1, 2013 and April 24, 2013, defendants \"approved and/or caused Elk to pay an additional $226,043 of Ameritrans' expenses with no consideration.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 153.) Ameritrans' last reimbursement to Elk was in 2011, for $38,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 120.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Form 468s, which reported the amount \"Due From Parent,\" were certified by defendants Feinstein and Mullens, and were reviewed and approved by the other defendants. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20107.730\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20107.730\">\n    \u00b6 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Shur Decl. Exs. P, T.) Ameritrans' Form 10-K filings with the SEC in 2010, 2011, and 2012, which reported that Ameritrans had not operated at a profit in recent years and anticipated incurring a loss in the next year, were also approved by the Board of Directors. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 112-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   b. Alleged Improper Loan and Cash Transfers\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Elk also transferred cash directly to Ameritrans to pay Ameritrans' debts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 121.) The alleged improper transfers started in early 2012, and reached $6,779,898 by April 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The complaint connects the alleged improper cash transfers to two events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   First, in January 2012, Ameritrans' bank account balance fell to approximately $15,000.

DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   A. Applicable Law\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   As an initial matter, the parties dispute to what extent the Court can rely on defendants' alleged violation of the SBIA and its regulations to support plaintiff's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As noted, plaintiff brings causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty,\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   acts, waste of assets, conversion, negligence,\n   aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty, civil conspiracy, and gross negligence. The parties agree that plaintiff's claims are governed by New York law in the first instance. Plaintiff, however, references defendants' alleged violations of the SBIA throughout its complaint, and appears to argue that such violations give rise to defendants' liability in this action. In particular, plaintiff asserts that Section 687f of the SBIA establishes that defendants are personally liable for their violations of the SBIA and its regulations, and that defendants owe fiduciary duties to Elk. To the extent that plaintiff contends that the alleged SBIA violations (by themselves) establish liability, the Court rejects that assertion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   There is no private right of action for a violation of the SBIA or its regulations.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Fid. Capital Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10545482\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/920/827/\">\n    920 F.2d 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 838 n.39 (11th Cir. 1991) (citing\n   <em>\n    Goodall v.

Instead, Congress provided that the SBIA would be enforced by the SBA, and delineated specific remedies under the statute (e.g., revocation of an SBIC license, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 687a, or removal or suspension of management,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5651836\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/374/1324/#p1330\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 687e). Accordingly, although defendants' alleged violations of the SBIA and its regulations might be relevant for purposes of establishing that defendants committed the asserted torts, a \"violation of the[ ] regulations, in and of themselves, does not give rise to liability.\"\n   <em>\n    SBA v. Echevarria\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7848896\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/864/1254/#p1260\">\n    864 F.Supp. 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1260 (S.D. Fla. 1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Court also disagrees with plaintiff's argument that the SBIA establishes that defendants owed fiduciary duties to Elk. As written, Section 687f simply provides that it is unlawful under the SBIA to breach one's fiduciary duty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 687f(b) (\"It shall be unlawful for any officer [or] director ... to engage in any act or practice, or to omit any act, in breach of his fiduciary duty as such officer [or] director.\").

Plaintiff alleges that defendants breached their fiduciary duties to Elk by causing Elk to enter into the alleged unlawful transactions (paying over $7 million of Ameritrans' expenses, issuing the $4.5 million loan to Ameritrans, and transferring additional cash to Ameritrans) for no consideration; aware that Ameritrans could not repay Elk; and for the improper purpose of using Elk's assets to pay Ameritrans' expenses and debts before Elk faced liquidation by the SBA, all of which wrongly \"put the interests of Ameritrans and of themselves ahead of the interest of Elk to the financial detriment of Elk.\" (Compl. \u00b6 193;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 82, 87, 111-17, 120-27, 137-38, 153-57, 192.) These allegations are sufficient to plausibly allege that defendants lacked good faith as to Elk and acted with the improper purpose of paying Ameritrans' expenses and debts, and, therefore, are sufficient to rebut the business judgment rule at this juncture.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Defendants argue that Elk's payment of Ameritrans' expenses does not suggest bad faith because Elk and Ameritrans operated as \"one company,\" with \"shared 'administrative costs,' \" and \"Elk did not simply gift Ameritrans these amounts-it accounted for them as debt Ameritrans was to repay to Elk once it was able.\" (Defs. Omnibus Mot. 15, ECF No. 47-1.) However, defendants overlook the fact that, once Elk became insolvent, defendants' duties shifted to preserving Elk's assets for the benefit of its creditors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Magnesium Corp. of Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3290217\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/399/722/#p773\">\n    399 B.R. at 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (When subsidiary is insolvent, its officers and directors \"must then look to the needs and concerns of the subsidiaries ..., and must take into account, in any corporate decision-making, the fact that creditors will have a superior claim to corporate assets.\"). Accordingly, defendants cannot simply rely on Elk's and Ameritrans' corporate structure to avoid liability, particularly where, as here, the allegations indicate that Elk began paying a disproportionate share of the expenses. Moreover, how defendants accounted for the payments is not dispositive; the complaint plausibly alleges that defendants knew that Ameritrans could not reimburse Elk, as supported by the alleged facts that Ameritrans was dependent on Elk's receipt of SBA funding in 2009; Ameritrans' financial condition continued to decline each year thereafter; and Ameritrans' last reimbursement to Elk was in 2011, for only $38,000. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 82-91, 97, 100-17, 120.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Independent Director defendants separately argue that the complaint fails to allege that they were involved with the allocation of expenses. The Court disagrees. The complaint alleges that all defendants, including the Independent Director\n   defendants, \"approved and/or caused Elk to pay $7,491,139 of Ameritrans' expenses.\" (\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82.) Moreover, the Form 468s, which documented the amount due to Elk from Ameritrans, state that the Elk board \"reviewed and approved\" those financial reports. (Shur Decl. Exs. P, T.) Accepting the allegations in the complaint as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiff's favor, plaintiff has plausibly alleged the Independent Director defendants' involvement in Elk's payment of Ameritrans' expenses, and, for the reasons just discussed, these allegations are sufficient to withstand the Independent Director defendants' motions to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   With respect to the cash transfers, defendants claim that plaintiff \"does not explain what those transfers were, much less how they show bad faith.\" (Defs. Omnibus Mot. 16.) To the contrary, the complaint alleges that defendants caused Elk to transfer cash generated from the sale of identified Elk assets to Ameritrans, bypassing the Custodian Account, and receiving no consideration in return. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 126, 127, 140-52.) Further, defendants allegedly started transferring the cash after learning that the SBA was going to move Elk to its Office of Liquidation, and the transfers continued up until SBA was named as receiver. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 125, 140-52.) Thus, in essence, plaintiff contends that defendants' actions are \"explicable only by bad faith.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    KDW Restructuring &amp; Liquidation Servs. LLC v.

More specifically, defendants argue that the special board meeting where the directors approved the loan demonstrates that defendants acted in good faith and with adequate process, and that any arguments to the contrary constitute improper second-guessing of their business decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Court disagrees that plaintiff's claim regarding the intercompany loan is barred by the business judgment rule at this juncture. This is not a situation where plaintiff, in hindsight, is simply second-guessing defendants' good faith business judgments as to Elk. Instead, the complaint alleges that, at the time defendants approved the loan, defendants acted with the improper purpose of paying Ameritrans' debts before Elk's assets were liquidated by the SBA, while aware that Ameritrans could not repay Elk.

Accordingly, defendants argue that any claim under New York Business Corporation Law \u00a7 203 similarly must apply the business judgment rule, which would require plaintiff to plead that defendants knowingly violated SBIA regulations in order to state a claim. In response, plaintiff argues that \u00a7 203(a)(2) does not require plaintiff to plead a knowing violation of the law, and that\n   <em>\n    Grasso\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable because New York's Not-For-Profit Corporation Law is a separate statutory scheme, with different policy purposes and legal analyses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Defendants also argue that plaintiff has failed to allege that defendants breached the SBIA regulations. Defendants note that Section 107.730 provides that SBICs that receive an SEC exemption do not need the SBA's approval of the transaction as long as they promptly notify the SBA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20107.730\">\n    13 C.F.R. \u00a7 107.730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). Defendants argue that they fall under this exception because Elk received an exemption from the SEC and the Form 468s constitute notice to the SBA. With respect to Section 107.750, defendants argue that this provision is inapplicable because it refers to the \"sale\" of assets, and plaintiff alleges that the transactions were loans, not sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Here, the Court concludes that plaintiff has plausibly alleged that defendants knowingly violated the SBIA regulations. Accordingly, the Court need not, and does not, determine whether the business judgment rule applies to claims under \u00a7 203.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Although defendants argue that they did not violate the SBIA regulations, based on the pleadings, the Court cannot conclude at this juncture as a matter of law that the transactions were in full compliance with the regulations. For example, defendants argue that they were exempt from seeking SBA approval under \u00a7 107.730(f), however the Court is unable to conclude as a matter of law that the Form 468s constituted \"prompt notification\" as required under the regulation, and, even if they did, that defendants documented all of the alleged improper transactions in those forms (e.g., the cash transfers). As another example, defendants claim that they did not violate \u00a7 107.885 because the alleged unlawful transactions were loans, however, the Court is likewise unable to conclude based on the pleadings that the cash transfers do not fall under this provision. In addition, the Court determines that plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to establish that defendants' alleged violation of the regulations was knowing.

The complaint alleges that defendants authorized and facilitated the use of over $14 million of Elk's cash to pay Ameritrans' expenses and debts (including defendants' salaries and directors' fees) for no consideration, ultimately depleting Elk's bank account to $17,415.85 by April 24, 2013. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 153, 203-05.) Plaintiff has plausibly asserted that no interest of Elk could be served by these transactions, particularly when considering the fact that the loan and cash transfers began after defendants allegedly learned that the SBA was going to transfer Elk to its Office of Liquidation, and continued up until the days leading up to the SBA taking over as receiver.

Second, plaintiff plausibly alleges that defendants, without authorization, transferred Elk's cash to Ameritrans for the purpose of paying Ameritrans' expenses and debts, and therefore interfered with Elk's rights to that money. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 210-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Defendants argue that plaintiff's conversion claim fails because plaintiff has failed to allege defendants' \"unauthorized possession.\" The Court disagrees. As noted, plaintiff plausibly alleges that defendants' actions were unauthorized. In addition, the Court concludes that defendants' role in approving and facilitating the alleged unlawful expense payments and transfers is sufficient to establish defendants' \"dominion over the property or interference with it\" at this juncture. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Grossi\n   </em>\n   , the case upon which defendants rely, the court found that the plaintiff had stated a cause of action for conversion when the defendants \"exercised dominion and control over [plaintiff's] proceeds in such a\n   manner that the proceeds\n   <em>\n    were used to pay customers or creditors of\n   </em>\n   [a party] other than plaintiff.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"347505\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/227/841/\">\n    642 N.Y.S.2d at 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because plaintiff also alleges that each defendant owed a fiduciary duty to Elk, and because the Court concludes that plaintiff has plausibly alleged that defendants owed duties to Elk (and breached those duties), the Court dismisses plaintiff's aiding and abetting claim as duplicative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Transeo S.A.R.L. v.

The Court also notes that plaintiff appears to concede that its aiding and abetting claim is duplicative, stating in its opposition brief that, \"[t]o the extent that this Court determines that any one of the Defendants' actions was insufficient to constitute a breach of their own fiduciary duty, that Defendant is still liable for aiding and abetting the breach of fiduciary duty by the other Defendants, as all Defendants knowingly agreed to, and/or actively participated in, the defalcation of funds from Elk to Ameritrans.\" (Pl.

However, the Court concludes that plaintiff's allegations with respect to Mullens, and in particular plaintiff's allegations regarding her role in executing the cash transfers in 2012, are sufficient to state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty at this juncture. Mullens served as an officer of Elk and Ameritrans starting in 1996 and 1998, respectively (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12, 29-31); was a signatory on Elk's bank accounts (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 58); certified the Form 468s (\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 109); and was an active participant in each of the alleged unlawful cash transfers (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 129-36, 141, 145, 147, 152). Accordingly, although Mullens did not attend board meetings, the reasonable inferences drawn from the totality of plaintiff's allegations in the complaint would support a plausible claim that Mullens was aware of the financial conditions of Ameritrans and Elk; was familiar with the processes for selling Elk's assets; and therefore that Mullens' actions lacked good faith and a legitimate corporate purpose as to Elk.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    The Court also denies defendants' motions to dismiss plaintiff's claims for negligence and gross negligence.
