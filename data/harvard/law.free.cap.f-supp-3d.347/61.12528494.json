(\"Brookdale\" and collectively with the preceding named-plaintiffs, \"Plaintiffs\") brought this action against Johnson Controls Fire Protection Limited Partnership formerly known as Tyco SimplexGrinnell or SimplexGrinnell Limited Partnership (\"Defendant\") for breach of contract and negligence. Defendant moves to dismiss for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. For the reasons stated below, Defendant's motion (Docket No. 22) is\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      denied\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are taking from Plaintiffs' amended complaint and are assumed true at this stage in the litigation. (Docket No. 18). On November 19, 2015, Plaintiffs' insured, Brookdale, entered into a contract with the Defendant. The contract required Defendant to maintain and regularly inspect the sprinkler systems on Brookdale's property. In addition, the contract provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   To the fullest extent permitted by law, [SimplexGrinnell] shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless [Brookdale] ... from and against [ ] damages, losses and expenses, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of or resulting from performance of the Work, provided that the claim, damage, loss or expense is attributable to ... injury to or destruction of tangible property (other than the Work itself) but only to the extent caused by the negligent acts or omissions of [SimplexGrinnell.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Upon Plaintiffs' information and belief, prior to February 15, 2016, the sprinkler system required maintenance because a compressor was failing to properly pressurize the attic's dry sprinkler system. Defendant initially replaced the smaller compressor with a larger compressor in an attempt to rectify the problem. This larger compressor, however, also had a problem keeping the system pressurized. Defendant became aware that the compressor was not the cause of the problem and began looking for leaks in the attic's sprinkler system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On or about February 15, 2016, one of Defendant's technicians was at Brookdale's property. Upon Plaintiffs' information and belief, the technician was performing repairs related to the pressurization issue in the attic's sprinkler system. While the\n   technician was performing this work, a clapper valve in the dry system opened and released water into the system at a rate of 100 pounds per square inch. The technician subsequently allowed the sprinkler system to run for approximately nine minutes. As a result, a pipe fixture failed, which enabled water to escape into Brookdale's property causing extensive water damage. The fitting that failed evidenced signs of oxidation, caused by condensation which was permitted to accumulate inside the pipe by the dry sprinkler's defective pressurization system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the damage was caused by Defendant's failure to adequately maintain Brookdale's dry sprinkler system from known weather conditions then existing, namely low temperatures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A defendant may move to dismiss, based solely on the complaint, for a plaintiff's \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Fed.

Further, Plaintiffs note that \"[o]n or about November 19, 2015, the Insured and SimplexGrinnell entered into a contract entitled 'Service Contractor Agreement Between Brookdale Senior Living Inc., and Joes Lang Lasalle Americas, Inc. and SimplexGrinnell, L.P.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.

Plaintiffs, however, note that prior to and on the date of the incident that caused water damage, Defendant's technicians were performing services pursuant to the contract. At this stage in the litigation, this Court must draw all reasonable inferences in Plaintiffs' favor.\n   <em>\n    Fothergill v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3646786\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/566/248/#p251\">\n    566 F.3d 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 251 (1st Cir. 2009). Accordingly, the inference that Defendant would not have continued to perform on a contract that Plaintiffs had breached is certainly plausible, if not likely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Thus, I find that Plaintiffs have pled with plausibility the existence of a valid and binding contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    b. Defendant Breached the Contract\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that that the contract required Defendant \"to provide maintenance to, and regular inspections of, its sprinkler systems located on the Property.\" (Docket No. 18 \u00b6 17). Further, the contract provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   To the fullest extent permitted by law, [SimplexGrinnell] shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless [Brookdale] ... from and against [ ] damages, losses and expenses, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of or resulting from performance of the Work, provided that the claim, damage, loss or expense is attributable to ... injury to or destruction of tangible property (other than the Work itself) but only to the extent caused by the negligent acts or omissions of [SimplexGrinnell.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that Defendant was on notice of a problem with the sprinkler systems and it had previously failed to rectify them. Further, Plaintiffs note that on February 15, 2016, a technician was on Brookdale's property to perform repairs related to the pressurization issue in the attic's dry sprinkler system. Thereafter, catastrophic water loss occurred which caused extensive damage. Assuming Plaintiffs' allegations are true, Defendant failed to adequately perform its contractual duty to inspect and maintain the sprinkler systems. Consequently, there was clearly \"injury to or destruction of tangible property\" that was \"caused by the negligent acts or\n   omissions\" of Defendant. Therefore, Defendant had a contractual obligation to indemnify Brookdale for the damage, which it did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant points to\n   <em>\n    Doyle v. Hasbro, Inc.\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that a plaintiff must state the nature of an alleged contract with specificity in a breach claim.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"973\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/103/186/#p195\">\n    103 F.3d 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 195 (1st Cir. 1996). Defendant argues that \"Plaintiffs' vague allegation\" that Defendant failed to indemnify Brookdale \"is precisely the 'conclusory' statement courts reject at the pleading stage because it lacks the requisite 'substantial certainty' regarding each parties' contractual rights and obligations.\" (Docket No. 23 at 6). In\n   <em>\n    Doyle\n   </em>\n   , however, the court noted that there was \"no presentation of the terms of a contract, its duration, or even when it was formed. Nor does the Amended Complaint explain what obligations were imposed on each of the parties by the alleged contract.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"973\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/103/186/#p195\">\n    103 F.3d at 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, the plaintiff in that case simply alleged that \"[Defendant] and its executives failed to meet their contractual requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"973\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/103/186/#p195\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Although Plaintiffs did not attach the entire contract to their Amended Complaint, they have made a presentation of the relevant terms, its duration, and when it was formed. Further, Plaintiffs have explained some of the obligations imposed on Defendant by the contract. This is a far cry from the insufficient pleadings in\n   <em>\n    Doyle\n   </em>\n   that failed to state a claim. Thus, I find that Plaintiffs have also plausibly pled that Defendant breached the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    c. Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs allege that as a result of Defendant's breach of contract and/or negligence, Brookdale's property incurred extensive water damage. The Plaintiff-insurers thereafter provided coverage to Brookdale for the loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   I find that Plaintiffs have plausibly pled that Defendant's breach caused Plaintiffs to incur damages. Therefore, Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled all of the elements of their breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    2. Negligence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"A party may set out 2 or more statements of a claim or defense alternatively or hypothetically, either in a single count or defense or in separate ones. If a party makes alternative statements, the pleading is sufficient if any one of them is sufficient.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(2). Here, Plaintiffs have pled both negligence and breach of contract claims arising out of the same general factual background.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant contends that its relationship with Plaintiffs was solely contractual and the alleged violation was of the contract, not of any common law duties. Defendant notes that Massachusetts courts have held that the breach of a contract, standing alone, does not support an independent tort cause of action.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

The Second Circuit, however, has established what seems to be the emerging consensus: \"The\n    <em>\n     Twombly\n    </em>\n    plausibility standard ... does not prevent a plaintiff from pleading facts alleged 'upon information and belief' (1) where the facts are peculiarly within the possession and control of the defendant, or (2) where the belief is based on factual information that makes the inference of culpability plausible.\"\n    <em>\n     Arista Records, LLC v.

Here, because much of the information pled with \"information and belief\" is within Defendant's possession and control, \"modest discovery may provide the missing link.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3627900\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/698/40/#p44\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3627900\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/698/40/#p44\">\n     at 45\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
