The primary issue is whether the 2-level enhancement for Abuse of a Position of Public or Private Trust applies when the Defendant Nancy Nunez used her Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) Government Purchase Card to obtain three Apple MacBook Pro laptop computers. The Court will sustain Nunez' Objection to the 2-level enhancement, because Nunez' discretion to make purchases was conditioned on her direct supervisor's express approval and, therefore, she lacked the substantial discretion inherent in a position of public or private trust.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The supervisor-approval requirement indicates that Nunez did not occupy a position of trust sufficient to satisfy the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit's standard for finding an abuse of a position of public or private trust. Thus,\n   the Court will not apply the 2-level increase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Section 3B1.3 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, entitled \"Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill,\" provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   If the defendant abused a position of public or private trust, or used a special skill, in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense, increase by 2 levels.

Such a requirement is an \"institutional constraint[ ]\" designed to limit the freedom to commit a difficult-to-detect wrong.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Queen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11937049\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/4/925/\">\n    4 F.3d at 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That the constraint failed to prevent Nunez' crime is irrelevant to the Court's analysis whether the position itself provided the freedom to commit the wrong; the Court finds that the job itself did not give that freedom. Thus, because Nunez' position required her supervisor's approval before making purchases, Nunez did not hold a position of trust sufficient to warrant a 2-level enhancement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the Objection to the 2-level enhancement in the Defendant Nancy Nunez's Objections to the Presentence Report, Motion for Reasonable Sentence and Sentencing Memorandum, filed September 14, 2018 (Doc. 15), is sustained.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
