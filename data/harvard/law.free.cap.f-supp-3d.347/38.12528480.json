ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   To address Concord's challenges to the indictment, it is necessary to first identify the \"lawful government functions\" that the defendants allegedly conspired to impair. In doing so, the Court \"must construe the indictment in light of its principal purposes of clarity and notice\" and will \"adhere to the indictment's plain language\" even if some \"language on which the government relies may point to possible ambiguities.\"\n   <em>\n    Hitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677970,11103180\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/249/1010/\">\n    249 F.3d at 1019-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The government has at times described the relevant function broadly, as \"regulat[ing] and monitor[ing] the participation of foreign nationals in the American electoral process,\" Hr'g Tr. at 29;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 31, 33, 35-36, 42, or \"promot[ing] transparency in the American political and electoral process,\" Hr'g Tr. at 49. Likewise, Concord has described the relevant function-to the extent one exists-as \"electoral processes,\" Def.'s Reply at 23, Dkt. 62, or \"administering an election,\" Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The text and structure of the indictment, however, point to a narrower set of functions. The indictment specifies the lawful government functions targeted by the conspiracy in two places: paragraph 9 and paragraphs 25 to 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Paragraph 9 serves as a capsule summary that distills the essence of the conspiracy and frames the allegations that follow.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment \u00b6 9. That paragraph-the heart of the conspiracy charge-alleges a conspiracy to impair three specific lawful functions of three specific agencies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It alleges that the defendants conspired to impair the functions of the FEC, DOJ, and DOS \"in\n   <em>\n    administering federal requirements for disclosure\n   </em>\n   of foreign involvement in certain domestic activities.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Later, in a subsection entitled \"Federal Regulatory Agencies,\" the indictment describes the relevant disclosure requirements in more detail.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-27. First, paragraph 25 explains that the FEC \"administers the Federal Election Campaign Act ('FECA'),\" which requires the reporting of certain independent expenditures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. Although this paragraph also mentions FECA's ban on foreign expenditures, it focuses on FEC's administration of FECA's \"reporting requirements,\" which, when followed, \"permit [the FEC] to fulfill its statutory duties of providing the American public with accurate data about the financial activities of individuals and entities supporting federal candidates, and enforcing FECA's limits and prohibitions, including the ban on foreign expenditures.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Second, paragraph 26 explains that DOJ \"administers the Foreign Agent Registration Act ('FARA'),\" which \"establishes a registration, reporting, and disclosure regime for agents of foreign principals.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. Finally, paragraph 27 explains that DOS issues \"non-immigrant visas\" to certain foreign nationals entering the United States and requires visa applicants to \"provide truthful information in response to questions on the visa application form.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Portions of the indictment arguably support a broader reading. For example, an introductory paragraph refers generally to the ban on certain foreign expenditures and the United States' interest in \"prevent[ing], disclos[ing], and counteract[ing] improper foreign influence on U.S. elections.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1. The indictment also contains allegations of conduct designed to \"avoid detection by U.S. regulators and law enforcement.\" Indictment \u00b6 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58. But this language cannot be fairly read to allege the impairment of government functions distinct from or broader than the disclosure regimes delineated in paragraphs 9 and 25 to 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In sum, the text and structure of the indictment reveal that the government functions targeted by the conspiracy are alleged solely to be the \"administ[ration]\" of \"federal requirements for disclosure.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. The Court will now consider Concord's challenges to the indictment based on that understanding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Failure to State an Offense Under \u00a7 371\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Section 371 prohibits two distinct types of conspiracies: (1) conspiracies \"to commit any offense against the United States\" and (2) conspiracies \"to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof[,] in any manner or for any purpose.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   Concord's view, that omission is dispositive: the indictment cannot accuse Concord of conspiring to obstruct lawful government functions \"without any identified or recognized statutory offense\" because a conspiracy conviction cannot be \"based strictly on lawful conduct\" even if that conduct is \"concealed from the government.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Concord is correct that the indictment must identify the lawful government functions at issue with some specificity.

Consistent with these principles, the Fifth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The government concedes that \u00a7 371 requires the specific intent to carry out the unlawful object of the agreement-in this case, the obstruction of lawful government functions. Gov't's Opp'n at 16 (\"Because Concord is charged with conspiring to defraud the United States, ... the requisite mental state is the intent of impairing, obstructing, or defeating the lawful function of any department of government through deception.\" (internal quotation marks omitted) ). Further, the government agrees that to form the intent to impair or obstruct a government function, one must first be aware of that function.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. at 40 (\"[Y]ou can't act with an intent to impair a lawful government function if you don't know about the lawful government function.\").

Here, as alleged in the indictment, the government must show that Concord knew that it was impairing the \"lawful functions\" of FEC, DOJ, or DOS \"in administering federal requirements for disclosure of foreign involvement in certain domestic activities.\" Indictment \u00b6 9.

A general knowledge that U.S. agencies are tasked with collecting the kinds of information the defendants agreed to withhold and conceal would suffice. Concord will have further opportunities-with jury instructions and in trial and post-trial motions, if any-to ensure that the government proves enough knowledge to support a specific intent to thwart at least one of the three government functions alleged in the indictment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment \u00b6 9.

But even if that is the case, it does not make a difference. Because the indictment charges a defraud-clause conspiracy and not an offense-based conspiracy, the government does not need to prove materiality. The false statements alleged are not relevant because they violate another criminal statute but because they are\n    <em>\n     deceptive\n    </em>\n    and intended to impair DOS's lawful function of \"administering federal requirements for disclosure of foreign involvement in certain domestic activities.\" Indictment \u00b6 9.
