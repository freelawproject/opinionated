BROWNING, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court on: (i) the Plaintiff Christus St. Vincent Regional Medical Center's Petition to Vacate Arbitration Award, filed April 13, 2017 (Doc. 1) (\"Petition\"); and (ii) the Defendant's Motion to Enforce Arbitration Award, filed April 27, 2017 (Doc. 9)(\"Motion\"). The Court held a hearing on January 19, 2018. The primary issues are: (i) whether the arbitration provisions in the Nurse Agreement between Christus St. Vincent Regional Medical Center &amp; District\n   1199 NM National Union of Hospital and Healthcare Employees AFSCME, AFL-CIO, October 15, 2014 to August 31, 2017 (Doc. 1-3) (\"CBA\")-which state that an arbitration award may be set aside under certain conditions-change the standard of review for arbitration awards, which the Supreme Court of the United States articulated in the\n   <em>\n    Steelworkers\n   </em>\n   Trilogy\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; (ii) whether the arbitrator, Michael S. Hill,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   exceeded his authority by ordering a fired employee reinstated; (iii) whether the arbitration award violates public policy by not disciplining an employee who allegedly violated the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-191,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20Stat.%201936\">\n    110 Stat. 1936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"HIPAA\"); and (iv) whether Plaintiff Christus St. Vincent Regional Medical Center's (\"St. Vincent\") claims were frivolous and brought in bad faith such that the Court should award attorneys' fees and costs. The Court concludes: (i) the CBA does not change the Court's standard of review, because the CBA's arbitration provisions restate traditional standard of review principles; (ii) the arbitrator did not exceed his authority, because the award draws from the CBA's essence; (iii) the award does not violate public policy, because there is no evidence that the employee violated HIPAA; and (iv) the Court will not award fees or costs, because St. Vincent did not pursue frivolous arguments or act in bad faith. Accordingly, the Court denies the Petition, and grants the Motion in part and denies it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   St. Vincent is a hospital in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petition \u00b6 1, at 1.

St. Vincent and the Hospital Union entered into the CBA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CBA at 1. The CBA states that St. Vincent has the \"exclusive discretion\" to execute certain actions, including \"[d]ecisions concerning the hiring, termination, assignment, transfer, demotion and promotion of associates,\" CBA \u00a7 7.1.12, at 7-8, and \"[d]ecisions concerning the counseling, reprimanding, discipline and discharge of associates for just cause with the specific understanding that any discipline must be for just cause and that the Union may grieve and arbitrate any such decisions,\" CBA \u00a7 7.1.16., at 8. The CBA establishes a progressive disciplinary process:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   The four (4) basic steps listed below will be followed for disciplinary action.

Argenbright was an active union member.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petition \u00b6 7, at 7 (stating that Argenbright was a \"Union Delegate\"). On May 16, 2015, Argenbright took a break from her work shift to enter the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (\"PACU\") area of Surgical Services and look through PACU's log books. Corrective Action Form at 1 (dated May 28, 2015) at 1, filed April 13, 2017 (Doc. 1-6)(\"Final Warning\"). Argenbright was searching for patient information relating to a grievance the Hospital Union filed on behalf of a recently terminated nurse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Warning at 1; Petition \u00b6 17, at 6. St. Vincent investigated the incident and determined that Argenbright's unauthorized entry into a secured area during her work shift to access confidential patient records on the Hospital Union's behalf is \"so egregious that it warrants skipping steps in the progressive disciplinary process and issuing this corrective action as a Final Warning.\" Final Warning at 2. The Final Warning directs Argenbright to refrain from certain actions, such as \"using her ID security badge to enter unauthorized or secure areas unless she is assigned to work in that area,\" \"conducing non-work related business during working hours,\" and \"looking at protected health information unless she has a need to know.\" Final Warning at 2-3. The Final Warning concludes by stating: \"\n   <strong>\n    Consequences of further infractions:\n   </strong>\n   Failure to immediately and continually adhere to the corrective measure described above may result in further corrective action up to and including termination for similar or any other hospital policy violation.\" Final Warning at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In early 2016, according to St. Vincent, Argenbright \"was involved in a series of incidents that taken separately each warrant discipline, and taken together, warrant termination.\" Corrective Action Form (dated February 18, 2016) at 1, filed April 13, 2017 (Doc. 1-7) (\"Termination Form\"). First, according to St. Vincent, during a\n   shift on January 11, 2016, Argenbright \"direct[ed] patient care providers to the Clinical Supervisor at a rate that seemed unnecessary.\" Termination Form at 1. Second, according to St. Vincent, during an investigative meeting relating to Argenbright's January 11, 2016, shift, Argenbright \"revealed that she was in possession of documents containing private healthcare information.\" Termination Form at 1. When \"management attempted to investigate the nature of the documents, Ms. Argenbright refused to cooperate.\" Termination Form at 1. Third, according to St. Vincent, on January 18, 2016, Argenbright \"failed to gain the confidence of [a] patient, ... fail[ed] to communicate properly about a perceived lack of responsiveness to the patient's pain, was unaware of care requirements for oxygen, and failed to reassign the patient formally to another nurse.\" Termination Form at 3. Fourth, on February 2, 2016, Argenbright entered the Surgical Services' break room to eat lunch, and leave a Union card and labor contract for an employee named Kathleen Cass.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Termination Form at 3; Petition \u00b6 27, at 9. According to St. Vincent, she had tried to enter the Surgical Services area by swiping her badge, but when that approach did not work, another employee let her in a different door.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Termination Form at 3. According to St. Vincent, after lunch, Argenbright returned to her usual workplace in the hospital and realized that she may have left her \"report sheet\" in the Surgical Services area; she returned to Surgical Services and was once again let into the area by another employee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Termination Form at 3. According to St. Vincent, during this visit, Argenbright entered a patient care area to speak with Cass.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Termination Form at 3-4. Based on these four incidents, it fired Argenbright.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Termination Form at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Argenbright requested arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Arbitrator's Decision and Award at 1 (dated January 13, 2016), filed April 13, 2017 (Doc. 1-2)(\"Award\"). According to Hill, the question is \"whether the Grievant was discharged for just cause and if not, what is the remedy?\" Award at 3.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply in Support of Defendant's Motion to Enforce Arbitration Award, filed June 14, 2017 (Doc. 20)(\"Reply\")(stating that the question for the Arbitrator was whether grievant was disciplined for just cause, and, if not, what is the appropriate remedy).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Hill held a hearing on October 18-19, 2017, and November 16, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Award at 1. Hill issued the Award on January 13, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Award at 1. In the Award, Hill provides a basic factual background,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Award at 3, summarizes relevant documents and the parties' positions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Award at 3-4, and provides a lengthy summary of the evidence and testimony,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Award at 4-32. Hill's \"Discussion and Decision\" section runs four pages in which he briefly addresses each of the four reasons given for Argenbright's discharge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Award at 33-37. First, Hill concludes that Argenbright's frequent requests for a supervisor's assistance were not an appropriate basis for termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Award at 33-34. Second, Hill states that Argenbright's \"handling of the difficult patient on January 18, 2016 is not found by the Arbitrator as cause for termination.\" Award at 35. Third, Hill states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   While testimony indicated reason for suspicion that Ms. Argenbright might have hospital documents in her possession, a collective bargaining agreement provision states that notes are not subject to disclosure. Therefore, no violation of the collective bargaining agreement was found in the refusal to disclose notes in the possession of Ms. Argenbright. Consequently, no evidence was\n   provided at the hearing of a HIPAA violation by Ms. Argenbright.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Award at 36. Fourth, Hill states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The evidence is clear and convincing that she attempted to enter the area by using her badge which did not permit her to enter. When that failed, she entered the area either by being let in a locked door by someone or following someone who gained entry by appropriate means.... The Grievant had previously been instructed in 2015 not to enter the Surgical Services area unless she was assigned duties in that area or she had permission of a supervisor to be in the area. The prior instructions were part of a Corrective Action which included a suspension and a final warning.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Award at 36-37. Hill concludes that \"the bulk of the charges against [Argenbright] were unsubstantiated.\" Award at 37. Hill orders Argenbright reinstated to her job after a six-month suspension and be awarded back pay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Award at 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     The Petition\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Three months after Hill issued the Award, St. Vincent asked the Court to vacate it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petition \u00b6 8, at 3. St. Vincent argues that the Award does not draw its essence from the CBA, because Hill's reduced discipline order deviated from the CBA's progressive disciplinary process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petition at 14-17. St. Vincent asserts that Hill ignored the CBA's plain language by reducing Argenbright's punishment despite determining that there is clear and convincing evidence that she violated a Final Warning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petition at 17-20. St. Vincent also argues that Hill exceeds his jurisdiction and violates public policy by reversing Argenbright's termination despite finding reason for suspicion that Argenbright violated the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201181\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"HIPAA\").

St. Vincent contended that the CBA's specified standard of review distinguishes this case from the caselaw.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 3:4-11 (Birenbaum). St. Vincent asserted that it skipped some steps in the CBA's four-step disciplinary process described in the CBA, because the CBA also allows steps to be skipped for serious violations, and Argenbright's offense was serious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 7:5-16 (Birenbaum)(citing CBA at 15).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   CBA at 19 (\"These steps will generally be taken in the order listed,\n   although some steps may be omitted when serious offences have been committed.\"). Regarding the Award, St. Vincent argues that Hill rendered a decision without applying or citing the CBA's disciplinary procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 8:20-9:4 (Birenbaum). St. Vincent argued that this case is similar to\n   <em>\n    Mistletoe\n   </em>\n   , because St. Vincent's power to terminate employees is not ambiguous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 9:31-10:14 (Birenbaum). St. Vincent distinguishes this case from\n   <em>\n    King Soopers\n   </em>\n   , because, in that case, the terminated worker was terminated for actions that their CBA did not expressly prohibit; here, by contrast, St. Vincent argues, Argenbright violated clear CBA policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 11:21-12:20 (Birenbaum). The Court indicated that Hill appeared to grapple with the CBA language, and St. Vincent replied that, in its view, Hill summarized the CBA language but did not apply the language to his analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 14:13-15:10 (Court, Birenbaum). St. Vincent emphasized its view that Hill exceeded his authority by deviating from the parties' clear intent when adopting the CBA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 16:18-17:3 (Birenbaum).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court asked whether the CBA can require the Court to depart from the\n   <em>\n    Steelworkers\n   </em>\n   Trilogy standards.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 17:4-8 (Court). St. Vincent answered that the\n   <em>\n    Steelworkers\n   </em>\n   Trilogy standards do not apply to this case, because in those cases, there was no standard of review \"baked into the [parties'] contract.\" Tr. at 17: 9-22 (Birenbaum). St. Vincent conceded that there are no cases standing for that proposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 18:3-4 (Birenbaum).

The Hospital Union stated that Hill was not obligated to provide a particular level of analysis supporting his decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 20:3-13 (Montalbano).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court asked why Hill did not ground his decision more clearly in the CBA's language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 20:21-24 (Court). The Hospital Union answered that, first of all, Hill's task \"was not to analyze the CBA\" but to decide whether there was just cause supporting Argenbright's termination. Tr. at 20:25-21:3 (Montalbano). The Hospital Union asserted that St. Vincent \"does not have unfettered discretion to terminate an employee no matter what\" without that judgment being challenged, even with HIPAA violations. Tr. at 21:20-22:18 (Montalbano). The Court asked whether the CBA permitted an arbitrator to fashion a new remedy, and the Hospital Union stated that there is caselaw stating that an arbitrator \"can reduce a termination and it's quite common that a termination gets reduced.\" Tr. at 23:7-23 (Court, Montalbano). The Hospital Union continued that the third step of the CBA's disciplinary process calls for a final warning or suspension, and that \"nothing in the CBA or caselaw says that if you get a final warning then any future [infraction] must result in termination.\" Tr. at 24:6-11 (Montalbano). The Hospital Union asserted: \"[E]ven if the arbitrator looks at a collective bargaining agreement and misinterprets it [or] gets it wrong, that is still not grounds for reversing an award and vacating it.\" Tr. at 24:20-23 (Montalbano).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Hospital Union stated that Hill's task was to determine whether the discipline was reasonable, and Hill determined that termination was excessive but suspension was reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 33:5-8 (Montalbano). The Court asked where Hill\n   derives his power to make his own reasonableness decision, and the Hospital Union replied that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   the CBA gives him the power to determine if just cause exists for a discipline action, and then in the decades-long history going back to the post-war era of arbitration jurisprudence, what it means is that when he has the power to determine just cause, that means he [uses] the seven factors and those factors were considered here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Tr. at 33:9-34:10 (Court, Montalbano).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Court asked the Hospital Union whether the parties could agree to a CBA that calls for applying a different standard than the\n   <em>\n    Steelworker\n   </em>\n   Trilogy standard, and the Hospital Union answered that \"I think it's a moot point because nothing in the contract contradicts or goes against what the\n   <em>\n    Steelworker\n   </em>\n   Trilogy says.\" Tr. at 36:24-37:12 (Court, Montalbano).

First, St. Vincent argues that\n   <em>\n    Mistletoe\n   </em>\n   does not require the Court to permit Hill to determine that certain conduct is just cause for discipline and not for discharge, because\n   <em>\n    Mistletoe\n   </em>\n   holds that an arbitrator cannot apply a different punishment from what the employer imposes if doing do violates the parties' contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter at 2. According to St. Vincent, Hill violated the CBA when he found just cause for discipline and not for termination, because the CBA's disciplinary process requires that a Final Warning violation result in termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter at 4-5 (citing\n   <em>\n    Amanda Bent Bolt Co. v.

In St. Vincent's view, under the\n   <em>\n    Steelworkers\n   </em>\n   Trilogy's deferential standard, the Court should not permit Hill to ignore the CBA's progressive disciplinary process and \"fashion a new disciplinary rule\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , creating \"a second final warning.\" Letter at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   St. Vincent also contends that, when an arbitrator \"implicitly finds just cause for discipline, the arbitrator cannot strip the\n   employer of its right to terminate the employee.\" Letter at 7 n.1 (citing\n   <em>\n    Delta Queen Steamboat Co. v.

A proper conception of the arbitrator's function is basic. He is not a public tribunal imposed upon the parties by superior authority which the parties are obliged to accept. He has no general charter to administer justice for a community which transcends the parties. He is rather part of a system of self-government created by and confined to the parties.... The labor arbitrator's source of law is not confined to the express provisions of the contract, as the industrial common law-the practices of the industry and the shop-is equally a part of the collective bargaining agreement although not expressed in it. The labor arbitrator is usually chosen because of the parties' confidence in his knowledge of the common law of the shop and their trust in his personal judgment to bring to bear considerations which are not expressed in the contract as criteria for judgment. The parties expect that his judgment of a particular grievance will reflect not only what the contract says but, insofar as the collective bargaining agreement permits, such\n   factors as the effect upon productivity of a particular result, its consequence to the morale of the shop, his judgment whether tensions will be heightened or diminished. For the parties' objective in using the arbitration process is primarily to further their common goal of uninterrupted production under the agreement, to make the agreement serve their specialized needs. The ablest judge cannot be expected to bring the same experience and competence to bear upon the determination of a grievance, because he cannot be similarly informed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   363 U.S. at 581-82,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166480\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/363/574/#p578\">\n    80 S.Ct. 1347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Whether the moving party is right or wrong is a question of contract interpretation for the arbitrator. In these circumstances the moving party should not be deprived of the arbitrator's judgment, when it was his judgment and all that it connotes that was bargained for. The courts, therefore, have no business weighing the merits of the grievance, considering whether there is equity in a particular claim, or determining whether there is particular language in the written instrument which will support the claim.

Hill does not rewrite or ignore the CBA's progressive disciplinary process when he reduces Argenbright's punishment from termination to suspension, because his decision reflects a plausible interpretation of the CBA's terms. Further, Hill does not exceed his authority by finding no grounds for terminating Argenbright for violating St. Vincent's HIPAA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   rules, because that decision reflect a reasonable interpretation of the CBA, and the Court may not vacate an arbitration award for an arbitrator's mistakes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

According to St. Vincent, Hill implicitly determined that there was just cause for Argenbright's termination, because he determined that Argenbright violated her Final Warning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion Response at 4-5. Consequently, St. Vincent maintains, Hill exceeded his authority, because he was only allowed to fashion an alternative remedy if there was no just cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion Response at 5. Additionally, St. Vincent argues that Hill exceeded his authority by effectively rewriting the CBA's progressive disciplinary process when he ordered that Argenbright be reinstated, because the disciplinary policy requires that termination follows a Final Warning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter at 4. These arguments are not availing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   To be sure, Hill determined that there was \"clear and convincing evidence\" that Argenbright entered a restricted area on January 11, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Award at 36. Hill appears to have concluded that Argenbright's actions violated the Final Warning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Award at 36-37 (noting that a 2015 \"Corrective Action which included a suspension and a final warning\" instructed Argenbright not to enter the Surgical Services area without authorization). It does not follow, however, that Hill concluded that St. Vincent had just cause for Argenbright's termination, because it is plausible to read the CBA as not requiring termination to follow a Final Warning. Before explaining why, it is worth revisiting the Court's standard of review: if there is a plausible argument that the arbitrator drew from the contract's essence, then the Court will not vacate the award, even if\n   the arbitrator made a mistake applying the facts or interpreting the contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United Paperworkers Int'l Union, AFL-CIO v. Misco, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"600957\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/29/#p36\">\n    484 U.S. at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"600957\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/29/#p36\">\n    108 S.Ct. 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . An arbitrator goes too far, however, when he or she ignores a contract provision's plain language and/or renders conclusions that are utterly unconnected with any reasonable contract interpretation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mistletoe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"901997\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/566/692/#p695\">\n    566 F.2d at 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Here, the Court can see a reasonable connection between the CBA and Hill's conclusions. The CBA's \u00a7 12.12.10 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   The four (4) basic steps listed below will be followed for disciplinary action. These steps will generally be taken in the order listed, although some steps may be omitted when serious offences have been committed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   (1) Documented Verbal Counseling\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   (2) Written Warning\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   (3) Final Warning or Suspension\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   (4) Termination\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   CBA \u00a7 12.12.10, at 15. St. Vincent contends that Hill rewrites this provision by ordering Argenbright suspended and reinstated because Hill repeats Step 3 instead of proceeding to Step 4, as the process requires. Although the provision clearly states that its steps must be taken in order, it does not expressly prohibit steps from being repeated. Moreover, the Final Warning and the Termination Form indicate that Termination does not necessarily follow a Final Warning. The Final Warning concludes by stating: \"\n   <strong>\n    Consequences of further infractions:\n   </strong>\n   Failure to immediately and continually adhere to the corrective measure described above\n   <em>\n    may result in further corrective action up to and including termination\n   </em>\n   for similar or any other hospital policy violation.\" Final Warning at 3 (emphasis added). Meanwhile, the Termination Form, which references Argenbright's Final Warning,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Termination Form at 4, explains that each of Argenbright's four infractions \"taken separately ... warrant[s] discipline, and taken together warrants termination.\" Termination Form at 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   With those statements in mind, it is plausible to read the progressive disciplinary process as being more flexible than St. Vincent now asserts that it is, such that an employee violating a Final Warning could remain in Step 3 to receive a suspension rather than necessarily proceeding to termination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   In its Letter, St. Vincent addresses two reasons why it believes that Hill exceeds his authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter at 2. First, St. Vincent argues that, because the CBA provides that St. Vincent has the exclusive\n   authority to make disciplinary decisions, and because Hill determines that Argenbright violated the Final Warning, Hill has no authority to change St. Vincent's decision to terminate Argenbright.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter at 4-5. St. Vincent argues that\n   <em>\n    Mistletoe\n   </em>\n   supports its position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter at 4. In\n   <em>\n    Mistletoe\n   </em>\n   , an employer fired a \"driver-salesman\" for \"failing to settle within 24 hours and accepting a personal check for a C.O.D. shipment.\"\n   <em>\n    Mistletoe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"901997\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/566/692/#p695\">\n    566 F.2d at 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Tenth Circuit observed that in a \"proper case an arbitrator, in reliance on custom or usage in an industry, may construe a 'just cause' provision of a labor contract to include a progressive discipline requirement and may determine that certain conduct is 'just cause' for discipline but not for discharge.\"\n   <em>\n    Mistletoe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"901997\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/566/692/#p695\">\n    566 F.2d at 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The arbitrator determined that the discharged workers violated the CBA by going on strike, but ordered that they be reinstated with full seniority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"787905\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/451/1277/#p1279\">\n    451 F.2d at 1280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit determined that the arbitrator exceeded his authority and that his award was contrary to the CBA's terms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"787905\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/451/1277/#p1279\">\n    451 F.2d at 1280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Sixth Circuit noted that the CBA reserved the employer's exclusive right to hire, promote, demote, discharge, or discipline its employers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"787905\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/451/1277/#p1279\">\n    451 F.2d at 1279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Sixth Circuit reasoned that, when the employees violated the CBA's no-strike clause, \"they were subject to discharge,\" and \"the determination of the penalty was reserved to the company and was not the prerogative of the arbitrator.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"787905\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/451/1277/#p1279\">\n    451 F.2d at 1280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consequently, according to the Sixth Circuit, once the arbitrator determined that the workers violated the CBA's no-strike clause which provided the basis for their termination, the arbitrator was not permitted to infringe on the employer's exclusive power to make its disciplinary proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"787905\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/451/1277/#p1279\">\n    451 F.2d at 1280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   This case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Mistletoe\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Amanda Bent\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Mistletoe\n   </em>\n   , the arbitrator determined that the employee did something that the CBA expressly states is cause for discharge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"901997\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/566/692/#p695\">\n    566 F.2d at 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the CBA does not expressly state that violating a Final Warning or entering a restricted area without authorization on multiple occasions is cause for discharge. To be sure, the CBA lists \"Termination\" and the step following \"Final Warning or Suspension,\" but it is not clear that violating a Final Warning necessarily results in Termination. The Final Warning itself states that violating the Final Warning's instructions \"may result in further corrective action\n   <em>\n    up to and including termination\n   </em>\n   for similar or any other hospital policy violation.\" Final Warning at 3 (emphasis added). The CBA in this case does not, therefore, bind Hill to uphold Argenbright's termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <em>\n    Amanda Bent\n   </em>\n   is also distinguishable. In that case, the Sixth Circuit indicates that, when the employer retains an exclusive right to discipline its employees, and the arbitrator confirms that the employee did\n   the act for which the employer disciplined the employee, the arbitrator may not second-guess the employer's disciplinary decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"787905\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/451/1277/#p1279\">\n    451 F.2d at 1280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At first glance, that principle appears to apply in this case, where the CBA gives St. Vincent the exclusive authority to make disciplinary decisions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   CBA \u00a7 1.1.12, at 8, and Hill appears to agree that Argenbright violated the Final Warning by entering the secured area without authorization,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Award at 36-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   There is, however, an important difference between this case and\n   <em>\n    Amanda Bent\n   </em>\n   : St. Vincent did not terminate Argenbright for violating the Final Warning. According to the Termination Form, St. Vincent terminated Argenbright for four infractions, including the Final Warning violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Termination Form at 1 (stating that each infraction, \"taken separately[,] ... warrant[s] discipline, and taken together warrants termination\"). Hill is not dealing with four punishments for four discrete violations; once he determines that \"the bulk of the charges against the Grievant were unsubstantiated,\" Award at 37, there was no disciplinary decision for the one violation to which he could defer. Hill therefore determines that there is no just cause for termination based on the four infractions; at that point he has no choice but to fashion his own remedy with regard to the Final Warning violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Award at 3 (\"The issue presented to the Arbitrator was whether the Grievant was discharged for just cause and if not, what is the remedy?\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Second, St. Vincent argues that Hill exceeds his authority by rewriting the CBA to \"effectively creat[e] a second final warning not provided in the CBA.\" Letter at 7. St. Vincent compares Hill's Award to the arbitrator's decision in\n   <em>\n    Bruno's, Inc. v. United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Int'l Union, Local 1657\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537107\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/858/1529/#p1530\">\n    858 F.2d 1529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1530 (11th Cir. 1988) (Johnson, C.J.)(\"\n   <em>\n    Bruno's\n   </em>\n   \"). According to St. Vincent,\n   <em>\n    Bruno's\n   </em>\n   offers a good example of an arbitrator creating new CBA policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter at 6. In\n   <em>\n    Bruno's\n   </em>\n   , the arbitrator determined that a grocery chain's policy for disciplining grocers for not charging for items in the bottom compartment of customers' shopping carts is unfair and void.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537107\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/858/1529/#p1530\">\n    858 F.2d at 1530-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The arbitrator \"specifically outlined a new policy, which included less severe fines for first offenses and more direct management monitoring of bascart security shoppers\"-secret shoppers meant to test grocers-\"to assure prompt notification and verification of offences.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537107\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/858/1529/#p1530\">\n    858 F.2d at 1531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Sixth Circuit determined that the arbitrator \"may not create a new rule to replace the one he strikes down,\" because the CBA bestowed an exclusive right upon the employer to establish reasonable rules.\n   <em>\n    Bruno's\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537107\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/858/1529/#p1530\">\n    858 F.2d at 1532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   St. Vincent argues that Hill, like the\n   <em>\n    Bruno's\n   </em>\n   arbitrator, rewrote the CBA by \"effectively creating a second final warning\" by reducing Argenbright's punishment from termination to suspension. Letter at 7. This case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Bruno's\n   </em>\n   in several ways. First, Hill does not purport to create a new CBA rule for St. Vincent's and the Hospital Union's application beyond this case. Second, suspending Argenbright does not create a second final warning step in contravention to the CBA's express terms, because Hill is readjusting Argenbright's punishment in light of his determination that there was no just cause for termination based on Argenbright's four alleged infractions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Award at 37, and, as discussed above, the CBA does not plainly state that violating a final warning necessarily results in termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 912. Hill's decision, therefore, is consistent with both his express direction,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Award at 3 (\"The issue presented to the Arbitrator was whether\n   the Grievant was discharged for just cause and if not, what is the remedy?\"), and Tenth Circuit precedent,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mistletoe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"901997\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/566/692/#p695\">\n    566 F.2d at 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[In a] proper case an arbitrator, in reliance on custom or usage in an industry, may construe a 'just cause' provision of a labor contract to include a progressive discipline requirement and may determine that certain conduct is 'just cause' for discipline but not for discharge.\").\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tobacco Workers International Union v.

According to St. Vincent, Hill misconstrues Argenbright's disclosure duties under the CBA, and Hill should analyze whether there is sufficient evidence that Argenbright violated St. Vincent's HIPAA-related policies and not HIPAA itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petition 21-23. St. Vincent may be correct that Hill misunderstood the CBA and the reasons for Argenbright's termination, but the Court must defer to an arbitrator's decision even when the arbitrator makes factual or legal errors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United Paperworkers Int'l Union, AFL-CIO v.

The Court cannot soundly say whether reinstating Argenbright without disciplining her for violating HIPAA or HIPAA-related policies would violate that public policy, because the Court does not know whether Argenbright mishandled confidential patient information. Hill determined that, although \"testimony indicated reasons for suspicion that Ms. Argenbright might have hospital documents in her possession, ... no evidence was provided at the hearing of a HIPAA violation by Ms. Argenbright.\" Award at 36. The Termination Form states that Argenbright had \"what appeared to be a hospital report sheet,\" but Argenbright said that the pages were \"personal notes.\" Termination Form at 2.

The Hospital Union adds that \"there is no objectively reasonable basis upon which the Hospital can argue that the Arbitrator exceeded the scope of his authority or issued an award that did not arguably construe or apply the contract.\" Petition Response at 23. The Court disagrees. St. Vincent bases most of its arguments on its general theory that the CBA's arbitration-related provisions changes the Court's standard of review and outlines prohibited actions that, St. Vincent alleges, Hill violated. The Court disagrees with St. Vincent, but its theory is plausible. The Court determines that the CBA's provisions are too general to change the Court's standard of review,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 I, at 26-31, and that Hill's decisions are consistent with a plausible reading of the CBA,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 II.A, at 33-34. These questions required some analysis to decide, and neither the Supreme Court nor the Tenth Circuit provides clear warnings that St. Vincent's claims would fail to carry the day. St. Vincent pushed for an extension of the law to give courts more power to vacate arbitration awards, but that request is no so unreasonable as to constitute bad faith. The law that the courts have drawn is not so clear that the Court should, in this case, award the Hospital Union fees. The Court will thus deny any requests for fees, costs, or sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that: (i) Defendant's Motion to Enforce Arbitration Award, filed April 27, 2017 (Doc. 9), is granted in part and denied in part; and (ii) Christus St. Vincent Regional Medical Center's Petition to Vacate Arbitration Award, filed April 13, 2017 (Doc. 1), is denied.
