The 2014 SEIS analyzed the possibility of moderate fluctuations in oil prices and the possibility of a low oil price scenario. The 2014 SEIS failed to address, however, the significant changes in oil prices that have occurred since 2014. This lack of analysis fails to satisfy NEPA's hard look requirement. The 2014 SEIS stated that \"pipeline constraints are unlikely to impact production given expected supply-demand scenarios, prices, and supply costs. Over the long term, lower-than-expected oil prices could affect the outlook for oil sand production[.]\" DOSKXLDMT0005895. The Department acknowledges that a significant drop in oil prices materially could change the analysis. The 2014 SEIS conditioned much of its analysis, however, on the price of oil remaining high.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The record demonstrates the need to supplement.

The record shows further that a dramatic drop in oil prices occurred soon after publication of the 2014 SEIS that lowered the price to nearly $38 per barrel. The Department suggests that the current price of oil stands at roughly $60 per barrel. (Doc. 173 at 49.) This drop constitutes more than a mere fluctuation in oil prices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiffs also present evidence that the Environmental Protection Agency called upon the Department to revisit the EIS's conclusions after the 2015 oil prices dropped. (Doc. 140 at 36 (citing DOSKXLDMT0000973-74).) Oil prices have remained below the \"break-even\" numbers established in the 2014 SEIS. This new and relevant information bears upon the Department's earlier analysis in the 2014 SEIS. The Court makes no suggestion of whether this information should alter the Department's analysis. Such an analysis proves material, however, to the Department's consideration of Keystone's impact on tar sands production.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Transportation of Crude Oil by Rail\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiffs next argue that the 2014 SEIS incorrectly concluded that significant amounts of crude oil would be transported by rail in the absence of Keystone. (Doc. 140 at 37.) Plaintiffs assert that the 2014 SEIS wrongly predicted the amount of tar sands that would be shipped by rail, and that new federal regulations requiring updated train safety measures require a supplement. Defendants contend that only immaterial changes in crude by rail have occurred since 2014. (Doc. 173 at 77.) The 2014 SEIS predicts that loading capacity would increase from 700,000 bpd to 1.1 million bpd. DOSKXLDMT0005805.

(Doc. 140 at 37.) The rate of transportation fails to present a material issue that would require a supplement. The capacity to transport the amount predicted in the 2014 SEIS represents the critical issue. Plaintiffs have the burden of showing that transportation capacity materially differs from its capacity in 2014. Plaintiffs have presented no evidence of a significant difference between current capacity and the 2014 SEIS projections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

Plaintiffs argue that the Department should have considered this more recent information in its 2017 permitting decision. (Doc. 140 at 39.) Plaintiffs argue further that the Department failed to analyze a new study\n   regarding the difficulty of cleaning up tar sands crude oil spills. (Doc. 140 at 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The ROD acknowledges that \"several new studies related to cleanup of diluted bitumen have been published.\" DOSKXLDMT0002506. The ROD cites a study by the National Academy of Sciences (\"NAS\") that Plaintiffs argue should have been evaluated in the 2014 SEIS. (Doc. 140 at 40.) NAS conducted the study at the direction of Congress. Specifically, Congress asked NAS to address \"whether the transport of diluted bitumen in pipelines has potential environmental consequences that are sufficiently different from those of commonly transported crude oils to warrant changes in regulations governing spill response planning, preparedness, and cleanup.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1379. The study found that diluted bitumen presents more challenges for cleanup response than other types of oil moved by pipeline.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1391. The study also determined that responders need more training and better communication to address these spills adequately.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The major spills that occurred between 2014 and 2017 qualify as significant. The Department would have evaluated the spills in the 2014 SEIS had the information been available. Further, the risk of spills likely would affect Keystone's potential impact on other areas of the ROD's analysis, including risks to water and wildlife. These new spills and the information provided by them warrant an update.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The ROD similarly fails to show how the 2014 SEIS adequately addressed the NAS study regarding tar sands oil. The ROD merely asserts that Keystone has agreed to consult with local emergency responders and update its mitigation response plans as new information becomes available. This conclusory statement fails to meet NEPA's \"hard look\" requirement. The absence of this information from the 2014 SEIS's mitigation measures demonstrates that the agency acted upon incomplete information in setting forth its mitigation measures.\n   <em>\n    Marsh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605417\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/360/#p373\">\n    490 U.S. at 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605417\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/360/#p373\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Historical sightings data includes over fifty years of observations compiled by FWS regarding whooping crane migration. (Doc. 153-1 at 31.) This data shows the boundaries of the whooping crane migration corridor and recurring stop-over locations. Both parties agree that historical sightings data represents the best available science.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The parties disagree, however, as to whether use of telemetry data would alter the Department's analysis. Plaintiffs argue that the 2014 SEIS underestimated the risk of collisions with power lines without the use of telemetry data. (Doc. 140 at 59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The United States Geological Survey (\"USGS\") maintains telemetry data through the Whooping Crane Tracking Partnership's (\"WCTP\") Telemetry Project. (Doc. 118 at 7.) The Telemetry Project collects telemetry data from radio-tagged cranes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The WCTP captures whooping cranes and attaches a transmitter to their leg. This transmission sends a signal received by satellite in a frequency of every six hours.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The telemetry data comes from 20% of the whooping crane population that was radio-tagged.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. The Telemetry Project seeks to document whooping crane movement within their migratory corridor and to gather behavioral data.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Defendants' expert asserts that the use of telemetry data has numerous limitations and flaws. Defendants' expert states, for example, that the WCTP collected telemetry data over a short span of time (2010-2014), whereas the historic sightings date back as far as the 1950s. (Doc. 128-4 at 18.) Defendants' expert also opines that the telemetry data points may represent the same individual bird traveling within a small area on one stopover.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, telemetry data does not account for altitude, so it may not distinguish between birds flying at lower altitudes in migration, or at elevations where altitude was inconclusive.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Importantly, Plaintiffs' expert does not explain how the telemetry data undermines the historical sightings data used by the Department. Plaintiffs' expert instead \"observed that several of the historical [FWS] sightings ... were at the same locations as recent telemetry data records. In fact the telemetry data only identified a few locations ... that were not identified using the historical data.\" (Doc. 118 at 16.) Plaintiffs' expert concludes that the telemetry data confirms site fidelity observed in historical sighting data.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \"The determination of what constitutes the best scientific data available belongs to the agency's special expertise.\"\n   <em>\n    San Luis &amp; Delta-Mendota Water Auth. v.

Accordingly, an agency possesses discretion to determine the best available science. Further, both parties' experts conclude that telemetry data confirms, rather than undermines sightings data. At best, the telemetry data provides additional information regarding how recent specific areas are used by whooping cranes. (Doc. 118 at 15.) Plaintiffs fail to show how this information would change the agencies' analysis. The agencies' failure to consider the telemetry data in their analysis does not provide a sufficient basis to conclude that the agencies acted arbitrarily and capriciously.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Interior Least Tern and Piping Plover\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that FWS failed to analyze adequately impacts to endangered interior least terns and threatened piping plovers from increased raptor predation attributable to the Project. (Doc. 140 at 70.) The BA concludes that power line routes associated with Keystone likely would attract raptors. FWS000000000660. The BA proposes the use of perch deterrents to be installed in coordination with FWS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2069-70. The BA determines that \"[p]rotection measures could be implemented by electrical service providers to minimize raptor perching in accordance with the Avian Power Line Interaction Committee (\"APLIC\"), Suggested Practices for Avian Protection on Power Lines (APLIC 1996).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 654. Plaintiffs argue that a 2006 edition of the APLIC contradicted BA's conclusion. The 2006 edition recognizes that perch discouragers intend \"to move birds from an unsafe location to a safe location and do not prevent perching.\" (Doc. 143-1 at 36.) The 2006 APLIC further determines that the use of perch deterrents is not recommended to prevent predation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The raptor predation protection measures that reference the 1996 guidance address dangers to black-footed ferrets, rather than dangers to terns or plovers. FWS000000000654. The use of this guidance would not apply to Plaintiffs' arguments regarding terns and plovers. The 2006 guidance does not disavow the use of perch deterrents. (Doc. 143-1 at 17.) The guidance simply cautions that perch deterrents do not prevent perching, but are intended to manage where birds perch.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In the end, the guidance suggests that electric utilities and agencies work together to identify predation risk to sensitive species.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, the BA discusses other conservation measures, including pre-construction surveys and rerouting of power lines. These steps and other measures should be coordinated with FWS. FWS000000000719.

The Department must supplement new and relevant information regarding the risk of spills. The 2014 SEIS, the BA, and the BiOp relied on outdated information regarding potential oil spills and the agencies must account for the supplemental information.

Mont. 2017). The Court provides the following instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <em>\n    Claim 1\n   </em>\n   : The Department's \"purpose and need\" statement in the 2014 SEIS did not violate NEPA. The Department's range of alternatives analyzed in the 2014 SEIS did not violate NEPA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201502.1\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1502.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1502.13, 1502.14. Further, the Department did not violate NEPA when it set forth its no-action alternative in the 2014 SEIS. Similarly, the Department did not violate NEPA in its analysis of transportation of crude oil by rail in the 2014 SEIS. The Department's response to public comments on the draft 2014 SEIS comported with its obligations under NEPA. And finally, the Department's incorporation of the CNEB's analysis of impacts in Canada satisfied NEPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The Department's analysis of the following issues fell short of a \"hard look\" and requires a supplement to the 2014 SEIS in order to comply with its obligations under NEPA:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   \u2022 The effects of current oil prices on the viability of Keystone (Section I (C)(2)(a) );\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n   \u2022 The cumulative effects of greenhouse gas emissions from the Alberta Clipper expansion and Keystone (Section I (C)(2)(c) );\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n   \u2022 A survey of potential cultural resources contained in the 1,038 acres not addressed in the 2014 SEIS (Section I (E)(1) ); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   \u2022 An updated modeling of potential oil spills and recommended mitigation measures (Section I (E)(3) ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   These omissions require a remand with instructions to the Department to satisfy its obligations under NEPA to take a \"hard look\" at the issues through a supplement to the 2014 SEIS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <em>\n    Claim 2\n   </em>\n   : Plaintiffs' second group of claims relate to the need for TransCanada\n   to obtain a right of way across BLM-owned land. The parties' current motions for summary judgment do not address these claims. The Court defers ruling on these claims until the parties have submitted motions and supporting briefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <em>\n    Claim 3\n   </em>\n   : NEPA and the APA require a detailed justification for reversing course and adopting a policy that \"rests upon factual findings that contradict those which underlay its prior policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Fox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653713\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/502/#p515\">\n    556 U.S. at 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653713\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/502/#p515\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Department failed to comply with NEPA and the APA when it disregarded prior factual findings related to climate change and reversed course. The Court vacates the 2017 ROD and remands with instructions to provide a reasoned explanation for the 2017 ROD's change in course.\n   <em>\n    Kake\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4288600\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/795/956/#p966\">\n    795 F.3d at 966\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <em>\n    Claims 4 and 5\n   </em>\n   : Section 7(a)(2) of the ESA requires that an agency ensure its actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of endangered or threatened species, and are not likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201536\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).

The Department did not violate the ESA when it did not use the telemetry data to assess potential harm to whooping cranes. The Department did not violate the ESA when it put forth mitigation measures related to the western prairie fringed orchid. The Department did not violate the ESA in its analysis of the black-footed ferret, the rufa red knot, the northern long-eared bat or terns and plovers. Further, the Department did not violate the ESA when it did not apply Section 7 in Canada.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   The Department's 2012 BA, and FWS's 2013 BiOp and concurrence shall be set aside and remanded to the Department with instructions to consider potential adverse impacts to endangered species from oil spills associated with Keystone in light of the updated data on oil spills and leaks.
