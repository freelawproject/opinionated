The primary issues are: (i) whether Albuquerque Police Department (\"APD\") Officer Jason Harvey detained Defendant Apache Young when he took Young's pocketknife and told Young to wait with another police officer while Harvey inspected the scene and investigated Young's criminal history; (ii) whether Harvey had reasonable suspicion to detain Young after he saw Young on Albuquerque, New Mexico's West Mesa emerge from an empty water tank shirtless and covered in tattoos, and place what Harvey suspected was a firearm in a holster into a pickup truck bed; (iii) whether the circumstances justify the length and manner of Young's detention; (iv) whether the Court should suppress Young's post-arrest statements, because no one Mirandized\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Young; and (v) whether Harvey violated Young's constitutional rights, because Harvey -- an APD officer -- arrested Young outside Albuquerque's city limits. The Court concludes that: (i) Harvey detained Young, because a reasonable person in Young's position would not have felt free to leave; (ii) Harvey had reasonable suspicion to detain Young, because the circumstances' totality suggests that Young might have been involved in a crime; (iii) the circumstances justify the length and manner of Young's detention, because it was reasonable for Harvey to detain Young long enough to determine\n   whether he had outstanding warrants or is a felon; (iv) the Court will not suppress Young's post-arrest statements under\n   <em>\n    Miranda v. Arizona\n   </em>\n   , because Harvey did not interrogate Young; and (v) Harvey was authorized to operate throughout the County of Bernalillo, but, even if he was not so authorized, the arrest did not violate the Constitution of the United States of America. Accordingly, the Court denies the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Rule 12(d) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires the Court to state its essential findings on the record when deciding a motion that involves factual issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(d) (\"When factual issues are involved in deciding a motion, the court must state its essential findings on the record.\"). The findings of fact in this Memorandum Opinion and Order serve as the Court's essential findings for rule 12(d) purposes. The Court makes these findings under the authority of rule 104(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which requires a judge to decide preliminary questions relating to the admissibility of evidence, including the legality of a search or seizure, and the voluntariness of an individual's confession or consent to a search.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In deciding such preliminary questions, the other rules of evidence, except those with respect to privileges, do not bind the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 104(a). Thus, the Court may consider hearsay in ruling on a motion to suppress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Young also contends that the APD officers were not within their jurisdiction when they made the arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 6. Second, Young contends that the APD officers arrested him without probable cause and violated Young's rights under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 7-8. Young argues, alternatively, that Harvey violated his rights under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America when he told Young that Young must stay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 9. Young contends that, given the circumstances -- namely, that Harvey was in full uniform and displaying a firearm when he told Young to stay and took Young's pocketknife -- \"it is not reasonable that anyone would have thought he was free to go.\" Motion at 10. Young asserts that, to discourage the APD officers' actions, the \"most common and appropriate sanction\" for their behavior is to suppress all the evidence. Motion at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Third, Young asserts that he has standing to contest the search of his truck, because he had legitimate possessory interest in the car and an expectation of privacy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 11-12. Fourth, Young asks the Court to suppress statements which he made to the APD officers following his arrest, because: (i) the APD officers got his statements as a result of their Fourth Amendment violation; and (ii) the APD officers did not Mirandize\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 12. Fifth and finally, Young asks the Court to suppress the fruits of the APD officer's arrest and detention, because the \"illegality tainted every piece of evidence the state acquired from Mr. Young since his arrest.\" Motion at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The Response\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The United States responds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response by the United States to the Defendant's Motion to Suppress, filed May 22, 2018 (Doc. 47)(\"Response\"). First, the United States asserts that Harvey had reasonable suspicion that Young was engaged in criminal activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 7. The United States explains that when the APD officers\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   observed the Defendant emerge from the water tank they knew only that it was an area that served as an attraction for the dumping of stolen vehicles and that had served as a burial ground for a number of murdered women and the burial of a fetus.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   They observed the shirtless Defendant, a muscular, hard-built tattooed man, walk towards a pickup truck that had an open driver's side door and place a holster and a firearm in the open bed of a pickup truck.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   Not knowing what relationship or explanation the Defendant had with the truck, the holster and the handgun or for being there shirtless in November, Officer Harvey, upon engaging the Defendant, asked him for identifying information such as name, date of birth, social security number as well as information about the pickup truck. As a result of Officer Harvey's reasonable suspicion that the Defendant was engaged in criminal activity he made an investigatory stop of the Defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Response at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Second, the United States asserts that the APD officers were authorized \"to investigate cases and to make arrests in the open space area of the West Mesa,\" because both officers, like all APD officers, \"were then cross-commissioned\" with the Bernalillo County Sheriff Office to do so. Response at 9. Third, the United States argues that Harvey's warrantless recovery of the handgun was legal, because he seized the handgun after he knew that Young was a felon, and because the handgun was in plain view.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 10. Fourth, the United States contends that the inevitable discovery doctrine applies, because law enforcement would have discovered the handgun along with the other firearms recovered from the tuck pursuant to a search warrant executed two days later.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 11. The United States adds that Harvey learned that Young was a felon not from questioning Young, but by independently consulting the National Crime Information Center database.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 11. Fifth, the United States addresses the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 12-13. The United States contends that the Court should not suppress Young's statements, even if he was not Mirandized, because, according to the United States, Young did not make those statements within the context of an interrogation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     The Reply\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Young replies to the United States' Response.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant's Reply to the Government's Response to Motion to Suppress, filed May 30, 2018 (Doc. 48)(\"Reply\"). In the Reply, Young disputes several facts that the United States asserts in its Response.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 1-2. For instance, Young states that \"[t]he information then and now available\" shows that the APD officers saw Young place a holster -- not a firearm -- in the truck's bed. Reply at 1. Young asserts that he did not give his pocketknife to Harvey voluntarily, but, rather, Harvey \"demanded that the Defendant surrender the little pocketknife.\" Reply at 1. Young disputes that the firearm was in plain view, asserting that Harvey's lapel video shows only \"dark object in the shadows\" of the pickup truck's bed. Reply at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Turning to reasonable suspicion, Young contends that the United States \"fails to specify what sort of criminal activity might have been afoot nor how the Officers reached that conclusion.\" Reply at 3.

Young contends:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   The search warrant depends entirely on the affidavit which rests entirely on information obtained from the illegal search and seizure.

Young asserts that the last time Harvey and Smith signed oaths of office cards was in 2000, when Joe Bowdich was Bernalillo County Sheriff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 4. He contends that Sheriff Gonzales did not appoint either Harvey or Smith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 4.

The United States and Young stipulated that the pickup truck belonged to Young's mother and that she gave Young permission to drive the truck that day.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 7:1-5 (Knoblauch). Young took the stand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 8:7-13 (Clerk, Young). Young said that he was on the West Mesa that day driving around looking for scrap metal and that he went into the water tank \"and used the bathroom.\" Tr. at 8:19-23 (Knoblauch, Young). Young explained that he saw the police officers approach him and he walked towards them to meet them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 9:6-9 (Knoblauch, Young). Young's attorney, Charles Knoblauch, asked Young whether he felt free to leave after he gave the police officer his pocket knife, and Young said that he did not, \"[b]ecause he told me to hold on right there until he checked something out.\" Tr. at 10:24-11:5 (Knoblauch, Young).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The United States began cross-examining Young.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 10:18-20 (Spiers).

The United States moved into evidence an identification card indicating that Harvey was commissioned as a \"Special Deputy Sheriff in the Bernalillo County\" with an expiration date of December 31, 2018.

Harvey stated that the identification card was active shortly \"after he\" -- the Court presumes Harvey means Manuel Gonzalez, the Sheriff of Bernalillo County -- \"took office.\" Tr. at 24:4-12 (Spiers, Harvey). Young objected to the identification card's admission, because \"[w]e still don't know when this card actually was issued.\" Tr. at 24:25-25:3 (Knoblauch).

Harvey said that Young then began walking away from the pickup truck towards them, which made Harvey wonder why he was choosing to distance himself from the vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 33:14-22 (Harvey). Harvey said that they began speaking with Young.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 35:24-36:4 (Spiers, Harvey). Harvey explained: \"My concern is: is that vehicle stolen? Whose vehicle is it? ... [W]hat's he doing in the water tank? Because ... I've had ... 15 years [experience] patrolling that desert, and I've never seen anybody in that water tank.\" Tr. at 36:6-11 (Harvey). Harvey recalled that Young was not wearing a shirt, and Harvey thought that it was unusual to not wear a shirt in November out on the West Mesa; Harvey also said that Young was \"covered in what appeared to be prison tattoos.\" Tr. at 38:13-17 (Harvey). Harvey explained that he believed that tattoos were \"prison tattoos\" because they were blue, as \"you would see in prison.\" Tr. at 39:5-13 (Harvey). Harvey believes blue ink is typical of prison tattoos, because \"based on my experience with people that I've arrested in the past that have done prison time, they all have the same ... blue color ink. They don't have the option of colors in the prison system, as far as I know.\" Tr. at 40:14-19 (Harvey).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Harvey recounted how he asked Young if he had any guns or weapons on him, and that Young handed Harvey a pocket knife.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 41:17-22 (Harvey). Harvey said that they wanted Young to stay with Smith while Harvey looked at the pickup truck and the water tank, because \"I didn't want him near the handgun, what I speculated to be the handgun.\" Tr. at 43:12-14 (Harvey). Harvey said that, when he saw blood and fecal matter on a white board in the water tank, he thought there might be another person nearby.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 45:17-23 (Harvey). When Harvey returned to Young and Smith, he looked into the truck bed and saw \"the butt of the gun, the grip of it.\" Tr. at 48:8-16 (Harvey). Harvey said that he then went to his police car and called to see if the truck was stolen and if there were any outstanding warrants for Young.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 49:2-10 (Harvey, Spiers). Once Harvey learned that Young was a felon, Harvey made the decision to arrest Young for being a felon in possession of a firearm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 50:1-13 (Harvey). The United States asked why Harvey did not Mirandize Young; Harvey explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   Because, one, I had seen him with the handgun already, so whatever he was going to say was irrelevant, because I'd seen him with it. And then, two, I'd confirmed that he was a felon. So at that point, I didn't need to Mirandize him. I already had him on felony charges.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Tr. at 51:3-10 (Spiers, Harvey). The United States asked Harvey whether, at that time, he had \"any interest in developing a statement from him,\" and Harvey replied: \"No, because I'd already seen him with [the firearm].\" Tr. at 59:11-13 (Spiers, Harvey).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Harvey stated that Young became \"very upset\" when he told Young that they would be towing the truck, which led Harvey to decide to \"have the vehicle sealed, towed, and then [get] a search warrant\n   performed on the vehicle.\" Tr. at 62:22-63:10 (Harvey).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   On cross examination, Young asked Harvey whether he was free to leave after he gave Harvey his pocketknife, and Harvey said Young was not free to leave.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 77:14-19 (Knoblauch, Harvey). The following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   Q. He was not free to leave, was he?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   Q. If he tried to leave, you would have stopped him right there? ...

Because at that point, I'm still investigating what's going on....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   Q. Okay. And if Mr. Young had gone to the truck and said: Okay, I'm getting in the truck, bye?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   A. I don't know. That situation didn't occur.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   Q. Would he have been free to leave?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   A. Probably. Because at that point, he wasn't under arrest. He was being detained, but he wasn't under arrest officially yet. I was trying to run that plate as fast as I could and try to figure out who he was, to see if he was a felon.... At that point, if he would have told me, ... I don't want to talk to you, and I want to leave, then I probably would have let him go.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Tr. at 77:19-78:25 (Knoblauch, Harvey). Next, Young asked Harvey whether he knew that certain felony convictions will not deprive a person's right to possesses a firearm, and Harvey answered that he was \"not real familiar with all those.\" Tr. at 81:9-13 (Knoblauch, Harvey). Harvey discussed the objects and fluids found in the empty water tank -- a \"water toy,\" fresh blood and fecal matter -- and said that, at the time, he wondered whether Young was \"keistering\" narcotics --\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , hiding drugs in his anus -- but that, later, it \"appeared ... that he was masturbating in the that water tank.\" Tr. 81:25-83:7 (Knoblauch, Harvey). Young then asked Harvey about Young's agitated reaction to learning that the truck would be towed, and Harvey admitted that Young's reaction was not recorded on video.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 84:3-11 (Knoblauch, Harvey).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Young then called a private investigator named William Elliott to the stand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 86:12-15 (Clerk, Elliott). Elliott asserted that, based on his investigation, the water tank is outside the Albuquerque city limits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 92:25-93:2 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The United States then argued that there was nothing coercive about the police officers' interaction with Young.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 103:23-24 (Spiers). The United States added that, if Young had not told Harvey that he had a pocket knife, \"in all likelihood, the officers wouldn't have patted him down and searched him for it, and it would have been the property that the defendant feels aggrieved about being detained [and] would not have even been an issue for argument.\" Tr. at 103:24-104:7 (Spiers).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The Court asked the United States when it considers the moment that it arrested Young, and the United States answered, \"[n]ot until his formal arrest,\" and that \"everything that preceded the actual arrest and followed from Officer Harvey learning that he was, in fact, a convicted felon was an investigatory stop and detention.\" Tr. at 106:23-107:6 (Court, Spiers). The Court asked when reasonable suspicion began, and the United States answered that it began as soon as Harvey saw Young, in light of the criminal activities that are known to happen on the West Mesa and because Harvey saw a lone pickup truck with its doors open -- indicating that it might be stolen -- and then seeing Young carrying something that looked like\n   a holstered firearm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 108:13-23 (Court, Spiers). The United States recognized that a power drill in a toolbelt harness might look like a holstered handgun from afar -- and vice versa -- but, given the setting, it makes sense to assume it is a handgun and not a drill.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 108:20-109:3 (Spiers). The United States summarized the factors giving rise to reasonable suspicion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   [T]he defendant ... was shirtless, tattooed, next to a car, a pickup truck, with an open driver's side door, emerging from a water tank, where no individual had been seen for five minutes prior, carrying what Officer Harvey inferred was a firearm, and then he put it in the truck, and ... wanted to distance himself from the truck and the offending weapon by coming closer to the officers. And then reasonable suspicion grew in its breadth when Officer Harvey went into the water tank and saw fresh blood and other artifacts that were abnormal to be seen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Tr. at 109:4-17 (Spiers).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The United States reiterated its view that the Court should not suppress the transcript on\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   grounds, because, according to the United States, Young made the statements while \"being detained in an investigatory capacity\" and not in a custodial interview. Tr. at 110:2-14 (Spiers). The United States concluded by asserting that the\n   <em>\n    Rhode Island v. Innis\n   </em>\n   analysis \"wasn't calibrated towards an interrogation-style dialogue with the defendant.\" Tr. at 111:7-11 (Spiers).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The Court addressed Young's arguments that the officers did not have jurisdictional authority on the West Mesa, wondering how a violation of state law violates the Constitution of the United States of America.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 113:23-114:4 (Court). Young recognized that this argument does not implicate well-tread constitutional principles, but argued that acting without jurisdictional authority implicates due process concerns and is also \"sort of a variation of the Silver Platter doctrine.\" Tr. at 113:22-114:5 (Knoblauch).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <strong>\n    5.\n    <em>\n     The Amended Response\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   After the hearing, the United States filed the Amended Response by the United States to the Defendant's Motion to Suppress, filed June 28, 2018 (Doc. 52)(\"Amended Response\").

He then observed Ceballos alter his route by making a U-turn and following the girl down a narrow, nearly deserted residential street. Ceballos pulled alongside the girl, who he did not know, and asked her if she wanted a ride. She refused, telling him she lived up the street. Ceballos then drove further down the road, pulled into a driveway\n   as if to turn around and return to the main road, but instead backed out and drove a few feet further east, in the same direction the girl was walking.

Garcia only speculates that Casuas\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   have found something. An officer is not required to exhaust every possible lead to satisfy the Fourth Amendment.

When [another officer] interviewed Garcia on the night of the incident, he asked Garcia whether Katz and Odom had a reason to beat him up, and informed him that he was being accused of choking K.J.... Garcia responded that Katz and Odom had no reason to beat him up, and denied hurting K.J., never mentioning that Katz and Odom might have beat him up or encouraged K.J. to accuse him because they were romantically interested in him..... During his interrogation after his arrest, Garcia never mentioned that Katz and Odom might have improper motives. The cases that Garcia cites establish only that the police may not ignore available material witnesses. Here, Thacker spoke with Garcia; Garcia denied doing wrong and never related that he may have been framed. Garcia presents no cases, and the Court could find none, suggesting that Casuas was required to repeat the steps other officers had already taken and re-interview all witnesses.... Finally, waiting for the laboratory results would not have substantially altered the probable-cause determination, because, while the New Mexico Department of Public Safety Forensic Laboratory found no semen, it does not have the capabilities to detect the presence of urine in or on a substance....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-210\">\n   Once probable cause is established, an officer is not required to continue to investigate for exculpatory evidence before arresting a suspect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cortez v.

In other words, Harvey expressed concern about weapons, took Young's pocketknife, indicated to Young that he would not return the knife until after he had took a look, and ordered Young to stay next to another police officer.

It was November and the temperature was in the 60s.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FOF \u00b6 22, at 7. Harvey saw Young carrying a dark object, which he placed in the bed of the pickup truck.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FOF \u00b6 37, at 8. Harvey thought that the dark object was a firearm in a holster.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FOF \u00b6 36, at 8. Young's torso was covered in tattoos, which Harvey thought were \"prison tattoos,\" because they were all blueish monochrome, and, in Harvey's experience, prison tattoos are not colorful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FOF \u00b6 32, at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   These facts and Harvey's inferences establish reasonable suspicion justifying detaining Young.

Harvey's experience with the West Mesa's criminal side is particularly strong. He was the lead officer on the West Mesa Murders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FOF 17, at 6. When Harvey spotted Young, he was within a half mile of the West Mesa Murder burial site.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 22:4-16 (Spiers, Harvey); FOF 21, at 7. Harvey has personally recovered scores of stolen vehicles left on the West Mesa.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FOF 18, at 6. He also personally discovered a drug drop site on the West Mesa.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FOF 4, at 4, Tr. at 36:17-37:16 (Harvey). There may be plenty of innocent uses for the West Mesa, but its criminal reputation is not undeserved. It is thus reasonable that activity on the West Mesa is more likely to indicate that criminal activity is afoot than those same actions elsewhere.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   The pickup truck with its driver's side door open weighs towards reasonable suspicion. Harvey stated that, based on his experience recovering stolen vehicles abandoned on the West Mesa, he looks for vehicles with their doors open, with their hoods up, with their wheels removed, that are burnt, or that have people standing nearby.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FOF \u00b6 19, at 6; Tr. at 26:13-19 (Harvey). Here, he spotted a red pickup truck next to an abandoned water tank with its driver's side door open; soon after spotting the pickup truck, he saw Young emerge from the water tank and drop a black object in the truck's bed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FOF \u00b6\u00b6 29, 36-37, at 7-8. To be sure, there is nothing illegal about parking a pickup truck on a mesa and leaving the driver's side door open. As the Court notes above, that observed actions are lawful is no bar to a police officer's reasonable suspicion determination, and a police officer need not eliminate an innocent explanation before lawfully detaining someone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Winder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3384105\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/557/1129/#p1134\">\n    557 F.3d 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1134. Had Harvey spotted this empty pickup truck with its door ajar parked in a residential driveway, the situation might not raise any eyebrows; parked out on the West Mesa --- a place known as a stolen vehicle repository -- next to an abandoned water tank, with no obvious purpose for being there, a police officer may reasonably wonder what the story is.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   Harvey spotting Young carrying what looked like a firearm weighs towards reasonable suspicion. The Court cautions that merely possessing a firearm may not, by itself, be enough to support reasonable suspicion.

Second, the detention's length was not excessive given the circumstances.

The important factors here are that Harvey saw a tattooed man holding a firearm, and that Harvey saw a man drop a firearm into a cluttered pickup truck bed and walk away from the truck moments after spotting the police officers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FOF \u00b6\u00b6 36-37, at 8. Harvey could reasonably wonder whether Young had a particular reason to want to not be caught by the police with a firearm.

The next question is whether Young made any incriminating statements in response to a question reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.

The only substantive question that Harvey poses is whether Young had ever previously been out to the West Mesa before.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Harvey Tr. at 14:4-5 (Harvey). The Court cannot say whether this question is reasonably likely to elicit an incriminatory response, because the Court does not see how Young's previous West Mesa experience might be incriminating.

Young essentially argues that, although Bowdich commissioned Harvey and Smith in 2000, there is no evidence that Sheriff Gonzales recommissioned Harvey and Smith before they arrested Young. Reply at 4. According to Young, because BCSO's Office Rules and Regulations require sworn personnel to renew their commission when a new Sheriff assumes office, the United States would need to show that\n   Gonzales, who succeeded Bowdich, commissioned Harvey and Smith before they arrested Young.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 4-5. Although the United States moved into evidence Harvey's current Special Deputy Commission Card, which Gonzales signed and has an expiration date of December 31, 2018,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Special Deputy Commission Card at 1-2, Young argues that the card proves nothing, because it does not indicate when it was issued,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 24:25-25:3 (Knoblauch)(objecting to the Special Deputy Commission Card's entry into evidence because it does not indicate when it was issued).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-306\">\n   The Court concludes that Harvey was commissioned to make arrests in Bernalillo County when he arrested Young. First, Harvey testified that the BSCO issued his current Special Deputy Commission card \"shortly\" after Gonzales came into office. Tr. at 24:18-21 (Spiers, Harvey). Gonzales was elected Sheriff in November, 2014,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FOF \u00b6 13, at 14, and Harvey arrested Young in November, 2016,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FOF \u00b6\u00b6 20, 74, at 13. Second, Sheriff Gonzales himself, in his Letter, indicates that, although Commissioned police officers get new Special Deputy Commission Cards each time there is a new Sheriff, those Special Deputy Commissions \"have been perpetual and reoccurring.\" Letter at 1. Gonzales also states that Harvey took his \"Oath of Office as a Special Deputy on December 11, 2000\" and \"has retained his arrest authority in Bernalillo County through his continued employment with the Albuquerque Police Department.\" Letter at 1. Gonzales' Letter indicates that Harvey's arrest authority in Bernalillo County never lapsed since it began in 2000 and that the Special Deputy Commission Card's status is not the determinative factor. Thus, even if the evidence showed that Harvey did not get his new Special Deputy Commission Card with Gonzales' signature on it until after he arrested Young, he still had authority to operate in Bernalillo County. The Bernalillo County Sherriff's Department Rules and Regulations do not indicate otherwise: it states that \"[s]worn personnel will renew their identification/commission cards\" in certain situations, such as when there has been \"an official change of administration.\" BCSO's Rules and Regulations \u00a7 206-5(B)(1), at 1. That language suggests merely that Commissioned officers must get new cards; it does not suggest that a change of administration renders all previous Commissions null, or that Commissioned officers must re-take their Oath of Office.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-307\">\n   Even if Harvey was not authorized to operate on the West Mesa, detaining and arresting Young would not violate his Fourth Amendment rights. To be sure, the Tenth Circuit has determined that a police officer arresting someone outside his or her jurisdiction can violate the Fourth Amendment. In\n   <em>\n    Ross v.

Young does not provide authority for the proposition that a law enforcement agency's partial federal funding changes the Fourth Amendment calculus under these circumstances, and the Court cannot find any. Nor does the Court think that the presence of federal funding should change the constitutional analysis. In\n   <em>\n    Mikulski\n   </em>\n   , the Tenth Circuit \"emphasized that state law allowed peace officers (with authorization) to act within neighboring political subdivisions, whereas in\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   , under no circumstances would the officer have had authority to act on tribal lands.\"\n   <em>\n    Swanson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4043574\" index=\"317\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/577/1196/#p1201\">\n    577 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1202 (citing\n   <em>\n    Mikulski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9344585\" index=\"318\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/317/1228/#p1232\">\n    317 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1232 ;\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1806710\" index=\"319\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/905/1349/#p1352\">\n    905 F.2d at 1353-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)

Aragones\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4129455\" index=\"339\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/483/415/\">\n     483 F. App'x at 416\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (factoring into the reasonable suspicion calculation that the police officer noticed the individual had a neck tattoo that was \"consistent with gang affiliation\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-332\">\n    At the hearing, Young asked Harvey whether he knew that certain felony convictions will not deprive a person's right to possesses a firearm, and Harvey answered that he was \"not real familiar with all those.\" Tr. at 81:9-13 (Knoblauch, Harvey). To the extent that Young contends that Harvey lacked reasonable suspicion that Young was a felon in possession of a firearm, because certain felony convictions do not implicate a person's right to carry a firearm, the argument is unpersuasive. To be sure,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"340\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (g)(1) -- which makes it a crime for anyone \"who has been convicted ... of ... a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" to possess a firearm excludes certain crimes -- does not apply to people whose felony convictions \"pertain[ ] to antitrust violations, unfair trade practices, restraints of trade, or other similar offenses relating to the regulation of business practices,\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"341\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(20)(A). The possibility that a someone's felony conviction might one of the few felonies not qualifying for the being a felon in possession of a firearm crime is too insignificant to vitiate a police officer's otherwise valid reasonable suspicion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-333\">\n    There is some confusion about what Young said. At the hearing, the parties recognized that one of the videos and its corresponding transcript that the United States entered into evidence does not involve Young and is unrelated to this case.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tr. at 5:20-6:7 (Knoblauch); Tr. at 54:1-19 (Knoblauch, Court, Spiers)(agreeing that the conversation is irrelevant to this case and that the Court should ignore the Harvey Tr. after line 2 on page 20). Consequently, much of the United States' arguments in the Response are irrelevant as well, because the United States bases its arguments on that irrelevant conversation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Response at 12 (summarizing the irrelevant conversation and arguing that the speaker made his statements voluntarily). The Court therefore considers the only video that captures Young speaking after his arrest, which is Lapel Video 3.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Harvey Tr. at 13:6-20:2.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-334\">\n    As mentioned\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , the Harvey Tr. indicates that Harvey had this conversation with Smith, but the Court is confident that Harvey is speaking with Young as he walked Young to a waiting police car.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-335\">\n    The Court's decision to deny Young's post-arrest statement suppression request is limited to the statements that Young made in the conversation with Harvey excerpted above. Although Young, in his Motion, contends that, during the ride in custody from the West Mesa to the police station, Brown did not Mirandize Young and also \"continued to talk to Mr. Young\" during which time \"potentially inculpatory information was elicited from him.\" Motion at 5. The Court cannot determine whether those statements should be suppressed for failure to Mirandize, because the Court has no evidence of that exchange. Thus the Court does not know what, if anything, Young told Brown, nor can the Court determine whether Brown interrogated Young. Given that Young bears the burden of proof to show that the Court should suppress the evidence,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.
