On February 29, 2016, an individual named \"Mr. Medrano\" physically assaulted Owens while Owens was awaiting arraignment at the San Juan County courthouse. Complaint at 2. The assault was racially motivated, and Correctional Officer Yates \"did not restrain Medrano until Mr. Owens had suffered a dislocated shoulder, a broken digit, busted dentures and a broken nose.\" Complaint at 2. After the assault, Owens was denied medical treatment, denied access to an informal complaint, and deprived of his court appearance, because \"he could not summon his witness again until much later.\" Complaint at 3. The Complaint seeks compensatory damages against Defendants San Juan County, San Juan County Detention Center, and San Juan County Sheriff's Department for the alleged violation of Owens' rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States of America.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint at 1, 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court has the discretion to dismiss an in forma pauperis complaint sua sponte under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B) and 1915A at any time if the action is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B), 1915A(b). \"Dismissal of a pro se complaint for failure to state a claim is proper only where it is obvious that the plaintiff cannot prevail on the facts he has alleged and it would be\n   futile to give him an opportunity to amend.\"\n   <em>\n    Kay v.
