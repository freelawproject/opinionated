Any person desiring to own, possess or keep more than five dogs or cats or any combination thereof at any one time, in an area zoned as business or industrial, with the exception of a litter or a portion of a litter of pups or kittens less than four months old, shall first obtain a permit from the City as provided in this section and shall additionally obtain such other licenses as may be required by the Ohio Revised Code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ECF No. 42-1 at PageID: # 729, Stip. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   According to Defendants, a prosecution under either ordinance is a multi-phase process which generally involves: (1) a party making a complaint to a License Technician, typically Defendant Shirley Moore; (2) the License Technician sending a letter to the person residing at the home warning her that she is violating an ordinance; and (3) a follow-up visit to the property at least 30 days after the letter is sent to determine if the resident is still in violation of the ordinance.

Plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of the amended Codified Ordinance 505.14 (hereinafter \"the Ordinance\") ECF. No. 66 at PageID: # 2522, \u00b6 1. Plaintiffs allege the Ordinance: (1) is void for vagueness; (2) denies Plaintiffs the Freedom of Association guaranteed under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution; and (3) criminalizes status.

Void for Vagueness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Pursuant to the Fourth Amended Class Action Complaint, filed on April 27, 2018, Plaintiffs allege that Plaintiff Julie Roth currently resides with Plaintiff Michael T. Roth and their seven dogs and two cats, potentially leaving both individuals amenable to be in violation of the Ordinance. ECF No. 66 at PageID # :5, \u00b6\u00b6 27, 28. These Plaintiffs are arguably engaging in conduct proscribed by the Ordinance since they have more than five dogs or cats under their control. Additionally, the record indicates that Defendants have enforced Canton Codified Ordinance 505.15 against Plaintiff Julie Roth in the past. ECF No. 66 at PageID # : 37, \u00b6 189. Similar to\n   <em>\n    Kiser\n   </em>\n   , in which the court found that a plaintiff receiving an enforcement letter and response from a board threatening to impose sanctions resulted in a credible fear of prosecution, Plaintiff Julie Roth's past criminal proceedings and enforcement letter create a credible fear of prosecution under the Ordinance.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4184610\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/765/601/#p607\">\n    765 F.3d at 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have met the injury-in-fact requirement because they allege an intention to engage in conduct arguably affecting a constitutional interest, proscribed in the Ordinance, and have a credible threat of prosecution thereunder. Since the threatened\n   enforcement of the allegedly vague ordinance inhibits Plaintiffs due process rights, and the injury can be redressed by enjoining enforcement of the Ordinance, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have met all the requirements necessary to have standing to assert the void for vagueness claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Freedom of Association\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs argue that because visitors or intimate partners, who own dogs or cats, cannot bring their own pets to another home in the City of Canton without violating Section 505.14, the Ordinance violates Plaintiffs' First Amendment Right of Association. ECF No. 40-1 at PageID: # 661-62. The record indicates that Defendants have not enforced the Ordinance against individuals who stay at each other's home overnight and, therefore, Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate past injury. Therefore, to meet the injury-in-fact requirement, Plaintiffs must allege an intention to engage in conduct proscribed by the Ordinance and have a credible threat of prosecution thereunder.\n   <em>\n    Kiser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4184610\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/765/601/#p607\">\n    765 F.3d at 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because they do not demonstrate a credible threat of prosecution for visiting one another's homes with pets in tow, Plaintiffs have not alleged an injury-in-fact. Therefore, they lack standing to assert the Freedom of Association claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Status\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Lastly, Plaintiffs argue that although under Ohio law a landlord is not in control of a premises which he rents to a tenant, Defendants punish landowners based on status when they send enforcement letters informing them that they are responsible for violating the Ordinance. ECF No. 40-1 at PageID: # 662. Plaintiffs allege that the Ordinance has been applied to landlords by referring to an enforcement letter sent to Greg Swift. ECF No. 66 at PageID # : 2562, \u00b6\u00b6 221-24. None of the plaintiffs, however, allege that they are landlords (or intend to be landlords), and it is well-established that a plaintiff \"cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Warth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9528\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/490/#p499\">\n    422 U.S. at 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9528\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/490/#p499\">\n    95 S.Ct. 2197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, since Plaintiffs fail to allege an intention to engage in conduct arguably affecting a constitutional interest, Plaintiffs have not met the injury-in-fact requirement, and accordingly lack standing to bring this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Having found that Plaintiffs have standing to sue on their void for vagueness claim, the Court shall assess the likelihood of success on the merits that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the Ordinance is unconstitutionally vague, as applied to them, because the Ordinance fails to provide adequate notice and because Defendants have no rules, regulations, guidelines, standards or procedures set forth to govern their interpretation of the Ordinance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 66 at PageID # :, \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. Specifically, Plaintiffs argue that the Ordinance's construction and Defendants' failure to define terms, arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, and misleading application of the words in practice renders the Ordinance void for vagueness. ECF No. 40-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments provide the constitutional foundation for the void for vagueness doctrine.\n   <em>\n    Columbia Natural Resources, Inc. v.

ECF No. 40-1 at PageID # : 651. Defendants respond that when \"not\" precedes a list with \"or\" being used, the singular negation effect turns the list from disjunctive to conjunctive. ECF No. 44 at PageID # : 744.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Under Plaintiffs' interpretation, a person possessing four cats, keeping four dogs, and harboring four dogs would not violate the Ordinance. A fair reading of the Ordinance, however, does not comport with this interpretation. Since the Ordinance states that \"a person may not possess, keep, harbor, or permit to be possessed ...\n   <em>\n    a total of more than\n   </em>\n   five dogs or cats,\" the Court finds that a potential violator is put on notice that the\n   <em>\n    total\n   </em>\n   number of animals an individual can keep, harbor, or possess, is limited to five. ECF No. 42-1 at PageID # : 729, Stip. 4 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs argue that by failing to define \"own,\" \"possess,\" \"keep,\" or \"harbor,\" ordinary people cannot fully understand what conduct is prohibited under the Ordinance. ECF No. 40-1 at PageID # : 653. Defendants contend that since \"own\" is no longer in the Ordinance, and \"harbor\" is defined in the Ordinance as \"to give shelter or refuge to,\" the only terms left to define are \"possess\" and \"keep.\" ECF No. 44 at PageID # : 745; ECF No. 42-1 at PageID # : 729, Stip. 4. Because \"possess\" and \"keep\" are within the grasp of ordinary people, according to Defendants, the failure to define these words does not render the Ordinance void for vagueness. ECF No. 44 at PageID # : 745.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Generally, \"failure to define a term within a statute or ordinance does not render the statute unconstitutionally vague, where the common meaning of the word provides both adequate notice of the conduct prohibited and of the standards for enforcement.\"\n   <em>\n    Belle Maer Harbor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11586791\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/170/553/#p557\">\n    170 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   558 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Defendants do not define \"possess\" and \"keep\" within the Ordinance, and do not provide potential violators with the standards the License Technicians use to enforce the Ordinance. Potential violators are left wondering what connotes \"possession\" or \"keeping,\" while License Technicians are not expected to reference any guidelines\n   in enforcing an ordinance that is accompanied with criminal sanctions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Enforcement letters have been sent out to potential violators stating that \"if you are feeding, you are considered the owner.\" ECF No. 66-4 at PageID # : 2696. An ordinary individual would not associate the act of feeding with ownership of an animal. The record indicates that Defendant Shirley Moore has also deemed an individual to be the owner of an animal based off of the duration a bowl of food was left for the animal. Affidavit of Sandra Hoover (ECF No. 40-4) at \u00b6 6. These issues pertaining to what connotes ownership would not be an issue if the Ordinance was enforced in a way that properly informed an individual of the law they violated. Instead, the record indicates that Defendants have sent out enforcement letters with the pre-2017 ordinance language despite the amendment that deleted the word \"own.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 40-3 at PageID # : 717.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants have also used \"per household\" language in the enforcement letters, although the Ordinance explicitly applies to individuals. ECF No. 66-8 at PageID # : 2750. If the goal of these letters is \"compliance,\" the letters should state the correct language of the law individuals are expected to comply with. ECF No. 71-1 at PageID # : 3186.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Individuals have also been sent enforcement letters for having cats or dogs \"habitually residing\" or for \"feeding\" on the property although neither the pre-2017 Ordinance nor the Ordinance have that language. ECF Nos. 66-14 and 66-16. Defendants argue that those terms are used when the License Technician lacks sufficient information to determine whether a person \"owns the animals or is harboring, keeping, or possessing strays.\" Affidavit of Shirley Moore (ECF No. 71-1) at PageID # : 3186-87, \u00b6 8. In Defendants' Memorandum in Opposition to the within motion, however, Defendants note that feeding stray animals may very well constitute \"harboring\" or \"keeping.\" ECF No. 44 at PageID # : 748. If that is so, there would be no need for the License Technician to use \"habitually residing\" or \"feeding\" in the enforcement letters. These conflicting definitions and explanations give rise to the ambiguity that renders the Ordinance vague to a resident of the City of Canton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   It is true that the Fourteenth Amendment does not require the language to be \"mathematically precise,\" but it does require that individuals are put on adequate notice that their conduct violates the law.\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

Arbitrary enforcement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Ordinance must also establish standards to permit police to enforce the law in a non-arbitrary, non-discriminatory manner.\n   <em>\n    Belle Maer Harbor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11586791\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/170/553/#p557\">\n    170 F.3d at 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a practical matter, the Supreme Court of the United States considers this the most important concern because it \"reflects the common sense understanding that the average citizen does not read, at\n   his leisure, every federal, state, and local statute to which he is subject.\"\n   <em>\n    Columbia Nat. Resources, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7412886\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/58/1101/#p1104\">\n    58 F.3d at 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   First, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants are acting arbitrarily because they do not identify which animals an individual possesses, which animals an individual keeps, and which animals an individual harbors. ECF No. 40-1 at PageID # : 658. Second, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants are enforcing the Ordinance against those who have birds or stray cats on their property. ECF No. 40-1 at PageID # : 659-70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendants maintain that they are not obligated to prove which cats or dogs a person possesses, keeps, or harbors. ECF No. 44 at PageID # : 747-48. Defendants also argue that the two letters Plaintiffs rely on to conclude that the Ordinance applies to birds is misguided and that the Ordinance can be construed to apply to stray cats without being void for vagueness. ECF No. 44 at PageID # : 748.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Under Plaintiffs' rationale, a License Technician would have to extend vast amounts of time and resources to deduce which cats or dogs an individual possesses, keeps, or harbors. This is all expected to be done without entering the home and infringing on the homeowner's constitutional right against unlawful search and seizure. Any confusion arising from which animals an individual possesses, keeps, or harbors, could be solved by providing residents of the City of Canton with clear definitions of what \"keep\" and \"possess\" mean, and which animals the Ordinance applies to (stray or pets), so that individuals can conform their behavior to comply with the Ordinance. These definitions would also benefit License Technicians, who may reference these definitions to ensure that the Ordinance is uniformly enforced throughout the City of Canton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiffs' contention that the Ordinance applies to birds is unavailing. Enforcement Letter 1, ECF No. 40-2 at PageID # : 677, mentions a bird, but, the ordinance at issue in that enforcement letter is not Ordinance 505.14. Enforcement Letter 2, ECF No. 40-2 at PageID # : 685, states that a person with seven dogs and one bird was in violation of the Ordinance. As noted in Defendant Shirley Moore's deposition, the License Technician simply writes down the complaint she receives. ECF No. 66-3 at Tr. Pg. 26. In the case of Enforcement Letter 2, a bird was only mentioned in the letter because the person complained about the resident having seven dogs and a bird on the property. ECF No. 40-2 at PageID # : 685. The Court finds that these letters are inadequate to support Plaintiffs argument that the Ordinance applies to birds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Lastly, the Court finds that Defendants' lack of guidelines, rules, and procedures permits License Technicians to enforce the Ordinance in an arbitrary manner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 66 at PageID # : 2523, \u00b6 8. Defendant Shirley Moore's deposition regarding counting strays in the animal limit is probative:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    Q.\n   </strong>\n   Depending on the situation on whether the cat is staying around or going?

No. 66-3 at Tr. Pgs. 63-64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Court finds that Defendants use their own discretion in deciding if an animal is counted in the animal limit and the Ordinance does not provide an ordinary individual with notice that an animal is included in the dog or cat limit count based off of the duration of time it is on the property. Defendants argue that the License Technician follows a process by providing an individual with an enforcement letter that addresses: (1) which ordinance the individual is violating; (2) why they are in violation of the ordinance; and, (3) a phone number the violator can call if they have any questions. ECF. No. 44 at PageID: # 740-41. This process would likely be adequate if the enforcement letters actually used the specific language of the Ordinance and the letters did not strain the definitions of the language in the Ordinance to include conduct an ordinary individual would not expect it to encompass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In sum, the Court finds there is merit to the void for vagueness claim. Moreover, when a constitutional violation is likely, there is potential for irreparable injury and Defendants do not have a valid interest in enforcing an unconstitutional ordinance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood Ass'n of Cincinnati, Inc. v.
