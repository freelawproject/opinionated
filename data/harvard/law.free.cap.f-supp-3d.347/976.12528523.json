For the reasons set forth below, the court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Edwards's motion. The Third-Party Complaint filed by Third-Party Plaintiffs Evergreen Strategies, LLC and Relay Advanced Materials, Inc. is dismissed without prejudice as to Edwards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Third-Party Plaintiffs Evergreen and Relay Advanced Materials (RAM) bring suit against Third-Party Defendant Brian Edwards, CEO of Celtig, LLC, on two counts: tortious interference with economic relations and civil conspiracy. Third-Party Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 121-26; 153-58. Edwards moves to dismiss the claims against him for lack of personal jurisdiction. Motion to Dismiss (\"Motion\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Evergreen and RAM allege personal jurisdiction over Edwards arising from his actions \"in furtherance of the common scheme to commit tortious and contractual breaches\" that caused \"tortious injury\" to Third-Party Plaintiffs in the state of Utah, \"pursuant to Utah Code \u00a7 78B-3-205(3).\" Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 13, 22. Evergreen and RAM have not alleged that Edwards is domiciled in the state of Utah, which would subject Edwards to the court's general jurisdiction. Therefore, to establish personal jurisdiction over Edwards individually, Evergreen and RAM must meet their burden of showing that Edwards intentionally caused Third-Party Plaintiffs harm within the state of Utah. As Evergreen and RAM have failed to allege a prima facie case of conspiracy involving Edwards, the court must dismiss, without prejudice, the claims against Edwards for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This case involves a business dispute between the parties regarding the substance graphene, a \"unique substance that has not been easily or economically produced.\" Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 1. Plaintiff and Third-Party Defendant Celtig L.L.C. is a Tennessee limited liability company that created a process allowing for the mass production of graphene at low cost. Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 1, 8. On or about March 28, 2017, Evergreen, a Nevada limited liability company with offices in Utah County, Utah, signed two business agreements with Celtig: the Definitive Agreement and the\n   <em>\n    Exclusive License and Distribution Agreement\n   </em>\n   (\"Licensing Agreement\"). Third-Party Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 25. On or about the same day, Evergreen\n   and Impel Sales LLC, a Utah limited liability company (Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 16), entered into the \"Impel Agreement.\" Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 65. Finally, as part of the negotiations, Third-Party Plaintiff Relay Advanced Materials, Inc. (\"RAM\"), a Delaware corporation whose principal place of business is Lindon, Utah, was formed \"for the purpose of purchasing product from Celtig.\" Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Conflict between the parties concerning the Definitive Agreement arose almost immediately after the signing. Section 1 of the Definitive Agreement calls for Evergreen to pre-pay $750,015 for the purchase of 833,350 grams of graphene from Celtig within three business days following execution of the agreement. Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 27. Evergreen and RAM allege that Evergreen pre-paid the $750,015, but Celtig failed to deliver the 833,350 grams of graphene. Third-Party Compl. 29. Evergreen alleges that Celtig refused to deliver the graphene because it was unable to produce graphene that met the quality and purity standards to which the parties agreed. Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 30. Evergreen and RAM also allege that Celtig refused to deliver the graphene because of concerted actions taken by the \"Conspirators.\" The Conspirators allegedly mischaracterized the requirements of the Definitive Agreement to make it appear that the $750,015 payment was for graphene that Celtig would produce at a later date and that the graphene would need to be paid for again before delivery. Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 32. These mischaracterizations made it appear to Celtig that Evergreen breached the Definitive Agreement. Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. THE CONSPIRACY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The \"Conspirators\" allegedly include Brent Benjamin Woodson, Phillip Cox, Michael Gunderson, Tibor Kalnoki-kes, David Nielson, David Waite, Brian Edwards, ULLC, Impel Sales, and \"other Doe Defendants.\" Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 85. According to Evergreen, the Conspirators \"precipitated the instant dispute between Evergreen and Celtig,\" and are \"liable for any damages Celtig may prove against Evergreen.\" Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 124. The Conspirators allegedly made it appear that Evergreen breached the Definitive Agreement, but in actuality, it was Celtig that breached the Definitive Agreement on multiple occasions. Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 34-45. Celtig also allegedly breached the requirements of the Licensing Agreement. Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 58. According to Evergreen and RAM, \"some or all of these breaches by Celtig are the result of the concerted action of some or all of the Conspirators.\" Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Conspirators allegedly also attempted to directly interfere with the business agreements between Celtig, Evergreen, and RAM by establishing competing businesses. In April 2017, Cox allegedly formed \"a series of companies\" to \"supplant Evergreen and RAM.\" Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 87. On or about August 18, 2017, Woodson and Kalnoki-kes allegedly formed ULLC for the purpose of competing with RAM, in violation of their employment agreements. Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 70. Nielson and Waite allegedly worked in concert with Woodson and Kalnoki-kes to establish ULLC. Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 80, 82. It is not alleged that Edwards had any involvement with this part of the scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After six months of failed business negotiations, on or about September 11, 2017, Edwards, acting on behalf of Celtig, attempted to terminate the Definitive Agreement and the Licensing Agreement by sending an email to the President of RAM and Evergreen. Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 91.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   According to Evergreen, Celtig's attempts to terminate the Definitive Agreement and Licensing Agreement were without cause. Third-Party Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 53, 62. Evergreen and RAM allege that \"[b]ut for the tortious activities of the Conspirators, no attempt would have been made by Celtig to terminate the Definitive Agreement\" or the \"Licensing Agreement,\" two actions which \"furthered the aims of the Conspirators.\" Third-Party Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 54, 62, 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   RAM and Evergreen did not receive the email terminating the agreements until three days later, on September 14, 2017, allegedly because Edwards did not address the email to the correct email address per the notice provisions of the agreements. Instead, Edwards sent the email to the President's \"relaycorp.com\" email, which allegedly had been tampered with by Woodson. Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 92. It is alleged that Woodson, one of the Conspirators, on or about September 7, 2017, used his control of RAM's email server, \"relaycorp.com\" to prevent the President of RAM and Evergreen from accessing his email address. Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 90. The correct email address could not have been tampered with by Woodson. Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 91.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   During the same time period, on or about September 12, 2017, someone at RAM informed Celtig that Woodson was going to be fired in a communication marked \"CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\" Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 93. Edwards was allegedly bound, as CEO of Celtig, by the Definitive Agreement and the Licensing Agreement, which contained confidentiality provisions prohibiting \"disclosing confidential information to third parties without the consent of Evergreen.\" Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 47. Edwards had been informed the communicated information was confidential per the terms of the agreements between Celtig and Evergreen. Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 94. Despite this, Edwards told Woodson that he was going to be fired. Woodson quit the next day, on or about September 13, 2017. Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C. THE LAWSUIT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On September 14, 2017, Evergreen learned that Edwards, Cox, and Celtig had jointly retained an attorney in Salt Lake City, Utah. Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 96. On September 26, 2017, Celtig filed suit against RAM and Evergreen, alleging, among other things, breach of contract and fraud. Motion 3. Evergreen and RAM filed their Third-Party Complaint on November 1, 2017. Evergreen and RAM allege that the Conspirators tortiously and intentionally interfered with Evergreen's contractual relationship with Celtig in order to appropriate the benefits of the contracts for themselves, as well as conspiring to damage Evergreen and RAM's \"relationships with potential partners.\" Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 86; 4. As a result of their actions, and the breaches by Celtig, Evergreen and RAM allege they have been harmed in an amount \"which conservatively exceeds $5 billion dollars [sic].\" Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A. PERSONAL JURISDICTION GENERALLY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Edwards moves to dismiss with prejudice Evergreen and RAM's Third-Party Complaint against Edwards for lack of personal jurisdiction.

Both parties allege that Edwards \"resides\" in Tennessee. Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 13; Motion 3. As Edwards is an out-of-state defendant, the court must look to Utah's long-arm statute. Utah's long-arm statute extends jurisdiction \"to the fullest extent permitted by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78B-3-201(3).

Johndrow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879938\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/553/\">\n    2015 UT 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 45,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879938\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/553/\">\n    345 P.3d 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 561. It now appears that, under Utah law, a plaintiff can no longer establish the improper means element of a claim for intentional interference based solely on the defendant's\n   motivation for breaching its own contract. Indeed, it would be inconsistent with the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Eldridge\n   </em>\n   to consider a party's motivation for breaching its contract in determining whether the party could satisfy the improper means element of a claim for either tortious interference with existing or prospective economic relations. In other words, the efficient breach defense is available to defendants in any tortious interference with economic relations action. This is the same conclusion reached in\n   <em>\n    Vasquez v. Trinity Mission Health\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:11-CV-01002-EJF,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%204095157\">\n    2013 WL 4095157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *21 (D.

This approach is consistent with\n   <em>\n    Eldridge\n   </em>\n   and other Utah Supreme Court cases that have included tortious interference with prospective economic advantage in their analysis of tortious interference with economic relations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson Dev.

Because the former, pivotal difference regarding the efficient breach defense appears to have been eliminated by\n   <em>\n    Eldridge\n   </em>\n   , the court will analyze the claims together as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   To support their claim for tortious interference, Evergreen and RAM allege that Edwards, acting on behalf of Celtig, attempted to unilaterally terminate the agreements between Celtig and Evergreen. Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 91. They allege that he did so by sending an email to an email address that had been compromised by Woodson. Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 91. They allege that Celtig's attempts (through Edwards) to unilaterally terminate the Definitive Agreement and Licensing Agreement were breaches of contract undertaken in an attempt to deprive Evergreen of economic advantages. Third-Party Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 53-54. However, because Edwards acted as the agent of Celtig in communicating with Evergreen and RAM, and Celtig was party to the terminated agreements, Edwards cannot be held liable for tortious interference, because he was entitled to terminate the agreements on Celtig's behalf under an efficient breach theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Evergreen and RAM also allege that Edwards acted \"in furtherance of this conspiracy\" by providing Woodson with confidential information in breach of confidentiality provisions in the Definitive and Licensing Agreements. Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 94; Opposition 4. Edwards signed those agreements on behalf of Celtig, and was bound by them in his official capacity. Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 13. Again, however, Celtig's alleged breach of these agreements does not give rise to a claim of tortious interference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   To hold Edwards personally liable for tortious interference, Evergreen and RAM would need to establish that Edwards, acting in his personal capacity, and not on behalf of Celtig, interfered with the economic relations between Celtig, RAM, and Evergreen. As stated, Edwards cannot be held liable for interfering with the\n   agreements in his role of CEO because he represented Celtig, which was a party to the agreements. At most, Evergreen and RAM may be able to argue that Edwards interfered with the employment contract between Woodson and RAM when he warned Woodson, enabling Woodson to quit before he could be fired by RAM. But Edwards's alleged actions did not cause any harm that RAM did not already intend to bring about. And in any event, the alleged actions do not rise to the level of \"improper means\" necessary to establish tortious interference. Under Utah law, to qualify as improper means, an action must be \"contrary to law, such as violations of statutes, regulations, or recognized common-law rules,\" including \"violence, threats or other intimidation, deceit or misrepresentation, bribery, unfounded litigation, defamation, or disparaging falsehood.\"\n   <em>\n    SCO Grp., Inc. v.

The claims brought against Edwards in the third-party complaint do arise from his alleged contacts with Utah, which relate exclusively to the present dispute. As discussed above, however, the contacts as alleged are insufficient to establish minimum contacts with the forum.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      c. Insufficient Contacts\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Due process requires that a defendant have minimum contacts with the forum state before the court may exercise personal jurisdiction over him. Evergreen and RAM have failed to allege minimum contacts between the state of Utah and Edwards acting in his personal capacity, and thus have failed to meet their burden of establishing personal jurisdiction over him.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    The minimum contacts analysis examines whether a defendant purposefully directed activity at the forum and whether the claims against him arise from his contacts with the state. When personal jurisdiction, as here, is based on a civil conspiracy directed at the forum state, plaintiffs must allege a prima facie case of civil conspiracy involving the defendant. Evergreen and RAM have failed to allege a prima facie case of civil conspiracy. They have failed to allege sufficient facts to establish a meeting of the minds between Edwards and other parties. They have failed to establish that Edwards participated in the underlying tort of tortious interference with economic relations. Accordingly, the court cannot exercise personal jurisdiction over Edwards.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    <strong>\n     2. Traditional Notions of Fair Play and Substantial Justice (Reasonableness)\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    To satisfy due process, a party seeking to establish personal jurisdiction\n    over a defendant must not only establish that the defendant had minimum contacts with the forum, it must also establish that the exercise of personal jurisdiction comports with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Asahi Metal Indus.

Third-Party Plaintiffs also fail to satisfy this independent requirement. The court concludes that it cannot exercise personal jurisdiction over Edwards because doing so would violate notions of fair play and substantial justice.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Whether jurisdiction is reasonable in accordance with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice depends on five factors:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n    (1) the burden on the defendant, (2) the forum state's interest in resolving the dispute, (3) the plaintiff's interest in receiving convenient and effective relief, (4) the interstate judicial system's interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies, and (5) the shared interest of the several states in furthering fundamental social policies.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    <em>\n     Pro Axess, Inc. v.

Edwards \"resides\" in Tennessee, and the burden on Edwards to travel to Utah would be high. Furthermore, both Utah and Third-Party plaintiffs' interests in resolving the dispute efficiently can be satisfied without Edwards. Any contact he has had with Utah has been in his role as CEO of Celtig and Celtig is a party to the suit. Thus, naming Edwards as a defendant in his personal capacity is unnecessary. Under these circumstances, the court accordingly concludes that it would be unreasonable to exercise personal jurisdiction over Edwards. Evergreen and RAM may choose to pursue further claims against Edwards, but those actions must be brought in a forum in which he is subject to personal jurisdiction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    <strong>\n     IV.
