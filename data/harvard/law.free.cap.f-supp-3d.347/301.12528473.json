They seek an injunction prohibiting Defendants from enforcing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20PA%20520\">\n    2016 PA 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and requiring them to allow out-of-state wine retailers to distribute wine directly to consumers in Michigan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The laws governing wine retailing in Michigan were amended by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20PA%20520\">\n    2016 PA 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   on March 29, 2017. The old laws allowed licensed Michigan retailers, and retailers from other states with similar licenses, to ship wine to Michigan consumers only by using their own employees and not by using a third party-delivery service. M.C.L.A. 436.1203,\n   <em>\n    effective\n   </em>\n   from March 25, 2014 to March 28, 2017. The new laws permit certain Michigan wine retailers to sell, ship, and deliver alcoholic beverages directly to Michigan customers by using a licensed third party carrier, but they prohibit out-of-state retailers from shipping to Michigan customers by any means. M.C.L.A. 436.1203. The law thus expanded the shipping rights of Michigan retailers while eliminating the shipping rights of out-of-state retailers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The MLCC, by way of the Michigan Liquor Control Code, controls and regulates the sale and importation of alcohol through a three-tier distribution system of suppliers, wholesalers, and retailers. Licensed suppliers sell beer, wine, and mixed spirits to licensed wholesalers, who in turn sell these products to licensed retailers. Licensed retailers may only purchase wine from licensed Michigan wholesalers. Licensed retailers then sell alcohol to consumers. The MLCC exercises its powers over the three tiers of distribution to regulate the behavior of market participants. For instance, retailers are forbidden to negotiate volume discounts with wholesalers or purchases on credit. Mich. Comp. L. \u00a7 436.1609a(5) ; Mich. Admin. Code, R, 436.1625(5), 436.1726(4). Michigan also requires wholesalers to \"post-and-hold\" prices to police against industry favoritism or covert volume discounts. Mich. Admin. Code, R. 436.1726.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    PLAINTIFFS' LAWSUIT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs challenge the new version of M.C.L. \u00a7 436.1203(2), as enacted on January 5, 2017. The law permits retailers who obtain specially designated merchant (\"SDM\") licenses to deliver wine to Michigan consumers using a common carrier, their own vehicle, or a third-party facilitator. M.C.L. \u00a7\u00a7 436.1203(3), (12), and (15). These provisions do not apply to Lebamoff Enterprises, Inc., however, because as an \"outstate seller of wine,\" it is ineligible to become \"licensed as a specially designated merchant.\" M.C.L. \u00a7 436.1607(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff Lebamoff Enterprises, Inc.

Many of Lebamoff's customers live in cities in southwest Michigan and have requested that Lebamoff ship wine to them. (Pls.' Ex. 2 at \u00b6 2). Lebamoff is unable to do so however, despite being fully equipped to ship and deliver wine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6). Plaintiff Joseph Doust is a wine merchant and one of the co-owners of Lebamoff Enterprises. Plaintiffs Richard Donovan, Jack Strike, and Jack Schulz are Michigan wine consumers who wish to be able to order wine from out-of-state retailers. They prefer to order wine on the internet, and they allege that many of their desired vintages are not\n   available in the Michigan market. (Pls.

Michigan retains its Twenty-first Amendment powers to maintain a closed three tier system, just as it remained free after\n   <em>\n    Granholm\n   </em>\n   to prohibit wineries from shipping directly to consumers. But when it starts carving exceptions out of that system, it must do so without resorting to economic protectionism.

Given that simply outlawing retail wine shipping without providing an exception for SDMs would likely accomplish the following four objectives, and that the State has operated a non-discriminatory retail regime in the past, Defendants seem foreclosed from meeting their burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Nevertheless, Defendants argue that four legitimate local purposes will save wine retailer-delivery discrimination from a Commerce Clause challenge. The Court considers each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    1. Administrative Overburdening\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The State argues that Michigan cannot feasibly regulate a nationwide market of wine retailers. The MLCC opines that 338,000 retailers nationwide could be eligible for licenses and references the heavy burden that licensing and regulating out-of-state wine retailers will entail. (Defs.' Ex. B, at \u00b6 13). Plaintiffs argue that only a tiny fraction of these retailers will in fact apply for a license, as was the case in New Hampshire, and that the costs of running a shipping business will prevent the market from becoming saturated with out-of-state retailers. (Pls.' Ex. 14 &amp; 15). It is impossible to know just how many applicants an expanded SDM license eligibility would create, but the State has not demonstrated that no reasonable alternatives exist to prevent administrative overflow. The MLCC could for instance tighten regulations with other non-discriminatory requirements or increase its application fees. The State cannot justify restricting market access to local businesses merely by pleading regulatory frugality and pointing out that Michigan has fewer potential licensees than the whole country.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    2. Youth Access\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The State argues that licensing out-of-state retailers to deliver wine would substantially increase the risk of minors obtaining alcohol. Defendants provide evidence that out-of-state direct shippers have sold more wine to minors during investigatory control sales. (Defs.' Ex. D at \u00b6 18; Ex. C at \u00b6 14). The\n   <em>\n    Granholm\n   </em>\n   Court already considered and rejected the justification of preventing youth access for winery direct shipments, finding that the states needed not only to show that a problem existed but also that alternative mechanisms could not solve that problem.\n   <em>\n    Granholm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5881890\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/460/\">\n    544 U.S. at 489-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5881890\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/460/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that online wine shipping is an unattractive means for minors to procure alcohol, and noting less restrictive alternatives to foreclosing youth access to wine).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Preventing underage wine sales fails as a justification because the point-of-enforcement is on the delivery end. Michigan law provides that wine must be shipped in a specially marked package, and that only someone at least 21 years of age can accept delivery. M.L.C. 436.1203(15). Third party shippers must be approved by the MLCC and must keep records of their shipments for inspection. M.L.C. 436.1203(20)-(21). Michigan does not advance any theory on how its wine retailing websites better screen out minors than their out-of-state rivals, and in fact both websites would be equally accessible to Michigan officials seeking to investigate underage sales, as would both company's deliveries (presumably accomplished by the same common carrier). Further, as Plaintiffs argue, there are many forms of leverage the state can hold over out-of-state retailers short of the threat of property abatement. Bonds can be required from retailers where the MLCC sees fit, and, along with the SDM license itself, subject to forfeiture where necessary. The\n   <em>\n    Granholm\n   </em>\n   Court found that Michigan failed in 2005 to make the \"clearest showing\" that was necessary to justify discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Granholm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5881890\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/460/\">\n    544 U.S. at 489-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5881890\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/460/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    C &amp; A Carbone, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 511 U.S. at 393,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147591\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/383/#p390\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Tax Collection\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The State argues that collecting Michigan taxes from out-of-state retailers would be unworkable. Defendants base this conclusion off the MLCC's experience taxing out-of-state wineries. Direct shipper licensees pay the excise tax directly to the MLCC, but the Commission believes itself to be unable to collect the full taxes owed on such transactions. (Defs.' Ex. E). Defendants advance evidence that out-of-state wineries have disproportionately failed to timely file required tax documentation and have routinely underpaid taxes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147591\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/383/#p390\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The fact that much of Michigan's evidence comes from winery direct shipping suggests that the State's problem lies with\n   <em>\n    Granholm\n   </em>\n   itself, a problem that this Court is not in a position to remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Indeed, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Granholm\n   </em>\n   found that there were reasonable alternative methods available to collect taxes without burdening interstate commerce.

While the success of regulation should never undermine the regulation that made it possible, Michigan has not demonstrated that the regulatory efforts of the Federal Government and other state governments is so deficient as to require Michigan to keep all retail shippers within its state lines.

The law as amended by the Act-which allows sellers of wine who hold a \"specially designated merchant license located in this state ... to use a common carrier to deliver wine to a consumer in this state ...\"-may remain unaltered insofar as it permits otherwise compliant out-of-state wine retailers to either apply for and receive SDM licenses or ship to Michigan customers with comparable out-of-state licenses. Finding the Commerce Clause sufficient grounds for relief, the Court declines to reach Plaintiffs' Privileges and Immunities claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Court finds that there are no genuine issues of material fact which would preclude judgment as a matter of law in this case that 2016 Public Act 520-read in conjunction with MLCC Section 436.1607 -violates the dormant Commerce Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Consequently, Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment [31]\n   <strong>\n    IS HEREBY GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendants' and Intervenor's Motions for Summary Judgment [33, 34] are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DECLARES\n   </strong>\n   that Michigan's wine retail shipping laws are unconstitutional insofar as they forbid out-of-state retailers from shipping wine to Michigan customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Therefore,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendants Michigan Governor Rick Snyder and Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, in their official capacities, and the State of Michigan\n   <strong>\n    ARE PERMANENTLY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    RESTRAINED AND ENJOINED\n   </strong>\n   from enforcing provisions of M.C.L. \u00a7\u00a7 436.1607 and 436.1203 to preclude out-of-state retailers of wine from shipping through interstate commerce to Michigan customers.
