He asserts that Defendants Benjamin Daffron and Jonathan Franco, who are Police Officers with the Albuquerque Police Department (\"APD\"), used excessive force during his December, 2015, arrest.

On December 3, 2015, Daffron and Franco approached Chacon in an alley near California Street in southeast Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint at 2. They instructed Chacon to stop and to get on the ground.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint at 2. As he was attempting to comply, one of the officers grabbed Chacon, slammed him down to the ground, and thrust his knees into Chacon's head and ribs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint at 2. The officer also directed Chacon to \"quit resisting,\" although Chacon alleges that he was not resisting arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint at 2. The officer then grabbed Chacon's right arm, forced it up towards Chacon's head until it made a popping sound, and thrust his knee into Chacon's back.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint at 2. Chacon informed the officer that he recently had open heart surgery, and was experiencing pain in his chest and elbow.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint at 2. The officer initially refused to listen, but eventually called an ambulance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint at 2. When Chacon arrived at the University of New Mexico Hospital, the medical providers discovered a fracture in his right elbow.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint at 2. At some point Chacon inquired why he was arrested, but the Daffron and Franco refused to answer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint at 2. After Chacon was transported to the Metropolitan Detention Center, he learned that Daffron and Francisco arrested him for a crime he did not commit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint at 2.
