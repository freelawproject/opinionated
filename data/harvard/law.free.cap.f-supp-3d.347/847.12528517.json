BROWNING, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court on: (i) the Addendum to United States' Sentencing Memorandum, filed September 8, 2016 (Doc. 205)(\"United States' Motion\"); and (ii) the Amendment to Sentencing Memorandum, filed March 10, 2017 (Doc. 222)(\"Jim's Motion\"). The Court held an evidentiary and sentencing hearing on March 21, 2017. The primary issues are: (i) whether Jim should receive a 2-level enhancement pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2A3.1(b)(4) (U.S. Sentencing Comm'n 2018)(\"U.S.S.G.\") for \"serious bodily injury\" based on injuries that Jane Doe sustained as a result of Jim's sexual abuse on August 12, 2010; (ii) whether the Court should impose a 4-level downward departure based on Jim's memory and comprehension issues; and (iii) whether the Court should grant a variance, because of the same memory and comprehension problems. The Court concludes that: (i) it will impose a 2-level enhancement for serious bodily injury, because Doe suffered twenty-five different lacerations to her genitals and anus as a result of Jim raping her, while also sustaining major bruising to her body and overwhelming pain; (ii) Jim's mild memory problems do not remove his\n   case from the heartland of cases such that a downward departure is warranted; and (iii) the Court will not grant a downward variance, because the factors that put downward pressure on the sentence do not outweigh the factors that put pressure to keep the sentence within the guideline range. Here, the factors that put downward pressure on the sentence do not outweigh the aggravating factors that put upward pressure on the sentence to keep it in the guideline range. On balance, a life sentence imposed by the guideline range is necessary to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, afford adequate deterrence, and avoid sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records who are found guilty of similar offenses. The Court, accordingly, grants the United States' Motion and denies Jim's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2003, Jim was convicted for driving under the influence of liquor or drug, as well as for a traffic violation, and sentenced to 90 days jail suspended.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Presentence Investigation Report \u00b6 52, at 14 (disclosed March 9, 2012)(\"PSR\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2004, Jim was convicted of driving while intoxicated (\"DWI\") and abandonment or abuse of a child, and sentenced to 364 days in jail, with 320 days suspended.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 53, at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Jim first met Doe on August 12, 2010, at her home.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 11, at 4. Jim, Doe, and Doe's friends gathered outside her home socializing and drinking alcohol.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 11, at 4. As the night progressed, Doe's friends noticed that Jim was following Doe as she went in and out of her home.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 12, at 4. Sometime shortly after 1:00 a.m., Doe went inside her home and vomited.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 13, at 4. When she emerged from the bathroom, she noticed Jim standing outside the bathroom door and then went to the couch to go to sleep.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 13, at 4. She later opened her eyes, saw that the outside door was closed, and saw Jim standing over her.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 14, at 4. Jim grabbed Doe's ankles and dragged her down the hall to her bedroom.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 14, at 5. He removed her clothes, forced himself on her, and penetrated her vaginally and anally with his penis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 14, at 5. Doe testified that Jim caused her overwhelming pain, that she tried to fight him, and that the struggle moved from her bedroom to the laundry room.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 15, at 5. Jim fled out the laundry room door and headed north.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 16, at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FINDINGS OF FACT\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Rule 12(d) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure states: \"When factual issues are involved in deciding a motion, the court must state its essential findings on the record.\" Fed.

Accordingly, the Court makes the following findings of fact in accordance with rule 12(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   1. In the early morning of August 13, 2010, Margaret Finnan -- a sexual assault nurse examiner -- performed an examination of Doe a few hours after she was\n   raped.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Transcript of Trial Proceedings at 50:13-15 (taken January 9, 2012), filed August 30, 2012 (Baker, Finnan)(\"Jan. 9 Tr.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 54:4-8 (Baker, Finnan).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   2. During that examination, Doe told Finnan that, on a scale from zero to ten -- zero meaning no pain, and ten meaning the worst pain imaginable -- Doe felt a pain level of eight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jan. 9 Tr. at 68:21-24 (Finnan).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   3. Doe had bruises on her forearms, her back, and her knees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jan. 9 Tr. at 69:5-7 (Finnan);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 69:17-70:20 (Baker, Finnan).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   4. Doe sustained eleven to thirteen lacerations to her vaginal area, some as large as 3.5 centimeters in length.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jan. 9 Tr. at 83:13-22 (Baker, Finnan).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   5. Doe sustained twelve lacerations to the area around her anus.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jan. 9 Tr. at 84:23-85:1 (Finnan).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   6. Graham Tull -- an emergency-room physician -- also examined Doe on August 13, 2010.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Transcript of Trial Proceedings at 437:24 (dated January 11, 2012), filed August 30, 2012 (Tull)(\"Jan. 11 Tr.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 439:20-24 (Baker, Tull).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   7. After examining her, Dr. Tull ordered a CT\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   scan of Doe's abdomen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jan. 11 Tr. at 444:19 (Tull).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   8. Dr. Tull had never ordered a CT scan on a sexual assault victim's abdomen before, but ordered one on Doe, because \"of the amount of pain and the distress that she seemed to be in.\" Jan. 11 Tr. at 445:1-4 (Tull).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   9. In December, 2016, Susan Cave, a clinical and forensic psychologist, evaluated Jim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sealed Forensic Evaluation Report at 1 (taken December 15, 2016)(dated January 11, 2017), filed February 16, 2017 (Doc. 220-1)(\"Report\"); Draft Transcript of Sentencing Hearing at 5:25 (taken March 21, 2017)(Cave)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"Tr.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   10. After performing an intelligent quotient (\"IQ\") test, Dr. Cave determined that Jim's performance IQ lands in the 66th percentile, which is above average, whereas his verbal IQ is in the 50th percentile.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 6:11-16 (Cave); Report at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   11. Jim's combined IQ score is 104, which falls in the average range at the 61st percentile.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   12. Dr. Cave also performed a cognitive linguistic quick test, in which Jim scores within the normal range except that his memory \"is mildly impaired.\" Tr. at 7:3-4 (Cave).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   13. Cave determined that alcohol does not cause Jim's trouble remembering things,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 7:12-16 (Cave); rather, she concluded that \"multiple head injuries\" sustained as a child likely cause his memory problems, Tr. at 7:19-21 (Cave).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   14. As an eight-year-old, Jim slipped on some gravel, struck his head, and fell unconscious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   15. A year later, Jim fell unconscious again when he ran into a board.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A grand jury indicted Jim on two counts of aggravated sexual abuse in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201153\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2241(a)(1), and 2246(2)(A).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Superseding Indictment at 1-2, filed December 1, 2012 (Doc. 58)(\"Superseding Indictment\"). Jim initially pled guilty, agreeing to a sentencing guideline range of 151-188 months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plea Agreement at 4, filed February 8, 2011 (Doc. 25)(\"Plea\"). Jim subsequently moved the Court to vacate his Plea,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Motion for an Order to Vacate the Sentencing and to Allow Defendant to Withdraw his Plea Agreement and to Proceed to Trial, filed September 19, 2011 (Doc. 48), and the Court granted the request, because it \"doubt[ed] whether the plea was knowing and voluntary.\" Memorandum Opinion and Order at 16,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%206013093\">\n    2011 WL 6013093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (D.N.M. 2011) (Browning, J.), filed November 22, 2011 (Doc. 53)(\" MOO\"). The Court based that conclusion on Jim's statements that he did not understand that his Plea meant he waived his right to a jury trial and that the Honorable Richard Puglisi, then-Chief United States Magistrate Judge for the District of New Mexico, did not tell Jim during the plea colloquy that Jim was waiving his right to a jury trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MOO at 16-22,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%206013093\">\n    2011 WL 6013093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   After a trial on the merits, a petit jury convicted Jim on both counts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Verdict, filed January 13, 2012 (Doc. 136); Superseding Indictment at 1-2. The Court sentenced Jim to 360 months imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Judgment at 2 (dated May 16, 2012), filed June 22, 2012 (Doc. 165). In sentencing Jim to 360 months imprisonment, the Court concluded that it could not, as a matter of law, apply the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.1(b)(4)(B)\"serious bodily injury\" 2-level enhancement based solely on Doe's injuries resulting directly from the sexual abuse underlying the conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum Opinion and Order at 33,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3872691\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/877/1018/#p1037\">\n    877 F.Supp.2d 1018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1037 (D.N.M. 2012) (Browning, J.), filed June 22, 2012 (Doc. 164)(\" Sentencing MOO\"). It so concluded because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.1, application note 1 \"indicates that, for the purposes of this guideline, serious bodily injury means conduct other than criminal sexual abuse, which is taken into account in the base offense level under subsection (a).\" Sentencing MOO at 30,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3872691\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/877/1018/#p1037\">\n    877 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1037 (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.1 cmt. n.1). The Court reasoned that, although the \"serious bodily injury\" definition from U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 n.1(L) could include -- and indeed, would per se include -- injuries stemming from the sexual contact underlying the offense, the Court concluded that \u00a7 2A3.1, application note 1's explicit direction that \"serious bodily injury means conduct other than criminal sexual abuse,\" overrides \"the provision in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, because the base offense level already takes into account the injuries related to the sexual contact.\" Sentencing MOO at 33,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3872691\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/877/1018/#p1037\">\n    877 F.Supp.2d at 1039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   It is difficult to separate the sexual contact and injuries related to it from the criminal sexual abuse, and the Court believes that, when the guidelines state that serious bodily injury means conduct other than criminal sexual abuse, it must also exclude from that definition injuries resulting from the criminal sexual abuse.

The Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The jury and the Court had physical evidence before them, something not often seen in a sexual abuse case. Moreover, at trial, Doe testified as to what happened to her, which substantially conformed with Jim's sworn statements during the plea colloquy and in the Plea Agreement. The standard at sentencing is a preponderance of the evidence, and the Court believes that the PSR accurately sets forth the facts of the case in paragraphs 8 to 33. Although these facts are favorable to the United States, the Court believes that those are the facts on which the jury relied in reaching its verdicts and that those facts are supported by a preponderance of the evidence. The Court also notes that, while it denied the serious-bodily-injury enhancement, Doe's injuries were serious, and the Court believes that she suffered extreme emotional and physical pain. The Court believes that the testimony from Doe and the doctors at trial establish that this was a particularly brutal rape. The Court also finds that Jim has a serious drinking problem. The Court gave some thought to whether Jim's problem with alcohol might justify a variance, but the Court is troubled that Jim's previous convictions also involved alcohol issues. Without any assurances that Jim has taken steps to address his alcohol problem, the Court does not believe that fact justifies a variance. The jury found, and the Court finds, that the evidence shows that Jim raped Doe vaginally and anally causing severe injuries, and he has not accepted responsibility for his conduct. Additionally, the evidence shows that, at some stage of the proceedings, Jim lied. The contrast between his statements to federal agents and his later testimony, and between his sworn plea statements and testimony at trial demonstrate that Jim has lied. By his own account at trial, he admits to lying at the plea colloquy, but the more fundamental concern for the Court is that Jim did not tell the truth at trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court gave serious consideration to the request for a variance, but it is difficult to justify when a defendant insists on a trial, when he continues to refuse to accept responsibility for his conduct, and where there are serious doubts about the veracity of the defendant's testimony. The Court agrees with the United States that a variance to Jim's requested sentence -- five years -- would not adequately reflect the\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) factors. Additionally, varying to a sentence at or below the guideline range stipulated to in the Plea Agreement -- 151 to 188 months -- would be inappropriate. Jim withdrew his plea, an additional count was added in the Superseding Indictment, and Jim put the United States to its burden of proof at trial. While Jim has a protected right to a trial and should not be punished for exercising that right, he also should not exercise that right and then expect the bargain that he secured in his Plea Agreement. This process has been a nightmare for Doe, and the experience is still very raw for her. The high sentences that the guidelines establish and that Congress has approved were meant to protect women from this situation. The guideline range is high, but the Court does not believe that it is inappropriate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Sentencing MOO at 45-46,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3872691\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/877/1018/#p1037\">\n    877 F.Supp.2d at 1046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the Court's decision to enforce Jim's rule 410 waiver, but disagreed with the Court's refusal\n   to apply the 2-level serious-bodily-injury enhancement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The two-level serious-bodily-injury enhancement can still apply to a sexual abuse offender, but it must be based on the fact that the victim's injuries meet the first definition of \"serious bodily injury\": \"injury involving extreme physical pain or the protracted impairment of a function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty; or requiring medical intervention such as surgery, hospitalization, or physical rehabilitation.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 app. n.1(L).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Jim\n   </em>\n   , Opinion at 21-22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4190557\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/786/802/#p813\">\n    786 F.3d at 814\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4190557\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/786/802/#p813\">\n    786 F.3d at 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"But the base offense level takes into account the\n   <em>\n    offender's\n   </em>\n   conduct in committing a sexual abuse offense, not the injuries the victim suffered.\")(emphasis in original).

This was premedi[t]ated. This was callous. And the defendant did everything he could to avoid apprehension and conviction in this matter, from fleeing the scene, to taking the stand and lying. He actually committed perjury when he took the stand in this matter. Everything leans toward adherence to the guidelines and imposing a life sentence.... And I briefly addressed this during my departure argument, but the sentencing guidelines, which have to be considered under 3553, don't even go so far as to [offense] level 44. The Sentencing Guideline Commission didn't think that it was worth it to categorize behavior this extreme, because it was so unlikely to occur. And in this matter it occurred.

So even though I credit what Dr. Cave says ... today and I do think that it does put downward pressure and that he may not be the smartest person and even though I haven't departed and said that it justifies a downward departure, I do credit her testimony that he doesn't have the best memory and he may have difficulty with a non-Indian judicial system. And I also think the fact that this is a severe sentence regardless of what he gets put downward pressure on it in comparison with other crimes such as murder. I don't have any substantial disagreement with the way that counsel handled matters in this case. I think largely they were driven by Mr. Jim. So I don't think that that is necessarily something that puts downward pressure. But I will agree that maybe his comprehension is not as great as other defendant. But I think that he clearly was competent to both enter the plea and to conduct and help his counsel during trial. We certainly want a sentence that promotes respect for the law[,] that provides just punishment[, and] that affords adequate deterrence, but I think any sort of sentence that we're talking about\n   [--] on the specific or general level [--] is going to provide those.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Tr. at 68:16-70:1 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   On the other hand, the Court noted some factors did not counsel toward a variance upward and put pressure to keep the sentence a guideline sentence.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   So [the Court] think[s] there is some downward pressure. But the factors that cause the Court not to vary from the guideline range also remain and they were overwhelming in the last case and many of them are back today, and some of them are here in a more emphatic form than they were even in 2012. One is the brutal factor of [--] the seriousness of this crime, the lying, the taking the stand, the Court does have to protect the public, and it doesn't have any assurance at the present time any more than it had in 2012. [The Court] think[s] that factor has to be emphasized.

U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0(b)'s Application Note 4 clarifies that, to meet \u00a7 5K2.0(b)(1)'s \"affirmatively and specifically identified\" requirement, \"any mitigating circumstance that forms the basis for such a downward departure be affirmatively and specifically identified as a ground for downward departure in this part (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Chapter Five, Park K).\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0(b) n.4(B)(i). After examining Chapter 5, Part K of the Guidelines, the Court concludes that none of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K's subsections \"affirmatively and specifically identif[y]\" memory impairment as a permissible ground for downward departure. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0(b) n.4(B)(i).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The only two subsections that could, at first glance, apply are: (i) diminished capacity; and (ii) specific offender characteristics as grounds for downward departure in child crimes and sexual offenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 5K2.13 ; 5K2.22. The diminished capacity subsection applies, however, only if \"the defendant committed the offense while suffering from a significantly reduced mental capacity\" and \"the significantly reduced mental capacity contributed substantially to the commission of the offense.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13. Jim's contention does not fit the mental-capacity subsection, because he does not assert that his memory impairment contributed to the rape he committed; rather, he argues that his memory problems contributed to his lack of understanding during the trial proceedings,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , it caused him to make the disastrous decision to withdraw his plea agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jim's Supp. Motion at 2; Tr. at 38:20-22 (Samore). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.22 is inapplicable too, because that subsection does not include memory impairment as a reason for departure; instead, it specifies that: (i) \"[a]ge may be a reason to depart downward only if and to the extent permitted\n   by \u00a7 5H1.1\"; (ii) \"[a]n extraordinary physical impairment may be a reason to depart downward only if and to the extent permitted by \u00a7 5H1.4\"; and (iii) \"[d]rug, alcohol, or gambling dependence or abuse is not a reason to depart downward.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.22. Accordingly, because there are no \u00a7 5K subsections that \"affirmatively and specifically identif[y]\" memory impairment as a reason to downwardly depart, the Court concludes that it cannot properly depart under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0(b).

A downward departure is warranted under that subsection when such mental or emotional conditions \"individually or in combination with other offender characteristics, are present to an unusual degree and distinguish the case from the typical cases covered by the guidelines.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.3.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Koon v.

While the Court concludes that a departure based on loss of memory is authorized under the Guidelines and the applicable case law, the Court also concludes that a departure is not warranted on those bases given this case's facts. The Court is having trouble squaring Jim's allegation of memory loss with his seemingly lucid conduct in hearings over the years. In any case, the Court chooses not to depart, because it does not believe departure is warranted under the facts and circumstances here. Unfortunately, the nation's federal prisons contain many inmates who have diminished capacity, and many have diminished capacity because of traumatic head injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Center for Disease Control,\n   <em>\n    Traumatic Brain Injury in Prisons and Jails: An Unrecognized Problem\n   </em>\n   at 1, https://www.cdc.gov/traumaticbraininjury/pdf/Prisoner_TBI_Prof-a.pdf (\"25-87% of inmates report having experienced a head injury or TBI as compared to 8.5% in a general population reporting a history of TBI.\"). The Court concludes that Jim's alleged memory loss does not distinguish his case from the heartland of cases that the Court and other federal courts regularly see, and so the Court will not downwardly depart under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.3 on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Jim also asserts that he has difficulty comprehending complex concepts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jim's Motion at 3. According to Jim, this difficulty stems from a variety of sources, including his traumatic head injuries, post-traumatic stress disorder, and poor education.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jim's Motion at 1-4. The Court concludes that this difficulty does not warrant a departure based on this case's facts. Although suffering head injuries as a child, experiencing trauma, and receiving a poor education represent meaningful life challenges, they do not distinguish Jim from many other disadvantaged defendants before the Court and other federal courts. Likewise, Jim's apparent difficulty comprehending complex concepts and related overreliance on authority figures,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Jim's Motion at 3, does not remove this case from the heartland of other cases before the Court and other federal courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0(c) permits Courts to depart from the Guideline range \"based on the combination of two or more offender characteristics or other circumstances, none of which independently is sufficient to provide a basis for departure.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0(c). The Court concludes that there is no sound basis for departure even when\n   considering Jim's alleged memory loss problems and challenges comprehending complex concepts. Section \u00a7 5K2.0(c) permits departure on multiple circumstances only if the multiple circumstances or offender characteristics \"make the case an exceptional one,\" and each circumstance or characteristic \"is present to a substantial degree.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0(c)(1)-(2). The Court concludes that, even considered together, Jim's memory and cognitive deficiencies do not make his case an exceptional one, given that the Court often sees defendants with similar mental and cognitive challenges. Moreover, the case's facts do not suggest that either of these challenges are present to a substantial degree. For instance, although he has trouble comprehending language, he nonetheless scored roughly average on an IQ test, and the Court, in its previous interactions with Jim, has not sensed that he was not of sound mind.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jim's Motion at 3.

When performing that task, courts need to consider: (i) the Guidelines; (ii) the nature of the offense as well as the defendant's history and characteristics; (iii) the available sentences; (iv) a policy favoring uniformity in sentences for defendants who commit similar crimes; and (v) the need to provide restitution to victims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), (3)-(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The Court has considered these factors and concludes that a life sentence is reasonable, meaning sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the four purposes that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) enumerates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   When the Court sentenced Jim in 2012, it concluded that the Guidelines had made an appropriate calculation and that the factors favored remaining within the Guideline's range. This time around, Jim has presented a few additional factors, but the Court, once again, concludes that the factors do not call for the Court to do a downward variance. The fourteen factors that the Court has identified as placing a downward pressure on Jim's sentence include the following. First, the Court always wants to work hard to impose a sentence that is not greater than necessary to promote the \u00a7 3353(a) factors. Second, while the task of the Court, as a district court, is not to come up with a reasonable sentence -- it is to arrive at a sentence that accurately reflects the \u00a7 3353(a) factors,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Conlan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699398\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/500/1167/#p1169\">\n    500 F.3d 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1169 (10th Cir. 2007) (\" 'A district court's job is not to impose a reasonable sentence.

July 16, 2010) (Browning, J.)(\"While the Court's task, as a district court, is not to arrive at a reasonable sentence -- it is to come up with one that reflects the factors in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)....\" (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Third, the Court can use -- and should use -- supervised release, not incarceration, to address some of Jim's problems, such as his struggles with alcohol. Fourth, the Court has discretion after\n   <em>\n    Pepper v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457265,6023823\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/476/\">\n    562 U.S. 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457265,6023823\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/476/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Fifth, the sad procedure in this case -- where Jim withdrew his plea agreement while suffering under all these mental health problems -- puts downward pressure on the sentence. Sixth, while the Court has decided not to depart on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0(b) &amp; (c) grounds, the Court still recognizes that Jim is not the smartest defendant, does not have the best memory, and has difficulty communicating and dealing with non-Indians; these problems put downward pressure in the variance calculus, even if not to the level to justify a departure. Seventh, whether the Court imposes a 360-month sentence or a life sentence, any sentence that the Court is likely to impose will be severe. Eighth, when the Court compares any sentence in this case with the sentences that other New Mexicans receive after serious crimes, such as murder, the sentence here is likely to be greater than what the New Mexico state courts give. Ninth, while the Court does not have any great disagreement with the way Jim's prior counsel handled matters, the guilty plea/colloquy and withdrawal of the plea puts downward pressure on the sentence. Tenth, while the Court concludes that Jim's comprehension problems are not great enough to justify a departure; his comprehension difficulties put downward pressure on the sentence. Eleventh, while the Tenth Circuit agreed with this Court that Jim entered the guilty plea knowingly and voluntarily, Jim might not have received notice from the Magistrate Judge about waiving his right to a jury trial. Twelfth, any sentence must promote respect for the law, and sentences that are too severe for the crime do not. Thirteenth, any sentence must provide a just sentence, and if the sentence is too long for the crime, the sentence will not be just. Fourteenth, the sentence must afford adequate deterrence, both at a specific and general level; both sentences being considered will probably satisfy this factor, thus putting downward pressure on any sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Other factors -- and at least eight -- continue to counsel against issuing a downward variance. First, the seriousness of this crime -- the brutality -- is a factor that weighs heavily in favor of a life-time sentence. Second, following the crime, Jim made statements implicating himself. Third, Jim took the stand in a federal courthouse and lied. Fourth, the sentence must promote respect of the law, and the brutality and lying do not counsel for a variance. Fifth, the sentence must provide a just sentence and provide adequate deterrence, both at a specific and general level; given that Jim is now in denial, will not accept responsibility for his crime, and is willing to lie about what he did that night, he needs to be deterred, and men tempted to brutalize and rape women must\n   be deterred, too. Sixth, the sentence needs to protect the public, both by incapacitating Jim, who will not accept responsibility, and by discouraging others from committing similar crimes. Seventh, the Court should not create an unwarranted sentencing disparity among similar defendants who committed similar crimes; this factor counsels that the Court give him a Guideline range. Eighth, the Court must fashion a sentence that is sufficient to promote the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   In many cases, the many downward factors would overrule the fewer factors that lead the Court to give a Guideline sentence. But all factors are not created equal. The Court concluded in 2012, when it first sentenced Jim, that a Guideline sentence was needed. The Court again concludes that a Guideline sentence is needed. The brutality of Jim's crime and his lying have not changed. He still should receive a Guideline sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that: (i) the request in Plaintiff's Addendum to United States' Sentencing Memorandum, filed September 8, 2016 (Doc. 205), is granted; and (ii) the requests in Defendant's Amendment to Sentencing Memorandum, filed March 10, 2017 (Doc. 222), are denied.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    The PSR was never filed on the Court's docket.
