MICHELSON, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Johana Arucan, proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , sued her employer for discrimination and\n   wrongful termination. She also sued two police officers who were called to remove her from the premises for constitutional violations. (R. 5.) The Court referred all pretrial matters to Magistrate Judge Stephanie Dawkins Davis. (R. 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Now before the Court are Arucan's objections to the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation to grant Defendants' motions for summary judgment. (R. 73.) For the reasons set forth below, the Court overrules Arucan's objections and accepts the Report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Arucan began working for Cambridge East Healthcare in September 2012 as a full-time physical therapy assistant. (R. 50-6, PID 308.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Over three years later, on January 5, 2016, Arucan provided physical therapy treatment to the wrong patient. (R. 52-6, PID 556.) Arucan usually treated only patients on her daily list, which did not include Catherine Y. (R. 71-3, PID 751, 753-54) But because she had extra time (two of her patients did not need services), another physical therapist asked Arucan to treat Catherine Y. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) But Arucan treated Catherine B. She discovered the mistake the next day and immediately reported the error to Megan Mocny, the Rehabilitation Manager. (R. 50-6, PID 320, 332.) That same day, Mocny reported the incident to Paige VanTiem, the administrator at Cambridge East. (R. 52-6, PID 558.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the morning of January 8, 2016, VanTiem informed Arucan that she was being terminated for treating the wrong patient. (R. 52-8, 565.) VanTiem avers that Arucan refused to sign the termination papers and instead insisted that she was not terminated. (R. 52-6, PID 559.) As she continued to protest, VanTiem instructed Arucan to leave the premises. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Arucan refused. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Instead, she stated that she had patients to treat and left for the second floor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) VanTiem managed to convince Arucan to go to the first floor, but Arucan continued to refuse to leave the premises. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Madison Heights Police Department was called. (R. 52-6, PID 559.) Officers John Heinrich and Rick Zamoski responded. (R. 50-3, PID 294; R. 50-4, PID 299.) VanTiem informed the officers that Arucan had been fired and was now refusing to leave. (R. 50-4, PID 299.) The officers claim they told Arucan she needed to leave the premises, but she refused to do so. (R. 50-3, PID 295; R. 50-4, 299.) Instead, she insisted that she needed to stay to see her patients. (R. 50-4, PID 299.) The officers warned Arucan multiple times that if she did not leave the premises she would be arrested. (R. 50-4, PID 299.) Still, Arucan balked. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   So Officer Heinrich handcuffed Arucan and transported her to the police station. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The officers booked her (for trespassing) and placed her in a cell, where she remained until around lunch time. (R. 50-6, PID 335.) Arucan then went to lunch with some of her former co-workers. (R. 50-6, PID 323.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Arucan has a different version of the events. She testified that \"they said I was not fired\" and that VanTiem was only going to talk to \"corporate.\" (R. 50-6, PID 325.) She never heard that she was asked to leave. (R. 50-6, PID 324.) It was a janitor, according to Arucan, who called the police. (R. 50-6, PID 325.) When the police arrived, she told them that she wanted to go home and was going downstairs to collect her belongings. (R. 50-6, PID 334.) The officers never told her that she needed to leave. (R. 50-6, PID 334.) Officer Heinrich took her patient schedule from her pocket and gave it to either VanTiem or Mocny. (R. 50-6, PID 321.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Then Officer Heinrich pulled her hands behind her back and handcuffed her. (R. 50-6, PID 322.) Once at the station, the officers took her belongings, including her lab coat, and asked for $500 in bail. (R. 506-, PID 322.) She was then placed in a cold cell with only a smelly blanket to keep her warm. (R. 50-6, PID 335.) Around lunchtime, some of her former co-workers paid her bail and she left to have lunch with them. (R. 50-6, PID 335.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Arucan testified that she had pain in her chest as a result of being handcuffed and that she went to urgent care that day and later sought medical treatment from a doctor. (R. 50-6, PID 332-33.) VanTiem took her jacket and lunch box, but those items were mailed to her a week later by Cambridge East. (R. 50-6, PID 326.) She further asserts that she was replaced with a younger male employee. (R. 5, PID 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Arucan ultimately pled \"no contest\" to trespassing. (R. 50-11, PID 361.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Arucan filed this lawsuit against her former employer, VanTiem, Mocny, and the two officers. (R. 1.) In her amended complaint, Arucan alleges that Cambridge East discriminated against her based upon her gender, age, color, race, and her ethnicity. (R. 5.) She further alleges wrongful termination, failure to promote, and retaliation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She also includes claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress and harassment based upon alleged verbal and emotional abuse during her time of employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Against the officers, she alleges that she was never given her\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, she was unlawfully arrested, unnecessarily humiliated, handcuffed in a manner that caused her injury, and that she got cold in the cell because they took her lab coat. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Both Cambridge East and the officers filed for summary judgment. (R. 50, 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court will accept the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation to grant Defendants' motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   This Court performs a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of those portions of the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation to which the parties have objected.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

But none concern the Magistrate Judge's legal analysis. Instead, they attempt to introduce new facts or arguments, put forth arguments\n   that have no bearing on the Report's recommendations, or re-state her summary judgment arguments without explaining how the Magistrate Judge erred in analyzing those arguments. (R. 77.) The Court will address each objection, but will combine them when they overlap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Arucan's first and fifteenth objections concern three court dates in Madison Heights, Michigan that Defendants allegedly failed to show up for in early 2016. (R. 77, PID 986, 992.) Given the time period, the Court assumes that Arucan is referring to her criminal trespassing case. (R. 50-11.) These objections do not affect the outcome of the Report. Defendants' attendance at Arucan's criminal proceedings has no bearing on Arucan's current Title VII claims against her employer and her constitutional claims against Officers Heinrich and Zamojski. The Court therefore overrules Arucan's first and fifteenth objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Arucan's second, eighth and ninth objections are to the Report's treatment of her discrimination claims. (R. 77, PID 987, 989-90.) The Magistrate Judge found that Arucan did not identify any other employees who, like her, treated the wrong patient, and yet were not terminated. Thus, she could not make out a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of discrimination. (R. 73, PID 954-58.) And, further still, the Magistrate Judge found that Arucan failed to show that the reason Cambridge East gave for terminating her was pretext for discrimination. (R. 73, PID 957-58 (citing\n   <em>\n    White v. Baxter Healthcare Corp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4039528\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/533/381/#p393\">\n    533 F.3d 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 393 (6th Cir. 2008).) Arucan does not argue that the Magistrate Judge erred in granting summary judgment on the record before her. Instead, Arucan asserts that other physical therapists who were white or male performed deficiently, received citations, and harmed patients even to the point of causing death, yet were not terminated from their employment. (R. 77, PID 987, 989-90.) These arguments were not raised before the Magistrate Judge and will therefore not be considered.\n   <em>\n    Swain v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3911757\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/379/512/#p517\">\n    379 F. App'x 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 517-18 (6th Cir. 2010) (citing\n   <em>\n    Ward v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=208%20F.3d%20216\">\n    208 F.3d 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (table) (6th Cir. 2000) ) (\"[A] claim raised for the first time in objections to a magistrate judge's report is deemed waived.\") ). Arucan's second, eighth and ninth objections are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Arucan's third and fourteenth objections appear to be that the Magistrate Judge misread her complaint as stating that she was at the jail for 24 hours, when she actually wrote four hours, with a \"greater than\" (\"&gt;\") sign in front of it. (R. 77, PID 987, 992.) This does not affect the Report's recommendations and these objections are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Arucan's fourth objection is that she did not receive the original CCTV footage of the incident in discovery. (R. 77, PID 988.) But Arucan's motion to compel discovery of the CCTV tapes was denied, (R. 66, 69) so this objection is also overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Arucan's fifth (and part of her third) objection asserts that she was not allowed to review her deposition transcript and that she was harassed during her deposition. (R. 77, PID 988.) This, like her other objections, does not contest a finding in the Report itself and has no bearing on the outcome of the Magistrate Judge's summary judgment analysis. It is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    F.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Arucan's sixth, seventh, eleventh, and sixteenth objections raise arguments not presented in the summary judgment briefing. (R. 77, PID 988-92.) Number six claims that Cambridge East purposefully confused her as to which patients she needed to treat so that they could terminate her, (R. 77, PID 988-89) and number seven contends she did not harm the patient she erroneously treated\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (R. 77 PID 989). In her eleventh objection, she says for the first time that she was framed (R. 77, PID 990-91), and in her sixteenth that she was forced to sign some paperwork regarding her criminal trespassing charge\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (R. 77, PID 992). As these arguments were not raised before the Magistrate Judge, they are deemed waived.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3911757\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/379/512/#p517\">\n    379 F.

Her objections are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    G.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Arucan's tenth objection (R. 77, PID 990) is not responsive to the Report and re-asserts issues that were sufficiently addressed in the Report (R. 73, PID 954-68). Her tenth objection is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    H.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Arucan's twelfth and thirteenth (and part of her first and fourth) objections are, in essence, a recital of her unlawful arrest and excessive use of force claims. (R. 77, PID 986-88, 991.) Arucan fails to identify any error in the Magistrate Judge's ruling that Defendants were entitled to summary judgment on these claims. Eastern District of Michigan Local Rule 72.1(d) requires that objections not only specify the part of the report to which a person objects, but also the basis for that objection. E.D. Mich. L.R. 72.1(d). An objection, then, that fails to show any error in the Magistrate Judge's analysis is not entitled to relief.\n   <em>\n    Adam v. Comm'r of Soc.

Mich. Comp. Law \u00a7 750.552. Even construing the record in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, it establishes that Officer Zamojski responded to a complaint \"that an employee who had just been terminated from Cambridge East Healthcare Center would not leave the premises.\" (R. 50-3, PID 294.) And that, once he arrived, VanTiem told him that Arucan had been terminated \"but would not leave the facility.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He observed that Arucan remained on the premises. Officer Heinrich similarly averred that he was called for assistance \"by a Cambridge staff member who needed help with a former employee who refused to leave the facility.\" (R. 50-4, PID 299.) And that, when he arrived, VanTiem told him that Arucan had been terminated that morning and that \"[VanTiem] had attempted to get [Arucan] to leave the premises after she was fired, but that [Arucan] refused.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He also observed that Arucan remained on the premises. Thus, even though Arucan claims she personally was never told to leave the premises, the totality of the circumstances would not have lead an officer to doubt the reasonableness of VanTiem's report and thus, the probable cause they had to arrest Arucan.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Radvansky v.

(Dkt. 5). Defendants in this matter are Cambridge East Healthcare/Sava SeniorCare, LLC, plaintiff's former employer, Paige VanTiem, Megan Reusser, who are employees of Cambridge (collectively, the Cambridge defendants) along with John Heinrich and Rick Zamojski, who are police officers employed by the City of Madison Heights (collectively, the Madison Heights defendants). This matter was referred to the undersigned for all pretrial proceedings. (Dkt. 10). Defendants have filed answers to the amended complaint. (Dkt. 12, 14). Discovery closed on March 13, 2017 (Dkt. 35) and defendants timely filed their motions for summary judgment on April 13, 2017. (Dkt. 50, 52). These motions are fully briefed and ready for report and recommendation. (Dkt. 59, 61, 65).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the undersigned\n   <strong>\n    RECOMMENDS\n   </strong>\n   that defendants' motions for summary judgment be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , that plaintiff's federal claims be\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   with prejudice, and that her state claims be\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In her amended complaint, plaintiff alleges that the Cambridge defendants discriminated against her in violation of Title VII, the Age Discrimination in Employment Law, and other \"federal law\" (unspecified). (Dkt. 5, p. 4). The alleged discriminatory conduct included termination of her employment, failure to promote her, retaliation, and harassment. (Dkt. 5, p. 5). The alleged discriminatory acts occurred on January 8, 2016. (Dkt. 5, p. 5). Plaintiff claims she was discriminated against based on her race (Asian), color (Fair), gender (Female), national origin (Filipino), and age (date of birth: January 29, 1976). (Dkt. 5, p. 5). Plaintiff maintains that, on January 8, 2016, she was working as scheduled and did not trespass. (Dkt. 5, p. 6). She points out that even an at-will employee cannot be fired for a reason that is illegal, which, here, involved police brutality. (Dkt. 5, p. 6). She says she was not afforded the same progressive disciplinary process as her co-workers had been. (Dkt. 5, p. 6). Plaintiff claims she was the only female physical therapist assistant and was replaced by a man named Aaron Ivan Tanap. (Dkt. 5, p. 6). Plaintiff also alleges that she was harassed by Megan Reusser and Paige VanTiem. (Dkt. 5, p. 6). According to the amended complaint, Ms. VanTiem favors men and does not discipline or punish male employees when they made mistakes. (Dkt. 5, pp. 6-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   As to the Madison Heights defendants, plaintiff alleges they \"did a warrantless entry\" and did not get the facts right. Plaintiff alleges that she was unlawfully detained by the Madison Heights defendants for 24 hours and put into a cold cell. She was \"unduly handcuffed,\" that is, handcuffed unnecessarily behind her back, which caused pain and enlarged her chest area. Plaintiff says she became sick with a cough after this incident. Plaintiff also alleges that the officers did not read\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights to her, she never resisted, and she followed all commands, as evidenced on the CCTV footage of the facility and police station. (Dkt. 5, p. 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Factual Development\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiff is a 40-year old woman from the Philippines who immigrated to the United States in 2004. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 1, Plaintiff's Deposition, p. 21). On September 24, 2012), plaintiff was hired by Cambridge East Healthcare Center, a private nursing home owned by SavaSeniorCare (Cambridge East), as a physical therapy assistant. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 1, p. 26; Ex. 2,\n   10/9/2012 Signed Position Description). Plaintiff was an at-will employee. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 1, p. 9). On January 5, 2016, according to the Cambridge defendants, plaintiff provided unnecessary and unapproved physical therapy treatment on a Cambridge East patient. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 3, Incident/Accident Report; Ex. 4, Interdisciplinary Progress Notes, pp. 1-2). On that date, there were some changes to plaintiff's schedule (a patient needed to be removed) so a physical therapist, Bobby Manalel, asked plaintiff to see a patient by the name of Catherine \"Y\". (Dkt. 52, Ex. 5, Affidavit of Megan Mocny, \u00b6 5; Ex. 1, pp. 50-51). However, instead of treating Catherine \"Y,\" plaintiff treated Catherine \"B\" - an individual who was not approved for the performed physical therapy services. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 5, \u00b6\u00b6 14-16). Megan Mocny, plaintiff's direct supervisor and Cambridge East's rehabilitation manager, became suspicious about the potential mix-up when she was reviewing patient discharge dates with plaintiff the following day. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 5, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12) (Ex. 4, p. 1). In particular, plaintiff mentioned that Catherine \"Y\" 's daughter did not want her to receive therapy. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 5, \u00b6 11; Ex. 4, p. 1). Ms. Mocny asked plaintiff to take her to the room of the patient who she had treated the day before. As Ms. Mocny suspected, plaintiff took her to Catherine \"B\" 's room. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 5, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14; Ex. 4, p. 1). Ms. Mocny asked plaintiff if she did, in fact, treat Catherine \"B\" the previous day and she indicated that she had. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 5, \u00b6 15; Ex. 4, pp. 1-2). Plaintiff also subsequently acknowledged that she did not treat Catherine \"Y.\" (Dkt. 52, Ex. 5, \u00b6 16; Ex. 4, p. 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Ms. Mocny immediately reported the incident to Paige VanTiem, Administrator of Cambridge East and Sarah Hoskins, a Speech Therapist. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 5, \u00b6 17). Later that day, plaintiff advised Ms. Mocny that she was unaware of the correct patient's name as she had been passed the patient by one of the physical therapists that morning. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 5, \u00b6 18; Ex. 4, p. 2). Ms. Mocny explained to plaintiff that it was her responsibility to know the patients she was treating and that if she was unsure she should have looked at the evaluation/assignment board and could have also confirmed the correct patient was being treated by looking at the name and room number on the door. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 5, \u00b6 19; Ex. 4, p. 2). Ms. Mocny explained that plaintiff's \"mistake\" simply could not happen, as certain types of therapy could be harmful to certain patients. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 5, \u00b6 20; Ex. 4, p. 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The following day, January 7, 2016, plaintiff completed a handwritten statement, which explained that she \"mistakenly treated\" Catherine \"B\" and listed the treatment that was improperly conducted. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 6, Plaintiff's 1/7/2016 Statement). During her deposition, plaintiff initially indicated that she did not remember writing that statement. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 1, p. 63). Subsequently, plaintiff changed her story and indicated that Ms. Mocny \"forced\" her to write the statement. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 1, pp. 94, 98-101). However, plaintiff admitted that she did, in fact, give the wrong treatment to the wrong patient - Catherine B. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 1, pp. 110-111). Plaintiff further explained that it would have been wrong to bill for treatment that was improperly provided and that is why she allegedly \"reported it immediately when I learned that it's the wrong patient. I voluntarily - you know, I don't hide it to myself. I go to Megan... [and admit it] ... I'm being honest and told Megan, oh, my God... Catherine is the wrong one. I told Megan.\" (Dkt. 52, Ex. 1, pp. 111-112). Moreover, plaintiff admitted that she was aware during her employment at Cambridge East that she was supposed to provide physical therapy only to patients that\n   were assigned to her and only to patients that had been prescribed physical therapy treatment. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 1, pp. 38-39). Plaintiff also admitted that she was aware that providing physical therapy services to a patient who was not assigned to her and who was not supposed to be receiving physical therapy services, would be grounds for termination. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 1, p. 39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   As a result of plaintiff providing the wrong patient with physical therapy treatment, Cambridge East's Administrator, Paige VanTiem, made the decision to terminate plaintiff's employment. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 7, VanTiem Affidavit, \u00b6 2). Ms. VanTiem explained that the mistake that plaintiff made was unacceptable, as there are multiple ways for a physical therapy assistant to verify that he or she is treating the correct patient and providing the incorrect treatment or unnecessary treatment to a patient could have very harmful effects on the patient. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 7, \u00b6 5). On January 8, 2016, Ms. VanTiem asked Ms. Mocny to be a witness during the termination meeting and called plaintiff into her office to advise her that her employment was being terminated. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 7, \u00b6 6; Ex. 5, \u00b6 23). Plaintiff testified that she recalled the meeting, but could not recall anything about what happened therein. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 1, p. 67). Ms. VanTiem and Ms. Mocny testified that plaintiff was advised that her employment was being terminated because she provided physical therapy services to the wrong patient - in response, plaintiff said she was \"not terminated\" and refused to leave the premises. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 7, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8; Ex. 5, \u00b6\u00b6 24-25). Plaintiff left Ms. VanTiem's office and went to the second floor, where she indicated she was going to continue to treat patients; Ms. VanTiem indicated that if plaintiff refused to leave, she would call the police. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 7, \u00b6\u00b6 10-12; Ex. 5, \u00b6 26). While Ms. Mocny followed plaintiff to the second floor, Ms. VanTiem called the police. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 7, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12). After speaking to the police, Ms. VanTiem went to the second floor and was eventually able to convince plaintiff to return to the first floor and to Ms. VanTiem's office, but plaintiff still refused to leave the premises. (Ex. 7, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14; Ex. 5, \u00b6\u00b6 28-29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Officers Richard Zamojski and John Heinrich of the Madison Heights Police Department were dispatched to Cambridge East in response to the call for assistance by plaintiff's employer. (Dkt. 50, Exs. A-C). When they arrived, they were informed by Paige VanTiem, an administrator at Cambridge East, that although plaintiff had been fired earlier that morning, she refused to leave the work premises. (Dkt. 50, Exs. A-C). Ms. VanTiem then pointed to plaintiff, who was seated in a chair in the administrative office. (Dkt. 50, Exs. A-B). When Officer Zamojski approached plaintiff and asked her about what had occurred, she told him to \"stop harassing [her].\" (Dkt. 50, Exs. A-B). Ms. VanTiem told the officer that she wanted plaintiff to leave the premises immediately. (Dkt. 50, Exs. A-B). Officer Zamojski informed plaintiff that she needed to leave Cambridge East but she refused, and would not get out of the seat she was occupying. (Dkt. 50, Exs. A-C). She again told Officer Zamojski to stop harassing her and informed him that she was calling her lawyer. (Dkt. 50, Exs. A-B). Ms. VanTiem then asked plaintiff to leave, in Officer Zamojski's presence, advising plaintiff that she was terminated, to which plaintiff responded, \"I am not leaving.\" (Dkt. 50, Ex. A-B). Officer Zamojski again told plaintiff to exit the premises, this time warning her that she would be arrested for trespassing if she failed to do so. (Dkt. 50, Exs. A-C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   When plaintiff still would not get out of her seat, Officer Zamojski advised her three more times to leave, but instead of\n   complying, plaintiff responded, \"I need to work\" and told the officers that she needed to treat her patients. (Dkt. 50, Exs. A-C). Officer Zamojski, for at least the sixth time, told plaintiff to leave Cambridge East, finally prompting her to get out of her chair. (Dkt. 50, Exs. A-B). At that point, Officers Zamojski and Heinrich escorted plaintiff out of the administrative office, to a first floor hallway, where she again threatened to call her lawyer. (Dkt. 50, Exs. A-B). Officer Zamojski told plaintiff to leave the facility and call her lawyer outside. (Dkt. 50, Exs. A-B). Officer Zamojski told plaintiff to exit Cambridge East two more times but plaintiff continued to refuse to leave. (Dkt. 50, Exs. A-C). Officer Heinrich stated that he was asking her to exit for the final time, or she would be arrested. (Dkt. 50, Exs. A-C). This was at least the tenth time plaintiff was asked to leave the premises between the two officers. (Dkt. 50, Exs. A-C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   When plaintiff again refused to leave, Officer Heinrich got out his handcuffs and attempted to place plaintiff under arrest. (Dkt. 50, Exs. A-C). During the handcuffing process, plaintiff pulled away several times. (Dkt. 50, Exs. A-C). Finally, Officer Heinrich was able to place the handcuffs on plaintiff, checking them for tightness and double locking them to ensure they did not become tighter on her wrists. (Dkt. 50, Exs. A-B). The only physical injury plaintiff complains of in this lawsuit is discomfort in her sternum area, which she attributes, without support, to the fact that she was placed in handcuffs. (Dkt. 50, Ex. E, pp. 113-114). Plaintiff concedes that Officer Zamojski did not touch her at any point during the encounter that morning. (Dkt. 50, Ex. E, pp. 118, 123). Officer Zamojski did not have any further contact with plaintiff after she was handcuffed. (Dkt. 50, Ex. B). Additionally, plaintiff acknowledges that the only time Officer Heinrich touched her was to place her hands behind her back in order to handcuff her. (Dkt. 50, Ex. E, pp. 121-122).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Officer Heinrich placed plaintiff in his patrol car and transported her, without incident, to the Madison Heights Police Department, which was only a mile and a half away from Cambridge East. (Dkt. 50, Ex. A; Ex. C; Ex. G, In-Car Video). In the back of the patrol car, plaintiff did not complain of, and did not appear to be experiencing, any pain. (Dkt. 50, Ex. G; Ex. C). Inside the booking room, Officer Heinrich removed plaintiff's handcuffs and booked her with no problem. (Dkt. 50, Ex. C; Ex. E, pp. 122). Plaintiff did not request medical attention and did not appear to be in any kind of medical distress inside the booking room. (Dkt. 50, Ex. C; Ex. H - Booking Sheet). After the booking process was complete, plaintiff was placed into a holding cell and Officer Heinrich had no further contact with her. (Dkt. 50, Ex. A; Ex. C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Although her pleadings allege that she was held at the Madison Heights lockup for 74\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   hours, plaintiff's own testimony indicates that she was released on January 8, 2016 in time to have lunch at a Vietnamese restaurant with a friend. (Dkt. 50, Ex. E, pp. 74-75, 77, 83-84; Dkt. 5). This fact is supported by the Madison Heights Police Department's Detention Sheet, which indicates that plaintiff was lodged at the PD from approximately 9:13 a.m. to 11:25 a.m. (Dkt. 50, Ex. H - Detention Sheet). Plaintiff was charged with trespassing, a misdemeanor offense, and was represented by attorney Doraid Elder throughout the criminal proceedings. (Dkt. 50, Ex. I -Criminal\n   Complaint &amp; Appearance). On April 12, 2016, plaintiff entered into a plea bargain, pursuant to which she was permitted to plead no contest to the trespassing charge under a first offender program. (Dkt. 50, Ex. E, pp. 113, Ex. J - Plea Agreement). One of the terms of the plea agreement was that plaintiff agreed to \"release the City, its officers, employees and agents from any claims, damages, or causes of action of any kind that may be associated with the incident resulting in the prosecution of this case.\" (Dkt. 50, Ex. J). Both plaintiff and her attorney signed this release of liability.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p249\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

As discussed below, plaintiff's claim fails because she cannot show that she was treated differently than a similarly situated, non-protected employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In their motion for summary judgment, the Cambridge defendants point out that although plaintiff \"checked the box\" for failure-to-promote in her complaint, she never applied for any promotion, was never denied any promotion, and was not qualified for any promotion. Rather, according to her complaint, all of her claims derive from what occurred on January 8, 2016 - her termination. (Dkt. 5, p. 5). Plaintiff also asserts in her complaint that the only other physical therapist assistants were men and that Ms. VanTiem favored men and did not discipline male employees. (Dkt. 5, pp. 6-7). Defendants assert that plaintiff makes no specific allegations regarding her race or national origin or how she was allegedly treated differently than individuals outside of those protected characteristics. (Dkt. 5). Thus, defendants maintain that plaintiff's baseless allegations are insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding the Cambridge defendants' treatment of her compared to other employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Cambridge defendants also assert that plaintiff has no evidence to dispute their legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasoning for her termination or to establish that it was pretext for impermissible discrimination. Specifically, plaintiff has not and\n   cannot identify any similarly-situated employee who, like her, administered treatment to the wrong patient and was not subsequently disciplined. Ms. VanTiem and Ms. Mocny have testified that they are both unaware of any other employee who provided physical therapy treatment to the wrong patient. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 5, \u00b6 31; Ex. 7, \u00b6 20). Thus, the Cambridge defendants maintain that it is impossible for plaintiff to establish that a male employee with whom she compares her treatment was similarly-situated in all respects, as required and explained by\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .

Toledo Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"42493\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/964/577/#p583\">\n    964 F.2d 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 583 (6th Cir.1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Additionally, the Cambridge defendants contend that they have met their burden under the applicable\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   framework. They have repeatedly and consistently articulated the legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for plaintiff's termination: her admitted conduct in providing physical therapy treatment to the wrong patient. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 1, pp. 111-112; Ex. 7, \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, 22). Plaintiff acknowledged and admitted that she was an at-will employee during her employment. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 1, p. 9). The company's employment handbook explained that certain types of violations would result in immediate termination. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 10, Excerpt from Handbook, Section IV: Employment Practices). Here, Ms. VanTiem determined plaintiff's conduct warranted immediate termination. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 7, \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Finally, defendants argue that plaintiff has no evidence to establish pretext. She admitted the reasoning for terminating her employment was based in fact. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 1, pp. 111-112). There is no dispute that plaintiff, on January 5, 2016, administered physical therapy treatment to the wrong patient. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 1, pp. 111-112; Ex. 4, pp. 2-3; Ex. 5, \u00b6\u00b6 14-18; Ex. 6). According to the Cambridge defendants, plaintiff has no evidence that her very critical error in administering physical therapy treatment to the wrong patient was not the actual reason for Ms. VanTiem's decision to terminate her employment. Similarly, defendants assert that plaintiff has no evidence that her error was \"insufficient\" to justify the decision. Rather, to the contrary, defendants maintain that the error was extremely unusual (Ms. VanTiem and Ms. Mocny are unaware of any other employee who ever gave physical therapy treatment to the wrong patient) and could have had significant consequences for the company and the patient. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 5, \u00b6 31; Ex. 7, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 20). Therefore, defendants contend that plaintiff cannot possibly establish pretext.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4039528\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/533/381/#p393\">\n    533 F.3d at 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of discrimination, the Cambridge defendants have articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating plaintiff's employment, and plaintiff cannot rebut that reason by demonstrating it was mere pretext for impermissible discrimination, plaintiff's Title VII discrimination claims fail as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In response, plaintiff merely asserts that at the time of the incident in question, she was scheduled to work a full 8 hour shift and, per the employee handbook, employees may not stop working before the time specified for their shift to end. (Dkt. 50, p. 1; Ex. 2, Pg ID 629). Plaintiff also says that she was not afforded a progressive disciplinary process and that defendants' intention was to replace her with a new physical therapy assistant named Aaron Ivan Tanap, a younger, male, less expensive employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   While plaintiff maintains that defendants' reason for firing her was without merit, defendants are correct: she offers no evidence whatsoever to support her claim that she was terminated because of\n   her sex, national origin, or race or that the reason for her termination was merely a pretext. Thus, plaintiff has not met her burden of establishing a genuine issue of material fact regarding her claim that she was terminated because her race, national origin, or that the stated reason for her termination was merely a pretext. Consequently, her claim must fail. The undersigned also concludes that the Cambridge defendants have met their initial burden and summary judgment for them is appropriate on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   (b). ADEA Claim\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Next, while plaintiff alleges that her claims are brought, in part, pursuant to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (\"ADEA\") (Dkt. 5, p. 4), the Cambridge defendants point out that the prohibitions in the ADEA only apply to individuals who are at least 40 years of age.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20631\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). And, at the time she was terminated, plaintiff was not yet 40 years old. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 1, pp. 22-23). Thus, defendants maintain that plaintiff simply cannot sustain an age discrimination claim under the ADEA and it should be dismissed. Again, in response, plaintiff merely says that she was replaced by a younger man.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In order to establish a prima facie case under the ADEA, a plaintiff must show that: 1) she is over 40 years old and, thus, is within the class protected by the ADEA; 2) she suffered an adverse employment action; 3) she was qualified for the employment position at issue; and 4) she was either replaced by a person who was significantly younger or was treated differently than similarly-situated individuals who were significantly younger.\n   <em>\n    Grimes v.

As plaintiff testified, she was born on January 29, 1976. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 1, pp. 22). She was only 39 years old on the date she was terminated by defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23. Thus, plaintiff cannot make out a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADEA because she was under 40 years old on the date she was termination. Defendants are entitled to dismissal of this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   (c). Harassment/Hostile Work Environment Claim\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Lastly, the Cambridge defendants asserts that plaintiff's \"harassment\" claim must fail. In her complaint, plaintiff makes the general accusation that she was \"harassed\" by Ms. Reusser and Ms. VanTiem. (Dkt. 5, p. 6). Defendants acknowledge that Title VII offers employees protection from a \"workplace [ ] permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment.\"\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

At best, defendants assert that plaintiff has alleged generally that she was \"harassed\" on January 8, 2016, the date she was terminated. (Dkt. 5, pp. 5-6). Defendants maintain that, on that date, the undisputed evidence establishes that plaintiff was not subjected to an alleged \"hostile work environment\" -- rather, she was terminated for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason and subsequently refused to leave the premises, which ultimately resulted in her arrest. (Dkt. 52, Ex. 7, \u00b6\u00b6 3-5, 10-18, 22; Ex. 8, pp. 4-5). Defendants assert that plaintiff was never \"harassed\" nor subjected to a hostile work environment and to the extent she has claimed otherwise, those claims should be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In response, plaintiff merely recounts her version of the events on January 8, 2016. She does not explain or support her claim that she was subject to a hostile work environment. Indeed, she offers no evidence at all to support her claim that she was subjected to a hostile work environment, and there is no record evidence to support such a claim. Thus, plaintiff has not met her burden of establishing a genuine issue of material fact regarding her hostile work environment claim.

(Dkt. 50, Exs. A-C). Defendants also point out that they witnessed firsthand Ms. VanTiem's demand to plaintiff that she leave the property and plaintiff's refusal to comply. (Dkt. 50, Exs. A-B; Ex.

(Dkt. 50, Ex. B, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 7-8; Ex. C, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6-8). They also witnessed Ms. VanTiem, in their presence, ask plaintiff to leave the premises immediately, and saw her refuse. (Dkt. 50, Ex. B, \u00b6 9). Plaintiff also refused the officers' repeated requests to leave and failed to heed their warning that she would be arrested if she refused to do so. (Dkt. 50, Ex.

She claims that the handcuffing caused her to experience \"pain and enlarged [sic] on [her]chest area.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p395\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendants asserts that plaintiff neither alleges nor offers any evidence suggesting that Officer Heinrich used any excessive force in bringing plaintiff's hands behind her back for the purpose of handcuffing her. According to their affidavit and police report, Officer Heinrich took precautions such as double locking the handcuffs and checking them for tightness in order to ensure that plaintiff would not sustain injury during the handcuffing process. (Dkt. 50, Exs. A-B). The caution used\n   by Officer Heinrich in applying the cuffs, and the fact that excessive force was not used in cuffing plaintiff, is confirmed by her failure to allege any wrist injury as a result of the cuffing. (Dkt. 50, Ex. C). After the short one and a half-mile ride to the Madison Heights PD, plaintiff's handcuffs were removed and she did not complain of pain inside the lockup, nor did she request any medical attention. (Dkt. 50, Ex. C). Notably, plaintiff testified that Officer Zamojski did not touch her at all, so there is no basis for any excessive force claim whatsoever against this officer. (Dkt. 50, Ex. E, pp. 118, 123). Defendants maintain that the only physical contact she is alleging against Officer Heinrich is limited to his justified and proper handcuffing of plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The cases cited by defendants are apt. In particular, the Sixth Circuit has concluded that an excessive force claim cannot stand where plaintiff's allegation of excessive force stems solely from the application of handcuffs pursuant to an otherwise lawful arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shelton v.

Plaintiff does not rebut the facts presented by defendants in her response and merely reiterates her claim that Officer Heinrich \"pulled her hands behind her back unduly...\" (Dkt. 59, p. 2). Under the totality of the circumstances, the conduct of the officers was objectively reasonable and therefore the conduct does not involve \"excessive\" force in a Constitutional sense.\n   <em>\n    Kostrzewa v.

Ms. Rice confirmed on page 131 of that transcript that plaintiff's deposition was \"taken before me,\" that plaintiff was \"duly sworn at the aforementioned time and place,\" that the testimony was \"stenographically recorded in the presence of said witness and afterwards transcribed by computer under my personal supervision,\" and that the transcript is a \"full, true and correct transcript of the testimony given by the witness.\" (Dkt. 65, Ex. A, Deposition Transcript Certification). Thus, the authenticity of the deposition transcript is simply not an issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Plaintiff also contends that the audio and video attached to the Madison Heights defendants' motion for summary judgment are not authenticated. Rule 56(c) provides in pertinent part\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   (1) Supporting Factual Positions. A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the assertion by:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   (A) citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Rule 56 places the initial burden on the movant to demonstrate with evidence that there is no genuine issue of material fact. \"The proffered evidence need not be in admissible\n   <em>\n    form\n   </em>\n   , but its\n   <em>\n    content\n   </em>\n   must be admissible.\"\n   <em>\n    Bailey v.

Here, defendants have not responded to plaintiff's claims that the video and audio are inadmissible. However, the undersigned has not considered these exhibits in its above analysis and thus, their authenticity is immaterial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Plaintiff states that a record of the \"ROX REHAB Computer List of Patient PT/PTA Providers Schedules\" and other \"records files\" that she requested should be produced to her. As the Cambridge defendants explained in response to plaintiff's motion to compel, plaintiff did not request any records or files during discovery and they complied with all applicable discovery obligations. Notably, the Court denied plaintiff's motion to compel discovery because, among other reasons, she did not timely serve her discovery requests. (Dkt. 66, p. 4). Nothing in plaintiff's response brief suggests that she is moving for relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d), which requires the party opposing summary judgment to show by affidavit or declaration that, \"for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition.\" Even if plaintiff's response suggests that she needs discovery in order to fully respond to the motions for summary judgment, she has not complied with Rule 56(d). The Sixth Circuit has stated that the need to comply with Rule 56(d)\"cannot be overstated.\"\n   <em>\n    Cacevic v.

A party requesting additional discovery must demonstrate\n   \"its need for discovery, what material facts it hopes to uncover, and why it has not previously discovered the information.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11232329\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/226/483/#p488\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11232329\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/226/483/#p488\">\n    at 488-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A motion under Rule 56(d) may be properly denied when the requesting party \"makes only general and conclusory statements... regarding the need for more discovery and does not show how an extension of time would have allowed information related to the truth or falsity of [a document] to be discovered.\"\n   <em>\n    Ball v.
