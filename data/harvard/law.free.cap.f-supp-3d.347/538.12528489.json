He alleges that defendants violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act by sending deceptive or misleading letters seeking repayment of time-barred debts. After the Court heard oral argument on the motion for summary judgment, plaintiff moved to amend his complaint. For the reasons explained below, the Court will grant Defendants' motion for summary judgment and deny the motion to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In March 2017, Midland Credit Management, Inc. sent a dunning letter to plaintiff. The first page of the letter (not including a clip-off payment coupon), is shown here:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The letter speaks for itself, but a few points are worth highlighting, given the parties' arguments. As shown, the letter informed Stimpson that \"Midland Credit Management, Inc. (MCM)\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   is the debt collection company, which will be collecting on, and servicing your account.\" Midland offered Stimpson three \"Available Payment Options\": (1) He could immediately pay 60 percent of the balance; (2) he could pay 80 percent of the balance over six months; or (3) he could make \"Monthly Payments As Low As $50 per month.\" Midland touted the benefits of paying the debt as: (1) saving up to $458.24; (2) putting the debt behind him; (3) \"No more communication on the account\"; and (4) \"Peace of mind.\" Finally, the letter contains this disclaimer language, which is a central focus of this lawsuit: \"The law limits how long you can be sued on a debt\n   and how long a debt can appear on your credit report. Due to the age of this debt, we will not sue you for it or report payment or non-payment to a credit bureau.\" The letter also state that the offer expires in 30 days, and that Midland is \"not obligated to renew any offers provided.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2006, more than ten years before Midland sent this letter, Stimpson entered into a credit card agreement with HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A. Stimpson made purchases with the card but did not pay off his entire balance. In 2009, HSBC sold the account to a debt collector, Defendant Midland Credit Funding, LLC. As of March 2017, the balance on Stimpson's account was $1,145.60, presumably including interest and other charges. Stimpson has not disputed the amount or the validity of this debt. When Midland sent Stimpson the dunning letter in March 2017, the statute of limitations had long since expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Stimpson did not choose any of the payment options offered in the letter. Instead, he sued Midland for sending the letter. Stimpson alleges that Midland engaged in unfair and deceptive acts and practices in violation of Sections 1692e and 1692f of the FDCPA.\n   <em>\n    See Compl.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 1-1, \u00b6 42.

In the case of \"regulated credit sales, regulated loans or modifications thereof,\" the ICC invalidates choice-of-law agreements applying the law of another state when an (1) Idaho resident enters into a loan transaction while physically present in Idaho and (2) the creditor has either (a) solicited or advertised in Idaho or (b) received a written agreement evidencing the Idaho resident consumer's obligation or offer in the State of Idaho.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2028-41-201\">\n    Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 28-41-201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1), (2), &amp; (8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In opposing defendants' motion for summary judgment, Stimpson has not come forward with evidence that HSBC either received the credit card agreement in Idaho or solicited or advertised in Idaho. Likewise, Stimpson has not presented evidence that he entered into the credit card agreement while physically present in the State of Idaho or, for that matter, that he was an Idaho resident at the time he entered into the credit card agreement. He has thus failed to challenge the facts asserted by defendants in the manner required by Rule 56. More to the point, he has failed to come forward with evidence that would displace the choice-of-law provision contained in the credit card agreement he indisputably entered into. Accordingly, the Court concludes that Nevada law governs the parties' agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Stimpson also argues that, regardless of which state's law applies, he will still be disadvantaged because a partial payment could force him to argue choice of law in court and the \"least-sophisticated debtor\" would not be aware of the choice-of-law provision. Dkt. 26 at 19. There is some merit to this claim: choice-of-law analysis is complex and if Midland were to sue Stimpson, and then claim in that lawsuit that Idaho law governed, thus reviving Stimpson's debt, Stimpson might need an attorney to figure out and argue that Nevada law applies. But ultimately, the Court is not persuaded that collectors must warn of such a hypothetical, attenuated risk. Nevada law governs this account; Stimpson has not come forward with any evidence demonstrating that Nevada law does not apply; therefore; there is no risk of revival under Nevada law; and, therefore, Midland did not mislead or confuse Stimpson by failing to include a revival warning. The outcome might be different if Idaho law governed the account, but that issue is not before the Court and will thus be left for another day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Midland Did Not Mislead Stimpson by Telling Him He Could \"Save\" Money\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Aside from the alleged failure to include a revival warning, Stimpson's complaint does not specifically identify other parts of the letter that render it false, deceptive, misleading, unconscionable, or unfair.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Compl.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 1-1.

And in defending Midland's motion for summary judgment, Stimpson advanced two additional theories as to why the letter violates the FDCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   First, Stimpson argues that Midland made false statements by offering up three specific payment options and informing Stimpson that he could \"\n   <em>\n    save\n   </em>\n   $458.24\" if he elected to pay a lump sum within 30 days. Stimpson focuses on the word \"save,\" and says this is necessarily a misrepresentation because he had no obligation to repay his debt, and, therefore, paying\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   amount over zero could not be a \"savings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   But Stimpson's debt did not evaporate when the statute of limitations ran. He made purchases with his credit card and he didn't pay the bill when it came due. His credit card debt is thus a valid, outstanding obligation and it will remain so until he pays it, regardless of whether his creditor can successfully sue him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding, LLC v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270533\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1407/#p1411\">\n    137 S.Ct. 1407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1411,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=197%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20790\">\n    197 L.Ed.2d 790\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). Accordingly, Midland may continue to appeal to Stimpson to pay his debt, and, therefore, it stands to reason that Midland may send a letter offering to accept less than the full amount Stimpson owes - resulting in a savings for Stimpson. As the Sixth Circuit recently explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Legal defenses are not moral defenses, however. And a creditor remains free, in the absence of a bankruptcy order or something comparable\n   <em>\n    preventing\n   </em>\n   it from trying to collect the debt, to let the debtor know what the debt is and to ask her to pay it. There thus is nothing wrong with informing debtors that a debt remains unpaid or for that matter allowing them to satisfy the debt at a discount.

But the FDCPA does not mandate an explicit statute-of-limitations disclosure, and the parties do not point to any Ninth Circuit authority to that effect.

From there, the more specific question becomes whether the letter misleadingly states or implies that Midland could enforce Stimpson's time-barred debt in court. If so, then Midland has violated the FDCPA by misrepresenting the \"legal status\" of Stimpson's debt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    (b) Midland's Statute-of-Limitations Disclaimer Is Not Confusing or Misleading\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Both parties point to the disclaimer language in their effort to convince the Court that the letter either is, or is not, misleading.

Further, in\n   <em>\n    Buchanan\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth Circuit suggested, in dicta, that if the debt collector had included the language Midland used here, that would have corrected \"any possible misimpression by unsophisticated consumers.\"\n   <em>\n    Buchanan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6887696\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/393/#p396\">\n    776 F.3d at 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Seventh Circuit made the same suggestion in\n   <em>\n    Pantoja v.

That was the one case (out of the five) where the collector included a disclaimer about the age of the debt. But the disclaimer did not use the same language Midland uses: rather, it included only the second sentence - the one that says, \"Because of the age of your debt, we will not sue you for it and we will not report it to any credit reporting agency.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277517\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/679/#p684\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277517\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/679/#p684\">\n    at 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court noted that it was somewhat troubled by the inefficiency of not tackling that issue, given that in the future it seemed likely that plaintiff's counsel would be back before the Court with a different plaintiff whose credit card agreement was governed by Idaho law. Regardless, though, the Court explained that, despite the inefficiency, there were good reasons to restrict itself to the more precise issues presented by Stimpson's dealings with Midland. The Court also advised the parties to inform Court staff if they both agreed that they would prefer that the Court decide that issue.\n   <em>\n    See Hearing Tr.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 34, at 37-38.

The parties disagree on this issue, but the larger point is that it appears discovery would be necessary to determine if Idaho law does, in fact, govern, Mr. Holt's agreement. The discovery deadlines have long since passed, which further supports the Court's decision to deny the motion to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    V\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Finally, the Court will address the plaintiff's motion for class certification.
