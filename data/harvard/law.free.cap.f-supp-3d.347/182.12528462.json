PAULEY III, Senior United States District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The United States of America (the \"Government\") moves for approval of a proposed consent decree touted by the parties to bring organizational reform to the New York City Housing Authority (\"NYCHA\") and correct its systemic violations of federal health and safety regulations. On September 26, 2018, scores of NYCHA tenants, elected officials, and representatives of community organizations appeared for a fairness hearing to assist this Court in assessing the proposed decree. One after another, they rendered harrowing accounts of the squalid conditions in their apartments and the indifference of NYCHA management, called for the firing or prosecution of NYCHA officials, and urged\n   greater tenant participation in the negotiation and enforcement of the proposed consent decree. Two of these community organizations, the City-Wide Council of Presidents and At-Risk Community Services (the \"Intervenors\"), also filed formal opposition briefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This human dimension cannot be ignored despite the parties' attempts to limit the Court to a perfunctory review of the validity and form of the settlement. For decades, Congress has addressed the importance of ensuring that public housing residents live in decent, safe, and sanitary conditions. Congress vested the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") with broad authority and responsibility to monitor the performance of public housing agencies receiving federal funds and to aggressively reform those agencies that misuse them. But the parties' proposed decree sidelines HUD and displaces the congressional framework for remedying public housing failures with a parallel framework to be managed by the judiciary. And aside from general directives to comply with applicable statutes and regulations, the proposed decree does not offer any specificity as to NYCHA's required or enjoined conduct. Rather, it contemplates the future elaboration of the terms of the injunction through the development of performance requirements and plans. These performance requirements and plans are not subject to this Court's approval, but will be developed by a monitor, approved by the Government, and subject to judicial review only under an arbitrary and capricious standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Because the record reveals a substantial basis to conclude that this proposed decree is not fair, reasonable, or consistent with the public interest, the Government's motion to approve the consent decree is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This case is about the disastrous human toll resulting from a complete bureaucratic breakdown of the largest public housing agency in the United States. NYCHA's stated mission is to provide safe, decent, and affordable housing for the 400,000 or more low-and moderate-income New Yorkers who live in approximately 175,000 apartments in 326 housing developments. NYCHA's reported population alone places it within the fifty most populous cities in the Nation. But NYCHA's size is paralleled by its organizational disarray in providing any semblance of adequate housing for some of the most vulnerable members of society and its systemic cover-up of a host of fundamental health and safety issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   More than two years ago, the Government began investigating NYCHA's violations of federal health and safety requirements and its deception of federal regulators as to its compliance with those requirements. The breathtaking scope of NYCHA's deficiencies came into public focus through the accretion of media scrutiny, the high-profile departures of some of NYCHA's top leadership, and federal and state court class actions by NYCHA's own tenants to remedy some of the\n   same housing conditions at issue in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 11, 2018, the Government's investigation culminated in the filing of a complaint and proposed settlement (the \"Complaint\" and \"Proposed Consent Decree\"). The Complaint, which seeks the appointment of a monitor and other injunctive relief, asserts three claims against NYCHA. First, the Government claims that NYCHA substantially defaulted on its covenants and obligations under its \"Annual Contributions Contract\" with HUD, which incorporates federal lead-paint safety regulations and NYCHA's obligation under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.703\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to provide \"decent, safe, and sanitary housing.\" (Compl., ECF No. 11, \u00b6\u00b6 268-271 (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437d(j)(3) ).) Second, it asserts a claim under the federal Anti-Fraud Injunction Act to enjoin NYCHA's ongoing or imminent false statements to federal regulators about its housing conditions and its compliance with federal law in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 272-276 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201345\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).) Finally, the Government brings a claim under the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 to restrain NYCHA's failure to comply with federal lead-based paint regulations. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 277-282.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Because the determination of whether the Proposed Consent Decree should be approved requires an examination of the terms of the settlement and the claims brought in this action, a brief overview is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    The Complaint\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This action may present the rare instance in which the allegations in the complaint are understated. As the Complaint alleges, and as numerous tenants testified from first-hand knowledge, NYCHA's apartments and buildings are literally falling apart-and NYCHA knows it. In March 2018, the New York State Department of Public Health found that 83% of inspected units contained some condition that could pose a health hazard to tenants. (Compl. \u00b6 161.) Somewhat reminiscent of the biblical plagues of Egypt, these conditions include toxic lead paint, asthma-inducing mold, lack of heat, frequent elevator outages, and vermin infestations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Lead Paint\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Contrary to NYCHA's public assurances that lead paint was not widely used in NYCHA and that the vast majority of its developments did not have lead paint, the Government alleges that NYCHA's own documents reveal that more than half of NYCHA's developments contain lead paint somewhere. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 54-56.) At minimum, NYCHA's assertions indicate that roughly 51,000 apartments in at least 1,200 buildings in at least 92 developments have lead paint on their walls, floors, ceilings, windows, doors, radiators, or pipes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 54, 57.) Approximately 173,000 residents, of which 11,500 are children under 6, live in these 92 developments. (Compl. \u00b6 57.) But these numbers are only the tip of the iceberg-City and New York State health inspections have identified lead paint in developments that NYCHA previously declared to be lead free. (Compl. \u00b6 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Despite the prevalence of lead paint in NYCHA's apartments, NYCHA inexplicably failed to conduct required inspections\n   and evaluations for years. For instance, NYCHA conducted less than 25% of the biennial risk assessment evaluations it should have conducted in the 92 developments with lead paint between 2010 and 2017. (Compl. \u00b6 60.) For 50 of these 92 developments, NYCHA failed to conduct a\n   <em>\n    single\n   </em>\n   evaluation during that period. (Compl. \u00b6 60.) NYCHA's senior management knew that these evaluations were not being conducted as early as 2011. (Compl. \u00b6 95.) Even where NYCHA found a child with elevated blood lead levels who lived in a development previously determined to be lead free, it still-in defiance of all common sense-did not conduct risk assessments of that development. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 78-79.) Further, NYCHA simply stopped performing legally required annual visual assessments for lead paint hazards in 2012. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 64-67.) NYCHA's senior management allegedly knew that these assessments were not being conducted as early as 2013. (Compl. \u00b6 96.) Although NYCHA partially restarted inspections in May 2016, the 4,000 visual assessments it conducted generated 3,900 work orders to abate lead paint hazards. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 66-67.) When extrapolated, this rate of work orders underscores the prevalence of lead paint hazards in NYCHA housing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 68 (alleging that more than 80% of the 9,000 apartments inspected in 2017 contained potential lead paint hazards).) And when NYCHA did perform maintenance work, the majority of that work was performed by employees who did not have proper training in lead-safe work practices and did not safely abate lead paint hazards. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 70-75, 80.) This, too, was known to NYCHA's management. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 99-100.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Importantly, these statistics underscore the tangible impact of NYCHA's apathy on residents. Lead is toxic to all humans. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.) Even small amounts of lead may lead to cancer, hypertension, kidney failure, and other serious health conditions. (Compl. \u00b6 32.) Young children who unwittingly ingest even small amounts of lead paint flakes and lead dust may suffer irreversible neurological problems.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6 32.) The Government alleges that between 2010 and 2016, the City's Department of Health confirmed that at least 19 children had elevated blood lead levels while living in lead-riddled apartments. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 82-85.) Despite senior management's knowledge, NYCHA refused to provide any information or report these cases to HUD. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 76-77, 101.) Moreover, as the Complaint alleges, this number massively understates the actual number of children afflicted with elevated blood lead levels for at least two reasons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 82.) First, NYCHA employed an obstructionist and counterintuitive policy of immediately contesting every order by the Department of Health to abate lead paint following an inspection. (Compl. \u00b6 85.) These challenges\n   often resulted in the Department of Health's retraction of findings of lead paint and withdrawal of abatement orders, rendering under-counting all but certain. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 84-87.) Second, only a subset of children for whom exposure to lead paint could cause deleterious health effects were tested for elevated blood lead levels. (Compl. \u00b6 88.) As a NYCHA spokesperson intimated in a July 29, 2017 press release, even one child with elevated lead levels is one too many.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Mold, Heat, Elevators, and Vermin\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Endemic mold, insufficient heat during the wintertime, broken elevators, and infestations of rats, mice, and cockroaches are also a part of daily life for NYCHA tenants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 159-160.) Between 2013 and 2016, for example, NYCHA tenants made between 18,000 and 28,000 complaints about mold growth every year. (Compl. \u00b6 164.) During that same period, tenants lodged between 117,000 and 146,000 complaints each year about flooding and leaks, which contribute to mold growth. (Compl. \u00b6 166.) These annual numbers of complaints are increasing. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 164, 166.) And even where NYCHA claims to have addressed mold, it reoccurs 30% of the time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 171, 176.) Similarly, the 825,000 heating complaints that NYCHA's tenants made between 2011 and 2016 bear testament to its widespread and persistent inability to provide sufficient heat during frigid New York winters. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 177-186.) For example, during the winter of 2015-2016, roughly 43,000 residents made over 155,000 complaints of insufficient heat. (Compl. \u00b6 181.) Two years later, more than 323,000 residents-or over 80% of NYCHA's population-suffered heating outages lasting an average of 48 hours.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6 183.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As for NYCHA's elevators, the Government alleges that NYCHA experienced an average of 94 outages per elevator between 2011 and 2016. (Compl. \u00b6 188.) In 2016, nearly 70% of buildings with at least one elevator had no working elevators at some time-an occurrence apparently so common that NYCHA refers to it by the colloquialism \"double-header.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 190, 193.) Finally, cockroaches, mice, and rats are legion in NYCHA housing. Between 2010 and 2016, NYCHA tenants lodged over 280,000 complaints about cockroaches, more than 130,000 complaints about mice, and almost 15,000 complaints\n   about rats-numbers that are also increasing. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 200, 202.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   These statistics, while helpful in understanding the scope of NYCHA's failures, are given meaning by the toll that these physical conditions take on NYCHA residents. Mold may release toxins and allergens correlated with respiratory problems, contributing to NYCHA residents' disproportionate rate of asthma hospitalizations and forcing tenants to remove sheets of mold themselves. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 165, 172.) Frigid apartments give tenants no choice but to leave their stoves and ovens on all night for heat. (Compl. \u00b6 184.) Broken elevators trap residents for hours, put the elderly and disabled to the dilemma of waiting in lobbies or clambering up flights of stairs, and tragically, sometimes kill NYCHA residents. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 191-197.) And plainly, pests can carry disease, exacerbate respiratory conditions, and contaminate food and water. (Compl. \u00b6 203.) While aware of these conditions, NYCHA ignored tenant complaints or only nominally addressed them because of incompetence or apathy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 166-168, 175-176 (describing NYCHA's closing of mold work orders without remediation); Compl. \u00b6 186 (alleging NYCHA management's awareness of insufficient heat); Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 192-195 (alleging NYCHA's management's awareness of broken elevators); Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 204-210, 212-214 (detailing NYCHA's practices of arbitrarily closing out work orders or faking exterminations by spraying water).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    NYCHA's Deception\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Complaint alleges more than NYCHA's callous indifference to the well-being of its tenants, but that it whitewashed these deficiencies for years. According to the Government, NYCHA's deception was entrenched within its culture, from top-level management downward. In March 2016, for example, NYCHA's Chair testified before the New York City Council that NYCHA regularly performed visual assessments of lead paint as legally required. (Compl. \u00b6 111.) Despite learning in April 2016 that NYCHA did not perform these visual assessments, NYCHA's Chair did nothing. (Compl. \u00b6 97.) The false testimony by NYCHA's Chair is emblematic of NYCHA's pattern of deceiving anyone who it needed to falsely assure, whether it be elected officials, NYCHA's tenants, the general public, or HUD. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 103-117.) Indeed, between 2010 and 2016, NYCHA falsely certified its compliance with HUD's lead-paint safety regulations and its obligation to provide \"decent, safe, and sanitary\" housing in certifications submitted to HUD, amendments to its Annual Contributions Contract with HUD, and in drawing down operating funds provided by HUD. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 92, 241-264.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   NYCHA also lied to HUD and the public to allay concerns over a work order backlog spinning out of control. Between 2010 and 2012, NYCHA faced mounting pressure from HUD and criticism from the media to address its backlog of 400,000 work orders, which the media blamed as the source of NYCHA's decaying apartments. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 215-220.) As of August 2012, NYCHA was on pace to exceed the 170,000 work orders that its 2011 inspections had generated. (Compl. \u00b6 221.) Thus, it sought to engineer a backlog reduction. First, it suspended annual inspections between August 2012 and the summer of 2014. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 221-228.) Even though some of its executives expressed misgivings that a lengthy moratorium on inspections would run afoul of its obligations under the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, those concerns went unaddressed. (Compl. \u00b6 225.) This scheme allowed NYCHA to move 200,000 work orders off its books during the suspension. (Compl. \u00b6 226.) Second, in February 2013, NYCHA revived a\n   policy allowing staff to close work orders by reporting that the tenant was not home. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 233-235.) NYCHA's executives explicitly made this change to reduce the number of open work orders, which allowed them to close another 200,000 work orders in 2013. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 233-234.) Nonetheless, NYCHA triumphantly-but falsely-claimed to HUD and the public that it reduced its backlog based on initiatives to improve efficiency and productivity. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 229-232, 236-240.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Finally, NYCHA sought to game HUD's public housing inspection system in order to avoid the additional scrutiny that came with low inspection scores, including more frequent inspections, corrective action plans, and the potential of a federal receivership. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 121-132.) These inspections evaluate four \"indicators\" of a public housing agency's performance-physical conditions, financial condition, management, and capital funding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   24 C.F.R. part 902 subpart A. A public housing agency receives an overall score, as well as separate scores for each indicator.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20902.9\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 902.9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 902.11. In stark contrast to its lethargic attitude when it came to the health and safety of its tenants, NYCHA approached its inflation of HUD inspection scores with tactical precision and a take-no-prisoners approach. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 156.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On the eve of inspections, NYCHA transformed its developments into veritable Potemkin villages. The Complaint alleges that NYCHA's management circulated dossiers on individual inspectors so that its staff could identify and patch over specific conditions that certain inspectors were known to scrutinize. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 133-135.) And during inspections, NYCHA staff raced ahead of inspectors to address any unforeseen deficiencies. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 153-155.) NYCHA also employed a panoply of stratagems designed to temporarily conceal the crumbling physical conditions of its housing. These practices, which NYCHA's management knew about or actively directed, included (1) temporarily shutting off a building's water supply to hide water leaks; (2) plugging holes in walls and ceilings with newspaper and cork before painting over the hole; (3) building fake walls to conceal broken doors and dilapidated rooms; (4) locking doors and posting \"danger\" signs to keep inspectors away from rooms with dangerous or unsanitary conditions; and (5) hiding improperly stored hazardous materials. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 137-148.) Remarkably, NYCHA indoctrinated its staff in these deceptive tactics through internal guidelines, including the decade-long distribution of a \"Quick Fix Tips\" guide on how to conceal problematic conditions from HUD inspectors. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 149-152.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    The Proposed Consent Decree\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Proposed Consent Decree is the product of months of negotiations among the Government, NYCHA, and the City of New York,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   all of whom are signatories to the agreement. In broad strokes, the proposed decree contains factual admissions by NYCHA, provisions regarding the selection of a monitor and the monitor's powers and responsibilities, provisions for funding by the City, and provisions for injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Factual Admissions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Under the Proposed Consent Decree, NYCHA admits that between 2010 and 2016, it falsely certified its compliance with federal statutory and regulatory requirements-including\n   those relating to lead paint safety-to HUD. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 7(a)-(c).) NYCHA also admits that its inspections revealed that lead paint exists on the premises of more than half of its developments, including in the apartments of 92 developments. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 7(d).) These admissions also indicate that in the first half of this decade, NYCHA failed to conduct legally required lead paint risk assessment evaluations or visual assessments, failed to ensure that its staff use lead-safe work practices, and failed to provide HUD with any information regarding children living in NYCHA developments found to have elevated blood lead levels. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 7(e)-(h).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Similarly, NYCHA makes admissions regarding many of the appalling conditions of its apartments. These include 300 cases between 2014 and 2016 in which NYCHA staff verified mold growth covering more than 100 square feet and a mold reoccurrence rate exceeding 30%; 825,000 complaints of insufficient heat between 2011 and 2016; the loss of heat for 80% of NYCHA's residents during the winter of 2017-2018; the majority of NYCHA elevator buildings experiencing at least one period with no functioning elevators in 2016; and more than 260,000 work orders for roaches, more than 90,000 work orders for mice, and nearly 36,000 work orders for rats between 2013 and 2016. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 7(i)-(q).) And despite these conditions, NYCHA admits that it reported to HUD between 2012 and 2013 that it had made significant progress in reducing its work order backlog, while obscuring the fact that it generated substantially fewer work orders by suspending annual inspections. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 7(r).) Finally, the Proposed Consent Decree contains admissions that NYCHA artificially inflated its HUD inspection scores, including through its distribution of a list of \"Quick Fix Tips\" to deceive HUD inspectors. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 7(s)-(u).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Monitor Provisions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Government characterizes the monitorship as the \"centerpiece\" of the Proposed Consent Decree. Even though the Government suggests that the direction NYCHA's obligations may take will depend on who the monitor is, it still-more than five months after filing the proposed decree-has not identified any candidate who it might nominate to be the monitor. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   July 10, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 8 (statement by Government counsel that applicants for monitor may \"have different ideas and structures for what they would bring to that process\").) Thus, this Court's evaluation of whether the Proposed Consent Decree should be approved must necessarily occur with incomplete knowledge of its key monitorship component.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In any event, the monitor will be proposed by the Government in consultation with the City and NYCHA and-at the Government's discretion-with stakeholders such as New York State, the New York City Council, the City-Wide Council of Presidents, and other tenant groups. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 15.) The monitor\n   is subject to this Court's supervision as an officer of the court. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 40.) NYCHA bears the burden of paying \"all reasonable fees and costs\" of the monitor. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 53.) The proposed decree provides no cap on the costs of the proposed monitorship, and the Government could not offer any estimate, recognizing only that \"it will be a substantial amount of money\" that \"is hard to estimate until the monitor is in place.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   July 10, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 8-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Ultimately, the monitor's purpose is to \"ensure that NYCHA (1) complies with all Lead Paint Laws, (2) provides housing that is decent, safe, sanitary, and in good repair, ... (3) does not make false or misleading statements to the United States, and (4) implements the terms of the Consent Decree.\" (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 14.) To that end, the Proposed Consent Decree requires the monitor to ensure that NYCHA complies with federal, state, and local lead paint laws, including EPA and HUD regulations relating to lead-paint inspections, work practices, and disclosures. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 18(a).) Similarly, the monitor must ensure that NYCHA complies with HUD health and safety standards relating to mold, heating, elevators, and pests. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 18(b)-(e).) To address NYCHA's false or misleading statements to federal regulators, the Proposed Consent Decree requires NYCHA to consult with the monitor to create a Compliance Department, a Quality Assurance Department, and an Environmental Health and Safety Department. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6\u00b6 18(g), 63-65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Proposed Consent Decree contemplates the future development and implementation of frameworks to assist NYCHA in achieving compliance with the requirements set forth in paragraph 18(b)-(f). Performance Requirements are \"objective quantitative benchmarks\" to be developed by the monitor, in consultation with NYCHA and the City, and approved by the Government. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6\u00b6 13(p), 23.) After a Performance Requirement becomes effective, NYCHA and the monitor must prepare an Action Plan that includes \"specific actions\" to bring NYCHA into compliance with the Performance Requirement and paragraph 18's mandates, \"a date certain\" to satisfy those requirements, and \"interim milestones with specific completion dates.\" (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 27.) Action Plans may also provide for policies, procedures, systems, or structures for NYCHA to adopt to comply with the decree. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 34.) Apart from Action Plans, NYCHA must also work with the monitor to develop an Operational Plan that \"clearly delineat[es]\" the respective spheres of NYCHA's Chair, General Manager, and Board, as well as an Organizational Plan directed toward implementing changes to NYCHA's structure. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6\u00b6 28, 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   To assist in achieving the goals of the monitorship, the Proposed Consent Decree permits the monitor full access to NYCHA's documents, data, and other information. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 19.) The decree also grants the monitor full access to NYCHA's services, programs, facilities, and premises. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 19.) Additionally, the monitor may communicate with NYCHA's personnel without any prior notice to or permission by NYCHA. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 20.) The monitor may also engage any third parties at its discretion to assist in performing its responsibilities. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 17.) Finally, the monitor may seek \"extraordinary relief\" from this Court, \"including the authority to enter into contracts on NYCHA's behalf,\" upon a showing of \"compelling evidence\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   that NYCHA's inability to comply with an Action Plan frustrates the purpose of the proposed decree. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Evaluation of the monitor and NYCHA's progress occurs through reporting and feedback mechanisms. The monitor must submit a quarterly report to the Government, NYCHA, and this Court setting forth the work performed by the monitor and NYCHA's progress and compliance. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6\u00b6 41-44.) After the Proposed Consent Decree has been in place for five years, these periodic reports must also assess whether NYCHA meets the requirements for termination of the decree. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6\u00b6 43, 97.) Separately, NYCHA community leaders and representatives may provide feedback through a Community Advisory Committee that meets at least twice a year to discuss the achievement of the monitorship's purposes and to advise the monitor on the prioritization of projects. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 21.) Outside of the Community Advisory Committee, the monitor must also formulate procedures through which residents and other NYCHA stakeholders may provide input. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Funding\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   To assist NYCHA in complying with the Proposed Consent Decree and the to-be-determined Performance Requirements and plans, the City commits to providing almost $3 billion in previously budgeted capital and expense funding, as well as an additional $1 billion in capital funding over the next four years and $200 million in capital funding each subsequent year.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 54.) If the City fails to furnish the capital funds during the period prescribed in paragraph 54, those funding obligations will be carried over to the next fiscal year. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 57.) Similarly, capital funds that NYCHA fails to spend will be \"carried over and added to each subsequent fiscal year until spent.\" (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 57.) Unbelievably, despite NYCHA's $31.8 billion capital needs deficit and its widely publicized heating crisis last winter,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Government attests that NYCHA already left unspent roughly $377 million of the $483 million in capital funding provided by the City for fiscal year 2018, which will be carried over into fiscal year 2019. (Declaration of Monica P. Folch in Support of the United States' Motion to Enter the Proposed Consent Decree, ECF No. 45 (\"Folch Decl.\"), \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   These funding provisions are somewhat malleable. With respect to the City's funding obligations, the City retains the option to authorize additional capital or expense spending to NYCHA, although the City's\n   counsel confirmed that the City had no plans to allocate additional funding at present. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 60; Sept. 26, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 188.) However, the Proposed Consent Decree also sets forth procedures for the City to delay or be relieved by this Court of its funding obligations in the event of undue financial hardship that renders it unable to pay some or all of the amounts prescribed in paragraph 54. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6\u00b6 61-62.) Moreover, the proposed decree notes that $550 million in state resources \"may be available,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   in addition to ongoing operating and capital funds from HUD, which will not be offset by the amount that NYCHA is slated to receive from the City.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6\u00b6 38, 52;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 18 (alleging that roughly $900 million of NYCHA's operating budget comes from HUD and that HUD provides over $300 million per year in capital funding).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Injunctive Relief\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Proposed Consent Decree requires NYCHA to take certain specified actions without waiting for the effective date of the proposed decree, the appointment of a monitor, or the issuance of an Action Plan. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 66.) For instance, NYCHA must comply with HUD and EPA regulations relating to lead-safe work practices and abatement. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 67.) Under the Proposed Consent Decree, NYCHA must also take steps to notify residents of lead paint to which they may be exposed. In particular, NYCHA must notify residents if their apartments or common areas in their buildings have been identified as containing lead paint no later than November 8, 2018-or if a child under 6 resides in such an apartment, no later than September 9, 2018. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 68.) Finally, NYCHA must keep at each development's management office physical copies of all materials required to be disclosed by HUD and EPA's lead-disclosure regulations. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 69.) Those materials must be present and available for inspection no later than October 9, 2018 and must be sent to each resident no later than December 8, 2018. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 69.) To date, this Court has not received any update from the parties as to whether NYCHA has complied with the obligations for which the proposed decree sets a specific deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Second Circuit recognizes a \"strong federal policy favoring the approval and enforcement of consent decrees.\"\n   <em>\n    SEC v.

In particular,\n   <em>\n    Citigroup\n   </em>\n   's focus on judicial deference to a government agency's consent decree is somewhat in tension with a court's quasi-managerial role in implementing a consent decree to reform a state or local institution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thompson v.

In reiterating the urgent need for a monitor, the Government claims that NYCHA has already violated paragraph 67 of the Proposed Consent Decree by failing to \"immediately\" comply with its obligations regarding lead-safe work practices even before the approval of the proposed decree. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum of Law in Support of the United States' Motion to Enter the Proposed Consent Decree, ECF No. 44 (\"Gov't Brief\"), at 13-16; Folch Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-8.) Unsurprisingly, NYCHA disputes that it violated paragraph 67, explaining that it has been making efforts to comply that involve many complex and interrelated steps, which take time to implement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NYCHA's Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Enter the Consent Decree, ECF No. 46 (\"NYCHA Brief\"), at 4 n.11; Folch Decl., Ex. C.) Whatever the merits of the parties' positions, NYCHA's evident-and facially reasonable-belief that it is not in breach of the Proposed Consent Decree suggest that its terms are not sufficiently clear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Moreover, even assuming that the obligations the Proposed Consent Decree imposes on NYCHA to comply with various health and safety regulations may fairly be construed as injunctive relief-which, as noted below, may not be entirely clear-those terms are similarly amorphous. In relevant part, the agreement provides that NYCHA shall comply with (1) federal, state, and local lead paint safety statutes and regulations; and (2) federal regulations requiring HUD housing to be decent, safe,\n   sanitary, and in good repair with respect to mold, heating, elevators, and pests. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 18(a)-(f).) These provisions also require NYCHA to (1) make its housing free of lead paint \"within an accelerated timeframe\"; (2) \"remedy the conditions described in the Complaint\" related to mold, heating, elevators, and pests \"and prevent recurrence of those conditions\"; and (3) \"attempt to avoid and promptly address any other health and safety issue that arises.\" (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 18(a)-(f).) Finally, the Proposed Consent Decree requires NYCHA to, \"[a]s soon as practicable after the Monitor's appointment,\" create certain plans \"collaboratively\" or \"in consultation with\" the monitor \"for the achievement of\" or \"to achieve sustained compliance with\" subdivisions (a)-(g) of paragraph 18. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6\u00b6 27-34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   At the outset, the body of statutes and regulations with which NYCHA must comply is not entirely defined. In relevant part, paragraph 18 requires NYCHA to \"comply in all respects with Lead Paint Laws,\" (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 18(a)(7) ), which is defined to mean \"federal, state or local lead paint safety statutes and regulations,\" (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 13(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ) ). While the proposed decree lists several federal statutes and regulations that are included within this definition, it does not indicate which state or local statutes and regulations would form the basis for NYCHA's obligations. And even though paragraph 18 requires more than a naked directive to comply with the laws it does identify, its instructions to remedy and prevent recurrence of various health and safety conditions described in the Complaint as well as those that may arise still fail to specify \"the ways in which [NYCHA] must alter [its] behavior.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mickalis Pawn Shop\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5649658\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/645/114/#p145\">\n    645 F.3d at 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding insufficient for Rule 65(d) an obligation to \"act 'in full conformity with applicable laws pertaining to firearms,' and to 'adopt[ ] appropriate prophylactic measures to prevent violation' of those laws, without specifying which laws are 'applicable' or identifying the ways in which the defendants must alter their behavior to comply with those laws\");\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perez v.

To be fair, the directive that NYCHA must formulate plans to achieve and sustain compliance with federal health and safety regulations offers more clarity than other previously described provisions. Still, its ambiguity as to when those plans must be developed or how much cooperation with the monitor is necessary does not allow this Court to meaningfully determine when those provisions have been violated.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King v.

And in this Court's view, the lack of clarity is compounded by the more basic question of whether subsections (a)-(f) of paragraph 18 of the proposed decree affirmatively enjoin NYCHA or merely set forth the\n   <em>\n    monitor\n   </em>\n   's duty to ensure that NYCHA complies with federal health and safety standards-a distinction implied by the parties' briefs.

Without additional concreteness, NYCHA cannot possibly know the acts that are restrained or required, and this Court cannot fulfill its duty to enforce compliance with its orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   This is not to say that the Proposed Consent Decree must painstakingly detail every act that NYCHA must take or forbear from taking. Indeed, such an attempt would almost certainly be a fool's errand in the context of institutional reform litigation, for which injunctions \"are not so much peremptory commands to be obeyed in terms[ ] as they are future-oriented plans designed to achieve broader public policy objectives in a complex, ongoing fact situation.\"\n   <em>\n    N.Y.

Specifically, Section 6 of the U.S. Housing Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder set forth detailed procedures for HUD to evaluate the quality of public housing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437d(f) ; 24 C.F.R. part 902 subpart B;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.703\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; for HUD to evaluate a public housing agency's management performance,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437d(j)(1) ; 24 C.F.R. part 902 subpart D; for HUD to identify and assist public housing agencies whose performance is deficient,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437d(j)(2) ; 24 C.F.R. part 902 subparts A &amp; G; and for HUD to take action if a public housing agency is deemed to be in substantial default,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437d(j)(3) ; 24 C.F.R. part 907.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Consistent with HUD's primary regulatory responsibility, Congress endowed HUD with a robust arsenal of remedies to address a public housing agency's management and operational failures. For a public housing agency in substantial default-as the Government alleges here-HUD has the authority to (1) solicit proposals from other public housing agencies and private housing management agents to manage the public housing agency's housing or programs; (2) solicit proposals from other public housing agencies and private entities to oversee implementation of funds to assist the public housing agency with capital and management activities; (3) take possession of the public housing agency and, in certain circumstances, appoint an administrative receiver; or (4) require the public housing agency to make other arrangements for managing the public housing agency \"acceptable to the Secretary and in the best interests of the public housing residents and families.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437d(j)(3)(A), (j)(3)(B)(ii)(III)(bb). In addition to these remedies, HUD may also provide \"technical assistance for existing [public housing agency] management staff\" or \"assistance deemed necessary, in the discretion of HUD, to remedy emergency conditions.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20907.7\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 907.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   While these statutory and regulatory remedies do not require the public housing agency's consent or contemplate judicial involvement, HUD may seek the judicial appointment of a receiver with broad remedial powers to correct the substantial default, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437d(j)(3)(A)(ii), which a court must appoint upon a determination of substantial default, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437d(j)(3)(F). The receiver may abrogate the public housing agency's contracts, demolish and dispose of the public\n   housing agency's assets, establish new public housing agencies, consolidate the public housing agency into other public housing agencies, circumvent certain state and local requirements relating to procurement or financial controls, and exercise additional powers granted by the court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437d(j)(3)(C). Moreover, the HUD Secretary may make available to the receiver \"such assistance as the Secretary determines in the discretion of the Secretary is necessary and available to remedy the substantial deterioration of living conditions in individual public housing projects or other related emergencies that endanger the health, safety, and welfare\" of public housing residents. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437d(j)(3)(E). These drastic remedies have been deployed successfully to reform other public housing agencies, including HUD's takeover of the Chicago Housing Authority in the 1990s and the judicial appointment of receivers to oversee the Boston Housing Authority in the 1980s and the District of Columbia Housing Authority in the 1990s.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The legislative history for 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437d(j) also corroborates HUD's primary responsibility to reform failing public housing.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Digital Realty Tr., Inc. v.

The Senate committee report recognized that then-existing law \"provide[d] HUD with a strong set of powers\" that \"if properly implemented, would go a long way towards reforming the management of troubled [public housing agencies] and improving the living conditions of tenants who reside in housing administered by these agencies.\" S. Rep. No. 102-332, at 46 (1992). But as Senate Report 332 explained, Section 6(j) needed to be bolstered because HUD \"has rarely exercised these powers ....\" S. Rep. No. 102-332, at 46. It reaffirmed HUD's role as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   The Committee believes strongly that the federal government has an affirmative responsibility-to the residents of public housing, to the federal taxpayers-to use its resources to remedy the management deficiencies in those few local agencies that are troubled. HUD cannot \"shift the blame\" to local malfeasance or incompetence; it ultimately has the responsibility to monitor the performance of recipients of federal aid and to act aggressively when such aid is being misused.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   S. Rep. No. 102-332, at 46. These passages do not suggest that Congress intended\n   HUD to sit idly by and allow a district court to reform a public housing agency in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Against this legislative backdrop, HUD's comparative abdication of its remedial responsibilities and powers under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437d(j)(3) and 24 C.F.R. part 907 is particularly striking, especially given all of the Government's allegations regarding the deplorable conditions of NYCHA housing and NYCHA's deliberate attempts to pull the wool over HUD's eyes. Indeed, the Proposed Consent Decree relegates HUD to a narrow, auxiliary role in relaxing its own regulatory constraints to allow NYCHA to comply with the decree, lifting its earlier \"zero threshold\" sanction requiring NYCHA to obtain HUD approval before drawing any federal funds, agreeing not to offset federal funding by the amount of the City's funding obligation, and meeting with the monitor and NYCHA to \"discuss strategies to improve NYCHA's ability to comply with its obligations under [the decree].\" (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6\u00b6 48-52.) The inversion of roles contemplated by the Proposed Consent Decree is illustrated by the Corporation Counsel's statement at the July 10, 2018 conference regarding the alignment of the Government, NYCHA, and the City. Specifically, he shared the City's expectation that \"because we are allied in interests that we will have in the Government, in the U.S. Attorney's Office, an effective advocate for NYCHA with Washington, and specifically with HUD.\" (July 10, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 46.) But any role that functionally cabins HUD to getting out of the way of the monitor and NYCHA contravenes the central role that Congress envisioned for HUD in enacting the very statutory provisions that the Complaint and the Proposed Consent Decree seek to enforce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Instead, to address NYCHA's management and operational deficiencies, the proposed decree establishes an elaborate monitorship to bring about organizational reform under the auspices of this Court and appropriates funding to assist in achieving the monitorship's purposes. In particular, the Proposed Consent Decree obligates the monitor to develop Performance Requirements directed toward addressing the health and safety conditions referenced in paragraph 18. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6\u00b6 23-26.) Likewise, the Proposed Consent Decree requires NYCHA, together with the monitor, to develop Action Plans, an Operational Plan, and an Organizational Plan to remedy NYCHA's violations of the U.S. Housing Act and HUD regulations. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6\u00b6 27-29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   But such an arrangement implicates the fundamental separation of powers among the branches of the Federal Government by commandeering a court's equitable powers to fashion a comprehensive injunctive remedy parallel to-yet entirely unmoored from-the existing statutory and regulatory framework.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480961\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/144/#p179\">\n    505 U.S. at 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480961\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/144/#p179\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that \"[t]he Constitution's division of power among the three branches is violated where one branch invades the territory of another, whether or not the encroached-upon branch approves the encroachment\").

At bottom, the proposed decree outsources the formulation of NYCHA's obligations-the violation of which is ostensibly subject to this Court's contempt powers-to the monitor and the parties without any meaningful\n   judicial review. In this regard, the Proposed Consent Decree's delegation of this Court's ultimate authority to determine the terms of the injunctive relief is closer to a displacement of judicial authority than a decree in which a monitor aids the court by developing reforms to be approved by the court.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Floyd v.

To the contrary, Congress has committed to HUD the authority and responsibility to reform public housing agencies that receive federal funding. And to that end, it has established extensive remedies for HUD to aggressively address deficiencies in a public housing agency's management or the conditions of its housing. This Court has already discussed the concerns that the Proposed Consent Decree raises with respect to separation of powers and the delegation of equitable judicial authority. But the incongruity between the Complaint and the Proposed Consent Decree also raises doubts as to the legitimacy of any judicial imprimatur on the proposed decree. In particular, the Complaint asserts a \"claim\" under Section 6(j) of the U.S. Housing Act based on NYCHA's violations of its obligations under its Annual Contributions Contract, which incorporates federal lead-paint safety regulations and its obligation under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.703\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to provide decent, safe, and sanitary housing. While the Proposed Consent Decree in some general sense requires NYCHA to comply with these regulations,\n   the Government has made clear that the focus of the proposed decree is a monitorship structured entirely by the parties.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Firefighters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209292\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/501/#p525\">\n    478 U.S. at 536, 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209292\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/501/#p525\">\n    106 S.Ct. 3063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (questioning whether a consent decree \"may be structured almost entirely by the parties, even though the statute which the decree enforces may not authorize any such relief ...\" and expressing the view that the scope of a consent decree is \"properly restrain[ed] ... to that of implementation of the federal statute pursuant to which the decree is entered\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Questions of judicial legitimacy aside, the adversarial positions the parties have staked after signing the proposed decree and during the pendency of the motion for approval also portend this Court's\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   conscription into superintending NYCHA indefinitely-a role that judges are ill-equipped to assume.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clinton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11955064\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/999/320/#p326\">\n    999 F.2d at 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"[f]ederal courts operate according to institutional rules and procedures that are poorly suited to the management of state agencies\"). In particular, the Government's moving papers claim that NYCHA has already defaulted on its obligations to comply immediately with lead-safe work practices under paragraph 67 of the Proposed Consent Decree. (Gov't Brief, at 13-16.) NYCHA disputes that it violated the proposed decree, claiming that its efforts to comply had preceded the signing of the proposed decree and accelerated after that. (NYCHA Brief, at 4 n.11; Folch Decl. Ex. C.) In a similar vein, the Government has criticized NYCHA's unilateral appointment of a NYCHA insider who never previously worked in a compliance department as Chief Compliance Officer without consulting the Government. (Gov't Brief, at 17.) Though not outside the letter of the Proposed Consent Decree-which only requires that the Chief Compliance Officer be appointed in consultation with the monitor-NYCHA's counsel conceded that this appointment was not in the spirit of the parties' agreement. (Sept. 26, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 176.) When pressed at oral argument, NYCHA's counsel contended that the proposed decree had not yet been approved and that NYCHA believed that compliance work needed to continue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Sept. 26, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 175-77.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Further, the parties' divergent characterizations of the Proposed Consent Decree's key provisions-the monitorship, according to the Government, and NYCHA's obligations to follow the law, according to NYCHA-betray a disagreement over the monitor's role that evokes shades of the \"Peerless\" case familiar to first-year law students.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Raffles v. Wichelhaus\n   </em>\n   , 159 Eng. Rep. 375 (Ex. 1864). In addition to setting forth the general monitorship framework, the Proposed Consent Decree clarifies that the monitor \"shall not be responsible for NYCHA's day-to-day operations.\" (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 35.) Aside from this limitation, there is much room for disagreement as to the monitor's role. (\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   July 10, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 8 (statement by Government counsel noting the uncertainty in the degree to which the monitor's operations will be integrated with NYCHA's current infrastructure and\n   acknowledging that \"as people apply or suggest that they should be monitor, they have different ideas and structures for what they would bring to that process\").) In sum, the parties' statements on the record and subsequent public sniping tell a tale of two monitors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The Government has consistently described the monitorship as the \"centerpiece\" of the proposed decree whose role is not simply to monitor compliance with the decree, but to \"direct NYCHA to make overarching organizational and work force changes and to take specified steps to achieve health and safety improvements,\" including directing NYCHA to perform work through independent contractors, entering into contracts on NYCHA's behalf, and creating Performance Requirements and various organizational and operational plans. (Gov't Brief, at 1;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Sept. 26, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 151-52 (representing that the monitor will \"help NYCHA fix its problems and, where necessary, step in to fix them\"); July 10, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 6 (describing the monitor as \"not your ordinary monitor in some significant respects\" and that the monitor has \"its own authority laying out plans for improving NYCHA and for reorganizing the organization\").) While NYCHA's papers say little about how it envisions the monitor's role, its counsel's statements at the fairness hearing suggest a constrained view of the monitor as merely facilitating collaboration and providing increased accountability. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 26, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 177, 180-81.) Given NYCHA's active deceit of federal regulators, however, whether such a passive role can assure any meaningful accountability is doubtful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The public skirmishing between NYCHA's Interim Chair and the U.S. Attorney reveals the wide chasm between the parties' expectations for the monitor. Only two weeks after NYCHA's tenants testified at length about the need for greater oversight, NYCHA's Interim Chair-who was nowhere to be found during the public testimony by tenants-expressed his concerns \"about what could be a creeping monitorship that's more in the operational mode, as opposed to a monitor who monitors.\" Janaki Chadha,\n   <em>\n    Brezenoff raises doubts about NYCHA monitor under federal consent decree\n   </em>\n   , Politico (Oct. 10, 2018), https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2018/10/10/brezenoff-raises-doubts-about-nycha-monitor-under-federal-consent-decree-642333. He also criticized the proposed monitorship \"because it's much more actively constructed, where there's more of a management role, at least in vision,\" calling it \"a prescription for difficulty, if not disaster.\" He lamented that when he signed the proposed decree, he \"saw it as more of a monitorship, and in some of the interactions that are going on, [he] see[s] the possibility that others might have a different view.\" One of these \"others\" is the U.S. Attorney, who retorted that NYCHA's Interim Chair \"should be getting on board with the monitorship he signed off on\" and that NYCHA's belated resistance to anything more than a milquetoast monitor was \"not a smart move.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nolan Hicks,\n   <em>\n    Feds blast top NYCHA management as a 'real disaster'\n   </em>\n   , N.Y. Post (Oct. 30, 2018), https://nypost.com/2018/10/30/feds-blast-top-nycha-management-as-a-real-disaster.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In the end, NYCHA may be correct that whatever sluggishness the Government perceives in NYCHA's efforts to comply with the lead-safe work practices requirement does not fall outside the letter of the Proposed Consent Decree. And it may be that NYCHA's haste to appoint a compliance officer does not logically violate a decree that has yet to be judicially approved. Such actions, however, evince a troubling propensity for NYCHA to do what it wants, when it wants. The point is\n   that NYCHA's unilateral actions and statements decrying the monitor's role while this Court considers whether to approve the proposed decree-a time in which one would expect NYCHA to be on its best behavior-unearth fissures in the parties' collaborative front and foreshadow the beginning of prolonged judicial management of NYCHA through a monitorship whose costs may be limitless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Ultimately, whether the parties choose to address this public emergency through a judicially managed consent decree, a receivership under the U.S. Housing Act, or in some other way, it appears that half-measures that merely maintain the status quo while shielding the powers-that-be from politically unpalatable solutions are doomed to fail. As discussed, HUD is not blameless. The City's equivocal role in this settlement also bears mention. It is a non-party claiming to be bound only by its funding obligations while also maintaining that it has no legal obligation to provide any funds at all. At the same time, the City's Corporation Counsel extolled the \"unprecedented\" nature of the proposed decree's \"item by item\" negotiation that personally involved Corporation Counsel, the U.S. Attorney, and the Mayor of the City. (July 10, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 44.) Indeed, New York law puts the City much closer to the center of the action in granting the Mayor the power to control NYCHA by appointing its chairperson and board, who serve at his pleasure.\n   <em>\n    Paige v. N.Y.C. Hous. Auth.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203863451\">\n    2018 WL 3863451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *13 (S.D.N.Y.

Law \u00a7 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3) ). Finally, the State of New York lurks in the wings with $550 million that may help fund NYCHA's capital needs. The Governor-having previously overhauled the Chicago Housing Authority during his tenure as HUD Secretary-may well understand better than others what is at stake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   To be sure, this Court shares the parties' doubts that any solution will offer an immediate panacea, in large part due to NYCHA's crippling $31.8 billion capital deficit and its inexplicable dysfunction in leaving untouched hundreds of millions of dollars allocated to it by the City. But desperate times call for desperate-and sometimes politically unpopular-measures, whether that be exploring public-private housing partnerships, infill development, or the sale of air rights. Other measures may be necessary and even less palatable, such as replacing NYCHA's management or abrogating collective-bargaining agreements and vendor contracts. Any of these measures requires political will at all levels, from the HUD Secretary, to the Governor, to the Mayor, and to NYCHA's Interim Chair. The well-being of more than 400,000 New Yorkers depends on it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   This Court does not reject the Proposed Consent Decree lightly. The rejection of this decree will likely delay sorely needed relief for NYCHA tenants while the parties decide whether to re-negotiate, seek administrative remedies, litigate, or appeal, and a court's refusal to accept a proposed consent decree may have \"practical consequences for the government's ability to negotiate future settlements.\"\n   <em>\n    Microsoft Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11343155,3620246\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/56/1448/\">\n    56 F.3d at 1456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But as it stands, the proposed decree suffers from fatal procedural flaws, including its formless injunctive relief and enforcement mechanisms. The proposed decree also raises serious concerns implicating the separation of powers and the delegation of equitable judicial power, which appear attributable at least in part to the parties' sidestepping of the existing statutory scheme to address public housing failures. And on a more basic level, the nature of the claims asserted by the Government\n   raises questions as to the scope and applicability of\n   <em>\n    Citigroup\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Any judicial decree entered in this action will have a direct, tangible, and long-lasting impact not only on the parties, but most importantly on NYCHA's tenants. Because the Proposed Consent Decree is not fair and reasonable, and because its entry would disserve the public interest, the Government's motion for approval is denied. The parties are directed to submit a joint status report by December 14, 2018 detailing their respective positions on how they wish to proceed. That status report should also advise this Court regarding NYCHA's compliance to date with its obligations under paragraphs 67-70 of the Proposed Consent Decree.

At the July 10, 2018 conference, this Court scheduled a fairness hearing for September 26, 2018. The following day, the Government extended the monitor application deadline to September 12, 2018. On September 12, 2018, the Government again extended the time to submit a monitor application-this time, to the date this Court approves the Proposed Consent Decree.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    While these sums are not insignificant, they pale in comparison to NYCHA's estimated $31.8 billion in unmet capital needs. To put such a lofty figure in more understandable terms, NYCHA's capital needs amount to an expenditure of over $180,000 per apartment. But even assuming that the proposed decree lasts through fiscal year 2027 (the final year for which the City had previously allocated capital funding), the City's funding would only cover roughly $23,000 of each apartment's unmet capital needs. At the rate of the City's funding obligation-which is the only committed source of capital funds in the Proposed Consent Decree-NYCHA's current capital needs would not be met until the year 2166. This estimate also assumes that NYCHA's housing stock will not deteriorate further over the next 148 years.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    On October 18, 2018, the Mayor announced that boilers in twelve NYCHA developments had been replaced since last winter and that NYCHA was ready to deploy five mobile boilers for heating emergencies. This Court wonders how many other boilers could have been replaced if NYCHA had committed some of the $377 million it left on the table.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    Of course, this observation says nothing about whether these funds will in fact be released, and the State of New York is not a signatory bound by the proposed decree. The parties' agreement that the $550 million in state resources \"are important to the success of [the Proposed Consent Decree]\" is similarly aspirational. (Proposed Consent Decree \u00b6 38.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    The City expressed concern that HUD might reduce its capital funding contribution to NYCHA if HUD included the City's funding under the Proposed Consent Decree in its funding formula. This \"very technical\" provision was included to ensure that HUD could not do so. (Sept. 26, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 200-01.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    This action also raises the issue of\n    <em>\n     Citigroup\n    </em>\n    's applicability to a proposed consent decree that purports to resolve an action that asserts prototypical government enforcement claims\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    other claims that do not fit the typical government enforcement model. Nonetheless, this Court need not wade into these uncertain waters because its decision is binary-it only has the power to enter or reject the Proposed Consent Decree.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Petro-Suisse Ltd.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205348595\">\n     2013 WL 5348595\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *3.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    NYCHA's records indicate that 2,537 out of 11,182 NYCHA employees are NYCHA residents, as of October 1, 2018.

A court's substitution of its own judgment for that of a regulator is a raw exercise of judicial power. By contrast, this Court's rejection of the Proposed Consent Decree does not animate those concerns.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    NYCHA's Interim Chair reportedly offered a more pointed response, stating \"We are not in violation of the consent decree.

Of course, whatever urgency NYCHA's Interim Chair perceived, the unilateral nature of NYCHA's action undercuts the collaborative atmosphere the parties say they are cultivating.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
