The Court held a hearing on August 13, 2018. The primary issues are: (i) whether Defendant Airswift Holdings Limited has minimum contacts with New Mexico; (ii) whether Hernandez is diverse from Defendants Chevron U.S.A., Inc. and Grand Isle Shipyard, Inc.; and (iii) whether the Court should allow Hernandez to amend Plaintiff's Original Complaint for Personal Injuries, (First Judicial District Court, County of Santa Fe, State of New Mexico), filed September 6, 2017, filed in federal court on November 1, 2017 (Doc. 1-6)(\"Complaint\") to add Swift Technical Services, L.L.C. as a defendant, which would destroy complete diversity if it previously existed. The Court concludes that (i) Airswift Holdings lacks minimum contacts with New Mexico; (ii) all plaintiffs were diverse from all defendants at the time of removal; and (iii) Hernandez may amend his complaint to add Swift Technical. Accordingly, the Court grants the Motion, denies the Motion to Stay, denies the Motion to Remand, and grants the Motion to Amend. Because\n   the Court has permitted joinder of a non-diverse Defendant, the Court's jurisdiction has been destroyed, so it will remand the case to the First Judicial District Court, County of Santa Fe, State of New Mexico.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court takes its facts from the Complaint.

Airswift Holdings argues that there is no general personal jurisdiction, because \"Airswift is not incorporated in New Mexico, does not do business in New Mexico, does not own property in New Mexico, does not pay taxes in New Mexico, and\n   does not have a bank account in New Mexico.\" Motion at 4-5. Airswift Holdings argues that it is not subject to specific personal jurisdiction, because it lacks minimum contacts with New Mexico.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 5. According to Airswift Holdings, \"the only basis for specific jurisdiction articulated by Plaintiff is that, on information and belief, Airswift provided services or materials at Chevron's Buckeye CO2 Plant near Lovington, New Mexico.\" Motion at 5. Airswift Holdings contends that such an allegation is \"not supported by any facts.\" Motion at 5. Specifically, it argues that specific personal jurisdiction is lacking, because Airswift Holdings: (i) does not employ Hernandez; (ii) does not provide any services or materials to Chevron's Buckeye CO2 plant; and (iii) has no contractual relationship with Chevron U.S.A. or Grand Isle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 5 (citing Declaration of Peter Searle \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, at 1-2 (executed November 7, 2017), filed November 8, 2017 (Doc. 7-1)(\"Searle Decl.\") ). Finally, Airswift Holdings argues that none of its employees were working at that plant in 2015 or 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 5 (citing Searle Decl. \u00b6 6, at 2). Accordingly, Airswift Holdings requests that Court dismiss Hernandez' claims against it for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Motion to Stay\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Hernandez moves the Court to stay its ruling on the Motion pending jurisdictional discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Stay at 1. He argues that the stay is appropriate so that Hernandez can uncover Airswift Holdings' relationship with its related entity, Swift Technical, a Texas L.L.C., which, according to Hernandez, had employees or agents at the Lovington plant who were involved in negligent conduct that gives rise to Hernandez' injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Stay at 1, 5 (citing Notice of Denial of Compensability/Liability and Refusal to Pay Benefits at 1 (dated November 8, 2017), filed November 22, 2017 (Doc. 15)(\"Denial Notice\") ). Hernandez asserts that a stay to conduct jurisdictional discovery is appropriate \"when the existing record is inadequate,\" but a \"plaintiff's jurisdictional allegations may be supported through discovery.\" Motion to Stay at 5 (citing\n   <em>\n    Trintec Indus. v. Pedre Promotional Prods.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9173623\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/395/1275/#p1283\">\n    395 F.3d 1275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1283 (Fed. Cir. 2005) ). Hernandez asserts that discovery will show that Airswift Holdings is a \"multi-billion dollar corporation\" that has injected its products into New Mexico. Motion to Stay at 8. According to Hernandez, such a showing will demonstrate that personal jurisdiction is proper.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Stay at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Motion to Remand\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Hernandez moves to remand to state court for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Remand at 1. He contends that Airswift Holdings does not carry its removal burden, because it does not present any evidence to contest the Complaint's allegations that Grand Isle's principal place of business is in Odessa, Texas, and that Airswift Holdings' principal place of business is Houston, Texas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Remand at 7 (\"It simply alleges, without any evidence, that Plaintiff is mistaken.\"). Hernandez concludes that, because Airswift Holdings did not present sufficient evidence to rebut the Complaint's allegations, remand to state court is required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Remand at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Hernandez also argues that removal is untimely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Remand at 9. He argues that, because removal was more than thirty days after Chevron U.S.A. and Grand Isle received the Complaint, the Court should remand the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Remand at 9. Hernandez argues that the evidence does not support Airswift Holdings' argument to the contrary, that Airswift Holdings did not receive the Complaint\n   until October 2, 2017, as the state court record shows that the Complaint was served on Airswift Holdings on September 11, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Remand at 9-10. Accordingly, Hernandez asks the Court to remand the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Remand at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Motion to Amend\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Hernandez moves to amend the Complaint to add Swift Technical Services, L.L.C. as a defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Amend at 1. He argues that, should the Court grant the amendment, remand to state court would be proper, because Swift Technical is a Texas citizen, thus destroying complete diversity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Amend at 4-5. Hernandez asserts that Swift Technical's joinder \"is necessary to resolve the underlying issues of liability in this suit,\" and that, should the Court deny joinder, Hernandez would have to sue Swift Technical separately in state court, wasting judicial resources.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Amend at 5-6 (\"This would then create parallel proceedings and a race to judgment and res judicata between the Plaintiff's present suit against Defendants ... and the Plaintiff's state court suit against Swift Technical.\"). Hernandez asserts that allowing an amendment is proper, because he may have \"inadvertently\" brought his claim against Airswift Holdings, \"a related entity,\" rather than Swift Technical, the actual entity \"whose negligent conduct proximately caused Plaintiff's injuries and damages.\" Motion to Amend at 6-7. Thus, he asks the Court to allow an amendment adding Swift Technical as a defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Amend at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    5.\n    <em>\n     Response to Motion to Stay\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Airswift Holdings responds to the Motion to Stay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant Airswift Holdings Limited's Response to Plaintiff's Motion to Stay Ruling Pending Jurisdictional Discovery on Airswift's Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction at 1, filed December 6, 2017 (Doc. 20)(\"Motion to Stay Response\"). Airswift Holdings argues that the Court should deny the Motion to Stay, because Hernandez has not made \"a colorable or prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction.\" Motion to Stay Response at 3 (citing\n   <em>\n    Cent. States Se. &amp; Sw. Areas Pension Fund v. Reimer Express World Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1094358\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/230/934/#p946\">\n    230 F.3d 934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 946 (7th Cir. 2000) ). Airswift Holdings contends that a proper way for Hernandez to meet that prima facie showing is to present evidence, \"such as affidavits,\" but Hernandez has made no such showing. Motion to Stay Response at 3-4 (\"[T]he Court may not take the plaintiff's allegations in the complaint as true if the defendant's proffered evidence to controvert them.\"). According to Airswift Holdings, the only evidence that Hernandez has presented -- the Denial Notice -- is inadmissible hearsay and is not authenticated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Stay Response at 4 n.1. It adds that, even if the Court can properly consider the Denial Notice, it lacks \"any information that would establish that Airswift had ... minimum contacts with the state of New Mexico.\" Motion to Stay Response at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Airswift Holdings also argues that the Court should deny the Motion to Stay, because jurisdictional discovery will not establish personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Stay Response at 5-6. According to Hernandez, jurisdictional discovery will demonstrate that Airswift Holdings is connected to Swift Technical, but Airswift Holdings argues that, even if Swift Technical is a subsidiary or affiliate of Airswift Holdings, that connection will not establish personal jurisdiction over Airswift Holdings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Stay Response at 6. Finally, Airswift Holdings contends that the Court should deny jurisdictional discovery, because Hernandez' request is just a fishing expedition, as Hernandez' complete\n   lack of discovery requests demonstrate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Stay Response at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    6.\n    <em>\n     Chevron U.S.A.'s Response to the Motion\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Chevron U.S.A. responds to the Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant Chevron U.S.A.

Although the policy justifications behind the fraudulent-joinder doctrine would seem to apply just as strongly to the forum-defendant rule as they do to complete diversity, there is an important legal distinction between the two requirements: complete diversity is a requirement of original subject-matter jurisdiction and is found in \u00a7 1332; the forum-defendant rule is unique to removal jurisdiction -- it does not apply to cases filed in federal court in the first instance -- and is found in \u00a7 1441.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"283\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 1441(b)(2).

Professor E. Farish Percy of the University of Mississippi School of Law has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   Fraudulent misjoinder occurs when a plaintiff sues a diverse defendant in state court and joins a non-diverse or in-state defendant even though the plaintiff has no reasonable procedural basis to join such defendants in one action. While the traditional fraudulent joinder doctrine inquires into the substantive factual or legal basis for the plaintiff's claim against the jurisdictional spoiler, the fraudulent misjoinder doctrine inquires into the procedural basis for the plaintiff's joinder of the spoiler. Most state\n   joinder rules are modeled after the federal joinder rule that authorizes permissive joinder of parties when the claims brought by or against them arise \"out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences\" and give rise to a common question of law or fact. Thus, in a case where the joined claims are totally unrelated, a federal district court may find removal jurisdiction pursuant to the fraudulent misjoinder doctrine even though the plaintiff has a reasonable substantive basis for the claim against the jurisdictional spoiler.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   E.

We hold that the district court did not err in finding an attempt to defeat diversity jurisdiction by fraudulent joinder.

For the first factor, Airswift Holdings and Chevron U.S.A. admit that there is some prejudice no matter what the Court decides: \"If joinder is denied, Plaintiff would suffer some prejudice in having to litigate its claims in state court against Swift in a separate action, but if joinder is granted, Defendants would suffer prejudice in losing their chosen federal forum.\" Airswift Holdings' Response to Motion to Amend at 7.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Chevron U.S.A. Response to Motion to Amend at 1. Their main argument, accordingly, turns on the notion that Hernandez \"inexplicably\" delayed amendment and offers the amendment now only so that he can defeat federal jurisdiction. Airswift Holdings' Response to Motion to Amend at 7.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Chevron U.S.A. Response to Motion to Amend at 1. According to Airswift Holdings and Chevron U.S.A., Hernandez knew that Swift Technical was a potential defendant \"at the time of his injury,\" which was December 3, 2015, and thus, his Motion to Amend dated almost two years later must be sought only to defeat federal jurisdiction. Airswift Holdings' Response to Motion to Amend at 7 (citing Proposed Amended Complaint \u00b6 8, at 3).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Chevron U.S.A. Response to Motion to Amend at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   The Court, however, disagrees that Hernandez knew or should have known-at least not until very recently-that Swift Technical was a viable defendant. Based off of Hernandez' representations, he believed that Airswift Holdings was the proper party, until November 13, 2017, when he learned through the Notice of Denial that there was another entity, Swift Technical, that could have been involved.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 10. Although the injury occurred on December 3, 2015, it is not apparent that Hernandez should have known that Swift Technical was a viable and proper defendant in 2015, because of a merger between the date of injury and the date of this lawsuit that altered the company contracting with Chevron U.S.A.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-240\">\n   [B]etween plaintiff's injury and filing of this lawsuit ... Airs Energy, which is not in the lawsuit, and Swift Worldwide Resources merged. It was our understanding that Swift Worldwide Resources\n   was the entity that contracted with Chevron to provide oilfield personnel and services. But because of that merger, we added Airswift, the merged entity, [as a party, but] unbeknownst to us ... there was another subsidiary of both these other entities called Swift Technical Services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   Tr. at 17:19-18:4 (Isaac). Given this corporate history, the Court cannot conclude that Hernandez should have known Swift Technical was a proper defendant on the date of his injury. As the Court noted at the hearing, when a plaintiff's attorney initiates a case, oftentimes documents and information are thrust unceremoniously into that lawyer's lap.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 42:17-25 (Court). The attorney has to make many judgment calls in a short time based off of that imperfect information stream.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 42:17-25 (Court). The Court does not \"fault the plaintiff, much, if any, for the way he's handled the motions here.\" Tr. at 42:24-43:1 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   Airswift Holdings and Chevron U.S.A. next contend that, even if Hernandez did not know of Swift Technical around the time he was injured, he must have known of Swift Technical on October 26, 2017, when he reported an on the job injury for workers compensation benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Airswift Holdings' Response to Motion to Amend at 7 (citing Notice of Denial); Chevron U.S.A. Response to Motion to Amend at 1. At the outset, the Court concludes that, even if Hernandez knew that Swift Technical was a viable defendant on October 26, 2017, there is no undue delay in his request to add Swift Technical a little more than a month later on November 30, 2017. The Motion to Amend was filed very early on in the case, before even the Magistrate Judge had entered a scheduling order,\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   which usually sets a rule 15(a) deadline to amend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Harjo v.

Accordingly, the Court concludes there is no undue delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   The thrust of Airswift Holdings' and Chevron U.S.A.'s argument, however, is not that there is undue delay from Hernandez' October 26, 2017, knowledge, but that his knowledge predates the Notice of Removal, suggesting that Hernandez sought to amend only to destroy diversity jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Airswift Holdings' Response to Motion to Amend at 7-8; Chevron U.S.A. Response to Motion to Amend at 1. The evidence upon which Airswift Holdings and Chevron U.S.A. relies to assert that argument, however, does not demonstrate that Hernandez had knowledge of Swift Technical on October 26, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Denial at 1. To start, the Notice of Denial is dated November 8, 2017 -- eight days after removal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Denial at 1. To be sure, it states that, \"[o]n 10/26/2017, we received notice that you reported an on the job injury,\" but it does not detail any information that is in the notice Hernandez sent. Notice of Denial at 1. The record does not contain\n   Hernandez' request for workers compensation. Hernandez' initial request for worker's compensation does not need to and may not have listed Swift Technical as a party responsible for his injury. Indeed, the Notice of Denial reflects that there may have been some ambiguity in Hernandez' request, because the Notice of Denial details that it investigated both Airswift Holdings and Swift Technical as potential employers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Denial at 1. For his part, Hernandez contends that he \"was not aware of Swift Technical\" as a viable defendant until after receiving the Notice of Denial on \"November 13, 2017.\" Reply at 10. Rather, until that date, he, understandably, believed that Airswift Holdings -- an entity related to Swift Technical -- was the proper party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 10. The ambiguity in the Notice of Denial already mentioned supports Hernandez' representation. It is plausible that Hernandez listed Airswift Holdings in his request for employment compensation, and it was only when the insurance carrier investigated the claim did that carrier realize that Swift Technical may have been an operative party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   The case's procedural history also supports Hernandez' representation that he thought Airswift Holdings was the proper party until he received the Notice of Denial. In late September, 2017, Hernandez names Airswift Holdings in his Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 3, at 1-2. It is not until November 8, 2017 that Airswift Holdings responds by moving to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 1. About three weeks later, and a little over two weeks after Hernandez receives the Notice of Denial, Hernandez filed his Motion to Amend to add Swift Technical.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 3, at 1-2; Motion at 1; Motion to Amend at 1. Given that history and the Notice of Denial, the Court concludes that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that Hernandez sought to amend to destroy the Court's jurisdiction. Instead, the evidence suggests that, as Hernandez learned new information about the suit's proper parties, he appropriately and timely sought to amend the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   Thus, on balance, the Court concludes that the rule 20 factors favor allowing Hernandez to amend his complaint to add a party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lane v.

With respect to\n    <em>\n     Laughlin v.

Furthermore, the notice of removal in\n    <em>\n     Laughlin v.
