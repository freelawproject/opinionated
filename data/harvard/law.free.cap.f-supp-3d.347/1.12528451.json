The complaint recites the harms that could have flowed from a loss of accreditation, but DEAC never had the chance to evaluate the College in order to reach that decision. Indeed, the College admitted that it chose not to pursue the Show Cause process further after DEAC issued the Directive, and it never filed the application for re-accreditation. Moreover, WLC's accreditation remained intact while it was under the Show Cause Directive. Because the College did not avail itself of the opportunity to demonstrate compliance with DEAC's standards, it withdrew from the process, and its accreditation lapsed. Thus, all of the alleged harms flowed directly from WLC's inaction rather than any action on the part of DEAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Because the College cannot plausibly allege that DEAC's actions caused it any harm, it has failed to state a claim for negligence, and this provides the Court with yet another reason to dismiss Count V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Privilege\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Further, to the extent that the College has based its negligence count on DEAC's publication of the Show Cause Directive, the claim cannot survive because that communication was privileged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McBride\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7863168\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/658/205/#p207\">\n    658 A.2d at 207-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (dismissing the defamation count in addition to the injurious falsehood count because they were both based on the absolutely privileged communication).
