(\"Limnia\" or \"Plaintiff\"), a manufacturer of battery\n   systems for electric vehicles, applied for a loan from the Department of Energy (\"DOE\") through a congressionally-authorized clean energy program known as the Loan Guarantee Program (\"LG Program\"). Limnia submitted its program application to DOE, but it did not transmit the application fee that DOE's regulations prescribed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20609.6\">\n    10 C.F.R. \u00a7 609.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) (2009). DOE summarily rejected Limnia's loan application on this basis, after which Limnia filed the instant lawsuit against DOE and its Secretary (collectively, \"Defendants\") under the Administrative Procedure Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , claiming that DOE had arbitrarily refused to honor a supposedly pre-existing oral agreement to waive the application fee (a waiver that DOE says did not occur), and that the agency had also failed to explain why it would not honor the oral fee waiver. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl., ECF No. 26, \u00b6\u00b6 167-71; Pl. Limnia, Inc.'s Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. for Partial Summ. J. &amp; Cross-Mot. for Partial Summ. J. or for Disc. (\"Pl.'s Mot.\"), ECF No. 74, at 6.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Limnia combined its claims against DOE with those of another disgruntled loan applicant; the gravamen of their complaint, which also included alleged violations of Limnia's constitutional rights to due process and equal protection, was that various determinations that DOE had made regarding the processing and merits of their loan applications were infected with political \"cronyism\" and demonstrated an abuse of power. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 83-113.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As of July 21, 2016, this Court had (1) dismissed the other plaintiff and many of the complaint's claims; (2) voluntarily remanded Limnia's remaining APA claims back to the agency (over Limnia's objection) for reconsideration of Limnia's loan application; and (3) closed Limina's case due to its failure to resubmit its application materials to the agency pursuant to the voluntary remand. Limnia then appealed, and the D.C. Circuit determined that this Court's voluntary remand order was improper, and as relevant here, ordered this Court to \"resolve Limnia's APA challenge to the apparently denied 2009 loan applications.\"\n   <em>\n    Limnia, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of Energy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276548\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/379/#p388\">\n    857 F.3d 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 388 (D.C. Cir. 2017). The panel suggested that this Court could avoid addressing the merits of Limnia's APA challenge by voluntarily remanding the matter to the agency, but only if the Court \"first resolve[s] whether Limnia has to pay the application fee associated with the 2009 Loan Guarantee Program application, or whether that fee was waived by the Department.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276548\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/379/#p388\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Of course, answering\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   question under the circumstances presented actually eliminates any prospect of a voluntary remand to the agency, because Limnia's APA challenge to DOE's treatment of its 2009 LG Program loan application\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   its assertion that DOE had arbitrarily refused to process Limnia's application in the absence of the application fee. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. at 12:10-13 (\"[O]ur position here, our perspective is we're here today only regarding denial of the fee waiver.\").) Consequently, on remand, this Court ordered the parties to brief the merits of Limnia's LG Program APA claim, and the parties proceeded to address the issue of whether and to what extent DOE acted arbitrarily and capriciously in requiring that Limnia pay the application fee associated with the 2009 LG Program application. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Order of November 22, 2017.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before this Court at present are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment on this issue. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Supp. of Defs.' Mot. for Partial Summ. J. (\"Defs.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mem.\"), ECF No. 72-1; Pl.'s Mot.) In its motion, DOE argues that the agency \"reasonably decided to deny [Limnia's] LG Program application\" because \"Limnia did not pay the application fee\" (Defs.' Mem. at 16), and it further maintains that the agency provided Limnia with an adequate explanation as to that decision, given that \"[n]othing in the administrative record\" suggests that DOE \"agreed to specifically waive the application fee\" with respect to Limnia's LG application (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19). For its part, Limnia acknowledges that it \"did not submit an application fee\" (Pl.'s Mot. at 5), but it contends that DOE acted arbitrarily and capriciously in rejecting its application on this basis, because the agency had \"failed\" to \"provide[ ] a reasoned explanation for its refusal to waive the application fee\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6), given that \"[e]vidence in the record indicates that DOE consented to this waiver\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5). Limnia has also moved, in the alternative, \"for limited discovery to supplement the record\" if this Court finds \"the administrative record insufficient to allow for judicial review.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the reasons explained below, Defendants' motion for partial summary judgment must be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , and Plaintiff's cross-motion for partial summary judgment must be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In short, the instant record indisputably establishes that the steps that are necessary to waive Limnia's application fee for the LG Program under DOE regulations were never taken, and DOE had no obligation to honor an alleged oral waiver of the application fee, nor did it need to provide any explanation for its rejection of Limnia's application other than informing Limnia (accurately) that the mandatory application fee had not been remitted. Thus, DOE's rejection of Limnia's application was not arbitrary or capricious. Moreover, because discovery is generally disfavored in APA cases and is also entirely unnecessary for the resolution of the instant cross-motions, Limnia's alternative motion for discovery is denied.

Although federal statutes lay out the broad outlines and policy goals of the LG Program, Congress left it up to DOE to issue \"final regulations\" that provide details regarding how the agency would administer the LG Program.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016513\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 16515(b). DOE promulgated its first version of those final regulations on October 23, 2007, and that version governed the administration of the\n   LG Program as well as any applications that were submitted for processing through December 3, 2009.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20609\">\n    10 C.F.R. \u00a7 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As relevant here, the then-existing LG Program regulations laid out a framework for how DOE would accept, process, and approve applications for loan guarantees under the LG Program. This application process would begin with DOE's decision to issue a \"solicitation\" that informed the public that it was \"invit[ing] the submission of Pre-Applications or Applications for loan guarantees for Eligible Projects.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20609\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 609.3.

Limnia's LG Program Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2008, DOE issued a solicitation for applications to the LG Program related to \"projects that employ innovative energy efficiency, renewable energy, and advanced transmission and distribution technologies[.]\" (Joint Appendix (\"J.A.\"), ECF No. 78-1, at 1.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Having \"understood that Mr. Chu was waving the application fees\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), Limnia submitted an LG Program application to DOE on February 17, 2009, without including the fee (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6). In its application cover letter, Limnia specifically stated that it \"understand[s] that Secretary Chu has changed the submission fee to be payable upon award[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20609\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20609\">\n    at 8, 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)

However, according to Limnia, other DOE employees had orally represented that there was \"some flexibility on the time to wire the money.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) Ultimately, the fee-related communications between Limnia and DOE broke down, and Limnia never submitted any part of the LG Program application fee to DOE or the Treasury Department.

Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   DOE's rejection of Limnia's LG Program application gave rise, in part, to the instant litigation. In 2013, Limnia, alongside another plaintiff named XP Vehicles, filed a complaint in this Court against DOE and its Secretary. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1.) Plaintiffs then amended the complaint to allege that both Limnia and XP Vehicles' applications for financial support under the LG Program and another program DOE administers (the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (\"ATVM\") Program) were \"improperly denied[.]\" (Am.

Both plaintiffs claimed \"due process[,]\" \"equal protection[,]\" and APA violations (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 121-71), maintaining that DOE's denials were \"impermissibly infected with political pressure\" (\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20609\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20609\">\n    \u00b6 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Order of August 7, 2017.) As to the dispute surrounding DOE's rejection of Limnia's application to the LG Program-the merits of which relate simply and solely to whether or not DOE acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it insisted that Limnia pay the application fee under the circumstances alleged-the parties agreed to move ahead with summary judgment briefing and proceeded to file cross-motions for summary judgment.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. at 6-8 (referencing DOE's email to Limnia dated April 9, 2009).) For its part, Limnia vigorously contends that, by virtue of Secretary Chu's oral comments, DOE did, in fact, grant Limnia a fee waiver, and because DOE did not explain why it rescinded that fee waiver in the April 9, 2009 email, DOE did not provide a sufficiently thorough and reasoned explanation for rejecting Limnia's application for support under the LG Program. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. at 5.) In the alternative, Limnia has requested that this Court provide it with the chance to supplement the administrative record by engaging in discovery to allow Limnia \"to determine the Department of Energy's reason for refusing to honor the fee waiver.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The parties' cross-motions are now fully briefed (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Reply in Supp. of Defs.'

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   It is indisputable that the regulations governing DOE's LG Program required applicants to remit an application fee before the agency would review the merits of a given application,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20609.6\">\n    10 C.F.R. \u00a7 609.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2), (c), and it is equally indisputable that Limnia did not pay that mandatory fee when it submitted its 2009 LG Program application to DOE (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   J.A. at 12, 20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply at 2 (\"Limnia does not dispute that it did not pay the fee.\") ). Furthermore, there can be no doubt that DOE provided an explanation for its rejection of Limnia's application; the record plainly demonstrates that, on April 9, 2009, DOE informed Limnia in writing that its \"application will not be reviewed\" and that the agency was taking this non-action \"due to non-remittance of the required application fee[.]\" (J.A. at 8.) Thus, what remains to be resolved with respect to Limnia's contention that DOE acted arbitrarily and capriciously in rejecting Limnia's application is whether DOE's decision, and its explanation, were reasonable responses under the circumstances presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For the reasons explained below, it is clear to this Court that DOE acted entirely rationally when it refused to process Limnia's LG Program application, because DOE had not, in fact, granted Limnia any fee waiver, and having not approved any deviation from the mandatory fee requirement, DOE had no obligation to provide reasons why the agency had refused to honor the nonexistent waiver. Put another way, Limnia has conjured up a purported obligation of the agency ( to waive the fee) that has not been established, and its motion strangely contends that DOE's refusal to comply with this unestablished duty, as well as DOE's failure to explain this refusal, is irrational agency action in violation of the APA. Limnia's contentions are meritless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    A. DOE Never Waived The Application Fee For Limnia's LG Program Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Both parties recognize that the issue of whether DOE acted arbitrarily and capriciously by rejecting Limnia's LG Program application turns entirely upon whether DOE ever granted Limnia a fee waiver for its application. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' Reply at 11 (\"Plaintiff must first point to evidence suggesting that the agency in fact agreed to waive the fee in the first place[.]\"); Pl.'s Mot. at 8 (beginning with the contention that \"[t]he administrative record provides evidence ... that the application fee had been waived\").) That is, if DOE granted Limnia a valid fee waiver, then the agency's sudden change of course without providing \"a well-reasoned explanation for its decision\" to do so would constitute arbitrary and capricious action for APA purposes.\n   <em>\n    Policy &amp; Research\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525516\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/62/#p83\">\n    313 F.Supp.3d at 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the other hand, if DOE did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   grant Limnia a fee waiver, then its rejection of Limnia's application was plainly well-founded and there was nothing to explain-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , there would have\n   been no change in agency policy with respect to Limnia's application, and DOE's April 9th statement sufficently articulates that Limnia's failure to submit the mandatory application fee was the factor that precipitated DOE's rejection of Limnia's LG Program application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Safari Club Int'l v.

Cir. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Even the most cursory review of the applicable regulations and undisputed facts in the administrative record clearly reveals that DOE never authorized the fee waiver that Limnia says it was entitled to with respect to the LG Program application at issue in this case. As explained above, the regulations that were in force at the time that Limnia submitted its application to participate in the LG Program mandated that applicants pay any \"filing fee\" that an open solicitation required when their application to the LG Program was submitted,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20609.6\">\n    10 C.F.R. \u00a7 609.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2), and permitted deviation from such program requirements only under specified circumstances. Before any deviation from DOE's regulations could take place, an applicant had to submit a written recommendation that DOE deviate from its protocols, including a supporting statement describing the nature of the deviation and the justifications for that deviation.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20609.6\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 609.18. Upon receiving such a request, DOE would often consult with other agencies,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20609.6\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , and in order to authorize the requested deviation, DOE was required to make \"a finding\" that such deviation was \"essential to program objectives\" and would be \"in the best interest of the Government[,]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20609.6\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, a deviation from the LG Program application requirements (such as the prescribed fee) was by no means an entitlement, nor could it be whimsically granted by an oral representation; rather, under the express terms of the applicable regulations, a deviation required a written request and justification by the applicant and approval from DOE based on specified findings.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20609.6\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   None of the mandated steps for deviating from the fee requirement occurred in the instant case.

There is no dispute that, despite the clear requirements for deviation that are spelled out in the regulations, neither Limnia nor DOE took\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of the prerequisite steps to authorize a deviation (and thus a fee waiver) for Limnia's application to the LG Program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Limnia adamantly asserts that DOE should be deemed to have waived the fee with respect to its LG Program application nevertheless. In this regard, Limnia points to various record documents that it says establish that the agency had deviated from the application fee requirement, but none of those documents demonstrates that the steps that are indisputably necessary to secure a waiver under DOE regulations were taken. For example, Limnia maintains that it participated in a conference call during which Secretary Chu \"stated his intention to waive the application fees\" (J.A. at 12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. at 9), which Limnia says is confirmed by the\n   typed statement in Limnia's own application cover letter to the effect that \"Secretary Chu has changed the submission fee to be payable upon award\" ( Pl.'s Mot. at 9 (quoting J.A. at 6) ). At most, this evidence represents Limnia's own (potentially mistaken) understanding of the status of the fee requirement; it neither amounts to an applicant \"recommendation\" that the fee be waived,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20609.18\">\n    10 C.F.R. \u00a7 609.18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , nor provides the requisite \"statement\" in support of that deviation,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20609.18\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Limnia's cover-letter representation also falls far short of being a \"finding\" by DOE,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20609.18\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , and in the absence of any indication within the deviation rule that the Secretary has discretion to dispense with the deviation requirements, an\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   regarding a waiver (even one that was purportedly announced by the Secretary himself) is manifestly insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The purported fee waiver also cannot rest upon the e-mail from one of Limnia's associates to staff members at DOE, stating that DOE's denial of Limnia's application for non-remittance of the required fee was \"not in keeping with the discussion that was held ... regarding the DOE's review of Limnia's submission prior to its requirement for fee submission.\" (Pl.'s Mot. at 9 (quoting J.A. at 17).) Again, while it appears quite clear from this email that Limnia\n   <em>\n    believed\n   </em>\n   that it had been excused from the application-fee requirement, such a belief does not make it so. And a statement from a Limnia associate articulating Limnia's understanding of a discussion that Limnia allegedly had with the agency about its mistaken belief that there was an authorized deviation from the fee requirement does not satisfy the regulations' clear deviation \"prescription.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Limnia's other alleged smoking gun regarding DOE's grant of a fee waiver-the handwritten notation on Limnia's application cover letter stating \"Appli. [sic] Fee waived by Secretary DOE\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting J.A. at 6) )-is similarly unavailing. To begin with, it is entirely unclear who made this notation. Limnia speculates that \"someone at DOE read the typewritten statement that [the] Secretary [ ] had waived the application fee, circled Limnia's telephone number, called Limnia, and during that call[,] made the handwritten notation that Secretary Chu had waived the fee.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The notation itself does not plainly establish that this chain of events actually occurred in the manner than Limnia articulates, but even so, this handwritten note merely reflects that someone somehow said the fee had been waived, and is not reasonably construed to be a \"finding\" regarding the fee waiver, much less the required finding that such a waiver would prove \"essential\" to the LG Program's objectives or that it is in the best interests of the federal government under the deviation rules. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. at 6, 12, 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The best that Limnia can do to support its fee-waiver position is to note that \"[t]he cover letter of its application states that Limnia 'understands that Secretary Chu has changed the submission fee to be payable upon award[,]' \" (Pl.'s Mot. at 12 (quoting J.A. 6) ), and to insist that Limnia thereby successfully submitted to DOE \"a determination by the Secretary in his discretion to undertake a deviation\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20609.18\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20609.16\">\n    10 C.F.R. \u00a7 609.16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply at 4-5). There are multiple flaws with this argument, not the least of which is that Limnia's own statement is, quite plainly, not a determination by the Secretary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20609.16\">\n    10 C.F.R. \u00a7 609.16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) (2018). But it suffices here to point out that, in any event, Limnia's argument in this regard relies on a\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   version of DOE's regulations-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , one that was not in effect at the time of the determination at issue in this case. It may well be true that\n   <em>\n    today\n   </em>\n   DOE can deviate from its regulations if (1) an Applicant submits to DOE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \"a determination by the Secretary in his discretion to undertake a deviation[,]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20609.16\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 609.16(a)(1)(iii) (2018), and (2) there exists \"[a] finding by the Secretary that such deviation supports program objectives and the special circumstances stated in the request make such deviation clearly in the best interest of the Government[,]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20609.16\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 609.16(a)(2) (2018), but such was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the case under the regulations that were in force at the time DOE denied Limnia's LG Program application (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   n.3,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ). Instead, and as explained above, the then-existing deviation regulation required a written recommendation regarding any proposed deviation; a statement in support of that deviation; and a finding by the Secretary that such a deviation served both the objectives of the LG Program and the interests of the federal government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20609.18\">\n    10 C.F.R. \u00a7 609.18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). Limnia's statement in its cover letter that it \"understands that Secretary Chu has changed the submission fee to be payable upon award\" does not satisfy these requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    B. DOE's Rejection Of Limnia's LG Program Application Was Reasonable And Sufficiently Explained\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Because DOE did not waive the fee for Limnia's application to the LG Program, there can be no question that DOE's treatment of Limnia's application was entirely appropriate under the APA. Consistent with the regulations' statement that \"DOE will not consider any Application complete unless the Applicant has paid the [application fee],\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20609.18\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 609.6(c), DOE refused to process Limnia's application because Limnia failed to remit the fee (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   J.A. at 8).

And, indeed, it is only conceivably arbitrary action by DOE if one\n   <em>\n    assumes\n   </em>\n   , as Limnia does, that DOE granted Limnia a fee waiver despite the fact that the agency's deviation regulations were not followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Thus, by stating simply that Limnia's application was rejected \"due to non-remittance of the required application fee\" (J.A. at 8), DOE unquestionably \"articulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for its action[,]\"\n   <em>\n    State Farm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n    463 U.S. at 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vernal Enters., Inc. v.

Limnia's Discovery Request Is Baseless\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Apparently sensing the meritless nature of its current fee-waiver contentions, Limnia has requested that, as an alternative to granting it summary judgment, this Court should authorize \"limited discovery to determine the Department of Energy's reason for refusing to honor the fee waiver[.]\" (Pl.'s Mot. at 15.) Unfortunately\n   for Limnia, this request fares no better than its underlying claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   It is well established that, to seek discovery in the context of an APA case, the plaintiff must make \"a significant showing ... that [the plaintiff] will find material in the agency's possession indicative of bad faith or an incomplete record[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Air Transp. Ass'n of Am., Inc. v. Nat'l Mediation Bd.\n   </em>\n   , 663 F.3d at 487-88 (D.C. Cir. 2011). But, here, Limnia has offered nothing more than rank speculation about DOE's motives based on Limnia's own (unproven) assumption that the agency actually conferred a fee waiver through Secretary's Chu's comments and then inexplicably rescinded it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. at 16 (\"Defendants are the only party with access to the information regarding DOE's true reason for refusing to honor its fee waiver; the administrative record contains no contemporaneous evidence on this point.\").) Limnia's mistaken belief that the agency had granted it a fee waiver, however earnest, is an insufficient basis upon which to conclude that Limnia should be allowed to explore\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   the administrative record makes no mention of the agency's fee-waiver obligation, and this is especially so when the most obvious reason for the lack of record evidence regarding any fee waiver\n   <em>\n    is that no such waiver exists.\n   </em>\n   What is more, if there is any bad faith to be found, this Court concludes that it is most likely manifest in Limnia's own decision to pursue its frivolous contention that DOE somehow arbitrarily abandoned a commitment to process Limnia's LG application sans the mandatory fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Thus, far from demonstrating that discovery is warranted, Limnia's request for further factfinding merely exposes the extremely thin reed upon which Limnia's claim of arbitrary and capricious action rests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   DOE's regulations plainly required Limnia to submit an application fee alongside its application for an LG Program loan, and neither Limnia nor DOE undertook any of the steps that the regulations require in order to effect a waiver of that application-fee mandate. This Court finds that DOE never granted Limnia a fee waiver, and thus, the agency did not act arbitrarily and capriciously when it refused to process Limnia's application for failing to remit the required fee or when it explained that it was rejecting Limnia's application \"due to non-remittance of the required application fee[.]\" (J.A. at 8.) As a result, and as set forth in the accompanying Order, DOE's motion for partial summary judgment must be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , and Limnia's cross-motion for partial summary judgment must be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . And with the exception of DOE's pending review of Limnia's ATVM application on voluntarily remand, this matter is now over; no discovery is warranted or authorized.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Page-number citations to the documents that the parties have filed refer to the page numbers that the Court's electronic filing system automatically assigns.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    The parties have styled their summary judgment motions as \"partial\" cross-motions because Limnia's complaint contains claims regarding another loan application that DOE denied on its merits, and that portion of this case has been successfully voluntarily remanded to the agency. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Minute Order of August 7, 2017.).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    This first iteration of the LG Program's regulations applies to the instant dispute. Thus, subsequent citations to Part 609 of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations within this Memorandum Opinion reference the version of these regulations that was in force prior to December 4, 2009, unless otherwise noted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    The instant record does not reveal exactly what fee Limnia was expected to submit alongside its application to the LG Program. This uncertainty is primarily due to the fact that the amount of the LG Program application fee depended on the size of the loan guarantee that an applicant sought from DOE (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    J.A. at 5), and the record does not specify the magnitude of the loan guarantee that Limnia sought. In general, it appears that the fee that was to accompany applications in response to the solicitation at issue here was between $18,750 and $31,250.
