HERRERA, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter is before the Court on Defendants Cervantes Agribusiness' and Cervantes Enterprises, Inc.'s (\"Cervantes Defendants\") joint Motion for Summary Judgment [ECF No. 233]. Plaintiffs\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   are United States citizens or lawful permanent residents who were given hiring priority\n   through the federal H-2A program to provide manual labor on fields and land owned by the Cervantes Defendants during the 2011-2012 harvest seasons. The farm labor contractor who recruited and hired Plaintiffs - Defendants WKI Outsourcing Solutions, LLC (\"WKI\") and its owner Jaime Campos - never actually furnished Plaintiffs to work for the Cervantes Defendants. Citing a drought, Campos cancelled Plaintiffs' work contracts at the last minute. Plaintiffs allege there was no such unusual drought; the real reason Campos cancelled their contracts was because he realized there were too many qualified U.S. workers, so he would not be able to access foreign laborers from Mexico, which was Defendants' alleged goal all along.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Based on the theory that the Cervantes Defendants and WKI \"jointly employed\" Plaintiffs, they sued the Cervantes Defendants under the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201801\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 1854 (\"AWPA\") contending, among other things, that they were equally liable for WKI's cancellation of their work contracts. After carefully considering the motion, briefs, and relevant law, the Court concludes that the Cervantes Defendants' motion should be granted because they did not jointly employ Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Most of the facts necessary to resolve the pending motion for summary judgment are set forth in the Court's Memorandum Opinion and Order previously granting summary judgment to the Cervantes Defendants, which are either undisputed or construed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs as the non-movants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. Op. and Order 1-11, ECF No. 232 (\"Order\"). The Court need not repeat those facts herein but adopts them by reference for the purposes of resolving the motion for summary judgment and presents the following additional material facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The H-2A Program\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Under the H-2A program, WKI had to give hiring priority to domestic, or \"U.S. workers\" like Plaintiffs before petitioning for foreign workers. An employer like WKI could hire foreign guest laborers under the H-2A visa program only if it could certify that \"there are not sufficient workers who are able, willing, and qualified\" to perform the work and employing foreign workers \"will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers in the United States similarly employed\" 8 U.S.C \u00a7 1188(a)(1). An agricultural employer or its agent works with the State Workforce Agency to recruit U.S. workers on an intrastate and interstate basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20655.154\">\n    20 C.F.R \u00a7 655.154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

When it became apparent that Campos would not be able to provide Mexican workers, he cancelled Plaintiffs' work contracts under the pretense of a drought.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In addition to the Cervantes Defendants, WKI and Campos entered into farm labor contracts under the H-2A program with five other farms based in southern New Mexico - Defendants RJF Farms, Inc. and its owner Ronnie J. Franzoy, Tierra de Dios Farms, LLC, Lack Farms, Inc., Rio Valley Chili, Inc., and Skyline Produce, LLC. Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed claims against RJF Farms, Inc., Ronnie J. Franzoy, Rio Valley Chili, Inc., Lack Farms, Inc., and Skyline Produce, LLC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF. Nos. 71, 146, 158.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As for the Cervantes Defendants, Plaintiffs alleged four causes of action against them for various statutory violation of the AWPA, fraud, breach of contract, and civil conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' First Am. Comp., ECF. No. 103. In May and July 2016, the Cervantes Defendants moved for, and the Court granted, summary judgment to the Cervantes Defendants, concluding that no reasonable jury could find them liable to Plaintiffs on those theories of liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As for Defendants WKI and Tierra, they never obtained legal counsel as required for entity parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.N.M.LR-Civ. 83.7. WKI attempted to answer\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   in conjunction with Defendant Jaime Campos, WKI's owner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF. No. 55. The Court interpreted that answer as that of Campos', not WKI's.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 69. On September 3, 2015 the Honorable William P. Lynch, United States Magistrate Judge, entered a Notice of Proposed Entry of Default Judgment, warning Tierra and WKI that unless they \"retain counsel and submit answers filed by an attorney by September 25, 2015, [he would] recommend to the District Judge that default\n   judgment be entered against them and in favor of the Plaintiffs.\" ECF No. 128. Tierra and WKI never heeded that warning, so on October 7, 2015 the Clerk of Court filed the Clerk's Entry of Default Judgment against Tierra and WKI for having failed to plead or otherwise defend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 135, 136. Plaintiffs never moved for a damages hearing, and no subsequent litigation concerning the Clerk's Entry of Default has occurred since that October 7, 2015 entry. To date, WKI and Tierra have not obtained legal counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant Jaime Campos,\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , also appears to have stopped participating in the litigation. His last docket filing was on October 10, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 137. He failed to appear at a status conference before Judge Lynch on March 2, 2016, although he did participate in a mid-March 2016 deposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 161, 168.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

They therefore rely heavily on the Cervantes Defendants' past employment of a different farm labor contractor, Jesus Maldonado, as a proxy, contending that the Cervantes Defendants exercised substantial control of Maldonado and his work crew, and perforce would have done the same to Campos and Plaintiffs.

But is the Cervantes Defendants' relationship with Maldonado, a non-party to this case, relevant evidence of the relationship between the Cervantes Defendants and WKI? Plaintiffs say so, relying on a single district court opinion,\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez et al. v.

Here, WKI and the Cervantes Defendants had no prior history from which Plaintiffs can extrapolate. Using Maldonado as a stand-in is not relevant evidence of the relationship between WKI and the Cervantes Defendants. The conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   is not precedential or persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As between WKI and the Cervantes Defendants, the record construed in Plaintiffs' favor does show the following indicia of control and supervision that the Cervantes Defendants would have exercised: 1) they would have trained Plaintiffs on how to harvest crops; 2) they hired a specific number of laborers to harvest specific fields for a specific duration; and 3) they could have asked WKI to \"replace\" a laborer.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Charles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11773544,11773431\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/169/1322/\">\n    169 F.3d at 1330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (control found where agricultural determined when, where, and for how long farm labor contractor's crew would pick snap beans).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The main problem, though, is that Plaintiffs never actually worked on the Cervantes Defendants' lands. The Court therefore cannot meaningfully evaluate the degree of supervision and control they would have exercised over Plaintiffs.

Plaintiffs have presented no evidence that the Cervantes Defendants would have assigned work to specific workers, inspected the work performed, or would have closely monitored Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Torres-Lopez v.

Plaintiffs contend that the Cervantes Defendants effectively dictated Plaintiffs' wages by deciding to pay them on an hourly, rather than\n   piece rate, basis. However, as Plaintiffs repeatedly acknowledge, the H-2A regulations require the employing entity to pay workers an hourly wage of either the AEWR or the federal minimum hourly wage.

Cervantes Enterprises also contends that it is not involved in chile harvesting at all. But reading the record in Plaintiffs' favor, as the Court must, the evidence shows that harvesting chile is an integral part of the Cervantes Defendants' operations. Dino Cervantes, Cervantes Agribusiness' general manager, explained that he is \"involved in the chile industry,\" that his various family members \"are involved at different capacities and different aspects of the chile industry,\" that agriculture is a family vocation \"and chile is part of that.\" Dep. of Dino Cervantes, cited by Plaintiffs as \"SJR 27:13-23\", ECF No. 234-2 at 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   This evidence suggests that Cervantes Enterprises is in the \"chile industry\" even if it not the entity overseeing harvesting operations.

And as mentioned earlier, Plaintiffs presented no record evidence that WKI would have furnished Plaintiffs to work primarily or exclusively with the Cervantes Defendants as opposed to several other farmers WKI also had labor contracts with. This factor may weigh in Plaintiffs' favor, but as in\n   <em>\n    Martinez-Mendoza\n   </em>\n   , only slightly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    vii.\n    <em>\n     Responsibilities ordinary performed by employers\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \"The final factor examines whether [the putative employer] undertook responsibilities for workers often undertaken by employers, such as (1) preparing and/or making payroll records, (2) preparing and/or issuing pay checks, (3) paying FICA taxes, (4) providing workers' compensation insurance, (5) providing field sanitation facilities, housing or transportation, or (6) providing tools and equipment or materials required for the job.\"\n   <em>\n    Martinez-Mendoza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9102856\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/340/1200/#p1208\">\n    340 F.3d at 1214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The provision of such services \"is both an objective manifestation of employer status and strong evidence of the workers' economic dependence upon [it].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9102856\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/340/1200/#p1208\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus in\n   <em>\n    Martinez-Mendoza\n   </em>\n   , the court found that this factor did not suggest joint employment when the putative employer \"provided none of these services[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9102856\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/340/1200/#p1208\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"The [farm labor contractor] alone prepared the laborer's payroll records and checks, paid their FICA taxes, provided their housing, transportation, tools, etc.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9102856\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/340/1200/#p1208\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiffs submitted no evidence that the Cervantes Defendants undertook responsibilities commonly performed by employers. There is no evidence that the Cervantes Defendants would have managed Plaintiffs' payroll, provide workers' compensation insurance, provide field sanitation facilities, or provide house or transportation. The clearance order identified WKI alone as the employer. According to the clearance order, WKI was to provide workers three meals a day at specified cost, housing, transportation, and minimum work hours. WKI was responsible for deducting FICA and state taxes. The clearance order offered unemployment insurance, workers' compensation insurance, and tools at no charge. There is simply no indication in the record that the Cervantes Defendants were responsible for any of these services. This factor does not weigh in Plaintiffs' favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Weighing of Factors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Of the seven regulatory factors, only three weigh in Plaintiffs' favor (and one of them only slightly.) Again, in analyzing whether the Cervantes Defendants jointly employed Plaintiffs, \"the ultimate question to be determined is the economic reality - whether the worker is so economically dependent upon the agricultural employer/association as to be considered its employee.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20500.20\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 500.20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(5)(iii). The answer is no, because there is little to no evidence that the Cervantes Defendants would have directly impacted Plaintiffs' employment, performance, controlled their qualifications, payment, and the like. Plaintiffs were unaware of the Cervantes Defendants' existence. WKI, not the Cervantes Defendants, signed itself up to do employer-like things such as pay Plaintiffs and deduct their taxes. WKI was to furnish them meals, housing, and transportation. When weighed together the factors strongly show that the Cervantes Defendants did not jointly employ Plaintiffs with WKI. They are not liable for WKI's breach of any working arrangement under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201822\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1822\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that\n   </strong>\n   Cervantes Agribusiness' and Cervantes Enterprises Inc.'s Joint Motion for Summary Judgment\n   <strong>\n    [ECF No. 233]\n   </strong>\n   is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .
