By pleading guilty pursuant to the plea agreement, the petitioner avoided pleading guilty to Count III of the indictment, which charged him with aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1028A(a)(1), 1029(b)(2), and 2, a charge that was dismissed at sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On February 26, 2018, this Court sentenced the petitioner primarily to a term of six months' imprisonment and a three-year term of supervised release with a condition of six months' home confinement on Count I and II, to run concurrently. As a result of his conviction and sentence, the petitioner, a noncitizen, is subject to mandatory removal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(iii) for committing aggravated felonies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The petitioner timely filed a habeas petition under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , seeking to set aside his conviction and sentence on grounds of alleged ineffective assistance of counsel.

Pet. Ex. E at \u00b6\u00b6 50, 52. In December 2016, the petitioner was charged in the three-count indictment described above. Pet. Ex. B. The charges related to a scheme carried out from September 2011 to March 2015 whereby the petitioner and a co-defendant filed false tax returns and obtained refund checks to which they were not entitled. Pet. at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The petitioner was represented by experienced defense counsel throughout his criminal proceeding. Ultimately, the petitioner agreed to plead guilty to Counts I and II and stipulated that the Government's loss was at least $95,000. Pet. at 5. The petitioner was sentenced principally to a term of six months' imprisonment to be followed by three years of supervised release with a condition of six months' home confinement on each count, with the sentences on each count to run concurrently. The petitioner was also ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $114,669.45 to\n   the Internal Revenue Service. Pet. Ex.

This Court held an evidentiary hearing on September 20, 2018, at which trial counsel, an immigration lawyer who was consulted by trial counsel, and the petitioner all testified. Having reviewed the evidence and assessed the credibility of the witnesses, the Court makes the following findings of fact and reaches the following conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Trial counsel, assisted by an associate and an intern in his office, researched the immigration consequences facing the petitioner. Hearing Tr. at 33-34.

The Government also believed that Counts I and II were aggravated felonies.

Hearing Tr. at 66-67. But the petitioner was uninterested in going to trial after trial counsel told the petitioner that the Government had a strong case against him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    at 67, 102-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to trial counsel, the petitioner was concerned primarily with resolving his case in a way involving as little prison time as possible; the petitioner expressed repeatedly that he wished to avoid incarceration.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    at 51-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Trial counsel therefore negotiated a plea of guilty to Counts I and II and dismissal of Count III, which carried a two-year mandatory minimum sentence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    at 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The plea agreement signed by the petitioner stated that the petitioner recognized that his plea and conviction made it \"very likely that his deportation from the United States is presumptively mandatory and that, at a minimum, he is at risk of being deported or suffering other adverse immigration consequences.\" Pet.

The plea agreement also acknowledged that the petitioner discussed the possible immigration consequences of his plea with counsel and that the petitioner wished to plead guilty nonetheless.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, at the petitioner's plea hearing, the following colloquy occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   THE COURT: Do you ... understand that if I accept your guilty plea and adjudge you guilty, that adjudication can be used to remove you from the United States, what used to be called deportation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: I understand that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   THE COURT: You've spoken to your lawyer about the immigration consequences of your plea; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Yes, your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Pet. Ex. D at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Trial Counsel wrote a sentencing memorandum to the Court requesting that the petitioner receive only probation. Pet. Ex. F at 2. The memorandum did not mention the petitioner's removability because trial\n   counsel believed erroneously that the Court could not consider removability when determining an appropriate sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Counsel Decl. at \u00b6 8. At the petitioner's sentencing hearing, trial counsel twice asked for probation before the Court indicated its proposed sentence. Pet. Ex. G at 3, 13. Trial counsel added the second time that \"[the petitioner] understands that this is an aggravated felony that could result in his deportation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

He testified that he believed that he \"might get into [a] little trouble with immigration\" but that he would not face presumptively mandatory deportation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hearing Tr. at 88, 98-99.

This testimony was not credible. The petitioner also claimed that, although he is afraid of prison, he would have pleaded guilty to Count III, which carried a two-year mandatory minimum sentence, if he knew that it would have reduced his risk of deportation - even if it were possible that he would still be deported after that two-year term of imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    at 93, 103-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Due to this alleged deficiency, the petitioner claims that he was unaware that his plea would subject him to mandatory removal. Had the petitioner known the immigration consequences, he argues, he would not have pleaded guilty to Counts I and II. Thus, the petitioner contends that trial counsel's ineffectiveness caused him to enter into his plea agreement unknowingly and involuntarily.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Contrary to the petitioner's assertions, the record shows that the petitioner was aware of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea; the petitioner's testimony to the contrary is not credible. Trial counsel credibly testified that he researched extensively the immigration consequences of the petitioner's case, determined that the petitioner was alleged to have committed aggravated felonies, and then explained to the petitioner that he likely faced deportation. Moreover, the plea agreement stated that, by pleading guilty, the petitioner would likely face presumptively mandatory deportation. Pet. Ex. C at 5. The petitioner read the agreement, Hearing Tr. at 96, and trial counsel credibly testified that he told the petitioner that signing the plea agreement would subject the petitioner to removal,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 66-67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Moreover, at the plea hearing, the Court confirmed that the petitioner understood that his conviction \"[could] be used to remove\" him from the United States, and that the petitioner spoke with his trial counsel about the immigration consequences of his plea. Pet. Ex. D at 19. And at the petitioner's sentencing, trial counsel stated that \"[the petitioner] understands that this is an aggravated felony that could result in his deportation.\" Pet. Ex. G at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In short, the evidence does not reasonably support the petitioner's claim that he was unaware of the immigration consequences of his plea. Trial counsel was effective in relaying the immigration consequences, and the petitioner's alleged lack of knowledge is not credible. The petitioner has failed to demonstrate that he was afforded ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with his guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Moreover, the petitioner has failed to show prejudice from any advice he received from his trial counsel because he has failed to show that there is any additional advice he should have been given that would have caused him to reject the plea offer by the Government and take his chances at a trial on all three counts of the indictment, including the charge of aggravated identity theft that would have subjected him to a two-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment. Trial counsel informed the petitioner that the Government had a strong case against him, and the petitioner said that he did not wish to go to trial. A trial could have led to the petitioner's being convicted on all Counts and sentenced to at least two years of imprisonment. Thus, forgoing a plea in favor of trial would have been contrary to the petitioner's primary goal of avoiding prison time. Because the petitioner would not have, but for the alleged ineffective assistance, insisted on going to trial, he did not suffer prejudice under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Couto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301539\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/311/179/#p187\">\n    311 F.3d at 187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The petitioner next contends that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by securing a plea that subjected him to mandatory removal. The petitioner claims that if he had pleaded guilty to Count III - which involved conduct occurring in March 2015, Pet. Ex. C at 3-4 - and paid restitution, he would not be mandatorily removable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(iii) for having committed an aggravated felony, nor removable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(i) for having committed a crime of moral turpitude within five years of entering the United States. Thus, the petitioner contends that trial counsel should have secured a plea to Count III rather than to Counts I and II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   However, Count III carried a two-year mandatory minimum sentence. The petitioner stressed throughout his criminal proceeding that he wanted his case to be resolved in a way that minimized the chance or amount of incarceration. Given the petitioner's desire to avoid prison, trial counsel did not seek a plea agreement to Count III, which would have guaranteed the petitioner at least two years of imprisonment; trial counsel instead sought a disposition that would minimize the petitioner's time of imprisonment. Indeed, after the petitioner pleaded guilty to Counts I and II, trial counsel requested in a sentencing memorandum - and three times at sentencing - that the petitioner be sentenced only to probation. As a result of his guilty plea, the petitioner received a sentence principally of six months' imprisonment and three years of supervised release that included six months of home confinement, as opposed to the two-year minimum sentence attached to Count III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   It is clear that the petitioner - who was informed of the immigration consequences facing him - was concerned primarily with avoiding time in prison, not avoiding deportation. Trial counsel was therefore effective; he sought and obtained a disposition in line with the petitioner's desire to minimize incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Third, the petitioner contends that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to mention in his sentencing memorandum that the petitioner faced mandatory removal from the United States. Trial counsel had included that fact in a draft of the sentencing memorandum but removed it based upon his belief that the Court could not consider that consequence for sentencing purposes. Trial Counsel Decl. at \u00b6 8. However, the petitioner points out that in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Thavaraja\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit Court of Appeals held, \"In determining what sentence is 'sufficient, but not greater than necessary,' to serve the needs of justice,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), a district court may take into account the uncertainties presented by the prospect of removal proceedings and the impact deportation will have on the defendant and his family.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3826439\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/740/253/#p262\">\n    740 F.3d 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 262-63 (2d Cir. 2014). The petitioner therefore contends that trial counsel's sentencing memorandum failed to bring a legitimate concern to the Court's attention, thereby prejudicing the petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   However, this Court was certainly aware of the petitioner's noncitizen status and of the potential immigration consequences he faced. Indeed, they were stated in his plea agreement and acknowledged at his plea hearing. See Pet. Ex. C at 5, Ex. D at 19. Moreover, trial counsel stated at sentencing that the petitioner's offenses were aggravated felonies that could subject him to removal. Pet. Ex. G at 13. Therefore, the petitioner has failed to establish the second prong for a violation of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   . The petitioner has failed to show that he was prejudiced in any way by trial counsel's failure to include an argument based on immigration consequences in his sentencing memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Finally, the petitioner argues that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by not advising the Court of the immigration consequences attached to a sentence of six months' imprisonment and six months' home confinement as part of a term of supervised release and by failing to ask the Court to remove one day from the petitioner's term of home confinement. Had trial counsel done so, the petitioner contends, the petitioner's crimes would not have been classified as aggravated felonies and he would not be subject to mandatory removal. This argument depends on a reading of the immigration statutes that has not yet been resolved in this Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Committing an aggravated felony, defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43), subjects a noncitizen to mandatory deportation under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(iii).

However, the petitioner argues that under the categorical approach,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   his offenses are theft offenses.

Hence, the petitioner claims that had trial counsel asked the Court to remove one day from the petitioner's sentence, and had the Court done so, the petitioner's theft offenses would not constitute aggravated felonies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Government responds that, if the petitioner's offenses were theft offenses, a sentence of one less day would not affect the immigration consequences facing the petitioner.

Trial counsel was therefore deficient under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   's first prong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   With respect to\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   's prejudice prong, the petitioner acknowledges that, were he given a reduced sentence, there is still the possibility that he would be deportable for having committed crimes of moral turpitude within five years of his entry. But the petitioner argues that his deportation would not be\n   <em>\n    mandatory\n   </em>\n   for having been convicted of aggravated felonies. He would therefore be able to seek forms of discretionary relief from removal that are unavailable to noncitizens convicted of aggravated felonies, including asylum,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201158\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(B)(i) ; application or reapplication for a visa or for an adjustment of status, \u00a7 1182(h)(2) ; and cancellation of removal, \u00a7 1229b(a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The petitioner has established sufficient prejudice. If the Court were apprised of the effects that a one-day shorter sentence might have on the immigration consequences facing the petitioner, it would have granted a request for a one-day reduction in the petitioner's sentence. Any reduction in time incarcerated is significant for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Lafler v.

It is not certain that the petitioner will be granted any of these remedies; although, the prospect of faith-based persecution in the petitioner's home country indicates that he could potentially apply for such relief in good faith. Reducing the petitioner's sentence by one day enhances the probability of the petitioner's remaining in the United States with his family and significant other, rather than being removed to Bangladesh where he believes he will be persecuted. This is plainly consequential. \"Deportation is an integral part ... of the penalty that may be imposed on noncitizen defendants who plead guilty to specified crimes.\"\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    559 U.S. at 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But for trial counsel's ineffectiveness, the petitioner would have received a one-day shorter sentence and might not be subject to mandatory removal. The petitioner was therefore deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court has considered all of the arguments raised by the parties.
