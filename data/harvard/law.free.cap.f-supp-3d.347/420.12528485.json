(Defs.' Not. of Removal, Ex. A (\"Compl.\"), Dkt. No. 1.) Pending before the Court is Defendants' motion to compel arbitration. (Defs.' Mot. to Compel, Dkt No. 20.) The Court deems the matter suitable for disposition without hearing pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7-1(b). Having considered the papers filed by the parties and the relevant legal authority, the Court GRANTS Defendants' motion to compel arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff entered into an employment agreement with Defendants on December 2, 2013. (Domanico Decl., Ex. 1 (\"Emp't Agree't\") at 3, Dkt. No. 22-1.) The employment agreement signed by both parties contained an agreement to arbitrate all claims between the parties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The arbitration agreement provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   [A]ny dispute or controversy arising out of, relating to, or concerning any interpretation, construction, performance, or breach of this agreement, will be settled by arbitration to be held in King County, Washington, in accordance with the Employment Dispute Resolution Rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator may grant injunctions or other relief in a dispute or controversy. The decision of the arbitrator will be final, conclusive, and binding on the parties to the arbitration. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator's decision in any court having jurisdiction. The company and I will each pay one-half of the costs and expenses of the arbitration, and each of us will separately pay our counsel fees and expenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (Emp't Agree't at 3.) The arbitration agreement provides that both parties agree to arbitrate all claims, including claims for wrongful termination, breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent or intentional misrepresentation,\n   negligent or intentional interference with contract, and claims for any other violation of federal, state, or municipal statute. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Both Plaintiff and Defendants may seek equitable relief as necessary from a court of competent jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Agreement also contains a severability clause, stating that, \"if one or more of the provisions in this Agreement is deemed void by law, then the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Additionally, the offer letter from Defendants to Plaintiff asserts that the arbitration agreement in the employment agreement is a term of Plaintiff's employment. (Domanico Decl., Ex. 2 (\"Offer Ltr.\") at 5, Dkt. No. 22-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff filed this action in Contra Costa County Superior Court on October 6, 2017. (Compl.) Plaintiff asserted claims for: (1) wrongful termination; (2) breach of employment contract; (3) breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (4) promissory estoppel; (5) failure to pay all wages; (6) intentional interference with contract; (7) intentional misrepresentation; (8) \"promise without intent to perform;\" (9) intentional infliction of emotional distress; and (10) declaratory relief. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) On February 27, 2018, Defendants removed the action to this Court. (Defs'. Notice of Removal, Dkt. No. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants filed the instant motion to compel arbitration on August 6, 2018. (Defs.' Mot. to Compel.) Plaintiff filed his opposition on August 20, 2018.

Defendant Skytap is a private Washington state company offering a cloud computing service, and in so doing, has employees in twenty-eight states and major facilities in four states. (Colish Decl., at \u00b6\u00b6 2-5, Dkt. No. 21.) Therefore, the FAA governs this arbitration agreement\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , and as such, is only unenforceable under state contract law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In opposing Defendants' motion to compel arbitration, Plaintiff argues that the arbitration agreement is unconscionable, and that no one provision can be severed so as to make the agreement conscionable. (Plf.'s Opp'n at 1, 8-9.) Under California law, the party opposing arbitration bears the burden of proving that the arbitration provision is unenforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Sonic-Calabasas A, Inc. v.

(Plf.'s Opp'n at 8-9.) On the contrary, courts in this Circuit have found arbitration agreements with two or more unconscionable provisions to be enforceable by severing those unconscionable terms and enforcing the remainder of the agreement. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Pope v. Sonatype, Inc\n   </em>\n   ., the court found three terms in an employment agreement to be unconscionable-an injunctive relief carve out, a forum selection clause, and a requirement that the plaintiff pay his own attorney's fees. No. 5:15-cv-00956-RMW,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202174033\">\n    2015 WL 2174033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6-7 (N.D. Cal.

In such cases, the courts found that even though there was more than one unconscionable provision, those provisions were easily severable because they did not relate to the \"agreement's chief objective,\" nor were the agreements unilaterally binding on one party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In some instances, courts have been unwilling to enforce an arbitration agreement with more than one unconscionable provision. In such cases, however, the entire agreement lacked mutuality and the severance of any discrete provision would not have removed the taint of unconscionability from the agreement. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Bridge Fund Capital Corp. v. Fastbucks Franchise Corporation\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit found multiple unconscionable provisions in a franchisee agreement, including an unconscionable choice of law and forum selection provision, an unconscionable class action waiver, and multiple terms that constituted an unconscionable lack of mutuality between the parties.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787400\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/996/#p1005\">\n    622 F.3d 996\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1005-06 (9th Cir. 2010). The court refused to enforce the entire agreement because, although there were some easily severable terms, the lack of mutuality that permeated the agreement was too pervasive to remove with the severance of a single term.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787400\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/996/#p1005\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Capili v.

In such cases, the courts found that the agreements had terms that lacked mutuality between the parties, causing the courts to refuse to enforce the entire agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Here, the arbitration agreement has a severability clause, allowing the Court to sever the unconscionable terms and enforce the remainder of the agreement. (Emp't Agree't at 3.) Additionally, the arbitration agreement is mutually binding on both parties, making severance an option to cure the substantive unconscionability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Although there are three provisions that would need to be severed, this Court finds that each of the provisions can be severed without disrupting the agreement's chief objective- for the parties to submit any employment dispute arising between them to arbitration before a neutral arbitrator, subject to the AAA's rules for employment arbitrations. Importantly, none of the terms show a lack of mutuality, as none require Plaintiff to waive rights that are still reserved for Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   First, the forum selection clause and related choice of law clause are easily severable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Galen v.

Moreover, Defendants have agreed to move the arbitration to California and apply California law, thus relieving Plaintiff of any burden that would have been imposed on Plaintiff by having to travel to Washington, and allowing Plaintiff all statutory remedies and protections that he would be afforded in a California court. (Trani-Morris Decl. at \u00b6 2, Dkt. No. 23.) Accordingly, the choice of law and forum selection provisions are hereby severed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Second, the attorney's fee provision is also easily severable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grabowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4191998\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/817/1159/#p1179\">\n    817 F.Supp.2d at 1179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (severing the attorney's fee provision);\n   <em>\n    Pope\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202174033\">\n    2015 WL 2174033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6-7 (same);\n   <em>\n    Serafin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055069\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/235/165/#p184\">\n    235 Cal.

Under the AAA rules, Plaintiff would only be required to pay a $300 filing fee, a cost less than what he would have to pay-and already has paid-for filing the case in court. Additionally, Defendants have agreed \"to cover all fees and costs that are associated with the arbitration in accordance with California law.\" (Trani-Morris Decl. at \u00b6 2.) The arbitration cost-splitting provision is hereby severed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Because the unconscionable terms are severed, the Court finds there is no substantive unconscionability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
