The Court will deny Petitioner Kevin Jim's Motion and order Jim to pay the full $5.00 filing fee within thirty days of entry of this Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is a habeas corpus proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The filing fee for a \u00a7 2241 proceeding is $5.00. Jim did not pay the $5.00 filing fee, but, instead, filed his Motion. The Court has analyzed the inmate account that Jim submitted under \u00a7 1915(b)(1) and has determined that the average balance in Jim's inmate account in the six months preceding filing of this action is $708.75.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 3-4. Twenty percent of the average balance is $141.75, an amount that exceeds the $5.00 filing fee. The inmate account statement demonstrates that Jim has the financial ability to prepay the fee for this action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3). The Court will therefore deny Jim's Motion to proceed in forma pauperis pursuant to \u00a7 1915 and will order Jim to pay the full $5.00 filing fee. If Jim does not pay the $5.00 filing fee within thirty days, the Court may dismiss this proceeding without further notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that: (i) the requests in the Prisoner's Motion and Affidavit for Leave to Proceed Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , filed August 7, 2018 (Doc. 2), are denied; and (ii) Petitioner Kevin Jim will pay the full $5.00 filing fee within thirty days of entry of this Order.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
