Dill's Amended Motion to Dismiss and to Sanction Plaintiffs, filed November 6, 2017 (Doc. 12)(\"Dill MTD\"); and (ii) grant Defendant David Frewing and U.S. Bowling's Amended Motion to Dismiss, or in the alternative, Motion to Stay Proceedings, filed November 15, 2017 (Doc. 14)(\"Frewing MTD\"). The parties have not filed any objections to the PFRD, which waives their right to review of the PFRD.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Because the Court concludes that the PFRD by the Honorable Steven C. Yarbrough United States Magistrate Judge for the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico is not clearly erroneous, arbitrary, obviously contrary to law, or an abuse of discretion, the Court will: (i) adopt the PFRD as its own; (ii) grant the Dill MTD; and (iii) grant the Brewing MTD. Accordingly, the Court will dismiss the Complaint to Recover Compensatory, Consequential and Punitive Damages for Defendants' Breach of Contract, Promissory Estoppel, and Negligent Misrepresentation, filed June 23, 2017 (Doc. 1)(\"Complaint\"), with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     LAW REGARDING OBJECTIONS TO PROPOSED FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   District courts may refer dispositive motions to a Magistrate Judge for a recommended disposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

The Supreme Court of the United States of America -- in the course of approving the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit's use of the waiver rule -- has noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   It does not appear that Congress intended to require district court review of a magistrate's factual or legal conclusions, under a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   or any other standard, when neither party objects to those findings. The House and Senate Reports accompanying the 1976 amendments do not expressly consider what sort of review the district court should perform when no party objects to the magistrate's report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 94-625, pp. 9-10 (1976)(hereafter Senate Report); H.R. Rep. No. 94-1609, p. 11 (1976); U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1976, p. 6162 (hereafter House Report). There is nothing in those Reports, however, that demonstrates an intent to require the district court to give any more consideration to the magistrate judge's report than the court considers appropriate. Moreover, the Subcommittee\n   that drafted and held hearing on the 1976 amendments had before it the guidelines of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts concerning the efficient use of magistrates. Those guidelines recommended to the district courts that \"[w]here a magistrate makes a finding or\n   <em>\n    ruling\n   </em>\n   on a motion or an issue, his determination should become that of the district court, unless specific objection is filed within a reasonable time.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jurisdiction of the United States Magistrates, Hearings on S. 1283 before the Subcommittee on Improvements in Judicial Machinery of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 94th Cong., 1st Sess., 24 (1975)(emphasis added)(hereafter Senate Hearings). The Committee also heard Judge Metzner of the Southern District of New York, the chairman of a Judicial Conference Committee on the administration of the magistrate system, testify that he personally followed that practice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , at 11 (\"If any objections come in, ... I review [the record] and decide it. If no objections come in, I merely sign the magistrate's order.\"). The Judicial Conference of the United States, which supported the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard of review eventually incorporated in \u00a7 636(b)(1)(C), opined that in most instances no party would object to the magistrate's recommendation, and the litigation would terminate with the judge's adoption of the magistrate's report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Senate Hearings, at 35, 37. Congress apparently assumed, therefore, that any party who was dissatisfied for any reason with the magistrate's report would file objections, and those objections would trigger district court review. There is no indication that Congress, in enacting \u00a7 636(b)(1)(C), intended to require a district judge to review a magistrate's report to which no objections are filed. It did not preclude treating the failure to object as a procedural default, waiving the right to further consideration of any sort. We thus find nothing in the statute or the legislative history that convinces us that Congress intended to forbid a rule such as the one adopted by the Sixth Circuit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs Rick Jaramillo and Steve Duran are equity partners in Railyard Company, LLC. On September 4, 2015, Railyard Company commenced Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Railyard Co., LLC,\n   </em>\n   Case No. 15-12386-t11, Doc. 1. On July 13, 2016, United States Bankruptcy Judge Robert Jacobvitz entered an order approving the appointment of Defendant Craig Dill as Chapter 11 Trustee of the bankruptcy estate over the objections of Plaintiffs Duran and Jaramillo. Bank. Proc., Doc. 308. On August 18, 2018, Defendant Dill, in his capacity as Trustee, moved for an order approving the rejection of an executory contract between Railyard Company, LLC and Plaintiff Railyard Brewing Company. United States\n   Bankruptcy Judge David T. Thuma granted the motion and approved rejection of the lease. Bank. Proc., Doc. 508. Judge Thuma further approved rejection of a pre-petition lease with Plaintiff Ringside Entertainment and terminated that lease as well. Bank. Proc., Doc. 420.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Both leases concerned a space at a two-story, multi-tenant building at the Railyard in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bank. Proc., Doc. 629. Plaintiff Ringside Entertainment's lease contemplated use of the space as a combination restaurant, bar, and eight-lane bowling center.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Pursuant to the plan, Plaintiff Ringside contracted with U.S. Bowling for the purchase of bowling lanes and related bowling equipment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   At some point, however, Ringside Entertainment abandoned this project.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On January 30, 2014, Plaintiff Railyard Brewing signed a lease for the space with the intention of operating the restaurant, bar, and bowling center.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After bankruptcy proceedings were commenced, Defendant Dill determined that a bowling center would not be feasible at that location and moved for an order approving the sale of the bowling equipment.

Judge Thuma rejected these arguments and approved sale of the bowling equipment on June 21, 2017. Bank. Proc., Doc. 629 at 11; Bank. Proc., Doc. 640. U.S. Bowling ultimately entered into an agreement to purchase back the bowling equipment. Bank Proc., Doc. 640.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On June 23, 2017, Plaintiffs filed the present lawsuit against Chapter 11 Trustee Craig Dill, U.S. Bowling, and David Frewing bringing claims for breach of contract, promissory estoppel, and negligent misrepresentation. Civ. No. 17-673, Doc. 1. Plaintiffs' claims are premised on the circumstances surrounding U.S. Bowling's installation of the bowling equipment and the eventual sale of the bowling equipment by Defendant Dill. While difficult to parse the exact facts being asserted in support of Plaintiffs' claims, Plaintiffs allege that they entered into an agreement for the installation of bowling equipment with U.S. Bowling. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 12. Plaintiffs allege that in March 2013, Jaramillo signed a change order for the installation of sound attenuation equipment due to complaints from other tenants regarding noise emanating from the bowling equipment. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 15. Plaintiffs allege that U.S. Bowling represented that installation of the sound attenuation equipment would satisfy the other tenants' concerns. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 15. Plaintiffs allege, however, that they continued to receive complaints regarding noise. Doc. \u00b6 16. Plaintiffs allege that they continued to exchange communications with U.S. Bowling regarding completion of the sound attenuation equipment as well as other bowling equipment. Doc. \u00b6 17. Plaintiffs allege that the project was not completed because Defendant Dill subsequently moved in the bankruptcy proceedings to terminate the project. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 21. Plaintiffs allege Defendant Dill subsequently entered into an agreement with U.S. Bowling for U.S. Bowling to purchase the bowling equipment at a significantly reduced price. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 22. Plaintiffs further allege that U.S. Bowling did not have the appropriate contractor's licenses to undertake the work contrary to state law. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 24. Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Dill is \"aiding and abetting\" U.S. Bowling's unlicensed contracting work and conspired with U.S. Bowling \"in its unjust enrichment.\" Doc. 1 at \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This is not the first lawsuit Plaintiffs Steven Duran and Rick Jaramillo have pursued against Defendant Dill in his capacity as trustee of the bankruptcy estate. On August 15, 2016, Plaintiffs filed suit against Mr. Dill and attempted to nullify Judge Jacobvitz's order approving his appointment as trustee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Duran v. Dill\n   </em>\n   , Civ. No. 16-928. Chief Judge William P. Johnson ultimately dismissed the plaintiffs' Complaint on the bases that (1) Defendant Dill, in his capacity as trustee, was immune from suit; (2) the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiffs had not obtained permission to sue Defendant Dill, and (3) the plaintiffs insufficiently served him.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Doc. 6 at 5-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In the present case, Defendants filed their Amended Motions to Dismiss on November 1, 2017, and November 6, 2017, respectively. Defendants raise multiple reasons as to why Plaintiffs' Complaint should be dismissed. Both Defendants contend that (1) the Court does not have federal question or diversity jurisdiction; (2) Plaintiffs do not have standing to pursue claims set forth in the Complaint, which are exclusively bankruptcy estate property; (3) Plaintiffs have willfully violated the automatic stay in the bankruptcy proceeding; and (4) Plaintiffs have failed to comply with D.N.M.LR-Civ. 83.7 requiring corporations, partnerships, or business entities to be represented by attorneys authorized to practice law before this Court. Defendant Dill separately also moves for dismissal on the basis that he is entitled to quasi-judicial immunity in his capacity as trustee of the bankruptcy estate and that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because Plaintiffs failed to obtain the permission of the Bankruptcy Court to sue him in that capacity. Defendant Frewing separately contends that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiffs did not respond to Defendants' Amended Motions to Dismiss. Although the Court's local rules provide that a party's failure to respond to a motion generally constitutes consent to grant the motion, the Court \"cannot...grant a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment based solely on plaintiff's failure to respond and must consider the merits of the motion.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Issa v.

This is the second time Plaintiffs have filed a lawsuit against him in his capacity as trustee in response to their displeasure with developments in the bankruptcy proceedings. Indeed, Plaintiffs are, in effect, utilizing these lawsuits as de facto appeals of adverse determinations in the bankruptcy proceedings. For instance, in the previous lawsuit before Chief Judge Johnson, Plaintiffs were unhappy with the appointment of Defendant Dill and therefore filed claims challenging his impartiality in an effort to have him removed as trustee.\n   <em>\n    Duran v. Dill\n   </em>\n   , Civ. No. 16-928, Doc. 6. Their claims were, of course, the same objections Plaintiffs advanced against his appointment in the bankruptcy proceedings. After Chief Judge Johnson dismissed Plaintiffs' first lawsuit against Defendant Dill on the basis that, as trustee, Defendant Dill is entitled to quasi-judicial immunity and Plaintiffs failed to obtain permission in bankruptcy court to sue him, Plaintiffs are again attempting to sue him. Plaintiffs' present suit is founded on Plaintiffs' objections in the bankruptcy proceedings to the sale of the bowling equipment. Bank. Proc., Doc. 629 at 7-8. When Judge Thuma denied those objections, Plaintiffs immediately filed the present lawsuit without regard for Chief Judge Johnson's previous ruling. Given this, Plaintiffs' actions are frivolous at best and abusive at worst.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The posture of this case is similar to that in\n   <em>\n    Clark v. Meijer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8970027\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/376/1077/\">\n    376 F.Supp.2d 1077\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.N.M. 2004). In\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   , the court entered filing restrictions on the plaintiffs' future attempts to sue the defendants. The plaintiffs had a long history of filing lawsuits against the defendants but the most relevant facts for purposes of the court's award of sanctions was that the plaintiffs initiated a second suit in New Mexico against the defendants after their first suit was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8970027\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/376/1077/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8970027\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/376/1077/\">\n    at 1086\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court concluded that \"[t]he filing of this suit after a court within this district already determined the issue of personal jurisdiction indicates the [plaintiffs'] willingness to abuse the Court's judicial process in hopes of achieving a personal pecuniary benefit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8970027\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/376/1077/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court therefore imposed filing restrictions on the plaintiffs and granted defendants their reasonable attorneys' fees and other expenses in preparing their motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8970027\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/376/1077/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8970027\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/376/1077/\">\n    at 1087\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In an effort to deter future misconduct, I recommend that filing restrictions be placed on Plaintiffs to prevent future frivolous lawsuits against Defendant Dill. As noted above, Chief Judge Johnson's previous dismissal of Plaintiffs' prior lawsuit against Defendant Dill concluded that Defendant Dill, in his capacity as bankruptcy trustee, is immune from suit.\n   <em>\n    Duran v. Dill\n   </em>\n   , Civ. No. 16-928, Doc. 6 at 5-6. Second, Chief Judge Johnson dismissed that lawsuit because Plaintiffs did not obtain permission in bankruptcy court to sue Defendant Dill pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    Barton\n   </em>\n   doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8970027\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/376/1077/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 6 (citing\n   <em>\n    Satterfield v.

I therefore recommend that as a precondition to filing future lawsuits Plaintiffs be required to (1) file a petition with the Clerk of Court requesting leave to file\n   a pro se proceeding against Defendant Dill, (2) plaintiffs file with Clerk of Court a notarized affidavit setting out the basis of the causes of action they intend to pursue against Defendant Dill and specifically why the intended causes of action are not directed toward Defendant Dill in his capacity as the bankruptcy trustee, or (3) that they have received permission in bankruptcy court to bring suit against Defendant Dill. I further recommend that Defendant Dill be granted reasonable attorneys' fees and other expenses in connection with the preparation of his motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
