Walker, Chief United States District Judge\n   Consider the game of football. Football fans may quibble about the substance of the rules, but no one quibbles that rules are necessary to play the game.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Nat'l Football League,\n   <em>\n    2018 Official Playing Rules of the National Football League\n   </em>\n   (2018). And no one quibbles that football referees make certain calls, under the rules, that deserve review. Indeed, not every call is going to be clear-the ultimate decision may hinge on highly subjective factors. Hence, a call will be overturned only when there is \"clear and obvious visual evidence available that warrants the change.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Among other things, the 2018 NFL Rules allow video review for plays involving possession, boundary lines, the line of scrimmage, and the goal line.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The NFL likewise provides review for disqualification of players.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Coaches may challenge calls themselves by throwing a red flag, or, in certain circumstances, the referees may initiate review on their own.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   All that process. Just for a game.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In this case, the Plaintiffs have thrown a red flag. But this is not football. Rather, this is a case about the precious and fundamental right to vote-the right preservative of all other rights. And it is about the right of a voter to have his or her vote counted. There is no doubt there must be election laws. There is no doubt that to run an election, the state must impose deadlines and rules to govern an efficient and transparent election process. There is no doubt that election officials must make certain calls, under the rules, that deserve review. And there is no doubt some of those calls may hinge on highly subjective factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The precise issue in this case is whether Florida's law that allows county election officials to reject vote-by-mail and provisional ballots for mismatched signatures-with no standards, an illusory process to cure, and no process to challenge the rejection-passes constitutional muster. The answer is simple. It does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This is a case about vote-by-mail and provisional ballots. Florida allows registered eligible voters, without an excuse, to cast their ballots by mail, as opposed to casting their votes at their assigned precinct on Election Day.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20101.62\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 101.62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). Voting by mail has become a popular option for Florida voters. In the 2016 General Election, more than 2.7 million Florida voters either voted or attempted to vote by mail. Fla. Dep't. of State,\n   <em>\n    Voting Activity by Ballot Type for 2016 General Election\n   </em>\n   , Florida Department of State, Division of Elections (last visited Nov. 13, 2018), https://dos.myflorida.com/media/697842/2016-ge-summaries-ballots-by-type-activity.pdf. Provisional ballots may be cast when there is uncertainty over whether a voter is eligible to vote. In the 2016 General Election, 24,460 Florida voters cast or attempted to cast a provisional ballot.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20101.62\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Both vote-by-mail and provisional ballots are at risk of being rejected, and thus not cast, based on the mismatch of a signature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Voters who choose to vote by mail must follow certain instructions provided by Florida law. For example, vote-by-mail\n   voters must send their marked ballot back in a specially marked secrecy envelope.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20101.62\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 101.65 (2016). Those voters also must insert the secrecy envelope into another mailing envelope addressed to the supervisor, seal that mailing envelope, and fill out the \"Voter's Certificate\" on the back of the mailing envelope.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20101.62\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   For a vote-by-mail ballot to be counted, the envelope of that ballot must include the voter's signature.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20101.62\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Once the vote-by-mail ballots are received, county canvassing boards review those ballots to verify the signature requirement has been met.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20101.62\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 101.68(c). In addition to confirming the envelope is signed, the county canvassing boards confirm the signature on the envelope matches the signature on file for a voter. These county canvassing boards are staffed by laypersons that are not required to undergo formal handwriting-analysis education or training.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, Florida has no formalized statewide procedure for canvassing boards to evaluate whether the signature on a vote-by-mail ballot matches the signature on file with the elections office. If the canvassing board believes the signature on the vote-by-mail ballot does not correspond to the signature on file with the supervisor of elections office, the ballot is deemed \"illegal\" and is therefore rejected.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20101.68\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 101.68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5). Under an earlier version of Florida law, vote-by-mail voters had no opportunity to cure a mismatched signature on a vote-by-mail ballot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In a previous case, this Court found the Florida statutory scheme that provided an opportunity to cure no-signature ballots, but denied that opportunity to mismatched-signature ballots, was unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    Fla. Democratic Party v. Detzner\n   </em>\n   , No. 4:16-cv-607-MW/CAS,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206090943\">\n    2016 WL 6090943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (N.D. Fla. Oct. 16, 2016). Thus, this Court entered a preliminary injunction requiring the Florida Secretary of State to issue a directive to the supervisors of elections advising them that Florida's statutory scheme as it related to mismatched-signature ballots was unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9. And in light of that finding, they were required to allow mis-matched-signature ballots to be cured in the same way provided for non-signature ballots.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In response to that injunction, Florida law was amended. Now, if the canvassing board determines a vote-by-mail ballot contains a signature that does not match the voter's signature in the registration books or precinct register, the supervisor \"shall ... immediately notify\" the voter.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20101.68\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 101.68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4)(a) (2017). After notification, the voter may complete and submit an affidavit to cure the vote-by-mail ballot until 5 p.m. on the day before the election.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20101.68\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But notably, a vote-by-mail ballot may be received \"not later than 7 p.m. on the day of the election.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20101.68\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 101.6103(5)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The opportunity to cure is the last chance a vote-by-mail voter has to save their vote from being rejected and not counted. Florida law provides no opportunity for voters to challenge the determination of the canvassing board that their signatures do not match, and their votes do not count. Interestingly, Florida law does provide an opportunity for any voter or candidate to challenge a signature that was accepted and thus a vote that was counted.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20101.68\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 101.68(4). If any candidate or voter believes a vote-by-mail should not have been counted because of a defect on the voter's certificate or cure affidavit \"he or she may, at any time before the ballot is\n   removed from the envelope, file with the canvassing board a protest against the canvass of the ballot, specifying the precinct, the ballot, and the reason he or she believes the ballot to be illegal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20101.68\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Even more striking is the fact that under Florida law, canvassing boards may begin canvassing of vote-by-mail ballots at 7 a.m. on the 15th day before the election, but no later than noon on the day following the election.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20101.68\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 101.68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(a). Thus, a vote-by-mail voter could mail their ballot in weeks early, but the canvassing board could also wait, canvass the ballot the day after the election, determine there is a mismatched signature, and toss the vote. The voter therefore gets no chance to cure, since curing must be done by 5 p.m. the day before the election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Provisional ballots are also at issue in this case. In all elections, a voter claiming to be properly registered in the state and eligible to vote at the precinct in the election, but whose eligibility cannot be determined, or whom an election official asserts is not eligible, is entitled to cast a provisional ballot.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20101.68\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 101.048(1). Provisional ballots are placed in a secrecy envelope and sealed. The person casting a provisional ballot has until 5 p.m. on the second day following an election to present written evidence supporting his or her eligibility to vote.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20101.68\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   County canvassing boards examine the provisional ballot voter's certificate and affirmation, written evidence provided by the provisional voter, any other evidence presented by the supervisor of elections, and, in the case of a change, any evidence presented by the challenger to determine if the person was eligible to vote.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20101.68\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 101.048(2)(a). A provisional ballot shall be cast unless the canvassing board finds by a preponderance of the evidence the person was not entitled to vote.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20101.68\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After making the initial eligibility determination, the county canvassing board must further compare the signature on the provisional ballot voter's certificate with the signature on the voter's registration.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20101.68\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 101.048(2)(b)1. If the signatures match, the vote is counted.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20101.68\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   There is no mechanism for a voter to challenge the canvassing board's determination that the voter was or was not eligible to vote. Nor is there a cure period for provisional ballots rejected based on signature mismatch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs brought this case arguing Florida's use of signature matching for vote-by-mail and provisional ballots unconstitutionally burdens the rights of Florida's voters and deprives them of equal protection of the law. Specifically, Plaintiffs seek an injunction that requires Defendants and anyone under their supervision to count any vote-by-mail or provisional ballots rejected based on signature mismatching.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    This Court recognizes that time is of the essence inasmuch as the supervisors of elections have received thousands of vote-by-mail ballots and the recount of votes is currently underway. Moreover, this Court wishes to afford the parties a meaningful opportunity to seek a stay of this order. Accordingly, this order issues on an expedited basis.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    The canvassing boards consist of \"the [local] supervisor of elections; a county court judge, who shall act as chair; and the chair of the board of county commissioners.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20102.141\">\n     Fla.

In that case, the plaintiffs were deprived of the right to vote in an election because state law required the rejection of their votes without any opportunity to cure a mismatched signature. Res judicata is inapplicable for two reasons. First, the cases do not involve the same parties. A Plaintiff in this case, Bill Nelson for U.S. Senate, was not a party to the first case. In the present controversy, Bill Nelson is suing as a candidate. It is no answer to say\n    he is a part of the Democratic Party Executive Committee because, in this case, he is suing in a different capacity. The position the Defendants ask this Court to adopt-that every future candidate for office is barred from challenging an election law that was previously challenged-is nonsense. Second, the cases do not involve the same causes of action. This case involves a different election that was conducted using amended state law election procedures. Plaintiffs now allege that, despite a cure period, voters are still unconstitutionally denied the right to vote because state election law requires ballots with mismatched signatures be rejected. This is not a situation where the Plaintiffs are trying to take a second bite at the apple. Rather, this is a new alleged constitutional violation under a different iteration of state law that did not exist at the time the complaint was filed in the first case.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Kirksey v.

To start,\n    <em>\n     Toney\n    </em>\n    is a case that involved setting aside the results of an election and ordering a new election. And notably, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's grant of that relief. Voiding an election is an extreme and extraordinary remedy. Here, Plaintiffs do not ask for such a remedy. Moreover, Plaintiffs in this case have petitioned for judicial resolution over certain issues while the election count and results are still pending. This is not a situation where an election result is final, and a losing party seeks to invalidate the result. Here, the counting of votes is still occurring, and the Plaintiffs want certain votes counted.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Further,\n    <em>\n     Toney\n    </em>\n    itself recognized there are \"gray\" areas where the facts and circumstances of a case are not discovered until a \"late hour.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"213507\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/488/310/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"213507\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/488/310/\">\n     at 314\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In\n    <em>\n     Toney\n    </em>\n    ,\n    the Fifth Circuit found there was no deliberate bypass of a pre-election judicial remedy by the plaintiffs because the racially discriminatory voter purge began only thirty days before the election.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"213507\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/488/310/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"213507\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/488/310/\">\n     at 315\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Similarly, in this case, Plaintiffs did not-and could not-know prior to the election that this Court's prior injunction and the subsequent amendment to Florida law would be such a dismal failure. As this case's facts demonstrate, the opportunity to cure provided in Florida law is woefully inadequate. In this election, vote-by-mail voters followed every vote-by-mail rule to ensure their legal votes were counted.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF Nos. 29, 32, 44. Their legal votes were rejected based on a signature mismatch, but they did not even receive notice that their votes would not count until the time to cure-as established by state law-had passed.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    ECF No. 29 at 2, \u00b6\u00b6 4-5; ECF No. 32 at 2, \u00b6\u00b6 6-7; ECF No. 44 at 2, \u00b6 7. These voters went above and beyond trying to get their legal votes counted. They contacted their local boards of election, presented valid identification, and tried to cure the incorrect signature mismatch determination. ECF No. 29 at 2, \u00b6 5; ECF No. 32 at 2-3, \u00b6 9; ECF No. 44 at 2-3, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9, 12. But there was nothing they could do, and their votes were not counted. ECF No. 29 at 2, \u00b6 6; ECF No. 32 at 3, \u00b6 9; ECF No. 44 at 3, \u00b6 12. Simply put, even if\n    <em>\n     Toney\n    </em>\n    does stand for the proposition that voters must be diligent in asserting their rights, it still supports the Plaintiffs' case. There was no possible way for voters to foresee before the election that the cure period would absolutely fail them.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Lastly, as already noted,\n    <em>\n     Toney\n    </em>\n    would require Defendants in this case to prove by clear and convincing evidence that there was a deliberate bypass of a pre-election judicial remedy by Plaintiffs. Defendants failed to carry their burden. They have presented no evidence-let alone clear and convincing evidence-that the Plaintiffs deliberately bypassed a pre-election judicial remedy. In one sense, they could argue the lawyers involved in this case should have foreseen problems with the statute, but even that is not clear. Ultimately, Plaintiffs could not have known before the election that the injunction entered by this Court in 2016 and the amendment to Florida law added nothing. The deficiencies of the law were not realized until voters were informed after the time to cure passed that their votes were rejected.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    To the extent the Defendants argue the Plaintiffs have failed to show they will suffer an irreparable injury without injunctive relief because they have not exercised due diligence in protecting their rights, that argument is rejected. As discussed above-and below-Plaintiffs could not have foreseen that this Court's previous injunction and the amended Florida law that requires an opportunity to cure would, in reality, be an illusory solution that fails to meaningfully protect the right to vote.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    III\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Under Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a district court may grant a preliminary injunction \"only if the moving party shows that: (1) it has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) irreparable injury will be suffered unless the injunction issues; (3) the threatened injury to the movant outweighs whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party; and (4) if issued, the injunction would not be adverse to the public interest.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    <em>\n     Siegel v.

Here, the injury is the deprivation of the right to vote based on a standardless determination made by laypeople that the signature on a voters' vote-by-mail or provisional ballot does not match the signature on file with the supervisor of elections. There are dozens of reasons a signature mismatch may occur, even when the individual signing is in fact the voter. Disenfranchisement of approximately 5,000 voters based on signature mismatch is a substantial burden. Indeed, \"[n]o right is more precious in a free country than that of having a voice in the election of those who make the laws under which, as good citizens, we must live.

What makes Florida's signature matching process even more problematic is that fact that counties have discretion to apply their own standards and procedures. Certain counties, such as Leon County, go above and beyond to ensure voters have a chance to cure a signature mismatch.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    But nothing in the law requires that and other counties may choose not to exercise the level of care and concern Leon County does. The only way such a scheme can be reasonable is if there are mechanisms in place to protect against arbitrary and unreasonable decisions by canvassing boards to reject ballots based on signature mismatches. In\n    <em>\n     Lemons\n    </em>\n    , the Ninth Circuit upheld the use of signature matching for referendum petitions.\n    <em>\n     Lemons\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4128513\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/538/1098/#p1103\">\n     538 F.3d at 1102\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . But in that decision, the court noted \"the verification process is already weighted in favor of accepting questionable signature, in part because only rejected signatures are subject to more than one level of review by county elections officials,\" and the \"procedures ... allow chief petitioners and members of the public to observe the signature verification process and challenge decisions by county elections officials.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4128513\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/538/1098/#p1103\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4128513\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/538/1098/#p1103\">\n     at 1105\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The cure period was intended to solve the inherent problems in signature matching, but the opportunity to cure has proven illusory. Vote-by-mail voters, in this election, were not notified of a signature mismatch problem until it was too late to cure. Provisional ballot voters are provided no opportunity to cure under the law. Without\n    this Court's intervention, these potential voters have no remedy. Rather, they are simply out of luck and deprived of the right to vote. What is shocking about Florida law is that even though a voter cannot challenge a vote rejected as illegal, any voter or candidate could challenge a vote accepted as legal. The burden on the right to vote, in this case, outweighs the state's reasons for the practice. Thus, under\n    <em>\n     Anderson\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     -\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Burdick\n    </em>\n    , this scheme unconstitutionally burdens the fundamental right of Florida citizens to vote and have their votes counted.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    This Court notes the Plaintiffs' claims are brought under the Fourteenth Amendment, but they have not made any argument their rights to procedural due process have been violated. However, as an aside, this Court further notes that as my colleague recently found in a case involving a similar Georgia law, the statutory scheme presents procedural due process concerns as well.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Martin v.

This Court finds that the Plaintiffs have established irreparable injury. Here, potentially thousands of voters have been deprived of the right to cast a legal vote-and have that vote counted-by an untrained canvassing board member based on an arbitrary determination that their respective signatures did not match. Such a violation of the right to vote cannot be undone.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Detzner\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206090943\">\n     2016 WL 6090943\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at *8 (\"This is not golf; there are no mulligans.\") (quoting\n    <em>\n     Fla.

Not so.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    First, some Plaintiffs clearly relied-much to their dismay-on a recently enacted statutory guarantee of notice and an opportunity to cure a mismatched ballot before the election.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF Nos. 29, 32, 44, 45.

The voter's potential remedy under Section 102.168 is limited to a circuit court's review of only the voter's signature on the voter's certificate and the signature of the voter in the registration records.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206090943\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 102.168(8).

Defendant Detzner is ordered to issue a directive to the supervisors of elections (with this Order attached) advising them (1) Florida's statutory scheme as it relates to curing mismatched-signature ballots has been applied unconstitutionally; and (2) in\n    light of this Court's order, they are required to allow voters who have been belatedly notified they have submitted a mismatched-signature ballot to cure their ballots by November 17, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. The supervisors of elections shall allow mismatched-signature ballots to be cured in the same manner and with the same proof a mismatched-signature ballot could have otherwise been cured before November 5, 2018, at 5:00 p.m.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n    3. The preliminary injunction set out above will take effect upon the posting of security in the amount of $500 for costs and damages sustained by a party found to have been wrongfully enjoined. Plaintiffs will immediately notify Defendant when the bond has been posted and thereafter immediately file proof of such notice through the electronic case files system.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n    4.
