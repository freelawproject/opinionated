The parties dispute the duties of the utilization manager and the nature of the job performance required by Holden and other utilization managers. Holden has presented evidence that her job consisted of collecting certain information from medical providers, using a scripted interview, and then inputting that information into a computer system, which would determine whether treatment should be approved.\n    <footnotemark>\n     71\n    </footnotemark>\n    The computer system contained certain controls that she could not override without a supervisor.\n    <footnotemark>\n     72\n    </footnotemark>\n    She maintains that she never spoke to or advised any members, did not assess medical condition, and never monitored care.\n    <footnotemark>\n     73\n    </footnotemark>\n    She did not have discretion to determine even the order in which she would process requests.\n    <footnotemark>\n     74\n    </footnotemark>\n    She also maintains that she was tested for inter-rater reliability, and if she failed, she would have to engage in additional training.\n    <footnotemark>\n     75\n    </footnotemark>\n    A reasonable fact-finder, drawing all inferences in favor of Holden, could conclude that Cenpatico's utilization review process was designed to minimize the amount of discretion and independent judgment employed by Holden and other utilization managers and, therefore, that the professional and administrative exemptions do not apply.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    On the other hand, a reasonable fact-finder, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Cenpatico, could conclude that Holden in fact exercised discretion and independent judgment in matters of significance. Based on the evidence presented by Cenpatico, such a fact-finder could conclude that Holden and other utilization managers received requests for treatment; independently gathered the necessary information in an interactive process; reviewed medical records applicable to the patient; applied guidelines to the medical information provided to determine whether the guideline was met; and operated with minimal supervision.\n    <footnotemark>\n     76\n    </footnotemark>\n    While Cenpatico acknowledges that Holden used a script to gather information and a computer system in determining whether to approve treatment, a reasonable fact-finder could also conclude that those were merely tools that Holden could use to assist in her determinations.\n    <footnotemark>\n     77\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Cenpatico cites to several decisions where courts found that employees with positions similar to Holden's were exempt as a matter of law. Docket No. 36 at 9-11. Those cases are distinguishable. For example, Cenpatico cites Judge Woodlock's decision in\n    <em>\n     Crowe v. Examworks, Inc.\n    </em>\n    , where he found that utilization review nurse auditors (\"URNAs\") exercised discretion and independent judgment in matters of significance.\n    <em>\n     Crowe\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180650\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/136/16/#p27\">\n     136 F.Supp.3d at 30-34\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Specifically, Judge Woodlock found that there was no dispute that URNAs considered a variety of medical records and circumstances, including a patient's diagnosis, treatment, and prescribed drugs, in comparing the patient's circumstances and the requested treatment to applicable guidelines and operated with minimal supervision.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180650\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/136/16/#p27\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180650\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/136/16/#p27\">\n     at 30\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Cenpatico argues that the Court should not credit Holden's descriptions of her job duties for purposes of the parties' motions for summary judgment because they contradict prior statements she made regarding her job duties. Docket No. 36 at 12, n. 12 (citing\n     <em>\n      Williams v. Genex Servs., LLC\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4059347\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/103/#p110\">\n      809 F.3d 103\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 110 (4th Cir. 2015) ). However, the statements to which Cenpatico refers were not made under oath and, therefore, her affidavit is not subject to being stricken under the sham affidavit rule. Whether to credit all, part, or none of Holden's affidavit or her prior statements is for the fact finder.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
