United States\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) (\"ACCA\"), is impermissibly vague and that imposing an increased sentence under that provision violates the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America's guarantee of due process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2562-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under the ACCA, a defendant convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm faces more severe punishment if he has three or more previous convictions for a \"violent felony.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B). The ACCA defines \"violent felony\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves the use of explosives,\n   <em>\n    or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B) (emphasis added). The Supreme Court, in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States\n   </em>\n   , struck down the italicized residual clause as unconstitutionally vague.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2555-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The language of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i), which defines \"violent felony\" as a crime that \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force,\" is commonly referred to as the \"element\" or \"force\" clause. The \"enumerated\" clause is the language of\n   \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) that lists particular offenses that are violent felonies. The Supreme Court expressly stated that its holding with respect to the residual clause does not call into question the ACCA's application to the four enumerated offenses or to the remainder of the definition of a violent felony in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.
