(\"FRA\"), a law firm, for allegedly violating the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\"). The case is before the Court on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. For the reasons stated herein, Plaintiff's Motion (Dkt. No. 28) is granted and Defendant's Motion (Dkt. No. 31) is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     UNDISPUTED FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises from a notice sent from FRA and received by Plaintiff on March 7, 2017 (\"Notice\") (Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s Statement of Facts (\"Def. SOF\") \u00b6 9, Dkt. No. 39.) During the relevant time, Plaintiff owned a property at North Old Creek Court, in Gurnee, Illinois. (Def. SOF \u00b6 5.) The property is a single-family home run by the Brookside Village Neighborhood Association (\"Association\"), which has the ability to charge monthly assessments. (SOF \u00b6 6.) On October 23, 2015, Plaintiff filed for bankruptcy, and in February 2016, the bankruptcy court entered a bankruptcy discharge. (Def. SOF \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.) Among the discharged debt was a debt held by the Association for dues. (Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Statement of Facts (\"Pl. SOF\") \u00b6 5, Dkt. No. 38.) FRA was aware at the time it sent the Notice that Plaintiff's dues debt to the Association had been discharged. (Pl. SOF \u00b6 8.) On March 7, 2017, FRA sent the Notice, which Plaintiff subsequently received. (Pl. SOF \u00b6 9.) The Notice sought to collect a debt to the Association. (Def.'s Reply to Pl.'s Statement of Additional Facts (\"Pl. SOAF\") \u00b6 14, Dkt. No. 46.) The parties dispute whether the debt sought was Plaintiff's dues debt. (Pl. SOAF \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are derived from the Notice itself and are thus undisputed. The Notice begins with a header providing: \"THIS COMMUNICATION IS FROM A DEBT COLLECTOR. THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO COLLECT A DEBT. ANY AND ALL INFORMATION OBTAINED WILL BE USED FOR THAT PURPOSE.\" (Notice, Ex. A to Def. SOF, Dkt. No. 39.) The title of the Notice states, \"IN REM NOTICE AND DEMAND FOR POSSESSION.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Notice's address block includes the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   36205 North Old Creed Court\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   c/o Joy Ellison\n   and All Unknown Occupants\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   36205 North Old Creek Court\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Gurnee, IL 60031\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The body of the Notice includes three paragraphs. The first begins by stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   THIS IS THE PROPERTY'S NOTICE ... that the property is in default of its ongoing obligation due to Brookside Village Neighborhood Association in the sum of $4,100.00 for its proportionate share of the expenses ... lawfully agreed upon due and owing at least in part since 02/01/2011, as well as the sum of $265.02 in legal fees and costs in attempting to collect this account, for a total sum of $4,365.02.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Notice thereafter warns that the Association will demand possession of the property upon expiration of the Notice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The second paragraph states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   This is its NOTICE that payment in full of the amount stated above is demanded of the property and that, unless its payment of the FULL AMOUNT is made on or before the expiration of thirty-four (34) days after the date of mailing of this Notice, THE ASSOCIATION MAY SEEK TO TERMINATE ANY RIGHT TO POSSESSION OF THE PREMISES.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) That paragraph concludes that \"[i]f the debt is disputed as discussed below, this office will suspend its efforts to collect the debt until the information is mailed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Finally, the third paragraph asserts, in all caps, the manner in which the debt may be disputed, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   UNLESS YOU NOTIFY THIS OFFICE WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER RECEIVING THIS NOTICE THAT YOU DISPUTE THE VALIDITY OF THIS DEBT OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, THIS OFFICE WILL ASSUME THIS DEBT IS VALID. IF YOU NOTIFY THIS OFFICE IN WRITING ... THAT YOU DISPUTE THE VALIDITY OF THIS DEBT ... THIS OFFICE WILL OBTAIN VERIFICATION OF THE DEBT ... IF YOU REQUEST OF THIS OFFICE ... [IT] WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH THE NAME AND ADDRESS OF THE ORIGINAL CREDITOR ... IF YOU DISPUTE THE DEBT WITHIN THE 30 DAY PERIOD, THIS OFFICE WILL SUSPEND EFFORTS TO COLLECT THE DEBT UNTIL THE INFORMATION IS MAILED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Upon receiving the Notice, Plaintiff consulted her attorneys. (Pl. SOAF \u00b6 13.) Plaintiff also sent a letter to FRA and the Association to inform them that the debt had been discharged in bankruptcy. (Pl. SOAF \u00b6 17.) The extent to which Plaintiff was confused or misled by the Notice is disputed. (Pl. SOF \u00b6\u00b6 19, 21.) The parties also dispute whether the Notice was an attempt to collect a debt from Plaintiff, individually, or from the property. (Pl. SOF \u00b6 9.) On March 23, 2017, Plaintiff commenced this lawsuit (Def. SOF \u00b6 16), alleging that the Notice was misleading in violation of \u00a7 1692e and \u00a7 1692g of the FDCPA. (Compl. \u00b6 31.) Finally, in August 2017, FRA filed a lawsuit in state court against the 36205 North Old Creek Court property which named Ellison as defendant. (Pl. SOAF \u00b6 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Section 1692e bars debt collectors from using \"any false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e. In particular, \u00a7 1692e(2) prohibits the false representation of,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"the character, amount, or legal status of any debt\"; \u00a7 1692e(5) prohibits the \"threat to take any action that cannot legally be taken or that is not intended to be taken\"; and \u00a7 1692e(10) prohibits the \"use of any false representation or deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect any debt or to obtain information concerning a consumer.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2), (5), (10). Finally, \u00a7 1692g provides that \"[w]ithin five days after the initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt, a debt collector shall ... send the consumer a written notice containing the amount of debt[.]\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court notes that Plaintiff brings two claims against Defendant: one under \u00a7 1692g for allegedly \"misstating the amount ... for which [P]laintiff is personally liable\" (Compl. \u00b6 31), and another under \u00a7 1692e for allegedly \"not identifying what amounts she is personally liable for\" (Compl. \u00b6 31.) However, the Court finds that \u00a7 1692g is inapplicable to Plaintiff's allegations. Section 1692g imposes a procedural requirement for debt collectors the purpose of which is to ensure debtors are provided with the necessary information to dispute a debt, not to hold debt collectors accountable for misstated debt amounts. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jenkins v.

Ill. 1998) (recognizing that Congress passed \u00a7 1692g to \"ensure that consumers have a fair chance to dispute and demand verification of their debt\"). The more appropriate vehicle for Plaintiff's claim is \u00a7 1692e. Because the core of Plaintiff's claim in both instances is the false or misleading representation of the purportedly owed debt, the Court will proceed only with a \u00a7 1692e analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   For the FDCPA to apply, certain threshold requirements must be met: (1) the defendant must qualify as a \"debt collector\"; and (2) the debt collector must have made a communication to a consumer \"in connection with the collection of any debt.\"\n   <em>\n    Heyer v. Pierce &amp; Assoc., P.C.\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-c-854,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%2075739\">\n    2017 WL 75739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 9, 2017) (citation omitted),\n   <em>\n    reconsideration denied\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-c-854,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202404978\">\n    2017 WL 2404978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Ill. June 2, 2017). The FDCPA defines a \"debt collector\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   any person who uses an instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in\n   any business the principle purpose of which is the collection of any debts, or who regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6). Here, the undisputed facts show that FRA is a debt collector. The Notice explicitly states, \"THIS COMMUNICATION IS FROM A DEBT COLLECTOR. THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO COLLECT A DEBT.\" The forthcoming analysis will thus focus on the second prong-whether FRA made a communication in connection to debt collection-and, more specifically, whether the communication was misleading in violation of \u00a7 1692e of the FDCPA. Because the parties' arguments tend to repeat and overlap, to the extent that FRA disputes being a \"debt collector,\" the Court will address that argument alongside the other arguments below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff maintains that she is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because FRA sent Plaintiff a confusing and misleading notice that was made in connection with the collection of a debt in violation of \u00a7 1692e.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   FRA has also advanced a number of arguments for why judgment as a matter of law should be entered in its favor. Those arguments include: (1) Plaintiff is not a \"consumer\" for purposes of the FDCPA; (2) the Notice was not made in connection with the collection of a debt; (3) the Notice was not misleading, but accurately explained what needed to be done to avoid losing possession; and (4) the Notice complied with Illinois state law governing evictions and interpreting the Notice to violate the FDCPA would thus raise constitutional concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Plaintiff as a \"Consumer\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   FRA argues that Plaintiff cannot as a matter of law establish an FDCPA violation because she is not a \"consumer\" pursuant to the statute. A consumer is \"any natural person obligated or allegedly obligated to pay any debt.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(3). As such, FRA contends that Plaintiff is not \"obligated to pay any debt\" because of her February 2016 bankruptcy discharge. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The FDCPA \"provides relief for debtors as well as non-debtors, provided no limitation in scope is stated within the specific provision on which the plaintiff's allegations are based.\"\n   <em>\n    Swearingen v.

Section 1692e does not contain any language that infers such a limitation in scope-let alone the word \"consumer\"-and Plaintiff need not be \"obligated to pay\" in order to bring this suit. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(3) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flowers v.

Ill. Apr. 30, 1997). FRA's argument thus fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Therefore, Court finds that, as a matter of law, FRA is not entitled to summary judgment on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Notice in Connection with the Collection of Any Debt\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   FRA next contends that the Notice was not made in connection with the collection of any debt pursuant to \u00a7 1692e. Plaintiff argues otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As mentioned, \u00a7 1692e provides that \"[a] debt collector may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means\n   <em>\n    in connection with the collection of any debt.\n   </em>\n   \" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e (emphasis added). The Seventh Circuit has noted that \"[n]either this circuit nor any other has established a bright-line rule for determining whether a communication from a debt collector was made in connection with the collection of any debt.\"\n   <em>\n    Gburek v. Litton Loan Servicing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3706383\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/614/380/#p384\">\n    614 F.3d 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 384 (7th Cir. 2010). However, the Seventh Circuit has suggested considering the following factors: (1) whether the payment is demanded, (2) whether the communication was made to induce a debtor to settle a debt, and (3) the relationship between the parties.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3706383\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/614/380/#p384\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The undisputed facts show that the Notice demanded payment. As provided, the Notice states, \"payment in full of the amount stated above is\n   <em>\n    demanded\n   </em>\n   of the property.\" (Notice, Ex. A to Def. SOF.) Nevertheless, FRA argues that the Notice did not demand payment from Ellison,\n   <em>\n    personally.\n   </em>\n   To support its position, FRA points out that the Notice was titled \"In Rem Notice and Demand for Possession\"; began by stating \"THIS IS THE PROPERTY'S NOTICE\"; and specified that \"payment in full of the amount stated above is demanded of the property[.]\" These facts, however, do not negate a demand for payment. In fact, they demonstrate the opposite. The Notice explicitly demands payment and specifies an amount-$4,365.02. This is sufficient to show that payment was demanded. FRA's argument that the Notice demanded payment not from Plaintiff but rather from the property is pertinent only to discuss whether the Notice was misleading. As such, the Court will return to this argument in the subsequent section. For now, FRA's argument fails to show that payment was not demanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Next, the undisputed facts also show that the Notice was sent to induce a debtor to settle a debt. As already discussed, the Notice demanded payment. The Notice specified a default in the sum of $4,100.00 and threatened that \"unless ... payment of the FULL AMOUNT is made,\" the \"ASSOCIATION MAY SEEK TO TERMINATE ANY RIGHT TO POSSESSION OF THE PREMISES.\" (Notice, Ex. A to Def. SOF.) Moreover, the Notice provided that \"UPON EXPIRATION OF THIS NOTICE, THE ASSOCIATION HEREBY DEMANDS POSSESSION OF THE\" property. (Notice, Ex. A to Def. SOF.) The Notice also contains language asserting that if Plaintiff disputed the debt, the FRA would \"suspend its efforts\" to collect it. (Notice, Ex. A to Def. SOF;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alibrandi v. Fin. Outsourcing Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9109004\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/82/#p88\">\n    333 F.3d 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 88 (2nd Cir. 2003) (finding that the inclusion of FDCPA warnings, albeit not conclusive, evidenced that the debt collector believed itself to be undertaking debt collection).) The Court finds that the Notice's threat to terminate any rights to possession of the property and to then demand possession of the property, along with its inclusion of warnings constitute language designed to induce a debtor to settle the debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Finally, the Court turns to the relationship between the parties. FRA contends that Plaintiff's relationship with the Association indicates that the letter was not sent in connection with debt collection. Plaintiff's relationship with the Association, however, is not the correct point of inquiry. The Court must look to the relationship between the\n   <em>\n    parties\n   </em>\n   : in this case, Plaintiff Ellison and FRA.\n   <em>\n    Gburek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3706383\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/614/380/#p384\">\n    614 F.3d at 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The relationship between Plaintiff and FRA resembles that of debtor and collector. Plaintiff failed to pay certain amounts to her neighborhood Association, and the Association, in return, sought\n   FRA's assistance in collecting debts. However, the parties' dispute whether the Notice was intended to collect a debt from Plaintiff, individually. The precise nature of the relationship between Plaintiff and FRA is thus unclear. Nevertheless, weighing all of the above factors, the Court finds that FRA's Notice was sent in connection with the collection of a debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Notwithstanding the above, FRA contends that the Notice was sent merely to retake a security, not to collect a debt.

First, the letter was addressed to \"36205 North Old Creek Court\" and provides \"c/o Joy Ellison and All Unknown Occupants\" directly underneath. FRA argues that this disposition clearly informs the unsophisticated consumer that the Notice was sent to the property \"care of\" the specified individuals.

Sept. 10, 2014) (\"The least sophisticated consumer would have known, after reading the entirety of the letter, that Defendant sought to collect a debt on behalf of [a creditor.]\"). Here, the Notice, taken as a whole, is confusing to the unsophisticated consumer, regardless of having repeated references to the \"property.\" The \"unsophisticated consumer\" would not necessarily know or understand the Latin phrase \"In Rem\" nor that the disposition of the\n   address and Plaintiff's name demonstrate that contents of the Notice are directed to the property and not the individual recipient therein. The Notice repeatedly references to \"you\"\n   <em>\n    in addition to\n   </em>\n   \"the property,\" which might confuse the recipient into thinking she must act in some way to address the debt, regardless of whether she individually owes it. The Notice was thus misleading and confusing on its face. Therefore, in accord with the standard, no additional extrinsic evidence is required from Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   FRA nevertheless contends that, regardless of the Notice, Plaintiff was aware that she did not owe any debt given her bankruptcy discharge.

Here, the Notice implies that a debt was still payable. In fact, the Notice explicitly states that payment is due and expected within 34 days. Regardless of the bankruptcy discharge, an unsophisticated consumer, without further investigation, might still believe the debt remained payable. Although the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   was not confused about the debt, that is not to say that the unsophisticated consumer would not be confused if in a similar position.

Constitutional Concerns\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Finally, FRA argues that the Notice complied with Illinois' Forcible Entry and Detainer Act (\"FEDA\"), so finding the Notice violated the FDCPA would raise constitutional concerns. The Court is unsure of the parameters of these alleged constitutional concerns, as FRA fails to specify them in its briefing. Generally, FRA seems to allege that they are hamstrung and that there is no way to comply with both FEDA, which requires sending certain notices related to foreclosure proceedings, and the FDCPA. 735 ILCS 5/9. FRA contends that it should be able to enforce lien interests pursuant to FEDA without violating the FDCPA, and supports this proposition with the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Vien-Phuong Thi Ho v.

Nor can the Court find any such conflicts. While fulfilling FEDA requirements, a notice or letter can still be drafted in a way that violates the FDCPA. This happens to be the case for the Notice here. Regardless of whether the Notice complies with FEDA requirements, the Court finds that the Notice was misleading and could have been crafted in a way to avoid ambiguity and confusion, particularly by informing Plaintiff either that she was not liable for the debt or by specifying the amount, if any, she was still liable for post-bankruptcy discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Given the facts of this particular case, the Court sees no conflict in finding an FDCPA violation for the Notice even if the Notice complied with FEDA. FEDA maintains a statutory scheme separate from and not contradictory to the FDCPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vincent v.

Ill. 2013) (finding that FEDA \"does not render plaintiff's claim 'meritless' \" and FEDA has \"nothing to do with the confusion alleged by plaintiff\"). Here, FEDA requires that a notice \"give a condominium owner at least 30 days to satisfy the terms of the demand before an action is filed,\" state the amount of the demand, and provide the time for which the amount was initially due. 735 ILCS 5/9-104.1. These requirements can be met without violating the FDCPA. As such, the Court finds neither constitutional concerns nor conflicts between FEDA and the FDCPA in holding that, as a matter of law, the Notice was misleading in violation of \u00a7 1692e.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgement (Dkt.
