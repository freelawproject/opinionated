Upon resolution of the most recent round of motions to dismiss, only certain aspects of the sixth claim for relief remain. First, as mentioned, Plaintiffs allege that the named SRS Contractor Defendants caused substantial temperature-dependent mortality of winter-run and spring-run Chinook salmon by diverting and transferring water pursuant to the terms of the SRS Contracts in 2014 and 2015, without an appropriate permit under the ESA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   6SC \u00b6 204. Only two narrow aspects of the Section 9 claim remain pending against Reclamation: that Reclamation unlawfully \"took\" ESA-listed salmonids by (1) approving water transfers SRS Contractors to others in 2014 and 2015; and (2) by failing to require one SRS Contractor, the Glenn Colusa Irrigation District (\"GCID\"), to divert a certain volume of water from Stony Creek, rather than directly from the Sacramento River, during those same years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NRDC v.

They divert water at their own diversion facilities located upstream from the Delta. The SRS Contractors claim the right to divert a significant portion of the water ... available for appropriation in the Sacramento River, particularly during the irrigation season (April through October).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The SRS Contractors became concerned that the construction of the CVP's Shasta Division would interfere with their pre-existing water rights and uses. Resolution of the dispute involved 20 years of negotiations, protracted technical studies, State of California and Congressional hearings, and intervention by representatives of the Secretary of the Interior.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Under Reclamation law, the Bureau had to obtain water rights permits from the State of California in order to operate the CVP. In Decision 990, the State Water Rights Board (the \"Board\"-a predecessor to the State Water Resources Control Board (\"SWRCB\") ) granted the Bureau permits to appropriate water from the Sacramento River, but directed the United States to reach a settlement agreement with the Sacramento River water users who held \"existing rights\" in the Sacramento River:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Throughout these proceedings, the Bureau's representatives have consistently affirmed their policy to recognize and protect all water rights on the Sacramento River and the Delta existing under State law at the times these applications were filed, including riparian, appropriative and others.... It is imperative, therefore, that the holders of existing rights and the United States reach agreement concerning those rights and the supplemental water required to provide the holders with a firm and adequate water supply, if a lengthy and extremely costly adjudication of the waters of the Sacramento River and its tributaries is to be avoided.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Decision 990, at 75 (emphasis added) ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Congress also urged the Bureau to reach an agreement with the SRS Contractors. In 1951, the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee issued a report recognizing the growing possibility of conflict between existing Sacramento River water users and the nascent CVP, urging the Bureau to avoid litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Engle, CVP Documents, Part I, S.

The SRS Contracts define the manner in which the parties agreed to administer their respective legal entitlements to Sacramento River water, to avoid conflict while preserving the rights of either party in any subsequent water right litigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Under the Settlement Contracts, the SRS Contractors continue to divert directly from the Sacramento River and its tributaries, with their own facilities, as they have historically done. However, the SRS Contracts ceded the Bureau some authority over the timing of the SRS Contractors' diversions. In exchange for the SRS Contractors giving up some of their flexibility in the timing of their diversions, the Bureau agreed to make stored water available to the Settlement Contractors during the lower flow (summer) months.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   It is undisputed that, historically, the execution of the SRS Contracts facilitated the Bureau's ability to operate the CVP, by providing the CVP with certainty as to the availability of water needed to schedule Project releases and deliveries throughout each water year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Nat.

BOR 7695. The NMFS BiOp provides additional, helpful background information:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Alterations to the natural hydrologic systems of the Sacramento and San Joaquin River basins began in the late 1800s, accelerating in the early 1900s, including the construction of three dams owned and operated by Reclamation, a fourth dam owned and operated by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), and a multitude of pumps and hundreds of miles of gravity-fed water diversions constructed and operated by private water users and by Reclamation and DWR. None of the major dams were constructed with fish ladders to pass anadromous fish and, as a result, salmon and steelhead have effectively been blocked from accessing the upper reaches of the basin. Beginning in 1993, Shasta and Keswick Dam releases on the upper Sacramento River have been managed to provide cold water to the spawning habitat below Keswick Dam as per requirements of NMFS' winter-run biological opinion on the operations of the CVP and SWP.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   BOR 7626.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The NMFS BiOp further indicates that winter-run and spring-run are dependent, at least in part, upon sufficiently cold temperatures during certain periods of the year to ensure successful egg incubation and development. BOR 8185, 8279. In light of these and other findings, the NMFS BiOp concludes that, unless modified, the long-term operation of the CVP/SWP is likely to jeopardize the continued existence and adversely modify critical habitat for winter-run and spring-run. BOR 8170. However, NMFS set forth an RPA which NMFS \"believes would enable the project to go forward in compliance with the ESA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In introducing the RPA, which is wide-ranging and impacts many aspects of CVP/SWP operations, including in ways not directly relevant to this ruling, NMFS indicates:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Water operations result in elevated water temperatures that have lethal and sub-lethal effects on egg incubation and juvenile rearing in the upper Sacramento River. The immediate operational cause is lack of sufficient cold water in storage to allow for cold water releases to reduce downstream temperatures at critical times and meet other project demands. This elevated temperature effect is particularly pronounced in the Upper Sacramento for winter-run and mainstem spring-run .... The RPA includes a new year-round storage and temperature management program for Shasta Reservoir and the Upper Sacramento River, as well as long-term passage prescriptions at Shasta Dam and re-introduction of winter-run into its native habitat in the McCloud and/or Upper Sacramento rivers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   BOR 8171-72. The RPA describes an entire suite of actions addressing \"Shasta Operations\" in Action Suite I.2, the introduction of which helps set the stage for the dispute in this case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Maintaining suitable temperatures for egg incubation, fry emergence, and juvenile rearing in the Sacramento River is critically important for survival and recovery of the winter-run ESU. The winter-run ESU has been reduced to a single population, which has been blocked from its historical range above Shasta Dam. Consequently, suitable temperatures and habitat for this population must be maintained downstream of Shasta Dam through management of the cold water pool behind the dam in the summer. Maintaining optimum conditions for this species below Shasta is crucial until additional populations are established in other habitats or this population is restored to its historical range. Spring-run are also affected by temperature management actions from Shasta Reservoir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   The effects analysis in this Opinion highlights the very challenging nature of maintaining an adequate cold water pool in critically dry years, extended dry periods, and under future conditions, which will be affected by increased downstream water demands and climate change. This suite of actions is designed to ensure that Reclamation uses maximum discretion to reduce adverse impacts of the projects to winter-run and spring-run in the Sacramento River by maintaining sufficient carryover storage and optimizing use of the cold water pool. In most years, reservoir releases through the use of the [temperature control device] are a necessity in order to maintain the bare minimum population levels necessary for survival (Yates et al. 2008, Angilletta et al. 2008).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   The effects analysis in this Opinion, and supplemental information provided by Reclamation, make it clear that despite Reclamation's best efforts, severe temperature-related effects cannot be avoided in some years. The RPA includes exception procedures to deal with this reality. Due to these unavoidable adverse effects, the RPA also specifies other actions that Reclamation must take, within its existing authority and discretion, to compensate for these periods of unavoidably high temperatures. These actions include restoration of habitat at Battle Creek that may be support a second population of winter-run, and a fish passage program at Keswick and Shasta dams to partially restore winter-run to their historical cold water habitat.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   BOR 8185-86. The RPA sets as one of the primary goals of Action Suite I.2 ensuring \"a sufficient cold water pool to provide suitable temperatures for winter-run spawning between Balls Ferry and Bend Bridge in most years, without sacrificing the potential for cold water management in a subsequent year,\" while acknowledging that other actions are needed to compensate for \"increased vulnerability of the population to temperature effects\" attributable to various factors. BOR 8186.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Important to this case is Action 1.2.4's call for Reclamation to develop and implement an annual \"Temperature Management Plan,\" to \"manage the cold water supply within Shasta Reservoir and to make cold water releases from Shasta Reservoir and Spring Creek to provide \"suitable temperatures for listed species ....\" BOR 8196.

In addition, also in the spring of 2014, Reclamation designated for transfer certain volumes of SRS Contract water to other water users. PSUF # 148. Some of this water was transferred in the months of designation, while other volumes were designated as transfer water but delivery was deferred to other months.

Taking the more 5 conservative numbers related to transfer water discussed above (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , counting only water that was 6 actually released for transfer, rather than all water designated for transfer) during that time period, the 7 total released \"to satisfy the SRS Contractors\" nonetheless exceeded 880,000 AF.

Yet, as the\n   <em>\n    Sweet Home\n   </em>\n   Court acknowledges, Congress intended \"take\" to be interpreted in \"the broadest possible terms.\" The Court also notes that at least one of the concerns underpinning the \"cautionary\" mandate of\n   <em>\n    Paroline\n   </em>\n   is arguably unique to the restitution context, namely the fact that an expansive causation pathway in that context would undermine the \"bedrock principle that restitution should reflect the consequences of the defendant's own conduct.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706995\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/434/#p444\">\n    572 U.S. at 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706995,12579853\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1710/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, what Footnote 13 of\n   <em>\n    Sweet Home\n   </em>\n   seems most concerned with is avoiding the dissent's concern over imposing \"strict liability\" upon \"routine\" activities of landowners (e.g., farming, ranching, roadbuilding, construction and logging). This is avoided by requiring every cause to be\n   <em>\n    proximate\n   </em>\n   , not by imposing a strict \"but-for\" actual causation standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   On balance, the Court finds the most appropriate conclusion here is that strict but-for causation cannot be required under the circumstances. Any other finding would exclude categorically from Section 9 liability any party whose conduct is individually insignificant, but is collectively significant, no matter how foreseeable to each of the individual actors the collective consequences of their actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   This conclusion finds support in the 1999 Federal Register notice promulgating an NMFS definition of \"harm\" substantially identical to the FWS definition upheld in\n   <em>\n    Sweet Home\n   </em>\n   several years earlier.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   NMFS indicated that a \"principal purpose\" of promulgating the definition \"is to provide clear notification to parties that habitat modification or degradation may harm listed species and, therefore, constitute a 'take' under the ESA.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20Fed.%20Reg.%2060727\">\n    64 Fed.

NMFS' definition of \"harm\" is consistent with the views articulated in the opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Sweet Home v. Babbitt\n   </em>\n   . In that opinion, the Court did not limit its discussion to a single term of art for the causal links necessary to show \"harm\" to a species resulting from habitat modification. The specific elements of causation to be proved, including foreseeability, will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Further, this document and the examples discussed in it, are intended to provide the public with information about activities which may result in injury or death of listed species. In NMFS' view, it is reasonably foreseeable that these activities and similar activities may injure or kill fish and wildlife, including listed species. While an action \"harms\" a listed species only if it actually results in the death or injury of a listed species, NMFS continues to encourage members of the public to consult with its staff whenever an activity is undertaken in the habitat of listed species and/or when listed species are present.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60,729-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Another comment on the proposed rule expressed concern that \"it is very difficult to determine when and whether modifications to aquatic habitat will injure fish. Sometimes it is activities occurring upstream from the apparent injury and sometimes it is simply cumulative degradation of the fish habitat.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60,728. NMFS responded by agreeing \"that sometimes it is difficult to isolate factors causing\n   injury to listed species,\" and offered the following guidance:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   All factors that reasonably could have caused the habitat modification or the injury itself must be carefully examined. Whenever an action alone or in combination with, or in concert with other actions is reasonably certain to injure or kill listed species, it will constitute a take. An action which contributes to injury can be a \"take\" even if it is not the only cause of the injury. This concept includes actions reasonably certain to contribute to the death or injury of listed species by significantly impairing the essential behavioral patterns of listed species.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60,728.

The Court could take many dozens of pages (and many additional months) to meticulously review the record as to all the various steps in the causal chain outlined by Plaintiffs, but it is not required to do so. Rather, if there is a dispute as to any one of many fundamental lynchpins in the causal chain, summary judgment in inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Plaintiffs' central theory is that \"[b]ecause the SRS Contractors' diversions and transfers from the Sacramento River cause temperature-dependent mortality to winter-run and spring run-chinook eggs and fry,\" the SRS contractors and Reclamation are in violation of Section 9. ECF No. 1184 at 34, 39. According to Plaintiffs' own description of their case, one of the \"core\" facts fundamental to this theory is that in 2014 and 2015 \"the upper Sacramento River reached temperatures legal to listed Chinook salmon eggs and fry.\" ECF No 1247 at 29. Underpinning this factual assertion is Plaintiffs' position that maintaining water temperatures at or below 56\u00b0F is \"necessary to avoid substantial mortality to Chinook eggs and fry.\" ECF No. 1184 at 26. Plaintiffs' causal proof, at least for purposes of the present motion, depends heavily on evidence demonstrating that water temperatures at the various TCPs exceeded 56\u00b0F. While it is undisputed that Chinook salmon require \"cold\" water for successful egg incubation and embryo and alevin\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   development, PSUF # 110, the details and exact temperature requirements are disputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   There is significant record evidence to support Plaintiffs' position that significant mortality is likely at temperatures of 56\u00b0F and above. For example, a scientific paper by Martin,\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   attached to an NMFS review of Reclamation's 2016 preliminary temperature modeling indicated that \"up to around 54F\" there is \"no predicted mortality due to temperature,\" but \"above this critical temperature mortality rate increased rapidly; a week at 56F resulted in a loss of approximately 20% of the population, and a loss of 60% after a month.\" Poole Decl., Ex. 58 (ECF No. 1178-12), Enclosure 1, Attachment 1 at ECF page 15 of 23. It is notable that the NMFS BiOp adopted 56\u00b0F as the temperature compliance target in its RPA. There is also evidence in the record that supports Plaintiffs' position that temperatures below 50\u00b0F are \"optimal\" for egg incubation. Plaintiffs cite a March 18, 2018 memorandum from an NMFS fisheries biologist regarding Shasta temperature compliance in which that biologist summarizes research on the subject of the effects of water temperature on the development of incubating salmon eggs as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   The effects of water temperature in regulating developmental rates of incubating eggs are well documented (e.g., Hicks 2000, McCullough 1999). During incubation, water temperature affects the rate of embryo and alevin development, the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water, and, to a significant extent, the survival of early fry (Bjornn and Reiser 1991). Within an acceptable range, the higher the temperature is,\n   the faster the rate of development will be, and the shorter the incubation period and time to emergence (Beacham and Murray 1990). Temperatures from 39.2 to 53.6\u00b0F (4-12\u00b0C) tend to produce relatively high survival to hatching and emergence, with approximately 42.8-50\u00b0F (6-10\u00b0C) being optimum. Exposure to temperatures above the optimal range results in sub-lethal or chronic effects (e.g., decreased juvenile growth, which results in smaller, more vulnerable fish; increased susceptibility to disease which can lead to mortality; and decreased ability to compete and avoid predation), as temperatures rise until at some point they become lethal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Poole Decl., Ex. 58 (ECF No. 1178-12), Enclosure 1 at ECF page 6 of 23. In a 2016 document, NMFS identified the \"Martin model\" as \"NMFS's Southwest Fisheries Science Center's ... new temperature-dependent mortality model,\" and acknowledged that it identified 53.7\u00b0F as the \"critical temperature at which temperature-related winter-run egg and fry mortality increases significantly with increasing water temperatures.\" Poole Decl., Ex. 71 (ECF No. 1178-25) at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   The Martin study also provides support for one of Plaintiffs' more important factual assertions: that substantial numbers of eggs failed to successfully hatch in 2014 and 2015 because of temperatures observed during those periods of time. Poole Decl., Ex. 58, Enclosure 1, Attachment 1 at ECF page 15 of 23 (\"Although in many years temperature had little influence on [egg-to-fry (\"ETF\") ] survival, in the years it did affect survival, the impact was substantial. Most notably, in 2014 and 2015 temperature dependent mortality alone resulted in a loss of ~77% and 85% of the population. When combined with background survival, this resulted in the extremely low ETF survival both predicted and observed in these years (~5%).\"). Martin's \"temperature-dependent mortality model\" was used by NMFS to find that in 2014 and 2015, winter-run \"temperature dependent mortality alone resulted in a loss of approximately 77% and 85% of the population, respectively.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., Enclosure 1, at ECF page 4 of 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that \"[w]hile [the SRS Contractors] may quibble with the exact temperature that is \"optimal\" for egg and fry survival, [they] cannot and do not dispute that warmer water temperatures result in mortality (and thus take).\" ECF No. 1247 at 29. After careful examination of the record, applying the standard of decision applicable on summary judgment, the Court concludes that the SRS Contractors have presented a material dispute, not just a quibble. The SRS Contractors' defense expert, Bradley Cavallo, who submitted a declaration in opposition to Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, points out that at least one panel of experts, the Delta Stewardship Council Independent Review Panel, has questioned foundational assumptions underpinning the Martin study, calling into question the extent to which it can be applied with precision in the field.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Bradley Cavallo (\"Cavallo Decl.\") (ECF No. 1223) \u00b6 13. Mr. Cavallo points to studies that indicate normal embryo development can take place at temperatures up to 57\u00b0F. Cavallo Decl. \u00b6 13. Mr. Cavallo also highlights a 2006 study by Geist,\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   , which reported no significant differences in survival of Chinook salmon embryos between 55.4 and 61.7\u00b0F, assuming certain background dissolved oxygen levels, with rapid declines in survival occurring\n   <em>\n    over 61.7\u00b0F\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1493414\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/153/#p164\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It is Mr. Cavallo's position that research indicating \"lower thermal tolerance\" is not supported by the data, in part because the relevant research did not measure dissolved oxygen levels, which Geist found to interact with temperature\n   levels.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1493414\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/153/#p164\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Nothing in the record suggests Mr. Cavallo's opinion is inadmissible or otherwise entirely invalid or irrelevant. So, what the SRS Contractors contend (and have supported with some evidence) is that temperature-related mortality may not actually occur until considerably higher temperatures than Plaintiffs suggest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Even if Plaintiffs are correct that that \"warmer temperatures result in mortality (and thus take),\" Plaintiffs' Section 9 claim requires a showing of proximate cause. As presented in the pending motions, Plaintiffs' proximate cause case against all Defendants turns in large part on actual temperature measurements during 2014 and 2015. But, in 2014, daily average temperatures never reached 61.7\u00b0F during the entire temperature management season, with average temperatures staying below 56\u00b0F for May, June, and July, reaching 56.1\u00b0 for August, 58.5\u00b0F for September, and 61.0\u00b0 for October. (Notably, the RPA's protections for winter-run do not extend into October, BOR 8196, and the level of temperature-dependent mortality to spring-run is not as well documented in the present record as it is for winter-run.) In 2015, daily average temperatures were 55.2\u00b0F in May, 57.3\u00b0F in June, 57.1\u00b0F in July, 56.9\u00b0F in August, 56.7\u00b0F in September, and 56.8\u00b0F in October. Assuming the truth of the evidence submitted by Mr. Cavallo and viewing that evidence in a light most favorable to Defendants, as this Court\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   on summary judgment, there is a hole in Plaintiffs' causal chain because the upper Sacramento River never reached temperatures lethal to listed Chinook. For purpose of summary judgment, the Court\n   <em>\n    may not weigh the relative value of these competing threads of information\n   </em>\n   . In other words, at this stage, this is not about which side's evidence represents the most up-to-date or even the more compelling interpretation of existing scientific information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   While it is compelling that relevant agencies, including Reclamation, concluded there was significant temperature related mortality in 2014 and 2015, these conclusions seem to be based, at least in part, on the Martin model.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Poole Decl., Ex. 58, Enclosure 1.

More generally, the Notice Letter informed Reclamation that Reclamation was unlawfully taking winter-run and spring-run Chinook and that the cause of the take was Reclamation's failure to conserve enough cold water to maintain temperature control of the upper Sacramento River during salmon spawning and rearing, the primary cause of which was meeting the demands of the SRS Contractors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1247 at 36 (citing 6SC, Ex. 6 at 13-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   The distinction at issue-between non-discretionary deliveries to the SRS Contractors under the SRS Contract's on the one hand and Reclamation's discretionary actions in connection with approving the transfer of certain volumes of SRS Contract water to other water users on the other-is a subtle one. As mentioned, in a previous order, the Court narrowed Reclamation's potential take liability to a subset of the discretionary actions Reclamation can take in connection with the SRS contracts, including transfer approvals.\n   <em>\n    NRDC v. Norton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268281\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/236/1198/#p1203\">\n    236 F.Supp.3d at 1240-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This narrowing was triggered by Federal Defendants' motion to dismiss, in which they argued that the Section 9 claim against Reclamation must be dismissed because Reclamation cannot, as a matter of law, be the proximate cause of any take that occurs as a result of the agency implementing a legally mandated water delivery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1069 at 50. The Court agreed with this general proposition, finding \"that a federal agency that is legally required to take an action pursuant to federal law, such as by implementing non-discretionary terms in an otherwise valid water delivery contract, that agency cannot be the proximate cause of Section 9 take by undertaking that non-discretionary action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55-56. But, the claim was permitted to proceed against Reclamation based upon a subset of water deliveries over which Reclamation does retain discretion. This narrowing process does not automatically pull the remaining subset of claims outside the scope of the allegation made in the Notice Letter. The Notice Letter encompassed\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   releases to satisfy SRS Contractor demands, whether those releases be discretionary (e.g., water transfer approvals) or non-discretionary. That Reclamation successfully asserted a defense (lack of discretion) against liability for certain releases does not mean the Notice Letter failed to provide Reclamation with sufficient information about Plaintiffs' theory that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   releases (including releases to implement\n   Reclamation -approved transfers) were a violation of the ESA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   The Court sees Plaintiffs' Stony Creek theory differently. That theory arises from a provision in the contract between Reclamation and GCID, one of the SRS Contractors, that on its face authorizes Reclamation to require GCID to divert up to 20,315 AF of its contract total from Stony Creek instead of from the Sacramento River.\n   <em>\n    NRDC v. Norton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268281\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/236/1198/#p1203\">\n    236 F.Supp.3d at 1240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs describe their theory of take liability under this provision as follows in their supplemental brief: \"If [Reclamation] had exercised its authority to require Stony Creek diversions in 2014 and 2015, that could have resulted in approximately 20,000 [AF] less of water released to the Sacramento River each year.\" ECF No. 1267 at 5. This is indisputably a theory based upon Reclamation's\n   <em>\n    failure to require GCID to divert water from somewhere other than the Sacramento River\n   </em>\n   . Nothing in the Notice Letter puts Reclamation on notice that it might face such a claim. The Notice Letter speaks to \"excessive reservoir releases\" to satisfy SRS Contractor demands. Notice Letter at 17. It mentions \"Reclamation's decision to make large early releases in 2014, and its resultant failure to maintain adequate temperature control.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. While transfers are a species of such releases, the Stony Creek theory is a different beast entirely. The Notice Letter nowhere mentions that Reclamation had any authority to require SRS Contractors to use alternative sources of supply, nor does it mention Stony Creek or the relevant GCID contract provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Accordingly, Federal Defendants' motion to dismiss based upon failure to comply with the ESA's 60-day notice provision is DENIED as to the transfer theory and GRANTED as to the Stony Creek theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   <strong>\n    d.\n    <em>\n     Past v.

(ECF No. 1210-1 at 33-34.)

FDR # 148; ECF No. 1210-1 at 37 n.25 (Federal Defendants admitting more than 40,000 AF of water was transferred in April through June 2014). In total, Reclamation approved at least 100,000 AF of SRS Contractor transfers by the end of September 2014. BOR 10859. Likewise, in 2015, Reclamation approved for transfer more than 200,000 AF of water in 2015, with some volume (again not\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   ) of that water being released for actual transfer in the early months of the temperature management season (May, June, and/or July). FDR # 181 (indicating Plaintiffs were incorrect to assert certain volumes of water were actually transferred during May, June, and July 2015, but declining to offer alternative numbers, referring the Court instead to ambiguous documents in the AR); SRSR # 181 (indicating that no water was actually transferred in 2015 until July and appearing\n   to concede at least 38,000 AF was transferred in July); BOR 19271-76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   The Parties also dispute whether, in the absence of Reclamation approval, the overall volume of water subject to transfer would have remained in storage. Federal Defendants suggest it is pure speculation to assume that the SRS Contractors would not have otherwise used that water, and maintain that the absence of any such proof breaks the causal chain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1210-1 at 29. Federal Defendants have presented legal authority and evidence indicating that the SRS Contractors were not permitted to transfer water unless that water otherwise would have been used. First, Federal Defendants cite Section 3405(a)(1)(I) of the 1992 Central Valley Project Improvement Act (\"CVPIA\"), Pub. L. No. 102-575,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"336\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=106%20Stat.%204700\">\n    106 Stat. 4700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992), which limits transfers to \"water that would have been consumptively used or irretrievably lost to beneficial use during the year or years of the transfer.\" In addition, Federal Defendants cite an agreement between Reclamation, GCID, and the San Luis &amp; Delta-Mendota Water Authority \"To Provide for Additional Water from the Central Valley Project for 2014.\" BOR 10575-581. On the second page of that Agreement, GCID agreed to \"forbear up to a total of 16,500 acre-feet of [water] it would have otherwise diverted under the Settlement Contract for use on lands depicted on Exhibit 'B' of the Settlement Contract.\" BOR 10576. Reclamation found certain types of transfers (from GCID to lands contiguous to GICD) would not be detrimental to fisheries in the Sacramento River in part because \"GCID would only transfer water made available through an increase in its conservation of water, [as] there would be no change in the amount or timing of diversions from the Sacramento River as a result of this action.\" BOR 10352.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   In an environmental review of transfers to the Tehama-Colusa Canal Authority (not an SRS Contractor) from various willing sellers, including some SRS Contractors, Reclamation explained that transfers of this nature would take place through forbearance agreements such as the one described above. BOR 11242. Practically, the seller would either use groundwater substitution or crop idling/crop shifting to effectuate the forbearance. BOR 11243-244. With groundwater substitution, sellers would choose to pump groundwater in lieu of diverting surface water supplies, making surface water available for transfer. BOR 11243. Crop idling involves the seller forgoing planting on a particular parcel of land they otherwise would have placed into production; crop shifting involves shifting production from a higher water use crop to a lower water use crop. BOR 11244. Reclamation uses various methods to calculate how much water would be freed for transfer using these methods.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"337\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=106%20Stat.%204700\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It also appears that Reclamation uses a system of \"compliance checks\" to determine whether lands that were in production the year prior to the transfer actually are idled during the year of transfer. BOR 10775-784 (indicating transfers are subject to \"compliance checks on idled lands\" and including a table detailing specific parcels of SRS Contractor land, the crop planted the previous year, and the amount of water fallowing those parcels would free for transfer). The Court has examined several other transfer approval documents in the administrative record and notes that they too have requirements for compliance checks on idled lands.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , BOR 10785; BOR 10740; BOR 19428-43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   Plaintiffs present evidence that, if believed, demonstrates generally that the SRS Contractors do not use all of the water allocated to them each year. For example, in 2014 and 2015 the SRS Contractors diverted or transferred approximately\n   1.3 MAF of the 1.6 MAF allocated to them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Poole Decl., Exs. 6 (ECF No. 1176-7) (showing 2014 actual deliveries), 10 (ECF No. 1176-11) (showing 2015 monthly deliveries), 87 (ECF No. 1179-16) (showing 2015 water transfers). Water usage tables from 2014 and 2015 show that at least some SRS Contractors did not use all of their \"scheduled\" allocations in April, May, and June, even in those \"Critical\" years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Poole Decl., Ex. 133 (ECF No. 1181-12). Evidence from other years, including evidence discussed in the Court's request for supplemental briefing, shows that the SRS Contractors typically divert less than their full contract allocation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Poole Decl., Ex. 6 (ECF No. 1176-6) (showing total actual deliveries significantly under full contract amount even in 100% allocation years);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Second Poole Decl., Exs. 174-77 (ECF Nos. 1248-29 - 1248-32). Plaintiffs do not present direct evidence to call into question the direct evidence that Reclamation has a system in place to ensure transferred water\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   is water that would have been used during that water year. Nonetheless, Plaintiffs argue that, \"taking all inferences in Plaintiffs' favor, a reasonable conclusion is that the SRS Contractors would not have otherwise used the water they transferred in 2014 and 2015.\" ECF No. 1267 at 3. The inference the Court presumes Plaintiffs advance is this: the circumstantial evidence of the SRS Contractors routinely not using all their allocated water suggests that the process used to identify water \"available for transfer\" is a mirage that allows the SRS Contractors to identify water \"available for transfer\" even when it would not otherwise be used. But the connection between Plaintiffs' evidence and that ultimate inference is far from clear.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   To put it another way, even assuming it is true that SRS Contractors, including those who engaged in transfers in 2014 and 2015, routinely failed to use their full contract allocation in, how does this call into question the evidence suggesting all water transferred in 2014 and 2015 was specifically accounted for through groundwater substitution and/or crop idling/crop substitution? The Court finds that the record is seriously underdeveloped on this issue, making it extraordinarily difficult for the Court to determine whether a dispute of fact exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   The Court need not get all the way to the bottom of the above-described dispute, as Plaintiffs advance an alternative theory of liability. They argue that Reclamation could have conditioned the transfers in ways that would have avoided harm to the species. ECF No. 1184 at 39-40; ECF No. 1124 at 38. Specifically, Plaintiffs suggest that Federal Defendants could have insisted upon delaying all (instead of just some) transfers until later in the water year in 2014 and 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1247 at 39.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   Federal Defendants protest that this cannot form the basis of Section 9 liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1210-1 at 37. As mentioned, the FWS has defined the term \"harass\" (a form of \"take\") to include \"an intentional or negligent act or\n   <em>\n    omission\n   </em>\n   which creates the likelihood of injury to wildlife by annoying it to such an extent as to significantly disrupt normal behavioral patterns which include, but are not limited to, breeding, feeding, or sheltering.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"338\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2017.3\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Though FWS specifically removed the word \"omission\" from its regulatory definition of \"harm\" (another form of \"take\"), FWS explained in the Federal Register that the agency considers the term \"act\" in that definition to be \"inclusive of either commissions or omissions which would be prohibited by section 9.\" Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Final Redefinition of \"Harm\", 46 Fed. Reg 54,748 -01, 54,750 (Nov. 4, 1981). There is some authority to suggest that for an omission to form the basis of Section 9 liability, it must involve some kind of\n   <em>\n    duty\n   </em>\n   to act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.Y.

But, there is also authority to suggest that, at least for purposes of standing, the kind of \"duty\" that would require an agency to act in a manner that could benefit the species is broad enough to encompass Reclamation's conduct in this case. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Loggerhead Turtle v. Cty. Council of Volusia Cty., Fla.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"288317\" index=\"340\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/148/1231/#p1247\">\n    148 F.3d 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1247-53 (11th Cir. 1998), the Eleventh Circuit found that plaintiffs demonstrated a causal connection for standing purposes in a Section 9 case where it was asserted that a county had imposed minimum lighting restrictions on some but not other beach communities within the county's jurisdiction. The court found that the absence of such lighting restrictions was harmful to sea turtles nesting on the county's beaches.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"288317\" index=\"341\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/148/1231/#p1247\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"288317\" index=\"341\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/148/1231/#p1247\">\n    at 1238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Critically, the Eleventh Circuit found that the county had \"authority-and arguably a duty-to establish minimum standards\" for the protection of the turtles under the county charter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"288317\" index=\"342\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/148/1231/#p1247\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"288317\" index=\"342\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/148/1231/#p1247\">\n    at 1249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Parties have not thoroughly explored the relevant authorities, but for purposes of this motion the Court finds that Reclamation has a similar duty here under the CVPIA, which precludes Reclamation from approving a transfer that violates \"Federal law,\" which includes the ESA. CVPIA \u00a7 3405(H). Therefore, while the record does not clearly reveal a dispute of fact over whether the SRS Contractors would have otherwise used the entire volume of water approved for transfer, Plaintiffs have established that Reclamation failed to act to require that all of the transfer activity take place late in the temperature management season, despite arguably having an obligation to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   For purposes of standing, the remaining causal links are also proved to the degree required, keeping in mind that on summary judgment \"the causal connection put forward for standing purposes cannot be too speculative, or rely on conjecture about the behavior of other parties, but need not be so airtight ... as to demonstrate that plaintiffs would succeed on the merits.\"\n   <em>\n    Ocean Advocates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9180187\" index=\"343\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/402/846/#p859\">\n    402 F.3d at 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to evidence submitted by Plaintiffs, \"the volume of cold water available for real-time management in June through October is highly dependent on [ ] releases [from Keswick Reservoir] in April through early June.\" BOR 12569;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   BOR 8192 (NMFS BiOp RPA recognizing that releases in the spring can be critical to providing \"sufficient water to reduce adverse effects of high water temperatures in the summer months for winter-run ... \"). NMFS concluded in January 2015 that \"[t]he effects of limited cold water storage and loss of temperature control out of Keswick Dam from early September through the fall of 2014 led to substantial egg and fry mortality (Figure 1).\" BOR 13442 (regarding winter-run);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   BOR 13449 (indicating that the peak of spring-run \"spawning activity corresponded with the high Sacramento River temperatures downstream of Keswick Dam throughout the fall of 2014, and illustrates the potential for high egg and alevin mortality\" and noting that \"extremely few juvenile spring-run Chinook salmon have been observed this year migrating downstream ... \"). A February 2015 SWRCB Order indicated that \"[d]espite temperature modeling that indicated that temperatures could be maintained below 56 degrees throughout the 2014 temperature control season immediately below the dam under the conditions that existed last year, temperature control was lost several weeks before the end of the egg incubation life stage last year. As a result, the 2014 winter-run brood year (BY) is estimated to have experienced 95 percent mortality.\" BOR 13528. That SWRCB order similarly concluded that \"[s]pring-run eggs in the Sacramento River underwent significant, and potentially complete, mortality due to high water temperature downstream of Keswick Dam starting in early September when water temperatures exceeded 56 degrees Fahrenheit.\" BOR 13529.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   In contrast to the analysis related to Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, here, it must be assumed that Plaintiffs' evidence regarding the temperature needs of winter-run and spring-run are correct. In that light, temperatures above 56\u00b0F must be assumed to cause extensive egg mortality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   Although Federal Defendants argue that some of these statements may be misinterpreted if pulled out of context, FD # 164, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs, this is support not only for the assertion that early-season releases for the purposes of transfers contributed to the failure of temperature management, but also for the assertion that the loss of temperature control harmed winter-run and spring-run. Federal Defendants' admission that Reclamation actually released water to effectuate transfers of more than 40,000 AF in April through June 2014,\n   ECF No. 1210-1 at 37 n.25, plausibly suggests a causal link between\n   <em>\n    Reclamation's actions\n   </em>\n   and the ultimate results: loss of temperature control leading to harm to winter-run and spring-run. While this evidence is not undisputed, it is sufficiently compelling for purposes of this standing analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   To the extent the Court is required to separately evaluate whether the causal links are established for 2015, the result is the same. As mentioned, Plaintiffs assert, and for purposes of this motion the evidence supports, that Reclamation approved more than 100,000 AF of transfers in 2014. Of that, a certain portion (apparently 38,000 AF), was released for transfer in July, after which temperatures exceeded 56\u00b0F for the remainder of the temperature compliance season. BOR 13480-83. Even though Federal Defendants point to evidence that the temperature compliance requirements were changed (raised) during the latter part of the 2015 temperature compliance season, this is not dispositive of whether the higher temperatures caused take. By the end of the 2015 season, fisheries agencies estimated that winter-run Chinook egg and fry mortality had reached more than 97%. Poole Decl., Ex. 64 (ECF No. 1178-18) (NOAA Fisheries presentation indicating few winter-run eggs in 2015 survived due to \"very little cold water in Shasta to cool the upper Sacramento\"); Ex. 83 (ECF No. 1179-12) at 1, 3-4 (NMFS describing an 85% temperature dependent mortality to winter-run in 2015); Ex. 72 (ECF No. 1179-1) at 1 (indicating juvenile spring-run likely suffered higher than average mortalities in the mainstem Sacramento River).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   The Court is cognizant of Federal Defendants' argument that Reclamation's approvals of transfers actually delayed at least some water deliveries to later in the season, arguably providing some benefit to the species. However, reviewing the evidence in the manner required, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs plausibly have demonstrated a causal connection between their harm and those releases to fulfill transfer requests that were not delayed until the later months of the temperature compliance season.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   For purposes of this analysis, the Court does not need to get into the weeds of whether the loss of temperature control was the proximate cause of take. Rather, Plaintiffs must establish a plausible causal connection between the transfer approvals and concrete injury to their interests. Here, for the reasons set forth above, the causal chain is not speculative and harm is traceable to Federal Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   <strong>\n    (c)\n    <em>\n     Redressability\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   To satisfy the final requirement of Article III standing, \"it must be likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"344\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"345\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Federal Defendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that their injuries would be redressed by a favorable decision on the Section 9 claim against Reclamation because the transfers in question simply shift the timing and point of diversion of water.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1210-1 at 29 &amp; 31. Federal Defendants assert that \"[i]f Reclamation did not approve transfer of SRS water, Reclamation would have to release the water for diversion and use by the SRS Contractors\" which would \"only exacerbate the alleged harms, as it removes a tool Reclamation used in 2014 and 2015 to reduce impacts to salmonids.\" ECF No. 1252 at 15. This fails to acknowledge that while some of the approved transfers delayed transfer until late in the temperature management seasons - to the benefit of the species - other approved transfers were not delayed. The Court finds that Plaintiffs' harms could be\n   alleviated by enjoining Reclamation from approving water transfers under similar circumstances in the future. The obvious implication of this is that Reclamation could use its discretion to require transfers to be delayed until later in the temperature management season. While some SRS Contractors might refuse to transfer under those circumstances, reverting to using that water, the present record contains no evidence to suggest this would be a common, let alone universal, response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   Federal Defendants also argue that standing cannot be based on wholly past activity.

Any person who \"knowingly\" violates \u00a7 1538(a)(1)(B) is subject to criminal penalties under \u00a7 1540(b)(1) and civil penalties under \u00a7 1540(a)(1) ; moreover, under the latter section, any person \"who otherwise violates\" the taking prohibition (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , violates it unknowingly) may be assessed a civil penalty of $500 for each violation, with the stricture that \"[e]ach such violation shall be a separate offense.\" This last provision should be clear warning that the regulation is in error, for when combined with the regulation it produces a result that no legislature could reasonably be thought to have intended: A large number of routine private activities-for example, farming, ranching, roadbuilding, construction and logging-are subjected to strict-liability penalties when they fortuitously injure protected wildlife, no matter how remote the chain of causation and no matter how difficult to foresee (or to disprove) the \"injury\" may be (\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , an \"impairment\" of breeding).

That is not correct. Without the regulation, the routine \"habitat modifying\" activities that people conduct to make a daily living would not carry exposure to strict penalties; only acts directed at animals, like those described by the other words in \u00a7 1532(19), would risk liability.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-334\">\n    <em>\n     Sweet Home\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564389\" index=\"397\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/687/\">\n     515 U.S. at 721-22\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564389\" index=\"398\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/687/\">\n     115 S.Ct. 2407\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-335\">\n    As mentioned, NMFS interprets the term \"harm\" as \"an act which actually kills or injures fish or wildlife.

The Court notes that it is not clear what \"irretrievably lost to beneficial use\" means in this context, as that term is not defined or used elsewhere in the CVPIA, but that language does not seem to be the basis of any of the transfers at issue in 2014 and 2015.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"25\">\n   <p id=\"p-345\">\n    Plaintiffs try to portray this as something other than a challenge to agency inaction (or omission), by explaining that they are challenging affirmative decisions by Reclamation to approve the transfers, ECF No. 1247 at 39, but the Court finds it difficult to understand this theory of failure by Reclamation as anything other than an allegation of inaction or omission.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"26\">\n   <p id=\"p-346\">\n    It is unclear whether Federal Defendants' argument-that the causal chain is broken as to Reclamation because water approved for transfer would have been used by the transferee SRS Contractor in the absence of permission to transfer-applies in some measure to this alternative theory regarding the timing of transfers. In other words, it is possible that the record contains evidence (or that evidence could be elicited at trial) indicating that if Reclamation had insisted upon all transfers being delayed, some of the transfer agreements between willing SRS Contractor sellers and willing buyers would have fallen through, with the water reverting to being delivered under the SRS Contract, with timing set by those Contracts.
