The Court gave Gutierrez and the Federal Public Defender's Office ten days to propose redactions. Neither provided any proposed redactions. The Federal Public Defender's Office noted, however, that their investigator, Maclovia Guardiola, is a woman, but the Court had used masculine pronouns and honorifics for her in its original Memorandum Opinion and Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter from Federal Public Defender to the Honorable James O. Browning at 1 (dated May 4, 2018), filed May 4, 2018 (Doc. 128). In this Amended Memorandum Opinion and Order, the Court has changed the pronouns and honorifics accordingly.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-8\">\n   JAMES O. BROWNING, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court on the United States' Motion to Show\n   Cause, filed August 8, 2016 (Doc. 29)(\"Motion\"). The Court held hearings on August 19, 2016; September 6, 2016; and September 28, 2016. The primary issues are: (i) whether Defendant Darryl J. Gutierrez is financially qualified under the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A (\"CJA\"), to continue to receive the unpaid assistance of a Federal Public Defender; and (ii) whether, if Gutierrez is not financially qualified, he should be compelled to make partial payment for the Federal Public Defender's representation. The Court concludes that Gutierrez is not qualified under the CJA, largely because he has an $800,000.00 annuity to draw upon to pay an attorney. Accordingly, the Court determines that he should make a payment to the United States Department of the Treasury for his representation by the Federal Public Defender's Office. The Court grants the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FINDINGS OF FACT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Rule 12(d) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure states: \"When factual issues are involved in deciding a motion, the court must state its essential findings on the record.\" Fed.

Yarbrough at 1, filed December 2, 2015 (Doc. 5). Gutierrez was arraigned the following day, December 3, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Clerk's Minutes before Magistrate Judge Steven C. Yarbrough at 1, filed December 3, 2015 (Doc. 9). Judge Yarbrough released Gutierrez on his own recognizance,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Order Setting Conditions of Release at 1, filed December 3, 2015 (Doc. 11), and subsequently placed him under the pretrial supervision of United States Probation Officer Jeffrey Martinez-Spelich,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Officer Jeffrey Martinez-Spelich Added (entered December 7, 2015)(text-only entry).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     The Motion to Show Cause\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Plaintiff United States of America moves for an order to show cause why Gutierrez should continue to receive an Assistant Federal Public Defender's assistance without paying for that representation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 1. The United States' primary argument is that Gutierrez is not qualified for an Assistant Federal Public Defender's services, because, based on Gutierrez' income history and IRA funds, he is \"financially able to obtain counsel or to make partial payment for the representation.\" Motion at \u00b6 8, at 3. The United States adds that Gutierrez has the burden of establishing that he or she is financially unable to obtain an attorney, and that, if a court determines post-appointment of counsel that \"the person is financially able to obtain counsel or to make partial payment for the representation,\" a court \"may terminate the appointment of counsel or authorize payment ..., as the interests of justice may dictate.\" Motion \u00b6 7, at 3 (citing\n   CJA \u00a7 3006AI)(internal quotation marks omitted). The United States argues that, based on Gutierrez' financial situation, he is \"financially able to obtain counsel or to make partial payment for the representation.\" Motion \u00b6 8, at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In conclusion, the United States notes that Mr. Butcher, Gutierrez' appointed counsel, \"takes no position concerning whether [he] or other counsel should be appointed or whether any defendant should make payments to the CJA fund.\" Motion \u00b6 9, at 4. The United States notes that Mr. Butcher encourages the Court, however, to \"make sure that a licensed member of the bar ... continues to represent Mr. Gutierrez, if that is his desire.\" Motion \u00b6 9, at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The First Hearing\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Court held the first hearing on the Motion on August 19, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Transcript of Motion Proceedings at 1 (held on August 19, 2016), filed September 16, 2016 (Doc. 34)(\"First Tr.\"). Before reaching the Motion's merits, Gutierrez asserted that he wishes to maintain a traditional attorney/client relationship with Mr. Butcher and have Mr. Butcher participate in trial by conducting direct- and cross-examinations \"and things like that.\" First Tr. at 12:14-25 (Butcher). Turning to the merits, the United States largely reiterated the Motion's financial data about Gutierrez and argued that Gutierrez \"has a substantial amount of money,\" so his court-appointed attorney should be dismissed. First Tr. at 13:23-14:1 (Vierbuchen). The United States clarified that its familiarity with Gutierrez' financial situation is somewhat limited, however, because it had not seen a full version of Gutierrez' financial affidavit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Tr. at 15:5-18 (Vierbuchen).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Court turned to Gutierrez, asking whether he or Mr. Butcher opposed the United States viewing the financial disclosure form that Gutierrez executed for probation and Judge Yarbrough.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Tr. at 15:19-23 (Court). In response, Mr. Butcher stated that, because \"the Office of the Federal Defender takes no position to whether we should be appointed,\" he had no position with respect to the disclosure of Gutierrez' finances for purposes of the hearing. First Tr. at 15:24-16:5 (Butcher). Mr. Butcher also asserted, however, that Gutierrez' financial disclosure should not be admitted at trial; instead, he encouraged the Court to conduct an in-camera inspection of the document.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Tr. at 16:8-12 (Butcher). The Court interjected, proposing that Mr. Butcher examine the document -- which he presumably had not yet seen -- to determine whether he had any objection to it being shown to the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Tr. at 16:14-22 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Court turned to the United States and inquired whether the Court should hold a separate hearing on the matter, to which the United States responded that it would not be opposed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Tr. at 17:2-5 (Court, Vierbuchen). The United States clarified that, although its central objective in filing the Motion was to alert the Court to Gutierrez' potentially disqualifying financial situation, a further hearing may be appropriate at the Court's discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Tr. at 18:5-18 (Vierbuchen). The United States reminded the Court that it does not have current information regarding Gutierrez' account balances; however, the United States asserted that Gutierrez had more than $700,000.00 in 2006, and that the current figure is likely higher, because he continued to work for several years after that and had a second IRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Tr. at 20:4-25 (Vierbuchen). The United States cited Gutierrez' comment to Mr. Martinez-Spelich that he withdraws $7,000.00 each month from an IRA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   as evidence that he likely has access to considerable funds at the present.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Tr. at 21:10-17 (Vierbuchen). The United States emphasized that this sum is especially large, because Gutierrez does not have any rent or mortgage obligations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Tr. at 21:18-22 (Vierbuchen).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   After reviewing the document, Mr. Butcher rejoined that the Court should look at the financial disclosure form in camera.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Tr. at 18:15-16 (Butcher). He also argued that, even if Gutierrez has a large amount of money now, Gutierrez might still qualify for an Assistant Federal Public Defender, because the IRS would presumably seize that money.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Tr. 18:19-23 (Butcher). The Court clarified with the United States that the United States was seeking about $300,000.00 from Gutierrez,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   First Tr. at 19:16-17 (Court), and that, at least in 2006, Gutierrez had more than $700,000.00 in an IRA,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   First Tr. at 20:1-16 (Court, Vierbuchen). Mr. Butcher again recommended that the Court perform an in-camera review of Gutierrez' financial disclosure, because such information might expose Gutierrez to additional criminal liability, so the United States may not be entitled to such information under the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Tr. at 22:6-18 (Butcher). Accordingly, Mr. Butcher proposed that the Court hold this issue in abeyance until after trial, at which point, if Gutierrez is acquitted, the Court can inquire whether Gutierrez should pay back the cost of his defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Tr. at 22:25-23:3 (Butcher). If Gutierrez is found guilty, Mr. Butcher continued, the Court can inquire whether his money should go to the IRS or any other restitution the Court may deem appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First. Tr. at 23:4-7 (Butcher). Mr. Butcher stated that he takes no position regarding whether Gutierrez should ultimately be required repay the Federal Public Defender's office for its services, however.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Tr. at 23:15-18 (Butcher).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The United States took up argument, emphasizing that it \"very much wants Mr. Gutierrez to have an attorney.\" First Tr. at 24:1-2 (Vierbuchen). The United States maintained, however, that Gutierrez can afford an attorney and therefore does not qualify for CJA assistance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Tr. at 24:2-4 (Vierbuchen). The United States also argued that holding the issue in abeyance as Mr. Butcher suggests misses the point -- Gutierrez should not receive any unpaid assistance \"if he truly has the income that the Government's filing suggests.\" First Tr. at 24:20-24 (Vierbuchen).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Mr. Butcher interjected, asserting that he is not proposing that Gutierrez receive any unpaid assistance, but rather, should the Court determine that Gutierrez is not financially qualified for such assistance, that he \"pay back the reasonable costs of his defense.\" First Tr. at 24:25-24:16 (Butcher). That determination can be made at any time by the Court, Mr. Butcher asserted, whether before or after trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Tr. at 25:16-18 (Butcher). Mr. Butcher summarized his position, stating that he is not suggesting that Gutierrez should receive free representation or that he should acquire his own; instead, he stated, \"the CJA Act allows something in between where he can get a CJA attorney or a federal public attorney, but has to pay back some or all that cost.\" First Tr. at 25:18-22 (Butcher).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The United States, in reply, suggested that, if the Court entertains the issue, \"Gutierrez' bond conditions need to be modified and he needs to put up a significant amount of money to pay for the eventuality [ ] that may occur.\" First Tr. at 26:3-7 (Vierbuchen). The United States expressed concern that Gutierrez \"has not paid taxes for years and he appears to be\n   hiding money .... He's withdrawing $7,000 a month ... and not paying taxes.\" First Tr. at 26:7-11 (Vierbuchen). In the end, the United States posited, \"maybe the money is not going to be there to pay, if we wait until the end of the trial and the disposition in this case.\" First Tr. at 26:11-14 (Vierbuchen).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Court informed the parties that it would set a date for a hearing to show cause, and that Gutierrez could, in his discretion, present additional information in his defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Tr. at 26:15-21 (Court). The Court noted that it was not requiring Gutierrez to submit additional information, if Gutierrez decided that disclosing his financial information was against his interest or if there were Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States problems.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Tr. at 26:17-21 (Court). Mr. Butcher stated that he \"would be surprised\" if he presented more information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Tr. at 27:9-11 (Butcher). The Court concluded by clarifying that Mr. Butcher would remain Gutierrez' attorney until the Court removed him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Tr. at 27:18-19 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     The Second Hearing\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Court held a show cause hearing on September 6, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Transcript of Show Cause Proceedings at 1 (held on September 6, 2016), filed October 18, 2016 (Doc. 42)(\"Second Tr.\"). The Court opened by stating that, according to the Court's Courtroom Deputy, Gutierrez \"wants to retain counsel, private counsel, to represent him.\" Second Tr. at 2:22-24 (Court). This request, the Court noted, possibly moots the United States' Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Tr. at 2:24-3:1 (Court). Mr. Butcher confirmed that Gutierrez wants to retain his own attorney, and that he \"would request a continuance of the trial date so he can retain his own attorney.\" Second Tr. at 3:4-6 (Butcher). In response, the United States asked for clarification from Gutierrez whether \"he is conceding that he is financially able to obtain counsel, in light of ... the fact that the Government has highlighted some information that suggests that the defendant has substantial assets.\" Second Tr. at 3:14-20 (Vierbuchen). The United States contended that \"it should be clear that he's doing that because he agrees that he is not entitled to a Public Defender.\" Second Tr. at 3:20-21 (Vierbuchen). Mr. Butcher answered, arguing that \"the right to retain counsel is not based upon finances, in the sense that [Gutierrez] only is entitled to counsel if he doesn't have the finances.\" Second Tr. at 4:1-3 (Butcher). That Gutierrez has requested to hire an attorney, Mr. Butcher contended, should end the inquiry, without regard to Gutierrez' finances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Tr. at 4:4-6 (Butcher).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Court proposed to postpone its resolution of the Motion and inquired where Gutierrez is in the process of selecting an attorney.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Tr. at 4:7-10 (Court). Gutierrez replied that he has \"not begun that process.\" Second Tr. at 4:11-12 (Gutierrez). The Court expressed its concern with Gutierrez' status and proposed to give him until September 20, 2016 to find counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Tr. at 4:13-16 (Court);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207206\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207206\">\n    at 5:16-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Butcher, Court). The Court cautioned that, if Gutierrez had not yet retained counsel by then, the Court would revisit the Motion and examine whether Gutierrez should provide information about his assets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Tr. at 5:16-21 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     The Third Hearing\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Court held a third hearing on September 28, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Tr. at 1:1. The Court opened by noting that Gutierrez had not yet retained counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Tr. at 3:3-4 (Court). The Court indicated that it understood the United States' position to\n   be that it will oppose a continuance until Gutierrez acquires a new attorney, and that Gutierrez contends that he cannot acquire an attorney without a continuance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Tr. at 3:4-9 (Court). Given this dilemma, the Court proposed to remove Mr. Butcher from the case and appoint an attorney from the CJA panel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Tr. at 3:10-15 (Court). The Court stated that its primary concern is avoiding a gap in Gutierrez' representation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Tr. at 3:17-18 (Court). The Court added that, should Gutierrez disagree with the Court's selection, he may select someone else.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Tr. at 3:18-23 (Court). The Court revealed, however, that it was likely to grant a continuance regardless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Tr. at 3:24-25 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The United States asked for clarification, inquiring whether the Court, in proffering the above proposal, was granting the United States' Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Tr. at 6:17-18 (Vierbuchen). The United States further queried whether the Court's intention was for Gutierrez to work out a retainer agreement with the assigned CJA attorney or whether public funds would be expended.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Tr. at 6:19-22 (Vierbuchen). If the latter is true, the United States asserted, the Court should conduct a hearing on the Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Tr. at 6:23-24 (Vierbuchen).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Court responded, stating: \"I thought we had the hearing on the Government's motion. I now need to rule on it.\" Third Tr. at 7:1-3 (Court). The Court indicated that it already made clear that Gutierrez \"has to retain his own counsel\" and that \"he may have to reimburse money to the Government.\" Third Tr. at 7:4-6 (Court). The Court stated, however, that, because the case had to move forward, it was inclined to appoint an attorney and remove Mr. Butcher -- and thus the Federal Public Defender's office -- from the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Tr. at 7:6-12 (Court). The Court reasoned that, if necessary, it can revisit the issue later, but that it would be unwise to continue to wait for Gutierrez to get an attorney.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Tr. at 7:13-18 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Notwithstanding the Court's inclination to revisit the issue later, the United States argued that, whether in camera or otherwise, the Court should examine Gutierrez' financial affidavit to determine whether he has the resources to obtain counsel, and also whether Gutierrez wished to retain counsel or represent himself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Tr. at 8:19-9:5 (Vierbuchen). The United States contended that, if he has the financial resources or wishes to represent himself, \"the public defender, or CJA should not be in here,\" and Gutierrez should be \"advised of his right to get an attorney and of his right [to] represent himself as well as cautioned about the dangers of representing [him]self.\" Third Tr. at 8:24-9:5 (Vierbuchen). The United States stated that, in any event, it was concerned about the Court striking Mr. Butcher and then appointing another attorney, because it is \"not clear that that is the defendant's desire,\" but that it is \"the Government's desire to have him represented.\" Third Tr. at 9:6-10 (Vierbuchen). The United States also said that Mr. Butcher had represented to it that Gutierrez wished to continue with Mr. Butcher, but that the United States was mainly concerned with Gutierrez saying later, on appeal, that \"I never had a chance to represent myself or [that] I was appointed counsel that I didn't want.\" Third Tr. at 10:14-16 (Vierbuchen). It added that the United States also \"wanted to move this case along,\" but that its position remained \"that if the defendant is financially able to retain counsel, I do not believe there is authority for the Court to continue to order the public trust to be used to fund his representation.\" Third Tr. 10:17-24 (Vierbuchen).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The United States also argued that, because Gutierrez had not found an attorney in three weeks, after representing that he would, Gutierrez may have waived his right to hire an attorney, so may need to proceed pro se.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Tr. at 11:15-12:1 (Court, Vierbuchen). The United States clarified that Gutierrez may not have yet waived his right to hire an attorney, but that there needs to be a hearing where Gutierrez either states he has the money to hire an attorney or he does not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Tr. at 12:2-6 (Vierbuchen). The Court then stated it had already had two hearings on the issue, it believed that Gutierrez had said everything he had wanted to say on the issue, and that the Court had taken the Motion under advisement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Tr. at 12:16-22 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Mr. Butcher reiterated that his office takes no position on whether his office should be appointed to represent Gutierrez.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Tr. 13:9-12 (Butcher). He also stated that it was his understanding that Gutierrez \"does not challenge that he has the resources to hire an attorney,\" and that he would have no objection if the Court needed Gutierrez to say that on the record. Third Tr. at 13:13-17 (Butcher). He argued, however, that if the Court wanted a more detailed conversation about Gutierrez' assets, it should be done in camera.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Tr. at 13:17-19 (Butcher). Finally, he stated that he believed Gutierrez \"was willing to go forward with me, with the understanding that he may have to pay back the CJA fund.\" Third Tr. at 13:22-24 (Butcher).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Court concluded that it would like to create a record, so it swore in Gutierrez as a witness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Tr. at 14:20-21 (Court);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207206\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207206\">\n    at 16:7-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Wild, Court). After hearing some of Gutierrez' testimony,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   the United States subsequently argued that, because Gutierrez conceded he had the money to obtain counsel, the CJA precludes Gutierrez from having an Assistant Federal Public Defender.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Tr. at 26:23-27:2 (Vierbuchen). The United States added that, if the Court was still inclined to let Gutierrez have an Assistant Federal Public Defender as an attorney and pay the CJA back later, the Court's in camera review of Gutierrez' finances was still necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Tr. at 27:2-6 (Vierbuchen). The Court concluded that an in camera review was still necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Tr. at 27:9-13 (Court). Before continuing, Mr. Butcher argued that the Court should focus its questions on Gutierrez' current financial resources and not on his past financial resources.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Tr. at 28:13-15 (Butcher). The United States rejoined that inquiries into Gutierrez' past resources were still relevant, because it is relevant whether Gutierrez has hidden any money -- perhaps with family members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Tr. at 29:11-25 (Vierbuchen). The Court subsequently conducted an in camera review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   In Camera Tr. at 30:3-49:17 (Butcher, Court, Gutierrez).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the In Camera portion of the proceeding, Mr. Butcher reiterated his argument that, even though Gutierrez had a strong flow of monthly income, he was unsure if that money was legally cognizable under CJA, because there was a chance that the United States could take that money so that Gutierrez would not actually be able to use his money to pay an attorney.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   In Camera Tr. at 39:18-40:25 (Butcher, Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   After conducting the in camera review, the Court asked Mr. Butcher to furnish the Court the number of hours that he had\n   worked on the case up until the third hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Tr. at 33:15-18 (Butcher, Court);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207206\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207206\">\n    at 46:6-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Court).

Although the United States presented evidence that the defendant's past annual income had been substantially higher than $20,000.00 per year, the Court reasoned that the $20,000.00 per year figure was the more appropriate number to consider, in part because the United States' evidence came from several years prior.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

It also reasoned that the defendant had presented substantial evidence that his expenses had \"drained away\" any assets he had attained by the higher monthly income; namely, the defendant demonstrated that he had lost his pre-indictment attorney, because he was unable to pay her, so the Court reasoned that the defendant's \"substantial prior income was used to compensate his former attorney.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The amount the United States is seeking in restitution is a fraction of that annuity, and the projected cost of a trial attorney is also less than the annuity's value. Because of those significant net assets and a calculation that he can pay for restitution and for an attorney and still have some assets remaining, the Court concludes that Gutierrez does not qualify for CJA.

That the United States seeks restitution for Gutierrez' outstanding tax bills does not change the Court's determination, because the restitution sought, and ultimately obtained -- $174,196.00 -- was less than a quarter of Gutierrez' assets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sentencing Tr. at 9:6-7 (Court).

With those two possible meanings in mind, the Third Circuit concluded that the latter definition was correct. It reasoned that, because \"reimbursement\" means \"to pay back,\" and because \"[a]ppropriation\" means the \"fund or sub-fund appropriated by Congress for court-appointed attorneys representing those who cannot afford legal counsel,\" the statute's most natural meaning is to \"pay back the value received\" or, put another way, \"the amount of benefit\" the \"ineligible defendant\" received.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

It also reasoned, as a policy matter, a defendant who can afford legal counsel \"should not benefit from his incomplete, undervalued or untruthful financial disclosures by receiving legal services\" from the Federal Public Defender's Office \"at a fraction of the cost\" that he would otherwise have to pay for a private attorney.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

If appropriation means the funds that Congress has set aside to pay CJA attorneys, it does not follow that the defendant should have to pay for the reasonable rate of a private attorney. Congress has planned to pay CJA rates, which, as the Third Circuit recognizes, are \"universally recognized as a below-market rate for criminal defense attorneys.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Konrad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703657\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/343/#p348\">\n    730 F.3d at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Congress has not set\n   aside funds to pay a reasonable private attorney's rates, but has, instead, set aside funds for CJA rates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(d), (i). If the Court follows the Third Circuit's guidance, the United States would receive more money into the fund than Congress appropriated. Such a result is incompatible with the statute's meaning that the defendant should pay back the money that Congress has set aside for those legal services. The CJA, in short, does not authorize a windfall to the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Konrad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703657\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/343/#p348\">\n    730 F.3d at 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fuentes, J., dissenting)(\"Having the Government profit from a court's reimbursement order is antithetical to the very concept of reimbursement.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The Third Circuit also reasoned that defendants should not be incentivized to lie on their financial affidavits so that they may retain and later pay for a public defender -- a defense attorney often as good as a private attorney -- at a fraction of a private attorney's cost.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

There is some merit to that reasoning, but the Court determines that such a policy consideration is Congress' domain and not the Court's. Further, there is already a strong disincentive for defendants to lie on their financial affidavits: the threat of a perjury charge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Konrad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703657\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/343/#p348\">\n    730 F.3d at 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fuentes, J., dissenting)(\"I doubt the desire for subsidized legal costs will drive those with means to pay for private counsel to risk a conviction and prison time for a randomly assigned public defender.\"). Moreover, the Third Circuit's reasoning sweeps in defendants, such as Gutierrez, who state their intention to hire an attorney,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Financial Affidavit at 1 (stating that Gutierrez \"wants to hire attorney\"), but were appointed an Assistant Federal Public Defender nonetheless.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   While there is an argument that those defendants who can pay but were erroneously appointed counsel should still pay the price of a private attorney, because they can afford one and have always been able to afford one, the Third Circuit's rule disincentives the judiciary from carefully inquiring into the defendant's intentions or their financial means knowing that any mistake it makes will be cleaned up later and the United States will receive a bonus payment from any mistake to boot. Moreover, because of the judiciary's mistake, those defendants are already required to spend more money than they otherwise would have had to pay. Once the mistake is discovered, the defendant's new private attorney must come up to speed on the case, which takes time and costs money. If there had been no mistake to begin with, the defendant would have had that private attorney all along and that additional cost would not incur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   There is also the practical consideration of how to calculate what a reasonable private criminal defense attorney would cost. The Court has had many occasions to consider a reasonable private attorney's fees in civil matters,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Payne v.

Most often, when determining civil attorney's fees, it has the benefit of the private attorneys arguing about what their time is valued at through evidence of past rates charged and other evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Payne v. Tri-State Careflight, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273234\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/278/1276/#p1296\">\n    278 F.Supp.3d at 1297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The party entitled to fees must provide the district court with sufficient information to evaluate prevailing market rates.\"). An Assistant Federal Public Defender, however, would not readily have that evidence to present to the Court. Although there is some evidence in this case that a private attorney would value Gutierrez' case at $100,000.00 from September 28, 2016 forward,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   In Camera Tr. at 42:8-10 (Gutierrez); Third Tr. at 21:2-3 (Gutierrez, Vierbuchen), that quote is just one data point. Moreover, the Court cannot reduce that amount to a rate to apply to Mr. Butcher's hours, because there is no indication how many hours that attorney thought she would spend on the case to charge $100,000.00.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   In Camera Tr. at 42:8-10 (Gutierrez); Third Tr. at 21:2-3 (Gutierrez, Vierbuchen). The Court could ask private attorneys to submit rates and calculate a reasonable rate from those submissions, as the district court's appointed special master did in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Konrad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703657\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/343/#p348\">\n    730 F.3d at 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or it could use the mean or median rate from the survey on New Mexico attorney's rates that the New Mexico Bar Association commissioned,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Research &amp; Polling Inc., The Economics of Law Practice in New Mexico May 2017, at 17 (2017) available at\n   <em>\n    https://www.nmbar.org/nmbardocs/pubres/reports/2017LawyerCompensationSurvey.pdf\n   </em>\n   (\"NM Bar Survey\")(listing the mean rate for New Mexico criminal defense attorneys at $217.00 per hour and the median rate at $224.00 per hour). Both approaches present problems, however. The former suffers from a potential selection bias possibly skewing the reasonable rate. The latter approach is also possibly a skewed view of the reasonable rate, because only eleven percent of New Mexico attorneys responded to the survey.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NM Bar Survey at 3.

The Federal Public Defender's Office, by statute, does not qualify as a \"community defender organization,\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(g)(2)(A), and does not fit the plain meanings of \"appointed attorney,\" \"bar association,\" or \"legal aid agency.\" To be sure, the Court or a magistrate judge, when appointing the Federal Public Defender's Office, technically appoints the Federal Public Defender, who is an attorney, who in turn appoints an Assistant Federal Public Defender to take the case. The Court concludes, however, that \"appointed attorney\" means a CJA appointed attorney and not the Federal Public Defender. The statute indicates that the meaning of \"appointed attorney\" means a private attorney or an attorney who charges for his or her services. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(d). In contrast, a Federal Public Defender does not charge for his or her services and is, by statute, forbidden from the private practice of law.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(g)(2)(A).

While the Court is not as knowledgeable about the local federal criminal attorney rates as it is about local federal civil rates, the Court is confident that, with New Mexico being a poor state, the gap between CJA rates and private rates is not as much here as it is in the Third Circuit.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Research &amp; Polling Inc.,\n    <em>\n     The Economics of Law Practice in New Mexico May 2017\n    </em>\n    , at 17 (2017)(listing the mean rate for New Mexico criminal defense attorneys at $217.00 per hour). A CJA lawyer in New Mexico can make a good, comfortable living.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    The Court also notes that there may be reasons, other than money, that attorneys take CJA cases. Practicing in federal court can be prestigious. Good, but young, lawyers can make reputations that they would never be able to make in drug or DWI cases in state, municipal, or metropolitan court, even at full hourly rates. A good federal trial for a young or even a journeyman attorney can be worth more on a resume than a dozen state pleas. Similarly, there are established lawyers, like Clarence Darrow in his prime, who are not attracted to cases because of the money. Federal criminal issues may simply be more attractive than state criminal issues to those attorneys.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-175\">\n    In terms of money, while it may be true that CJA rates are less than private rates, a CJA case has something that a private case does not -- the payout is guaranteed by the entity that prints the money. In a private case, attorneys have to worry about actually getting paid, so sometimes negotiate an up-front flat fee, leaving some money on the table if he or she had charged an hourly rate. In a CJA case, in contrast, the attorney does not have to worry about the United States paying out.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-176\">\n    Gutierrez never asked for an Assistant Federal Public Defender.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Third Tr. at 17:20-24 (Gutierrez, Vierbuchen).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
