Before the Court is Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment and entry of a permanent injunction against Defendants Andre Maurice and Leana Lopez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   There can be no dispute that in marketing to fianc\u00e9 purchasers, defendants chose the formation \"FEYONC\u00c9\" in order to capitalize off of the exceedingly famous BEYONC\u00c9 mark. But that alone does not establish likelihood of confusion. Rather, a critical question is whether a rational consumer would mistakenly believe FEYONC\u00c9 products are sponsored by or affiliated with BEYONC\u00c9 products. A rational jury might or might not conclude that the pun here is sufficient to dispel any confusion among the purchasing public. Thus, there is a genuine dispute of material fact that requires denial of the motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The \"operative question is whether the\n   <em>\n    kind\n   </em>\n   of association [Defendants] creat[e] here is likely to impair the distinctiveness of [Plaintiffs'] marks.\"\n   <em>\n    My Other Bag\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307330\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/156/425/#p434\">\n    156 F.Supp.3d at 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants' mark could be considered a pun-it is clearly a reference to Plaintiff Beyonc\u00e9, but it is just as clearly a signifier of a specific relationship status. A reasonable factfinder may determine that, given the similarity between the two marks, Defendants' use of FEYONC\u00c9 impairs the distinctiveness and selling power of the BEYONC\u00c9 mark. However, because Defendants' have not merely co-opted the BEYONC\u00c9 mark, but rather repurposed it in a way that can be distinguished from the original, a reasonable factfinder could also conclude that there is little risk of dilution.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hormel Foods Corp. v. Jim Henson Productions, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7411695\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/73/497/#p506\">\n    73 F.3d 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 506 (2d Cir. 1996) (noting that parody tends to increase rather than undermine the public identification of a famous mark). Because the outcome is not compelled as a matter of law, the Court denies Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on their federal trademark dilution claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   2. New York Trademark Dilution\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   To prevail on a claim for trademark dilution under New York General Business Law \u00a7 360-l, a plaintiff \"must prove (1) that the trademark is truly distinctive or has acquired secondary meaning, and (2) a likelihood of dilution either as a result of 'blurring' or 'tarnishment.' \"\n   <em>\n    U-Neek, Inc. v. Wal-mart Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11086596\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/147/158/#p175\">\n    147 F.Supp.2d 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 175 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (citing\n   <em>\n    Deere &amp; Co. v.

Plaintiffs' mark is registered and incontestable, and Plaintiffs have therefore established a rebuttable presumption of distinctiveness as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson &amp; Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. v. Aini\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715299\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/540/374/#p390\">\n    540 F.Supp.2d 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 390 (E.D.N.Y. 2008) (\"[W]hen the USPTO registers a mark without requiring proof of a secondary meaning, a presumption arises that the mark is more than merely descriptive but is, rather, inherently distinctive.\"). Defendants point to nothing that would rebut this presumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   However, summary judgment is inappropriate because there remain factual questions that bear on the second prong: likeliness of dilution. As with federal law, under New York law \"[d]ilution by 'blurring' may occur where the defendant uses or modifies that plaintiff's trademark to identify the defendants' goods and services, raising the possibility that the mark will lose its ability to serve as a unique identifier of the plaintiff's product.\"\n   <em>\n    U-Neek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11086596\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/147/158/#p175\">\n    147 F.Supp.2d at 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   New York courts consider six factors when determining if blurring is likely: \"(1) similarity of the marks, (2) similarity of the products covered by the marks, (3) sophistication of consumers, (4) predatory intent, (5) renown of the senior mark, (6) renown of the junior mark.\"\n   <em>\n    Mead Data Cent., Inc. v.

The first five of these factors are \"closely analogous\" to the\n   <em>\n    Polaroid\n   </em>\n   factors.\n   <em>\n    L &amp; L Wings, Inc. v.

As previously discussed, the Court concluded that factual questions related to the\n   <em>\n    Polaroid\n   </em>\n   factors preclude a finding of likeliness of confusion as a matter of law. Therefore, Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on its New York trademark dilution claim is also denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Permanent Injunction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"A permanent injunction is appropriate where the party seeking the injunction has succeeded on the merits and shows the absence of an adequate remedy at law and irreparable harm if the relief is not granted.\"\n   <em>\n    Patsy's Italian Restaurant, Inc. v.
