INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case presents the novel question whether a federal court has diversity jurisdiction over a limited liability company (\"LLC\") member's suit against the LLC about the scope of the member's rights when the member also requests a declaratory judgment that he is an LLC member. This Court holds that an LLC member cannot gin up jurisdiction by requesting such a declaratory judgment where both the member and the LLC agree that the member is, in fact, a member. As a consequence, pursuant to its order of September 24, 2018, ECF No. 15, this Court dismisses this case for want of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In summarizing the facts, this Court treats the petition's well-pleaded facts as true, draws all reasonable inferences in the petitioners' favor, and considers the petition's exhibits, but disregards the petition's conclusory allegations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

Wolf (\"Mr. Wolf\") is an Ohio-based investor in various domestic and international businesses. Pet. \u00b6 1, ECF No. 1. In early 2015, Mr. Wolf, his brother-in-law Allan S. Jones (\"Mr. Jones\"), and Luke D. Jones formed Altitude Costa, LLC (\"Costa\") in order to start a trampoline park business in Puerto Rico. Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6, 11-14, 105. That August, Mr. Wolf executed a subscription agreement to purchase 20,750 Class A LLC units in Costa. Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 43-47 &amp; Ex. I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Soon after making the investment, in spring 2016, Mr. Wolf noticed \"some irregularities\" in Costa's operations. Pet. \u00b6 64. Costa also restricted Mr. Wolf's access to its information. Pet. \u00b6 64. Although Mr. Wolf received a distribution of Costa's profits for the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, Mr. Wolf did not receive further distributions notwithstanding his repeated requests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 58, 60, 69.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    Mr. Wolf's attempts to help manage Costa appear to have frustrated the two other founding LLC members. In May 2016, Mr. Jones emailed Mr. Wolf to demand that Mr. Wolf \"act like a normal investor\" in Costa and its subsidiary, Altitude Costa West, LLC (\"West\"). Pet. \u00b6 76. Mr. Wolf alleges that that summer one of Costa's managers threatened him and prevented him from accessing Costa property, at the Joneses' behest. Pet. \u00b6 78.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    Mr. Wolf received an email on July 28, 2016 from Mr. Jones stating that Mr. Wolf was \"out of compliance\" and that the \"agreement are [sic] rescinded.\" Pet. \u00b6 83. Mr. Wolf's attorney contacted Mr. Jones the next day and asserted that Mr. Wolf was a member of Costa and demanded Costa pay Mr. Wolf owed distributions. Pet. \u00b6 84. Mr. Jones reaffirmed that he had rescinded \"the 'proposed' Subscription and Operating Agreement\" on July 30, 2016. Pet. \u00b6 85. On August 1, 2016, Mr. Wolf's attorney responded to Mr. Jones that the Subscription Agreement was fully signed -- and thus effective -- and again requested Mr. Wolf's distributions. Pet. \u00b6 86. Although Mr. Wolf's attorney offered to discuss the dispute in his August 1 communication, the petition reveals no response from Costa or the Joneses. Pet. \u00b6 86. While the petition alleges that Mr.\n    Wolf's attorney and Mr. Wolf's wife, Mary-Ann Wolf, followed up with Costa and the Joneses, the petition does not describe any response from them.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    Dissatisfied with Costa and the Joneses' silence, Mr. Wolf notified Costa, West, Mr. Jones, and Luke D. Jones (collectively, the \"Respondents\") on June 13, 2018 that he intended to invoke the subscription agreement's arbitration clause to resolve the dispute. Pet. \u00b6 106. With no response on June 27, 2018, the Wolfs filed a petition to compel arbitration in this Court. Pet. \u00b6 107.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    <strong>\n     B. Procedural History\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    The Respondents opposed the petition on September 12, 2018. Opp'n, ECF No. 12. At a teleconference hearing on September 24, 2018, this Court sua sponte noted the potential absence of subject matter jurisdiction because the pleadings did not reveal the LLC members' citizenships. Min. Order, ECF No. 15. It therefore ordered Costa and West to supply the names and addresses of their members.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7653212\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/99/1200/#p1210\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Instead of providing this information, however, the Respondents averred, on October 4, 2018, that Mr. Wolf is a member of Costa and asserted that an LLC member cannot bring a diversity action against the LLC.

Submitting LLC Membership Lists 1-2, ECF No. 19. Subsequently, on October 15, 2018, the Wolfs filed a motion in compliance with this Court's order in which they argued that Mr. Wolf's citizenship could not be attributed to Costa because Costa did not recognize him as a member when Mr. Wolf filed his petition.

ANALYSIS\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    This Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this petition to compel arbitration.

Where an LLC member and the LLC dispute the contours of the LLC member's rights, those questions ought not be decided in a federal forum.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ahmed\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Khanijow\n    </em>\n    , No. 11-11887,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%203566621\">\n     2011 WL 3566621\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *1 (E.D. Mich. Aug. 15, 2011) (reasoning that diversity jurisdiction was absent because the plaintiff \"pleaded that he is a member of [the LLC], and the Court, for this motion, accepts that allegation as true\"). In contrast, where an LLC outright denies any membership relationship with a plaintiff, those cases may be brought under alienage or diversity jurisdiction.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Symes\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5199883\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/472/754/\">\n     472 F.3d at 758\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . As Justice Ginsburg observed in\n    <em>\n     Vaden\n    </em>\n    :\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n    Artful dodges by a [petitioner for arbitration] should not divert [courts] from recognizing the actual dimensions of that controversy. The text of [section 4 of Chapter 29 of the United States Code] instructs federal courts to determine whether they would have jurisdiction over \"a suit arising out of\n    <em>\n     the\n    </em>\n    controversy between the parties\"; it does not give \u00a7 4 petitioners license to recharacterize an existing controversy, or manufacture a new controversy, in an effort to obtain a federal court's aid in compelling arbitration.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653799\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/49/#p62\">\n     556 U.S. at 68\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653799\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/49/#p62\">\n     129 S.Ct. 1262\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Notwithstanding the Wolfs' characterization, this Court rules that the actual controversy here is not whether Mr. Wolf is a member but whether Costa has fulfilled its obligations to him in that capacity. As such, this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the arbitration petition's underlying controversy and the petition itself.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    <strong>\n     III. CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, this Court dismisses the Wolfs' petition to compel arbitration for want of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    <strong>\n     SO ORDERED.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
