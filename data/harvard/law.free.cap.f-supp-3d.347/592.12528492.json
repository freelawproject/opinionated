In 2008, Mark Cowens and Melanie Giese (\"Borrowers\") purchased the Property by way of a loan in the amount of $212,199.00 secured by a deed of trust (\"DOT\") recorded on September 16, 2008. (Deed of Trust, Ex. A to Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. (\"MSJ\"), ECF No. 65-1). The initial beneficiary under the DOT was Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (\"MERS\"), who later assigned the DOT to Plaintiff on June 15, 2012. (Assignment of Deed of Trust, Ex. B to Pl.'s MSJ, ECF No. 65-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 1, 2010, HOA, through its agent Red Rock, recorded a lien for delinquent assessments against the Property. (Delinquent Assessments Lien, Ex. C to Pl.'s MSJ, ECF No. 65-3). Red Rock later recorded a notice of default and election to sell on January 31, 2011, and a subsequent notice of foreclosure sale on June 6, 2014.

At the foreclosure sale on August 1, 2014, HOA foreclosed on its lien and sold the Property to SFR, who recorded the foreclosure deed\n   on August 6, 2014. (Foreclosure Deed, Ex. F to Pl.'s MSJ, ECF No. 65-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff filed the instant Complaint on April 11, 2016, asserting the following causes of action arising from the foreclosure and subsequent sale of the Property: (1) quiet title against all Defendants; (2) Breach of NRS \u00a7 116.1113 against HOA and Red Rock; (3) wrongful foreclosure against HOA and Red Rock; and (4) injunctive relief against SFR.

The Ninth Circuit's conclusion that NRS \u00a7 116.3116 violated lenders' due process rights was explicitly premised upon the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of state law. Specifically, the Ninth Circuit concluded the notice provisions of NRS 107.090 are not incorporated into NRS 116.31168. However, because the Nevada Supreme Court has since rejected the Ninth Circuit's interpretation by holding that the notice provisions of NRS 107.090 are incorporated into NRS 116.31168,\n   <em>\n    Bourne Valley\n   </em>\n   is no longer controlling authority with respect to \u00a7 116.3116's notice provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Accordingly, to the extent Plaintiff seeks to quiet title based upon the Ninth Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Bourne Valley\n   </em>\n   , the Court rejects this theory.

Therefore, to protect its interest in the Property, Plaintiff only had to tender nine-months worth of unpaid assessments, which it did.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SFR's Resp. to Pl.'s MSJ 4:1-26, ECF No. 122). Specifically, SFR asserts the following arguments to establish the invalidity of Plaintiff's tender: (1) acceptance of the tender was contingent upon agreement with the facts as stated in the tender letter; (2) the letter provides for a waiver of certain legal rights; (3) and the check's description indicated that it was for \"HOA Fees and Assessments.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Additionally, SFR and Red Rock contend that even if the tender was valid, Red Rock rejected the tender in good faith. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   22:19-24:13); (Red Rock's Resp. to Pl.'s MSJ 4:1-6:9, ECF No. 121).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   At the outset, the Court notes that one of the purportedly improper paragraphs in the letter, quoted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , is identical to the letter the Nevada Supreme Court deemed unconditional and otherwise valid.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, to the extent SFR assigns impropriety to language in that paragraph, the argument necessarily fails. Specifically, with respect to the provision that an endorsement would be construed as acceptance of\n   the facts within the letter, the Court incorporates the reasoning of the Nevada Supreme Court and finds this language constitutes a condition on which Plaintiff had the right to insist.\n   <em>\n    Bank of Am., NA.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570330\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/427/113/#p116\">\n    427 P.3d at 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   SFR argues, however, that this condition is \"especially egregious\" because Plaintiff \"does not even acknowledge that an association has a superpriority portion of its lien for any amounts that constitute abatement charges.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SRF's Resp. 21:25-22:2). According to SFR, because the letter excludes relevant language \"without indicating the language has been deleted,\" the condition that endorsement would constitute acceptance of the facts in the letter is impermissible. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   22:7-17). The Court preliminarily notes that other courts in this District have considered virtually identical language and nonetheless concluded that the tenders were valid and unconditional.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bank of Am., N.A. v.

Sept. 30, 2016) (Tender Letter, Ex. 3 to Miles Bauer Aff., ECF No. 40-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Moreover, in this case, because Red Rock's accounting ledger shows that maintenance and abatement charges were not incurred during the relevant nine-month time period, acceptance of the letter's facts in this regard would not \"force the [HOA] to waive a portion of its superpriority lien,\" as SFR argues. (SFR's Resp. 22:13-14, ECF No. 122). On this point, SFR contends that it is irrelevant whether abatement charges were assessed because these charges \"can arise at any time during the delinquency process,\" and such charges are \"are not temporally limited.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   22:12 n.10). Contrary to SFR's assertion, however, an HOA's superpriority lien applies exclusively to the last nine months of unpaid HOA dues and maintenance and nuisance-abatement charges.\n   <em>\n    Prop. Plus Invs., LLC v. Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=401%20P.3d%20728\">\n    401 P.3d 728\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 730 (Nev. 2017). Therefore, new charges would not factor into an HOA's superpriority lien absent a new notice of delinquent assessments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Saticoy Bay LLC v. JPMorgan Chase Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=408%20P.3d%20558\">\n    408 P.3d 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206597154\">\n    2017 WL 6597154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Nev. 2017) (unpublished).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Next, SFR asserts that the letter's language stating that rejection would be \"construed as a waiver of any right ... to claim our client's lien was wiped out at the foreclosure sale,\" renders the tender conditional. (SFR's Resp. 4:13-15, ECF No. 122). SFR continues that this provision makes it \"virtually impossible for the Association/Agent to accept or reject any conditions [Plaintiff] opined were appropriate without purportedly waiving other legal rights.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   This provision does not require that HOA or SFR waive any rights in the event of acceptance. Instead, the language contemplates action Plaintiff would take in the event of rejection. The courts in this District that have considered the same language have concluded that the tender letter \"simply delineated how the tenderer would interpret the actions of the recipient.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bank of Am., N.A. v. Toscano River Townhomes Ass'n\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:16-cv-00196-RCJ-VPC,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202259985\">\n    2017 WL 2259985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (Tender Letter, Ex. 3 to Miles Bauer Decl., Ex. 6 to MSJ, ECF No. 30-6). The Court is in accord with this authority and therefore finds that this clause does not constitute a condition to acceptance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   SFR also argues that the tender was invalid because \"the check specifically\n   indicated in its description that it was for 'HOA Fees and Assessments,' while it only purported to pay a small portion of the Assessments and no fees.\" (SFR's Resp. 4:18-19). As noted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the evidence shows that Plaintiff tendered at least nine-months worth of monthly assessments, and that no maintenance and abatement fees were due to satisfy HOA's superpriority lien. Regardless, it is unclear why the addition of the word \"fees\" in the check's description would invalidate the tender, particularly given that the check was enclosed with a letter that undisputedly specified the amount was limited to monthly assessments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Lastly, Red Rock and SFR argue that the rejection of Plaintiff's tender was in good faith. (SFR's Resp. 22:19-24:13); (Red Rock's Resp. to Pl.'s MSJ 4:1-6:9, ECF No. 121). Red Rock asserts that rejection was reasonable because it believed that \"no super-priority lien existed and [Plaintiff's] offer was insufficient to cover the full lien,\" and that HOA and Red Rock had a right to include collection costs in the superpriority lien. (Red Rock's Resp. 6:1-9). In support, Red Rock notes that Nevada law with respect to non-judicial HOA foreclosures was in complete disarray at the time Red Rock received the tender. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   6:10-7:12). SFR similarly asserts that during the relevant time period, \"whether a lender had to pay nine months assessments plus collection costs to protect its deed of trust was still open to interpretation.\" (SFR's Resp. 23:8-10). SFR continues that because the tender letter required HOA to admit nothing more was due, the rejection was reasonable given the nebulous status of Nevada law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   23:5-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court finds these contentions unpersuasive. Responding to this same line of argument, the Nevada Supreme Court stated \"a plain reading of NRS 116.3116 indicates that at the time of Bank of America's [2012] tender, tender of the superpriority amount by the first deed of trust holder was sufficient to satisfy that portion of the lien.

In a prior opinion, the Nevada Supreme Court arrived at the same conclusion explaining \"we are not persuaded that this was a justifiable basis [for rejection] in light of the explanations contained in the letters sent by [plaintiff's] agent setting forth [plaintiff's] legal position.\"\n   <em>\n    BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP v.

July 20, 2018) (unpublished).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Based upon this authority, the Court finds that the purported unsettled nature of Nevada law during the relevant time period does not establish sufficient justification for rejection of Plaintiff's tender. This conclusion is further bolstered by the fact that Plaintiff's tender letter, as well as the preceding letter requesting an accounting, provided explanation of Plaintiff's legal position, as well as citations to pertinent statutory authority. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Accounting Request, Ex. 1 to Miles Bauer Aff., Ex.

Accordingly, in light of Plaintiff's unconditional tender, SFR's status as a bona fide purchaser is immaterial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that Plaintiff's unconditional tender of the superpriority amount satisfied HOA's superpriority lien and, therefore, Plaintiff's senior DOT survived the foreclosure sale. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment on its quiet title claim and holds that Plaintiff's DOT continues to encumber the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Plaintiff's Remaining Claims for Violation of NRS \u00a7 116.1113, Wrongful Foreclosure, and Injunctive Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In its prayer for relief, Plaintiff requests primarily an \"order declaring SFR purchased the property subject to [Plaintiff's] senior deed of trust.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. 15:3-4). The other relief requested-with the exception of injunctive relief-is phrased in the alternative. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   15:4-13). Therefore, because the Court grants summary judgment for Plaintiff on its quiet title claim, Plaintiff has received the relief it requested. Accordingly, the Court dismisses Plaintiff's second and third causes of action as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   With regard to Plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction pending a determination by the Court concerning the parties' respective rights and interests, the Court's grant of summary judgment for Plaintiff moots this claim, and it is therefore dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    E. SFR's Claim Against Borrowers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   SFR seeks summary judgment on its quiet title claim against Borrowers on the basis that through its purchase of the Property, \"it obtained title of the unit's owner without equity or right of redemption.\" (SFR's MSJ 24:7-8, ECF No. 117). Because the Court holds the sale remains intact, and given SFR's evidence of its interest in the Property relative to that of Borrowers', SFR's Motion against Borrowers is granted to the extent Borrowers assert any adverse interest in the Property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Deutsche Bank Nat'l Tr.
