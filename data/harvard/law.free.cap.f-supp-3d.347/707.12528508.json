In her PF &amp; RD, Magistrate Judge Molzen recommends denying D. Coriz' Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PF &amp; RD at 4. First, she concludes that D.

The Supreme Court of the United States of America-in the course of approving the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit's use of the waiver rule-noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   It does not appear that Congress intended to require district court review of a magistrate's factual or legal conclusions, under a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   or any other standard, when neither party objects to those findings. The House and Senate Reports accompanying the 1976 amendments do not expressly consider what sort of review the district court should perform when no party objects to the magistrate's report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 94-625, pp. 9-10 (1976)(hereafter Senate Report); H.R. Rep. No. 94-1609, p. 11 (1976), U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1976, p. 6162 (hereafter House Report). There is nothing in those Reports, however, that demonstrates an intent to require the district court to give any more consideration to the magistrate's report than the court considers appropriate. Moreover, the Subcommittee that drafted and held hearings on the 1976 amendments had before it the guidelines of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts concerning the efficient use of magistrates. Those guidelines recommended to the district courts that \"[w]here a magistrate makes a finding or\n   <em>\n    ruling\n   </em>\n   on a motion or an issue, his determination should become that of the district court, unless specific objection is filed within a reasonable time.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jurisdiction of United States Magistrates, Hearings on S. 1283 before\n   the Subcommittee on Improvements in Judicial Machinery of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 94th Cong., 1st Sess., 24 (1975)(emphasis added)(hereafter Senate Hearings). The Committee also heard Judge Metzner of the Southern District of New York, the chairman of a Judicial Conference Committee on the administration of the magistrate system, testify that he personally followed that practice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , at 11 (\"If any objections come in, ... I review [the record] and decide it. If no objections come in, I merely sign the magistrate's order.\"). The Judicial Conference of the United States, which supported the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard of review eventually incorporated in \u00a7 636(b)(1)(C), opined that in most instances no party would object to the magistrate's recommendation, and the litigation would terminate with the judge's adoption of the magistrate's report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Senate Hearings, at 35, 37. Congress apparently assumed, therefore, that any party who was dissatisfied for any reason with the magistrate's report would file objections, and those objections would trigger district court review. There is no indication that Congress, in enacting \u00a7 636(b)(1)(C), intended to require a district judge to review a magistrate's report to which no objections are filed. It did not preclude treating the failure to object as a procedural default, waiving the right to further consideration of any sort. We thus find nothing in the statute or the legislative history that convinces us that Congress intended to forbid a rule such as the one adopted by the Sixth Circuit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

While D. Coriz is correct\n   that \"additional facts will not cure the ICRA violations on the record,\" D.

It is not clear from the record currently before the Court, however, whether the Santo Domingo Tribal Court has formal procedures of appeal that exist more than just in theory. Specifically, D. Coriz signed an Advisement of Rights that included the statement, \"I understand that I may appeal my conviction, but must do so within 7 days of my conviction.\" Tribal Court Record at 4. It is not clear, however, what that appeal process is. In fact, D.

Because the current record omits the details of the appeal process and whether appeal would be futile, the Court agrees with Magistrate Judge Molzen that D.

Coriz's Objections and adopts the recommendation to set an evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Next, Magistrate Judge Molzen found that \"up to 360 days of Petitioner's total term is presumptively valid if, as some evidence indicates, Petitioner waived his right to counsel at the traditional trial.\" PF &amp; RD at 8.

D. Coriz objects to this finding, arguing that the Tribal Court also violated \u00a7 1302(a)(6) and \u00a7 1302(a)(1) by denying D. Coriz a continuance in which to obtain an attorney, a public trial, a jury trial, and the right to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. Coriz' Objections at 7-12. While D. Coriz asserts there was no waiver,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D. Coriz' Objections at 12, the Respondents counter that \"as trial began, defendant Coriz requested a 'traditional trial' with no attorneys and no non-tribal members present.\" Answer to Petition at 5, filed February 5, 2018 (Doc. 7). Because of this uncertainty, Magistrate Judge Molzen correctly recommends setting an evidentiary hearing to determine if D.

Coriz asserts that he has experienced an unusual delay in the appeal process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. Coriz' Objections at 18. His only support for this proposition is that his Petition has been pending for months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. Coriz' Objections at 18. While it is true that the Petition has been pending for months, the case has been progressing in a very timely manner, and D. Coriz has not experienced any unusual delays. D. Coriz filed his Petition on December 22, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petition at 1. By January 5, 2018, the Court had reviewed the Petition, determined it was not subject to summary dismissal, and ordered Respondent Coriz to answer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order to Answer at 1, filed January 5, 2018 (Doc. 5). The Respondents answered on February 5, 2018,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Answer to Petition at 1, and D. Coriz filed a reply on March 9, 2018,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Petitioner Daniel E. Coriz's Reply to Respondent Coriz's Answer at 1, filed March 9, 2018 (Doc. 11).

Magistrate Judge Molzen entered her PF &amp; RD on May 15, 2018 and the Court now addresses the objections to it. Simply put, D. Coriz has not demonstrated an unusual delay or any other any exceptional circumstances that warrant his immediate release. The Court therefore overrules D. Coriz' Objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that: (i) the Magistrate Judge's Proposed Findings and Recommended Disposition, filed May 10, 2018 (Doc. 27), is adopted; (ii) Petitioner Daniel Coriz's Motion for Immediate Release Pending Review of the Merits of his Petition (Doc. 14), is denied; and (iii) the Magistrate Judge shall set an evidentiary hearing to address the issues of exhaustion and waiver of rights and any other relevant issues.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20631\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 631\n    </extracted-citation>\n    -639.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
