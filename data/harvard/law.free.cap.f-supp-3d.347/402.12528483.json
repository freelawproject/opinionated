Thereafter, he committed several crimes, which served as the basis for subsequent removal proceedings. On June 8, 1998, a notice to appear issued, alleging that Defendant was removable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B). Defendant's notice to appear ordered that he appear before an Immigration Judge at a time and place \"To Be Calendared At A Later Date.\" After appearing at his removal proceedings via video conference on September 15, 1998, an Immigration Judge ordered Defendant removed from the United States. However, Cuba declined to issue travel documents and Defendant remained in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Nearly two decades later, on May 15, 2017, Defendant allegedly entered Canada and attempted to return to the United States on April 17, 2018.
