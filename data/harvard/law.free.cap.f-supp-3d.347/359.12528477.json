SMITH, JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   On October 19, 2018, the Magistrate Judge issued a\n   <em>\n    Report and Recommendation (\"R&amp;R\")\n   </em>\n   recommending that the petition for a writ of habeas corpus, (ECF No. 1), be denied. (ECF No. 2.) Although the parties were advised of the right to object to the R&amp;R, and of the consequences of failing to do so, no objections have been filed. The R&amp;R (ECF No. 2) is therefore,\n   <strong>\n    ADOPTED\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   . The petition for a writ of habeas corpus (ECF No. 1) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   and this case is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202253\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(A), the Court must also assess whether to issue a certificate of appealability. Rule 11 of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Proceedings for the United States District Courts states that \"[t]he district court must issue or deny a certificate of appealability when it enters a final order adverse to the applicant.\" However, Petitioner has waived the right to file an appeal by failing to file objections to the Magistrate Judge's recommendations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

The Court therefore\n   <strong>\n    DECLINES\n   </strong>\n   to issue a certificate of appealability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ORDER and REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Elizabeth A. Preston Deavers, United States Magistrate Judge\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Petitioner, a state prisoner, has filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   petition for a writ of habeas corpus under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (ECF No. 1-1.) This case has been referred to the Undersigned pursuant to 28 U.S.C \u00a7 636(b) and Columbus' General Order 14-1 regarding assignments and references to United States Magistrate Judges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Petitioner has also filed a motion to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis.\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 1.) Upon consideration, the Magistrate Judge finds the motion to be meritorious and it is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . Petitioner shall be permitted to proceed without prepayment of fees or costs and judicial officers who render services in this action shall do so as if costs had been prepaid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pursuant to Rule 4 of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in the United States District Courts (\"Rule 4\"), the Court must conduct a preliminary review to determine whether \"it plainly appears from the petition and any attached exhibits that the petitioner is not entitled to relief in the district court.\" If it does so appear, the petition must be dismissed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Rule 4 allows for the dismissal of petitions which raise legally frivolous claims, as well as petitions that contain factual allegations that are palpably incredible or false.\n   <em>\n    Carson v.

For the reasons that follow, it plainly appears that Petitioner is not entitled to relief because he has failed to satisfy the pleading requirements of Rule 2(c) of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in the District Courts. Accordingly, the Undersigned\n   <strong>\n    RECOMMENDS\n   </strong>\n   that this action be\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Petitioner alleges that he is in custody of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and\n   Correction. (ECF 1-1.) Petitioner seeks leave to \"file a verified Motion for immediate release from illegal State's custody due to violation of the fundamental Bill of Rights to indictment, the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PAGE ID# 8.) He does not, however, allege any facts related to those claims. He does not, for instance, identify the name of the state court that convicted him, the date he was convicted, or the offenses for which he was convicted. Nor does he allege facts about how any state court conviction that he may be attempting to challenge violated the Constitution or federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A habeas petition must \"allege the facts concerning the applicant's commitment or detention, the name of the person who has authority over him and by virtue of what claim or authority if known.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202242\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Pursuant to Rule 2(c) of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in the United States District Courts, the petition also must also \"specify all the grounds for relief available to the petitioner\" and \"state the facts supporting each ground.\"\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flood v.

Indeed, the instant petition is so deficient that it is impossible to determine if it challenges the same state court conviction that Petitioner challenged in his previous federal habeas action, and thus whether it constitutes a successive petition within the meaning of 28 U.S.C \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arega v. United States\n   </em>\n   , 2:16-CV-618, S.D. Ohio, ECF No. 3, August 1, 2016).
