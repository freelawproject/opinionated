Approximately two and a half weeks after Lints began working at White Knight, Ms. Mondragon \"walked up behind [Lints] and pressed her breasts into [his] back and reached around and gave [him] a hug and stared rubbing [his] chest.\" While doing so, Ms. Mondragon asked Lints why he was \"not interested in dating her and having a relationship with her.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   j.

On or about April 27, 2010, Lints asked Mr. Nauman to intervene in an incident that occurred between Ms. Mondragon and Lints while Ms. Mondragon was training Lints on a piece of machinery. When Mr. Nauman failed to do so, Lints approached Karen Bastian (who Lints believed to be the director of human resources) to report that he was being subjected to unwanted sexual advances by Ms. Mondragon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   8. Ms. Bastian called one of the owners of White Knight, Tom Simmons, to meet with Lints.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that time, Lints repeated the details of Ms. Mondragon's behavior to Mr. Simons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lints specifically told Mr. Simmons that he had been sexually harassed by Ms. Mondragon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   9. On April 28, 2010, Mr. Simmons called Lints into his office. Mr. Simons asked Lints about Ms. Mondragon's behavior that Lints considered to be sexual harassment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   10. Lints told Mr. Simmons that Ms. Mondragon had not sexually harassed him again after Mr. Nauman had talked with her two months prior.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   11. Lints stated that his \"main concern\" was that Ms. Mondragon did not treat him \"great\" like everyone else at White Knight.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   12. Lints alleged that Ms. Mondragon \"verbally attacked\" him during the April 27, 2010 incident and that she had been \"gossiping\" about him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   13. Mr. Simmons told Lints:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   People being mean and not getting along, that is a lot easier to deal with. Accusations of sexual harassment are a big deal and can land people in court\n   and it can be a real pain in the neck and real expensive and it just causes trouble.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   14. Mr. Simmons then moved on to discussing Lints's absences from work and terminated Lints.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   15. During the time that he was employed by White Knight, Lints missed 13 days of work. Of those days, 11 were due to illness. Lints called either Mr. Simmons or Mr. Nauman each day that he was sick to tell them that he would not be coming in to work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   16. Lints missed work for the remaining 2 days due to personal reasons. Each time, Lints requested and received permission from Mr. Nauman to be absent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   17. When Lints returned to work from his last absence for illness, Mr. Nauman told him that \"if [he] missed anymore work that [his] job may be in jeopardy.\" Mr. Nauman also told Lints that \"he wasn't blaming [Lints] for being sick but if he saw a repeated pattern in [Lints's] missing days of work then [they] would have to discuss other options.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   18. In response to Lints's discovery requests, White Knight did not identify any specific steps or actions taken to investigate Lints's complaints regarding Ms. Mondragon's behavior.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   19. After Lints's termination, White Knight circulated a notice to its employees stating that \"[o]n April 27, 2010, an employee of White Knight made a claim of sexual harassment that upper management had not been aware of until that time.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   20.

After his termination from White Knight, Lints got a job in June 2010 that lasted for approximately two months. Lints was fired from that job because he failed to show up for work one day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   22. After that, Lints began painting or pulling weeds for friends and family.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   23.

However, the timeline of events does not support White Knight's position that it relied upon Lints's representations to its detriment. On April 27\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , Lints clearly told Mr. Simmons that he had been sexually harassed by Ms. Mondragon. Lints also told Mr. Simmons the very next day (April 28\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   ) that Ms. Mondragon's behavior toward him had diminished.

Summary judgment on Lints's retaliation claim was denied. For the same reason, summary judgment on White Knight's sixth defense is denied. Whether White Knight's asserted basis for terminating Lints was legitimate or merely a pretext is reserved for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Finally, White Knight's eleventh defense states that \"Graco Fluid Handling (A), Inc. should be dismissed from this action, as [Lints] cannot establish liability under a theory of successor liability.\" Lints asserts that Defendant Graco Fluid Handling bears successor liability for all Title VII employment discrimination claims that Lints has against White Knight.\n   <footnotemark>\n    148\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Lints fails to engage in any further legal or factual analysis to establish that the defense should be stricken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The general rule for successor liability is that \"where one corporation sells its assets to another corporation, the latter is not liable for the former's debts unless the transaction fits within well-defined exceptions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    149\n   </footnotemark>\n   In order to overcome the general rule that a successor company is not\n   liable, and to hold Graco Fluid Handling responsible for White Knight's actions, Lints must show that this case fits within one of the well-defined exceptions.
