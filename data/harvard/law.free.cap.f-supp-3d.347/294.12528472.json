(Doc. 215). On July 16, 2018, the Court issued its Final Pretrial Conference Order requesting that the parties file supplemental briefing regarding whether \"a representative trial is required or sufficient for the resolution of this matter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On July 20, 2018, both parties filed their respective Brief regarding whether the Court should continue with representative evidence.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 26, 2015, Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit against Defendants alleging Defendants failed to pay Plaintiffs for hours worked in excess of 40 hours in a single workweek in violation of the Federal Labor Standards Act (FLSA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et. seq.\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 85 at 1). On February 29, 2016, the Court conditionally certified the case for: \"All pressure control operators who were employed by Nine Energy Services, LLC or Peak Pressure Control, LLC from August 26, 2012, to the present who were paid in whole or in part on a salary basis.\" (Doc. 56). Approximately seventy (70) Plaintiffs remained in the suit after the opt-in period terminated. (Doc. 217 at 2). The parties chose sixteen (16) discovery-group Plaintiffs to facilitate discovery.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On May 1, 2018, Defendants filed a Motion for Decertification arguing that \"the highly individualized claims and defenses, particularly with respect to workweek-specific and Plaintiff-specific liability issues under the Motor Carrier and Technical Corrections Act, make a collective\n   action and, thus, representative proof improper.\" (Doc. 216 at 1-2). The Court denied Defendants' Motion for Decertification on June 30, 2018. (Doc. 190). The Court found that the evidence demonstrated that: \"pressure control operators performed relatively similar work, worked similar hours, and possessed similar qualifications while receiving no overtime pay;\" \"each Plaintiff must undergo the same factual inquiry as to whether that Plaintiff is subject to the MCA and HCE exemption;\" and that \"the limited nature of the evidence and the parties' bench trial request will enable an efficient and fair resolution of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20201\">\n    at 6, 10, 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 13, 2018, the Court held a Final Pretrial Conference at which Defendants questioned the fairness and efficiency of using representative proof. (Doc. 215). Accordingly, in its Final Pretrial Conference Order issued on July 16, 2018, the Court ordered the parties to file supplemental briefing regarding the issue of whether the use of representative evidence is proper in this case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Both parties filed a Brief by the prescribed deadline of July 20, 2018.

Defendants also allege that the FLSA does not\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   representative proof.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20201\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Finally, Defendants argue that \"the exemption defenses in this case present issues individualized to each Plaintiff and dependent on facts that, as a matter of the governing statute, require a week-by-week and Plaintiff-by-Plaintiff review.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs counter that representative evidence has been used in many FLSA collective actions and is appropriate in this case. (Doc. 217). Plaintiffs argue that they \"can prove liability and the inaccuracy of the driver's logs based on common evidence on a classwide basis,\" and that they can prove \"both vehicle exclusivity and hours worked by 'just and reasonable inference' applicable to the class based on a weighted average for both components.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20201\">\n    at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
