Dana M. Sabraw, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs are migrant children who were forcibly separated from their parents shortly after crossing the United States-Mexico border. The children entered the United States with their parents at or between ports of entry and were fleeing violence from countries in Central America. They were seeking refuge in the United States and hoped to be granted asylum together as a family. However, under the Government's \"zero tolerance\" immigration policy, immigrant parents unlawfully entering the United States with their young children were subject to criminal prosecution and systematically separated from their children. In less than two months following implementation of the zero tolerance policy, approximately 2,600 families were separated, sparking national protests and condemnation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The parents of these children sought relief in this Court over the government's family separation practices. On June 26, 2018, this Court certified a nationwide class of separated parents and issued a classwide preliminary injunction requiring the Government to reunify these parents with their children by July 26, 2018, on a showing that the parents' fundamental right to family integrity under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution had been violated.\n   <em>\n    See Ms. L. v. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n   </em>\n   , (\"\n   <em>\n    Ms. L.\n   </em>\n   \"), Case No. 18cv0428 DMS (MDD), ECF No. 83. The Government marshaled its resources and reunified nearly 2,000 of these parents with their children by the deadline. These timely reunifications\n   were possible because the parents and children were still in the United States. Approximately 400 other parents, however, were deported to countries in Central America without their children prior to the Court's reunification order. An intensive collaborative effort is presently underway to locate and reunite these parents with their children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   With approximately 2,000 families recently reunified in the United States, attention has turned to what lies ahead for these parents and their children. Plaintiffs in this putative class action are the children of the parents in the\n   <em>\n    Ms. L.\n   </em>\n   case. They contend that Defendants intend to immediately remove some of the families, thereby depriving Plaintiffs of certain asylum procedures guaranteed by statute and under the United States Constitution. (Compl. \u00b6 4.) Over half of the parents completed their asylum proceedings and were issued final orders of removal after their claims were rejected. These parents cleared background checks and were deemed suitable for reunification, but did not otherwise meet the requirements for asylum or other relief from removal. Some of their children, who are Plaintiffs in the present action, were also in asylum proceedings that had been initiated for them by the Government before reunification occurred. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants have \"since reversed course, revoking [these proceedings] with the immigration court, presumably on the basis\" that their parents waived their rights to seek asylum when they executed forms agreeing to be removed with their children. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-50.) The Government does not dispute that it intends to remove parents with removal orders, and to remove their children (Plaintiffs) with them based on the parents' requests to be removed with their children. Plaintiffs dispute that their parents knowingly and voluntarily waived their rights, and thus request the Court to issue a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") enjoining the Government from removing them and their parents pending a determination of these issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs initially filed this action on July 27, 2018, before Judge Paul L. Friedman in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. (Case No. 1:18cv01759 PLF.) Judge Friedman observed that these cases, the present one and\n   <em>\n    Ms. L.\n   </em>\n   , \"represent two sides of the same coin: whether and to what extent parents may waive their children's rights to pursue asylum and whether and to what extent children may independently assert their individual asylum rights.\" (ECF No. 25 at 11.) On August 3, 2018, Judge Friedman transferred the case to this Court given the interrelated issues and invited it to \"untie this sailor's knot.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) To do so requires an understanding of what is actually in dispute and what is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Importantly, both sides appear to agree on maintaining family unity-they just do not agree on how the family unit should be treated. Plaintiffs want to access asylum proceedings to which they are statutorily entitled and to be accompanied by their parents, while Defendants want to remove the families forthwith.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs therefore\n   seek a TRO prohibiting their removal and the removal of their parents until a determination is made about whether and to what extent they may assert their individual asylum rights. The principal dispute here is not whether the children have their own asylum rights (Defendants agree they do), but whether their parents waived those rights, and if they did not, what\n   <em>\n    type\n   </em>\n   of asylum procedures the children are entitled to-a potentially quick one under \u00a7 235 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), or a more involved one under \u00a7 240 of the INA that was initially provided to some of the children after they were separated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As noted, this case is not about Defendants' authority-or desire-to deport the parents at issue without their children. It does not appear Defendants wish to do so. Rather, this case is about the\n   <em>\n    timing\n   </em>\n   of removal of the\n   <em>\n    family unit\n   </em>\n   and whether an orderly asylum process should be permitted. Re-separation of the family would be antithetical to the President's Executive Order which expressly restored family unity and abandoned the family separation policy,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and it would greatly exacerbate the intensive efforts presently underway to reunite the nearly 400 parents who were previously removed from the country with their children who remain in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Court concludes it has jurisdiction to issue the requested injunction and exercises its discretion to do so. Plaintiffs have met all the required factors for the relief they request, including likely success on the merits-which encompasses the waiver issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Generally, injunctive relief is \"an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Winter v.

Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Before turning to the merits of Plaintiffs' request for a temporary restraining order, the Court must first address Defendants' argument that the Court lacks jurisdiction to grant the requested relief, more specifically, to enjoin the execution of any final removal orders issued to Plaintiffs' parents. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n to Mot. at 6-9, ECF No. 15.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support of this argument, Defendants rely on the INA, specifically\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(i), 1252(e)(1), (2), (4), and 1252(g). Plaintiffs in both this case and in\n   <em>\n    Ms. L.\n   </em>\n   disagree that these statutes deprive the Court of jurisdiction to grant the requested relief. The\n   <em>\n    Ms. L.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs, in particular, also argue the Court has authority to issue orders necessary to ensure implementation of its injunction in that case. (\n   <em>\n    See Ms. L.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 110 at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The statute Defendants rely on to support their argument that the Court lacks jurisdiction is\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which is entitled \"Judicial Review of Orders of Removal.\" Defendants rely first on subsection (a)(2)(A)(i) of this statute, which states, \"no court shall have jurisdiction to review any individual determination or to entertain any other cause or claim arising from or relating to the implementation or operation of an order of removal pursuant to section 1225(b)(1) of this title.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(i).

There, the Court refused to give this language an \"expansive interpretation,\" stating it \"would lead to staggering results.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/\">\n    at 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, the Court concluded that \u00a7 1252(b)(9) did not present a jurisdictional bar where respondents were \"not asking for review of an order of removal; they are not challenging the decision to detain them in the first place or to seek removal; and they are not\n   even challenging any part of the process by which their removability will be determined.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/\">\n    at 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs are not asking this Court to review any individual removal orders. Indeed, none of the Plaintiffs in this case have final removal orders. The only persons with final removal orders here are Plaintiffs' parents, but they are not challenging the Government's ultimate decision to detain or remove them. All Plaintiffs are asking of the Court is to stay removal of their parents pending resolution of Plaintiffs' separate claims for asylum. Because this request does not \"aris[e] from ... the implementation or operation of an order of removal[,]\" \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(A)(i) does not deprive this Court of jurisdiction to consider Plaintiffs' request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Next, Defendants rely on \u00a7 1252(e)(1). That statute provides, no court may \"(A) enter declaratory, injunctive, or other equitable relief in any action pertaining to an order to exclude an alien in accordance with section 1225(b)(1) of this title except as specifically authorized in a subsequent paragraph of this subsection[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1). The parties do not devote much attention to this subsection, but like \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(A)(i), it also does not deprive this Court of jurisdiction to entertain Plaintiffs' request. On its face, this statute applies only to \"action[s] pertaining to an order to exclude an alien in accordance with section 1225(b)(1)[,]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A), and the cases and motions at issue here do not fit that description. Thus, this statute does not act as a jurisdictional bar to the Court's consideration of the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The final subsection of the statute Defendants rely on is \u00a7 1252(g). This subsection states \"no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien under this chapter.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). Like subsection (a)(2)(A)(i) above, the relevant language here is \"arising from,\" and as stated above, the claims in the cases and motions at issue here do not \"arise from\" the Attorney General's decision to execute removal orders against parents in\n   <em>\n    Ms. L.\n   </em>\n   Rather, the claims in\n   <em>\n    Ms. L.\n   </em>\n   and the relief requested in the motion to stay in that case arise from the parents' separation from their children pursuant to Defendants' policies. The present case is even farther afield of \u00a7 1252(g) as the claims here are brought on behalf of the children of\n   <em>\n    Ms. L.\n   </em>\n   parents, none of whom even have final orders of removal. Thus, \u00a7 1252(g) does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction to consider the present motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arce v.

Plaintiffs argue-and it is undisputed-that prior to the Government's separation policy, Plaintiffs and similarly situated children would have been subject to proceedings under \u00a7 235 of the INA. (Compl. \u00b6 53.) Under \u00a7 235, a person who requests asylum by expressing a fear of persecution in his or her home country has the right to be interviewed by an asylum officer to determine whether that individual has a credible fear of returning to their home country. The statute provides,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   If an immigration officer determines that an alien ... who is arriving in the United States ... is inadmissible under section 1182(a)(6)(C) or 1182(a)(7) of this title and the alien indicates either an intention to apply for asylum ... or a fear of persecution, the officer shall refer the alien for an interview by an asylum officer ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A)(ii). Here, Plaintiffs allege they have \"triggered the nondiscretionary duty outlined\" in this statute, namely, the duty to refer them for an interview by an asylum officer. (Compl. \u00b6 122.)

Indeed, Defendants' counsel conceded that children, like the Plaintiffs here, have a right to pursue asylum separate and apart from their parents. (Rep. Tr. at 14-15, August 8, 2018, ECF No. 180.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Third, there is no dispute that no other adequate remedy is available to Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In their opposition to the motion, Defendants did not address whether Plaintiffs had shown a likelihood of success on this claim. However, at oral argument and in\n   <em>\n    Ms. L.\n   </em>\n   Defendants raised the defense of waiver. Specifically, Defendants assert Plaintiffs' parents waived their children's separate right to pursue asylum by executing one of the forms during the reunification process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   An election form was provided to parents in\n   <em>\n    Ms. L.\n   </em>\n   and attached to their class notice, which was entitled \"Notice of Potential\n   Rights for Certain Detained Alien Parents Separated from their Minor Children.\" The class notice was created and distributed to advise the parents of their right to reunification with their children. The notice was proposed, in part, as a response to a form the Government had previously distributed to parents in the\n   <em>\n    Ms. L.\n   </em>\n   class, entitled \"Separated Parent's Removal Form.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ms. L. Pls.' Mem. Regarding Reunification Forms, Ex. 63, ECF No. 32.) The government form offered two choices to parents with final removal orders: (1) to be reunited with their child for the purpose of repatriation to their home country, or (2) to \"voluntarily\" return to their home country without their child, who would \"remain in the United States to pursue available claims of relief.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The\n   <em>\n    Ms. L.\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs argued the government form was misleading and was being used improperly to suggest to parents that they needed to waive their right to contest removal in order to obtain reunification. Plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Ms. L.\n   </em>\n   therefore requested the Court to issue the class notice to \"dispel that impression, and nothing more.\" (\n   <em>\n    See Ms. L.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 168 at 1.) The class notice included information left out of the government form, namely, that a preliminary injunction had issued compelling the government to reunify the parents with their children. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ms. L. Pls.' Mem. Regarding Reunification Forms, Ex. 62, ECF No. 32.) The class notice clarified, \"The government must reunify you with your child.... You do NOT need to take any action to be reunified with your child.... You do NOT need to agree to removal from the United States in order to be reunified with your child.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) A similar statement appeared on the election form attached to the class notice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11) (\"You DO NOT have to agree to removal from the United States in order to be reunified with your child. Even if you continue to fight your case, the government must still reunify you.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Notably, neither the government form nor the class notice included any language concerning the children's separate rights to pursue asylum. Similarly, there is no language on the election form concerning the children's right to pursue asylum, the parents' ability to waive those rights, or any place on the form for the parents to actually execute such a waiver. The reason for this omission is apparent: the class notice was designed to advise\n   <em>\n    parents\n   </em>\n   of their\n   <em>\n    right to reunification\n   </em>\n   without having to take any action on their own or abandoning their own challenge to removal, and nothing more. The core allegations in\n   <em>\n    Ms. L.\n   </em>\n   focused on the constitutional violation caused by the Government's family separation policy, and the obligation of the Government to reunify the separated families to redress the wrong. The class notice, therefore, was not designed to advise parents of their childrens' asylum rights, let alone to waive those rights. It was about the right to reunify. The complete absence of any mention of the children's asylum rights on any of the forms at issue here dooms Defendants' waiver argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kirkpatrick v. Chappell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266875\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/1047/#p1055\">\n    872 F.3d 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1055 (9th Cir. 2017) (stating \"knowing, voluntary, and intelligent requirement\" that applies to waivers means the waiver must be \"made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Defendants hinge their waiver argument on two statements in the election form. First, the form states: \"IF YOU LOSE YOUR CASE AND THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO REMOVE YOU FROM THE UNITED STATES, you must decide at that time whether you want your child to leave the United States with you.\" Next, the form prompts those parents to choose from one of three options: (1) to be removed with child, (2) to be removed without child, or (3) if undecided, \"to talk with a lawyer before deciding\" whether to be removed with or without child. Based on that language, Defendants argue the election form was \"designed to allow the parent to make the election whether to forego any separate relief their child may have and return home together[.]\" (ECF No. 169 at 3.) However, as discussed above, that is simply not the case. The class notice and election form were not designed for that purpose; they focused solely on the parents' reunification rights, not the childrens' rights, and certainly not on any waiver of those rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On the present record, Defendants have not met their burden of showing that the parents' execution of either the government form or the election form provided with the class notice effected a waiver of their children's asylum rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Orantes-Hernandez v.

With this ruling, the TRO in\n    <em>\n     Ms. L.\n    </em>\n    is moot, and will be denied in a separate order to be filed in that case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Importantly, Defendants do not argue, either here or in\n    <em>\n     Ms. L.\n    </em>\n    , that they wish to remove parents with final removal orders without their children. Rather, Defendants appear to be seeking removal of parents and children together. The only dispute here is whether those removals should occur now or at a later time.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Plaintiffs point out that families apprehended at or near the border prior to the zero tolerance policy would have gone through \u00a7 235 proceedings together. (Mem. of Law in Supp. of Pls.' Application for TRO and Prelim. Inj. at 16, ECF No. 6-1.) In those family proceedings, the asylum officer would make credible fear determinations as to both parent and child, and if one received a positive credible fear finding, that finding would inure to the benefit of the other. (Pls.' Supp. Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. for TRO, Ex. A (Decl. of Shalyn Fluharty) \u00b6\u00b6 3-5, ECF No. 33.) Plaintiffs note this is important because the credible fear determinations for parents and children are different. In analyzing the parent's claim, the asylum officer considers whether the parent has been targeted with persecution on account of a reason other than race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular group. In considering the children's claim, the inquiry may be broader in that their \"particular social group\" may \"be comprised of 'immediate family members' of their\" parent. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 3.) If, during this process, either the parent or child receives a credible fear finding, both parent and child are taken out of expedited removal proceedings and placed in proceedings under \u00a7 240. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 4.) However, if neither parent nor child receives a positive credible fear finding, both are subject to expedited removal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Executive Order, Affording Congress an Opportunity to Address Family Separation \u00a7 1,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203046068\">\n     2018 WL 3046068\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (June 20, 2018) (stating it is \"the policy of this Administration to maintain family unity, including by detaining alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Defendants also raised this argument in their opposition to the motion to stay in the\n    <em>\n     Ms. L.\n    </em>\n    case. (\n    <em>\n     See Ms. L.\n    </em>\n    , ECF No. 177 at 18-23.) Because the jurisdictional issue presented in that case is the same as the one presented here, the Court incorporates the parties' arguments and briefing from\n    <em>\n     Ms. L.\n    </em>\n    into this discussion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    In light of this conclusion the Court declines to address at this time Plaintiffs' other claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Unlike in\n    <em>\n     Ms. L.\n    </em>\n    , Plaintiffs here did not move for class certification in conjunction with their request for TRO. Defendants, however, did not object to providing classwide relief other than on Plaintiffs' claim under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201252\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e)(3). That claim remains pending before Judge Friedman in the district court for District of Columbia, and thus, that issue is more appropriately addressed to him. To the extent there is any objection to providing classwide relief here, the Court notes the reasoning behind certification of the class in\n    <em>\n     Ms. L.\n    </em>\n    would seem to apply equally here.\n    <em>\n     See Ms. L. v. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 82.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Consistent with the Court's Orders in\n    <em>\n     Ms. L.\n    </em>\n    , it appears Plaintiffs' asylum claims would be more appropriately addressed under \u00a7 235 since Plaintiffs were not truly \"unaccompanied\" minors warranting removal proceedings under \u00a7 240. Nevertheless, the Court reserves ruling on that issue pending guidance from the parties on how they wish to proceed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
