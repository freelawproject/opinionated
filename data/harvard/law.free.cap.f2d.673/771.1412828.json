A police officer was called; he arrested plaintiff and took her to the police station for booking. The shoplifting charges were subsequently dropped because no representative of the store appeared for the criminal trial.</p>\n<p id=\"Aea\">Plaintiff\u2019s contention that defendant\u2019s conduct was state action because de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>fendant was performing a function \u201cexclusively reserved to the state\u201d and was detaining her pursuant to La.Code Crim.P. Ann. art. 215 (West Supp.1982) are foreclosed by our decision in <em>White v. Scrivner Corp., </em>594 F.2d 140, 142-43 (5th Cir. 1979). In order to establish the requisite state action, plaintiff had to prove a \u201ccustomary\u201d or \u201cpre-existing\u201d arrangement between defendant and the police for detaining suspected shoplifters. <em>White v. Scrivner Corp., </em>594 F.2d at 143; <em>Smith v. Brookshire Bros., </em>519 F.2d 93, 94 (5th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 915, 96 S.Ct. 1115, 47 L.Ed.2d 320 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Plaintiff presented absolutely no evidence of such an arrangement. Plaintiffs own evidence demonstrated that defendant\u2019s employees called the police. Defendant\u2019s assistant chief of security, called as an adverse witness, testified that the police officer made his own investigation of the incident: the officer interviewed defendant\u2019s employees and plaintiff, wrote out his own report, and made his own determination concerning arrest. Plaintiff herself admitted that the police officer asked her questions. Plaintiff\u2019s only other witness on this issue, the arresting police officer, had no independent recollection of the arrest, but he testified that it had been his custom and he had understood it to be his duty to make an independent determination whether there was cause to arrest. He also testified that he customarily wrote out his own report of the shoplifting incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Plaintiff argues that there was evidence of an arrangement with the police because the police officer relied on a report prepared by defendant. Unless he were an eye-witness, a police officer could not make any arrest if he could not rely on information provided by citizens who witnessed the events. Such reliance does not convert the informing party into a state actor. Plaintiff\u2019s reliance on <em>Smith v. Brookshire Bros., supra, </em>is thus misplaced. The vice in <em>Smith </em>was that the police, pursuant to a \u201cpreconceived plan,\u201d would arrest any person merely because he was designated for arrest by the store owner. <em>See </em>519 F.2d at 94-95; <em>see also Duriso v. K-Mart, </em>559 F.2d 1274, 1277-78 (5th Cir. 1977). There was no similar abdication of state authority shown here; the uncontradicted evidence was that the police officer made his own determination of cause to arrest. <em>See White v. Scrivner, </em>594 F.2d at 143-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">Thus, there was no \u201csubstantial evidence opposed to the motion[]\u201d for directed verdict, <em>Boeing Co. v. Shipman, </em>411 F.2d 365, 374 (5th Cir. 1969) (en banc); there was no evidence opposed to the motion at all.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b868-6\"> The district court characterized its action as dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Compare Menchaca v. Chrysler Credit Corp., </em>613 F.2d 507, 511 (5th Cir.) (state action is a jurisdictional requirement for suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 953, 101 S.Ct. 358, 66 L.Ed.2d 217 (1980), <em>with Williamson v. Tucker, </em>645 F.2d 404, 415-16 (5th Cir.) (when jurisdictional requirement is also an element of plaintiffs claim, case should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction unless it appears from the <em>pleadings </em>that the claim is wholly insubstantial or frivolous), <em>cert. denied, </em>--- U.S. ---, 102 S.Ct. 396, 70 L.Ed.2d 212 (1981). If the issue for the court\u2019s determination were truly a question of jurisdiction, then our standard of review of the district court\u2019s determination would be merely the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard. <em>See Williamson, </em>645 F.2d at 413. Since the district court\u2019s action easily passes the much more demanding <em>Boeing </em>standard, however, we need not and do not decide whether any lesser standard of review would be appropriate. <em>Cf. Duriso, </em>559 F.2d at 1278 (applying <em>Boeing </em>standard to uphold jury finding of state action).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
