In considering such a motion, \u201cthe trial court must afford the party opposing the motion every inference which may properly be drawn from the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>presented, and the facts must be considered in a light most favorable to the nonmovant\u201d <em>(Szczerbiak v Pilat, </em>90 NY2d at 556; <em>see Cathey v Gartner, </em>15 AD3d 435, 436 [2005]). Under the circumstances presented here, the Supreme Court properly determined that there was no rational process by which the jury could find in favor of the plaintiff.
