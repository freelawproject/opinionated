There is no support in the record for her argument that the attorney influenced her to withdraw her motion. In any event, as an alternative holding, we conclude that there is no basis for reversal. Defendant concedes that her boilerplate motion did not establish good cause for a substitution, but argues that \u201can irreconcilable conflict had developed as soon as counsel called his client a liar.\u201d However, the conduct of counsel characterized as \u201ccalling his client a liar\u201d consisted of the attorney\u2019s permissible defense of his own performance <em>(see People v Nelson, </em>7 NY3d 883 [2006]), in which he described defendant\u2019s allegations as \u201cinaccurate,\u201d \u201cincorrect,\u201d and \u201cmisleading.\u201d Counsel appropriately brought these inaccuracies to the court\u2019s attention <em>(see People v DePallo, </em>96 NY2d 437, 441-442 [2001]). Moreover, counsel did not accuse his client of perjury or falsehood, impugn her credibility before a trier of fact <em>(compare People v Berroa, </em>99 NY2d 134 [2002]; <em>People v Darrett, 2 </em>AD3d 16 [2003]), or demonstrate any inability to continue providing effective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">Defendant\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of her adjudica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>tion as a persistent violent felony offender is not preserved for our review <em>(People v Rosen, </em>96 NY2d 329 [2001], <em>cert denied </em>534 US 899 [2001]), and we decline to review it in the interest of justice. As an alternative holding, we conclude that it is without merit <em>(see Almendarez-Torres v United States, </em>523 US 224 [1998]; <em>People v Leon, </em>10 NY3d 122, 126 [2008], <em>cert denied </em>554 US \u2014, 128 S Ct 2976 [2008]).
