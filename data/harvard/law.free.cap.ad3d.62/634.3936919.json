The plaintiff failed to show good cause for his failure since he admittedly made no attempt to serve the defendant within 120 days after the filing of the summons and complaint <em>(see Leader v Maroney, Ponzini &amp; Spencer, </em>97 NY2d at 105; <em>Valentin v Zaltsman, </em>39 AD3d 852 [2007]; <em>Riccio v Ghulam, </em>29 AD3d at 560).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Furthermore, the plaintiff failed to show that an extension of time to serve the defendant was warranted in the interest of justice in view of the lack of diligence shown by the plaintiff, including the one-year delay between the time the summons and complaint were filed and the time the cross motion to extend his time to serve the summons and complaint was made, the 91/2-month delay between the expiration of the statute of limitations and the defendant\u2019s receipt of notice of the action, the failure to make any showing of merit, and the lack of an excuse for the failure to effect timely service <em>(see Slate v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number><em>Schiavone Constr. Co., </em>4 NY3d 816, 817 [2005]; <em>American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v Schnabel Found. Co., </em>38 AD3d 580 [2007]; <em>Ortiz v Malik, </em>35 AD3d 560, 560-561 [2006]; <em>Meusa v BMW Fin.
