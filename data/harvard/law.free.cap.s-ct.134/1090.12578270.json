The question whether indicted defendants like the Kaleys are constitutionally entitled to a judicial re-determination of the grand jury's probable cause conclusion in a hearing to lift an asset restraint has a ready answer in the fundamental and historic commitment of the criminal justice system to entrust probable cause findings to a grand jury.

Allowing a judge to decide anew what the grand jury has already determined could result in two inconsistent findings governing different aspects of one criminal proceeding, with the same judge who found probable cause lacking presiding over a trial premised on its existence. That legal dissonance could not but undermine the criminal justice system's integrity, especially the grand jury's constitutional role.

Because the Government's interest in freezing potentially forfeitable assets without an adversarial hearing about the probable cause underlying criminal charges and the Kaleys' interest in retaining counsel of their own choosing are both substantial, the test's third prong is critical. It boils down to the \"probable value, if any,\" of a judicial hearing in uncovering mistaken grand jury probable cause findings. But when the legal standard is merely probable cause and the grand jury has already made that finding, a full-dress hearing will provide little benefit. See\n   <em>\n    Florida v.

A grand jury has already found probable cause to think that the Kaleys committed the offenses charged; that is why an indictment issued. No one doubts that those crimes are serious enough to trigger forfeiture. Similarly, no one contests that the assets in question derive from, or were used in committing, the offenses. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1096. The only question is whether the Kaleys are constitutionally entitled to a judicial re-determination of the conclusion the grand jury already reached: that probable cause supports this criminal prosecution (or alternatively put, that the prosecution is not \"baseless,\" as the Kaleys believe,\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1096).

If judicial review of the grand jury's probable cause determination is not warranted (as we have so often held) to put a defendant on trial or place her in custody, then neither is it needed to freeze her property. The grand jury that is good enough-reliable enough, protective enough-to inflict those other grave consequences through its probable cause findings must needs be adequate to impose this one too. Indeed,\n    <em>\n     Monsanto\n    </em>\n    already noted the absence of any reason to hold property seizures to different rules: As described earlier, the Court partly based its adoption of the probable cause standard on the incongruity of subjecting an asset freeze to any\n    stricter requirements than apply to an arrest or ensuing detention. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1108; 491 U.S., at 615,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217495\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/600/\">\n     109 S.Ct. 2657\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"[I]t would be odd to conclude that the Government may not restrain property\" on the showing often sufficient to \"restrain\n    <em>\n     persons\n    </em>\n    \"). By similar token, the probable cause standard, once selected, should work no differently for the single purpose of freezing assets than for all others.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fr7\" name=\"fr7\">\n      7\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    So the longstanding, unvarying rule of criminal procedure we have just described applies here as well: The grand jury's determination is conclusive.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    And indeed, the alternative rule the Kaleys seek would have strange and destructive consequences. The Kaleys here demand a do-over, except with a different referee. They wish a judge to decide anew the exact question the grand jury has already answered-whether there is probable cause to think the Kaleys committed the crimes charged. But suppose the judge performed that task and came to the opposite conclusion. Two inconsistent findings would then govern different aspects of one criminal proceeding: Probable cause would exist to bring the Kaleys to trial (and, if otherwise appropriate, hold them in prison), but not to restrain their property. And assuming the prosecutor continued to press the charges,\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fr8\" name=\"fr8\">\n      8\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    the same judge who found probable cause lacking would preside over a trial premised on its presence. That legal dissonance, if sustainable at all, could not but undermine the criminal justice system's integrity-and especially the grand jury's integral, constitutionally prescribed role. For in this new world, every prosecution involving a pre-trial asset freeze would potentially pit the judge against the grand jury as to the case's foundational issue.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fr9\" name=\"fr9\">\n      9\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The Kaleys counter (as does the dissent,\n    <em>\n     post,\n    </em>\n    at 1108 - 1109) that apparently inconsistent findings are not really so, because the prosecutor could have presented scantier evidence to the judge than he previously offered the grand jury. Suppose, for example, that at the judicial hearing the prosecutor put on only \"one witness instead of all five\"; then, the Kaleys maintain, the judge's decision of no probable cause would mean only that \"the Government did not satisfy its burden[ ] on that one day in time.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 12,\n    18; see Reply Brief 11-12. But we do not think that hypothetical solves the problem. As an initial matter, it does not foreclose a different fact pattern: A judge could hear the exact same evidence as the grand jury, yet respond to it differently, thus rendering what even the Kaleys must concede is a contradictory finding. And when the Kaleys' hypothetical\n    <em>\n     is\n    </em>\n    true, just what does it show? Consider that the prosecutor in their example has left home some of the witnesses he took to the grand jury-presumably because, as we later discuss, he does not yet wish to reveal their identities or likely testimony. See\n    <em>\n     infra,\n    </em>\n    at 1101 - 1102. The judge's ruling of no probable cause therefore would not mean that the grand jury was wrong: As the Kaleys concede, the grand jury could have heard more than enough evidence to find probable cause that they committed the crimes charged. The Kaleys would win at the later hearing despite, not because of, the case's true merits. And we would then see still less reason for a judge to topple the grand jury's (better supported) finding of probable cause.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fr10\" name=\"fr10\">\n      10\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Our reasoning so far is straightforward. We held in\n    <em>\n     Monsanto\n    </em>\n    that the probable cause standard governs the pre-trial seizure of forfeitable assets, even when they are needed to hire a lawyer. And we have repeatedly affirmed a corollary of that standard: A defendant has no right to judicial review of a grand jury's determination of probable cause to think a defendant committed a crime. In combination, those settled propositions signal defeat for the Kaleys because, in contesting the seizure of their property, they seek only to relitigate such a grand jury finding.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    <strong>\n     III\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    The Kaleys would have us undertake a different analysis, which they contend would lead to a different conclusion. They urge us to apply the balancing test of\n    <em>\n     Mathews v.

See Brief for Petitioners 32-64. Under that three-pronged test (reordered here for expositional purposes), a court must weigh (1) the burdens that a requested procedure would impose on the Government against (2) the private interest at stake, as viewed alongside (3) \"the risk of an erroneous deprivation\" of that interest without the procedure and \"the probable value, if any, of [the] additional ... procedural safeguard[ ].\"\n    <em>\n     Mathews,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n     424 U.S., at 335\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n     96 S.Ct. 893\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Stressing the importance of their interest in retaining chosen counsel, the Kaleys argue that the\n    <em>\n     Mathews\n    </em>\n    balance tilts hard in their favor. It thus overrides-or so the Kaleys claim-all we have previously held about the finality of grand jury findings, entitling them to an evidentiary hearing before a judge to contest the probable cause underlying the indictment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    The Government battles with the Kaleys over whether\n    <em>\n     Mathews\n    </em>\n    has any application to this case. This Court devised the test, the Government notes, in an administrative\n    setting-to decide whether a Social Security recipient was entitled to a hearing before her benefits were terminated. And although the Court has since employed the approach in other contexts, the Government reads\n    <em>\n     Medina v. California,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481180\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/437/\">\n     505 U.S. 437\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481180\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/437/\">\n     112 S.Ct. 2572\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481180\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/437/\">\n     120 L.Ed.2d 353\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1992), as foreclosing its use here. In that case, we held that \"the\n    <em>\n     Mathews\n    </em>\n    balancing test does not provide the appropriate framework for assessing the validity of state procedural rules which ... are part of the criminal process,\" reasoning that because the \"Bill of Rights speaks in explicit terms to many aspects of criminal procedure,\" the Due Process Clause \"has limited operation\" in the field.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481180\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/437/\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481180\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/437/\">\n     at 443\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481180\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/437/\">\n     112 S.Ct. 2572\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . That settles that, asserts the Government. See Brief for United States 18. But the Kaleys argue that\n    <em>\n     Medina\n    </em>\n    addressed a\n    <em>\n     State's\n    </em>\n    procedural rule and relied on federalism principles not implicated here. Further, they claim that\n    <em>\n     Medina\n    </em>\n    concerned a criminal proceeding proper, not a collateral action seizing property. See Reply Brief 1-5. As to that sort of action, the Kaleys contend,\n    <em>\n     Mathews\n    </em>\n    should govern.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    We decline to address those arguments, or to define the respective reach of\n    <em>\n     Mathews\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Medina,\n    </em>\n    because we need not do so. Even if\n    <em>\n     Mathews\n    </em>\n    applied here-even if, that is, its balancing inquiry were capable of trumping this Court's repeated admonitions that the grand jury's word is conclusive-the Kaleys still would not be entitled to the hearing they seek. That is because the\n    <em>\n     Mathews\n    </em>\n    test tips against them, and so only reinforces what we have already said. As we will explain, the problem for the Kaleys comes from\n    <em>\n     Mathews\n    </em>\n    ' prescribed inquiry into the requested procedure's usefulness in correcting erroneous deprivations of their private interest. In light of\n    <em>\n     Monsanto\n    </em>\n    's holding that a seizure of the Kaleys' property is erroneous only if unsupported by probable cause, the added procedure demanded here is not sufficiently likely to make any difference.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    To begin the\n    <em>\n     Mathews\n    </em>\n    analysis, the Government has a substantial interest in freezing potentially forfeitable assets without an evidentiary hearing about the probable cause underlying criminal charges. At the least, such an adversarial proceeding-think of it as a pre-trial mini-trial (or maybe a pre-trial not-so-mini-trial)-could consume significant prosecutorial time and resources. The hearing presumably would rehearse the case's merits, including the Government's theory and supporting evidence. And the Government also might have to litigate a range of ancillary questions relating to the conduct of the hearing itself (for example, could the Kaleys subpoena witnesses or exclude certain evidence?).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Still more seriously, requiring a proceeding of that kind could undermine the Government's ability either to obtain a conviction or to preserve forfeitable property. To ensure a favorable result at the hearing, the Government could choose to disclose all its witnesses and other evidence. But that would give the defendant knowledge of the Government's case and strategy well before the rules of criminal procedure-or principles of due process, see,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Brady v.

And sometimes (particularly in organized crime and drug trafficking prosecutions, in which forfeiture questions often arise), that sneak preview might not just aid the defendant's preparations but also facilitate witness tampering\n    or jeopardize witness safety. Alternatively, to ensure the success of its prosecution, the Government could hold back some of its evidence at the hearing or give up on the pre-trial seizure entirely.

On each occasion, we relied on the same reasoning, stemming from our recognition that probable cause served only a gateway function: Given the relatively undemanding \"nature of the determination,\" the value of requiring\n    any additional \"formalities and safeguards\" would \"[i]n most cases ... be too slight.\"\n    <em>\n     Gerstein,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11642843\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/103/#p117\">\n     420 U.S., at 121-122\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11642843\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/103/#p117\">\n     95 S.Ct. 854\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    We can come out no differently here. The probable cause determinations the Kaleys contest are simply those underlying the charges in the indictment. No doubt the Kaleys could seek to poke holes in the evidence the Government offered the grand jury to support those allegations. No doubt, too, the Kaleys could present evidence of their own, which might cast the Government's in a different light. (Presumably, the Kaleys would try in those two ways to show that they did not steal, but instead lawfully obtained the medical devices they later resold. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1095 - 1096.) Our criminal justice system of course relies on such contestation at trial when the question becomes whether a defendant is guilty beyond peradventure. But as we have held before, an adversarial process is far less useful to the threshold finding of probable cause, which determines only whether adequate grounds exist to proceed to trial and reach that question. The probable cause decision, by its nature, is hard to undermine, and still harder to reverse. So the likelihood that a judge holding an evidentiary hearing will repudiate the grand jury's decision strikes us, once more, as \"too slight\" to support a constitutional requirement.\n    <em>\n     Gerstein,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11642843\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/103/#p117\">\n     420 U.S., at 122\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11642843\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/103/#p117\">\n     95 S.Ct. 854\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    The evidence from other courts corroborates that view, over and over and over again. In the past two decades, the courts in several Circuits have routinely held the kind of hearing the Kaleys seek. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1095, and n. 4. Yet neither the Kaleys nor their\n    <em>\n     amici\n    </em>\n    (mostly lawyers' associations) have found a single case in which a judge found an absence of probable cause to believe that an indicted defendant committed the crime charged. One\n    <em>\n     amicus\n    </em>\n    cites 25 reported cases involving pre-trial hearings on asset freezes. See Brief for New York Council of Defense Lawyers 4, n. 2. In 24 of those, the defendant lost outright. The last involved a not-yet-indicted defendant (so no grand jury finding); there, the District Court's ruling for him was reversed on appeal. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 15, 36. To be sure, a kind of selection bias might affect those statistics: Perhaps a prosecutor with a very weak case would choose to abandon an asset freeze rather than face a difficult hearing. See\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 16, 37. But the Kaleys and their\n    <em>\n     amici\n    </em>\n    have also failed to offer any anecdotes of that kind; and we suspect that the far more common reason a prosecutor relinquishes a freeze is just to avoid premature discovery. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1101 - 1102. So experience, as far as anyone has discerned it, cuts against the Kaleys: It confirms that even under\n    <em>\n     Mathews,\n    </em>\n    they have no right to revisit the grand jury's finding.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fr14\" name=\"fr14\">\n      14\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    <strong>\n     IV\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    When we decided\n    <em>\n     Monsanto,\n    </em>\n    we effectively resolved this case too. If the question in a pre-trial forfeiture case is whether there is probable cause to think the defendant committed the crime alleged, then the answer is: whatever the grand jury decides. And even if we test that proposition by applying\n    <em>\n     Mathews,\n    </em>\n    we arrive at the same place: In considering such findings of probable cause, we have never thought the value of enhanced evidentiary procedures worth their costs. Congress of course may strike its own balance and give defendants like the Kaleys the kind of hearing they want. Indeed, Congress could disapprove of\n    <em>\n     Monsanto\n    </em>\n    itself and hold pre-trial seizures of property to a higher standard than probable cause. But the Due Process Clause, even when combined with a defendant's Sixth Amendment interests, does not command those results. Accordingly, the Kaleys cannot challenge the grand jury's conclusion that probable cause supports the charges against them. The grand jury gets the final word.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    We therefore affirm the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    <em>\n     It is so ordered.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    <strong>\n     Chief Justice ROBERTS, with whom Justice BREYER and Justice SOTOMAYOR join, dissenting.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    An individual facing serious criminal charges brought by the United States has little but the Constitution and his attorney standing between him and prison. He might readily give all he owns to defend himself.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    We have held, however, that the Government may effectively remove a defendant's primary weapon of defense-the attorney he selects and trusts-by freezing assets he needs to pay his lawyer. That ruling is not at issue. But today the Court goes further, holding that a defendant may be hobbled in this way without an opportunity to challenge the Government's decision to freeze those needed assets. I cannot subscribe to that holding and respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    <strong>\n     I\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    The facts of this case are important. They highlight the significance to a defendant of being able to hire his counsel of choice, and the potential for unfairness inherent in giving the prosecutor the discretion to take that right away. Kerri Kaley worked as a sales representative for a Johnson &amp; Johnson subsidiary, selling prescription medical devices. Kaley and other sales representatives occasionally obtained outmoded or surplus devices from staff members at the medical facilities they served, when, for example, those devices were no longer needed because they had been superseded by newer models. Kaley sold the unwanted devices to a Florida company, dividing the proceeds among the sales representatives.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Kaley learned in January 2005 that a federal grand jury was investigating those activities as a conspiracy to sell stolen prescription medical devices. Kaley and her husband (who allegedly helped ship the products to Florida) retained counsel, who immediately set to work preparing their defense against any impending charges. Counsel regularly discussed the investigation with the Kaleys, helped review documents demanded by the grand\n    jury, and met with prosecutors in an attempt to ward off an indictment. Nonetheless preparing for the worst, the Kaleys applied for a $500,000 equity line of credit on their home to pay estimated legal fees associated with a trial. They used that money to purchase a $500,000 certificate of deposit, which they set aside until it would be needed to pay their attorneys for the trial.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    In February 2007, the grand jury returned a seven-count indictment charging the Kaleys and another sales representative, Jennifer Gruenstrass, with violations of federal law. The indictment alleged that a \"money judgment\" of over $2 million and the $500,000 certificate of deposit were subject to forfeiture under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20981\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 981\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(1)(C) because those assets constituted \"proceeds\" of the alleged crimes. Armed with this indictment, the prosecution obtained an\n    <em>\n     ex parte\n    </em>\n    order pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20853\">\n     21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e), thereby freezing all of the Kaleys' assets listed in the indictment, including the certificate of deposit set aside for legal fees. The Government did not seek to freeze any of Gruenstrass's assets.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    The Kaleys moved to vacate the order, requesting a hearing at which they could argue that there was no probable cause to believe their assets were forfeitable, because their alleged conduct was not criminal. They argued they were entitled to such a hearing because the restraining order targeted funds they needed and had set aside to retain for trial the same counsel who had been preparing their defense for two years. And they contended that the prosecution was baseless because the Government could not identify anyone who claimed ownership of the medical devices alleged to have been \"stolen.\" During a telephone conference with a Magistrate Judge on the motion, the prosecution conceded that it had been able to trace only $140,000 in allegedly criminal proceeds to the Kaleys, which led the Magistrate Judge to question the lawfulness of restraining the listed assets.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Just two business days after that conference, the Government obtained a superseding indictment that added a count of conspiracy to commit money laundering under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201956\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (h). Adding that charge enabled the Government to proceed under a much broader forfeiture provision than the one in the original indictment. While the civil forfeiture provision in \u00a7 981(a)(1)(C) authorized forfeiture of property that \"constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to\" a qualifying criminal violation, the criminal forfeiture provision now invoked by the Government- \u00a7 982(a)(1)-authorizes forfeiture of property \"involved in\" a qualifying offense, or \"any property traceable to such property.\" The superseding indictment alleged that a sum of more than $2 million, the certificate of deposit reserved to pay legal expenses, and now the Kaleys' home were subject to forfeiture. And again, the Government sought an order freezing substantially all those assets.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    The Kaleys objected, repeating the arguments they had previously raised, and also contending that the prosecutors were being vindictive in adding the money laundering charge and seeking broader forfeiture. The District Court nonetheless entered the broader order requested by the Government, and the restraint on the Kaleys' assets remains in place.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    While the Kaleys' appeal from that denial was pending, the Government proceeded to trial separately against their codefendant Gruenstrass. As the Government had not sought to freeze Gruenstrass's assets, she was represented by her chosen counsel. Her counsel argued that the Government was pitching a fraud without a victim, because no Government witness\n    took the stand to claim ownership of the allegedly stolen devices. The jury acquitted Gruenstrass on all charges in less than three hours-a good omen for the Kaleys and their counsel as they prepared for their own trial.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    <strong>\n     II\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The issues at stake here implicate fundamental constitutional principles. The Sixth Amendment provides that \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\" In many ways, this is the most precious right a defendant has, because it is his attorney who will fight for the other rights the defendant enjoys.\n    <em>\n     United States v.

The majority's reasoning goes like this: First, to freeze assets prior to trial, the Government must show probable cause to believe that a defendant has committed an offense giving rise to forfeiture. Second, grand jury determinations of probable cause are nonreviewable. Therefore, the Kaleys cannot \"relitigate [the] grand jury finding\" of probable cause to avoid a pretrial restraint of assets they need to retain their counsel of choice.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318776\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/279/#p310\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    I do not view the matter as nearly so \"straightforward,\" and neither did the multiple Courts of Appeals since\n    <em>\n     Monsanto\n    </em>\n    that have granted defendants the type of hearing the Kaleys request.

To freeze assets prior to trial, the Government must show probable cause to believe both that (1) a defendant has committed an offense giving rise to forfeiture and (2) the targeted assets have the requisite connection to the alleged criminal conduct.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20853\">\n     21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e)(1)(A).

But by listing property in the indictment and alleging that it is subject to forfeiture-as required to restrain assets before trial under \u00a7 853(e)(1)(A)-the grand jury found probable cause to believe those assets were linked to the charged offenses, just as it found probable cause to believe the Kaleys committed the underlying crimes.

Neither the Government nor the majority gives any reason why the District Court may reconsider the grand jury's probable cause finding as to traceability-and in fact constitutionally\n    <em>\n     must,\n    </em>\n    if asked-but may not do so as to the underlying charged offenses.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fr16\" name=\"fr16\">\n      2\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    In any event, the hearing the Kaleys seek would not be mere relitigation of the grand jury proceedings. At that hearing, the District Court would consider the merits\n    of the prosecution to determine whether there is probable cause to believe the Kaleys' assets are forfeitable, not to determine whether the Kaleys may be tried at all. If the judge agrees with the Kaleys, he will merely hold that the Government has not met its burden at that hearing to justify freezing the assets the Kaleys need to pay their attorneys. The Government may proceed with the prosecution, but the Kaleys will have their chosen counsel at their side.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Even though the probable cause standard applies at both the indictment stage and the pretrial asset restraint hearing, the judge's determination will be based on different evidence than that previously presented to the grand jury. For its part, the Government may choose to put on more or less evidence at the hearing than it did before the grand jury. And of course the Kaleys would have the opportunity to tell their side of the story-something the grand jury never hears. See\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Here, much of what the Kaleys want to present comes from Gruenstrass's trial-evidence that the grand jury obviously could not have considered. So even if the judge determined that probable cause to justify the pretrial asset restraint had not been adequately established, that determination would not in any way amount to \"looking into and revising the judgment of the grand jury upon the evidence, for the purpose of determining whether or not the finding was founded upon sufficient proof.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1097 (quoting\n    <em>\n     Costello v.

The judge's decision based on the evidence presented at the hearing would have no necessary legal or logical consequence for the underlying prosecution because it would be based on different evidence and used for a different purpose.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    The majority warns that allowing a judge to consider the underlying merits of the prosecution for purposes of determining whether a defendant's assets may be restrained pretrial could create \"legal dissonance\" with the grand jury's indictment, which \"could not but undermine the criminal justice system's integrity.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1099. But as explained, such a judicial finding based on different evidence with both sides present would not contradict the grand jury's probable cause finding based on what was before it. That finding would still suffice to accomplish\n    <em>\n     its\n    </em>\n    purpose-to call for a trial on the merits of the charges. Rather than creating \"dissonance,\" the traditional roles of the principal actors in our justice system would remain respected: The grand jury decides whether a defendant should be required to stand trial, the judge decides pretrial matters and how the trial should proceed, and the jury decides whether the defendant is guilty of the crime.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Indeed, in the bail context-the pretrial determination that is perhaps the closest analogue to the pretrial restraint of assets at issue here-we allow judicial inquiries into the underlying merits of the indicted charges, without concern about intruding into the province of the grand jury. An indictment charging sufficiently serious crimes gives rise to a rebuttable presumption that a defendant is not eligible for pretrial release. See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203142\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3142\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e)(3) and (f). Such a defendant is nonetheless entitled to an evidentiary hearing at which he may contest (among other things) \"the weight of the evidence against\" him, \u00a7 3142(g)(2). Yet no one would say that the district court encroached on the grand jury's role if the court determined that it would not authorize pretrial detention because of the weakness\n    of the prosecution's case. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v. Hurtado,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1539668\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/779/1467/#p1479\">\n     779 F.2d 1467\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1479-1480 (C.A.11 1985) (recognizing that in considering the \"weight of the evidence\" to decide whether the presumption is rebutted, \"it may well be necessary to open up the issue of probable cause since that too is a question of evidentiary weight\"). That makes sense, because the district court has considered the underlying merits of the charges based on different information and for a different purpose than the grand jury did. Such a defendant would be granted pretrial release, but would still have to show up for trial.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fr17\" name=\"fr17\">\n      3\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    In any event, few things could do more to \"undermine the criminal justice system's integrity,\"\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1099, than to allow the Government to initiate a prosecution and then, at its option, disarm its presumptively innocent opponent by depriving him of his counsel of choice-without even an opportunity to be heard.

Williams,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179579\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/501/#p503\">\n     425 U.S. 501\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 503,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179579\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/501/#p503\">\n     96 S.Ct. 1691\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179579\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/501/#p503\">\n     48 L.Ed.2d 126\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1976). Whatever serious\n    crimes the grand jury alleges the Kaleys committed, they are presumptively innocent of those charges until final judgment. Their right to vindicate that presumption by choosing the advocate they believe will best defend them is, as explained, at the very core of the Sixth Amendment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    I suspect that, for the Kaleys, that right could hardly be more precious than it is now. In addition to potentially losing the property the Government has already frozen-including their home-the Kaleys face maximum prison terms of five years (\n    <extracted-citation index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ), ten years (\u00a7 2314), and 20 years (\u00a7 1956(h)) for the charges in the superseding indictment. The indictment means they must stand trial on those charges. But the Kaleys plainly have an urgent interest in having their chosen counsel-who has worked with them since the grand jury's investigation began, two years before the indictment-mount their best possible defense at trial.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    The majority alludes to our cases recognizing that indictments may result in the temporary deprivation of a defendant's liberty without judicial review, and suggests that indictments therefore must also be \"good enough\" to deprive a defendant of property without judicial review.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1098 - 1099. Even if this greater-includes-the-lesser reasoning might be valid in other contexts, it is not when the property at issue is needed to hire chosen counsel. In the context of a prosecution for serious crimes, it is far from clear which interest is greater-the interest in temporary liberty pending trial, or the interest in using one's available means to avoid imprisonment for many years after trial. Retaining one's counsel of choice ensures the fundamental fairness of the actual trial, and thus may be far more valuable to a criminal defendant than pretrial release.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    As for the Government's side, the Court echoes the Government's concerns that a hearing would place demands on its resources and interfere with its desire to keep its trial strategy close to the vest. These concerns are somewhat curious in light of the majority's emphasis on how easy it is to make a probable cause showing. And they are even more surprising in light of the extensive discovery obligations already imposed on the Government by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16 and\n    <em>\n     Brady v. Maryland,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n     373 U.S. 83\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n     83 S.Ct. 1194\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n     10 L.Ed.2d 215\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1963). The emphasis the Government places on pretrial secrecy evokes an outdated conception of the criminal trial as \"a poker game in which players enjoy an absolute right always to conceal their cards until played.\"\n    <em>\n     Williams v. Florida,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168686\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/78/#p82\">\n     399 U.S. 78\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 82,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168686\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/78/#p82\">\n     90 S.Ct. 1893\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168686\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/78/#p82\">\n     26 L.Ed.2d 446\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1970).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Moreover, recall that the Government concedes that due process guarantees defendants a hearing to contest the traceability of the restrained assets to the charged conduct. If a defendant requests such a hearing, the Government will likely be required to reveal something about its case to demonstrate that the assets have the requisite connection to the charged offenses.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    In any event, these concerns are exaggerated. What the Government would be required to show in a pretrial restraint hearing is similar to pretrial showings prosecutors make in other contexts on a daily basis. As mentioned above, when the Government seeks an order detaining a defendant pending trial, it routinely makes an extensive evidentiary showing-voluntarily disclosing much of its evidence and trial strategy-in support of that relief. See Brief for California Attorneys for Criminal Justice as\n    <em>\n     Amicus Curiae\n    </em>\n    11-18. The Government makes similar showings in the context of other pretrial motions, such as motions to admit hearsay evidence under the co-conspirator exception, or to\n    discover attorney-client communications made in furtherance of a future crime.\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 19-28.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    In those contexts, as in this one, the decision how much to \"show its hand\" rests fully within the Government's discretion. If it has a strong case and believes that pretrial restraint is necessary to preserve the assets for forfeiture, the Government may choose to make a strong evidentiary showing and have little concern about doing so. In a closer case, where the Government is more concerned about tipping its hand, it may elect to forgo a pretrial restraint of those assets the defendant needs to pay his counsel. I see no great burden on the Government in allowing it to strike this balance as it sees fit when considering a pretrial asset restraint that would deprive a defendant of his right to counsel of choice. In the end, it is a bit much to argue that the Government has discretion to deprive a defendant-without a hearing-of the counsel he has chosen to present his defense, simply to avoid the mere possibility of a premature peek at some aspect of what the Government intends to do at trial.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    The majority also significantly underestimates the amount of control judges can exercise in these types of hearings. The Circuits that allow such hearings have afforded judges a great deal of flexibility in structuring them. Judges need not apply the Federal Rules of Evidence during the hearings, and they can take many steps, including\n    <em>\n     in camera\n    </em>\n    proceedings, to ensure that witness safety and grand jury secrecy are fully preserved. See\n    <em>\n     Monsanto,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10546934\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/924/1186/#p1197\">\n     924 F.2d, at 1198\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     United States v.

See Brief for New York Council of Defense Lawyers as\n    <em>\n     Amicus Curiae\n    </em>\n    4-9. As the majority notes, only 25 reported cases appear to have addressed such hearings.\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 4. This relative rarity is unsurprising. To even be entitled to the hearing, defendants must first show a genuine need to use the assets to retain counsel of choice. See\n    <em>\n     United States v. Bonventre,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057680\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/126/#p131\">\n     720 F.3d 126\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 131 (C.A.2 2013). And defendants too have an incentive not to tip their hands as to trial strategy-perhaps to an even greater extent than the Government, given that defendants bear comparatively few discovery obligations at a criminal trial. In light of the low bar of the probable cause standard, many defendants likely conclude that the possible benefits of the hearing are not worth the candle.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    For those hearings that do occur, they are by all appearances ably controlled by district judges to keep them manageable and to limit the potential for excess or abuse. See Brief for New York Council of Defense Lawyers as\n    <em>\n     Amicus Curiae\n    </em>\n    6-8.

We simply see no reason to treat a grand jury's probable cause determination as conclusive for all other purposes (including, in some circumstances, locking up the defendant), but not for the one at issue here.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"8.\">\n    <p id=\"p-117\">\n     A prosecutor, of course, might drop the case because of the court's ruling, especially if he thought that decision would bring into play an ethical standard barring any charge \"that the prosecutor knows is not supported by probable cause.\" ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct 3.8(a) (2013). But then the court would have effectively done what we have long held it cannot: overrule the grand jury on whether to bring a defendant to trial.

But the tracing of assets is a technical matter far removed from the grand jury's core competence and traditional function-to determine whether there is probable cause to think the defendant committed a crime. And a judge's finding that assets are not traceable to the crime charged in no way casts doubt on the prosecution itself. So that determination does not similarly undermine the grand jury or create internal contradictions within the criminal justice system.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"10.\">\n    <p id=\"p-119\">\n     The dissent claims as well that the hearing the Kaleys seek \"would not be mere relitigation\" of the grand jury's decision because they could now \"tell their side of the story.\"\n     <em>\n      Post,\n     </em>\n     at 1109. But the same could be said of an adversarial hearing on an indictment's validity, which everyone agrees is impermissible because it \"look[s] into and revise[s]\" the grand jury's judgment.

The lesson of our precedents, as described above, is that a grand jury's finding is \"conclusive\"-and thus precludes subsequent proceedings on the same matter-even though not arising from adversarial testing.

That provision is intended to aid the Government in recovering funds transferred to a third party-here, the Kaleys' lawyer-subsequent to the crime. But forfeiture applies only to specific assets, so in the likely event that the third party has spent the money, the Government must resort to a State's equitable remedies-which may or may not even be available-to force him to disgorge an equivalent amount. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 48-49. And indeed, if the Government\n     <em>\n      could\n     </em>\n     easily recover such monies, then few lawyers would agree to represent defendants like the Kaleys, and the dissent's proposed holding would be for naught.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"12.\">\n    <p id=\"p-121\">\n     Compare Cassella, Criminal Forfeiture Procedure,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"267\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20Am.%20J.%20Crim.%20L.%2055\">\n      32 Am.

The dissent argues only that a hearing will have \"probable value\" for the Kaleys because \"the deprivation of [their] right\" to chosen counsel, once accomplished, is \"effectively permanent.\"\n     <em>\n      Post,\n     </em>\n     at 1113 - 1114. But that argument confuses two different parts of the\n     <em>\n      Mathews\n     </em>\n     inquiry. The dissent's point well underscores the importance of the Kaleys' interest: As we have readily acknowledged, if the grand jury made a mistake, the Kaleys have suffered a serious injury, which cannot later be corrected. See\n     <em>\n      supra,\n     </em>\n     at 1102 - 1103. (We note, though, that the dissent, in asserting that injury's uniqueness, understates the losses that always attend a mistaken indictment, which no ultimate verdict can erase.) But the dissent's argument about what is at stake for the Kaleys says nothing about the crucial, last prong of\n     <em>\n      Mathews,\n     </em>\n     which asks whether and to what extent the adversarial procedures they request will in fact correct any grand jury errors. That part of the analysis is what requires our decision, and the dissent's view that the Government overreached in this particular case cannot overcome it.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"1.\">\n    <p id=\"p-124\">\n     Because the District Court in\n     <em>\n      Monsanto\n     </em>\n     had imposed the restraining order after an \"extensive, 4-day hearing on the question of probable cause,\" it was \"pointless\" for this Court to decide whether a hearing was required to \"adequately establish[ ]\" probable cause. 491 U.S., at 615, n. 10, 616,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217495\" index=\"274\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/600/\">\n      109 S.Ct. 2657\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"2.\">\n    <p id=\"p-125\">\n     The majority's only response is to characterize the grand jury's finding of traceability as merely a \"technical matter.\"\n     <em>\n      Ante,\n     </em>\n     at 1099, n. 9.
