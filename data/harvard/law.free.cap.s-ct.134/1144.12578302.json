The Air Force has granted an easement over two areas of the Base, with the result that two public highways traverse the Base. Adjacent to one of those highways is an area that the Government has designated for peaceful protests. The Base commander has enacted several restrictions to control the protest area and has issued an advisory stating that anyone who fails to adhere to the protest area policies may be barred from entering the Base.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Petitioner Apel was barred from the Base for trespassing and vandalism, but continued to enter the protest area. A Magistrate Judge convicted him of violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201382\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which makes it a crime to reenter a \"military ... installation\" after having been ordered not to do so \"by any officer or person in command.\" On appeal, the Federal District Court rejected Apel's defense that \u00a7 1382 does not apply to the designated protest area. The Ninth Circuit reversed. It held that because the easement through Vandenberg deprived the Government of exclusive possession, \u00a7 1382 did not cover the portion of the Base where Apel's protest occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em>\n    Held\n   </em>\n   : A \"military ... installation\" for purposes of \u00a7 1382 encompasses the commanding officer's area of responsibility, and it includes Vandenberg's highways and protest area. Pp. 1149 - 1154.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   (a) Contrary to Apel's argument, \u00a7 1382 does not require exclusive possession and control. The statute is written broadly to apply to many different kinds of military places, and nothing in its text defines those places in terms of the access granted to the public or the nature of the Government's possessory interest. See\n   <em>\n    United States v. Albertini,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1512545\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/472/675/#p682\">\n    472 U.S. 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 682,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1512545\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/472/675/#p682\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1512545\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/472/675/#p682\">\n    86 L.Ed.2d 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nor have military places been defined historically as land withdrawn from public use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The common feature of the places described in \u00a7 1382 is that they have defined boundaries and are subject to the command authority of a military officer. This conclusion is confirmed by\n   <em>\n    United States v. Phisterer,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5645112\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/94/219/#p222\">\n    94 U.S. 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 222,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5645112\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/94/219/#p222\">\n    24 L.Ed. 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which defined the term \"military station\" as a place \"where military duty is performed or military protection afforded.\" And while some Executive Branch documents have said that \u00a7 1382 requires exclusive possession, those opinions are nonbinding, and this Court has never held that the Government's reading of a criminal statute is entitled to any deference. Pp. 1150 - 1152.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   (b) Section 1382 applies to any place with a defined boundary that is under the command of a military officer. Apel contends that the highways and protest area are outside the Base because they lie outside fenced areas on the Base, but this argument assumes the conclusion. The United States has placed the entire Vandenberg property under the administration of the Air Force. The Air Force's choice to secure a portion of the Base more closely does not alter its boundaries or diminish its commander's jurisdiction. Apel's further contention that the highways and protest area are uncontrolled spaces where military operations are not performed is contrary to the record: The Base commander has enacted rules to restrict the manner of protests in the designated area and has publicly stated that persons barred from Vandenberg may not enter the Base to protest; the District Court found that the Government exercises substantial control over the protest area; the easement itself reserves to the Base commander the authority to restrict access to the entire Base when necessary and reserves to the United States rights of way for all purposes; and the Base commander has occasionally closed the highways to the public for security purposes or when conducting a military launch. In any event, \u00a7 1382 does not require base commanders to make continuous, uninterrupted use of a place within their jurisdiction, lest they lose authority to exclude certain individuals. Such a use-it-or-lose-it rule would frustrate the administration of military facilities, raise difficult questions for judges, and discourage commanders from opening portions of their bases for public convenience. Pp. 1151 - 1153.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (c) Apel's argument that the statute was unconstitutional as applied was not reached by the Ninth Circuit and, thus, is not addressed here.

The Base sits on land owned by the United States and administered by the Department of the Air Force. It is the site of sensitive missile and space launch facilities. The commander of Vandenberg has designated it a \"closed base,\" meaning that civilians may not enter without express permission. Memorandum for the General Public Re: Closed Base, from David J. Buck, Commander (Oct. 23, 2008), App. 51; see also 32 CFR \u00a7 809a.2(b) (2013) (\"Each [Air Force] commander is authorized to grant or deny access to their installations, and to exclude or remove persons whose presence is unauthorized\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    Although the Base is closed, the Air Force has granted to the County of Santa Barbara \"an easement for a right-of-way for a road or street\" over two areas within Vandenberg. Department of the Air Force, Easement for Road or Street No. DA-04-353-ENG-8284 (Aug. 20, 1962), App. 35. Pursuant to that easement, two state roads traverse the Base. Highway 1 (the Pacific Coast Highway) runs through the eastern part of the Base and provides a route between the towns of Santa Maria and Lompoc. Highway 246 runs through the southern part of the Base and allows access to a beach and a train station on Vandenberg's western edge. The State of California maintains and polices these highways as it does other state roads, except that its jurisdiction is merely \"concurrent\" with that of the Federal Government. Letter from Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr., to Joseph C. Zengerle, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (July 21, 1981), App. 40. The easement instrument states that use of the roads \"shall be subject to such rules and regulations as [the Base commander] may prescribe from time to time in order to properly protect the interests of the United States.\" Easement, App. 36. The United States also \"reserves to itself rights-of-way for all purposes\" that would not create \"unnecessary interference with ... highway purposes.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201382\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201382\">\n     at 37\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    As relevant to this case, Highway 1 runs northwest several miles inside Vandenberg until it turns northeast at a 90 degree angle.

In the east corner of this intersection there is a middle school. In the west corner there is a visitors' center and a public bus stop. A short way down California Boulevard is the main entrance to the operational areas of the Base where military personnel live and work. Those areas are surrounded by a fence and entered by a security checkpoint.

Memorandum for the General Public Re: Limited Permission for Peaceful Protest Activity Policy, from David J. Buck, Commander (Oct. 23, 2008), App. 57-58.

He was convicted for these actions, was sentenced to two months' imprisonment, and was barred from the Base for three years. In May 2007, Apel returned to Vandenberg to protest. When he trespassed again and was convicted, he received another order barring him from Vandenberg, this time permanently, unless he followed specified procedures \"to modify or revoke\" the order. Memorandum for John D. Apel Re: Barment Order (Oct. 22, 2007), App. 63-65. The only exception to the barment was limited permission from the Base commander for Apel to \" 'traverse', meaning to travel ... on [Highway] 1 and ... on [Highway] 246....

Apel appealed to the Federal District Court for the Central District of California.

It does not.

Not so. Historical sources are replete with references to military \"forts\" and \"posts\" that provided services to civilians, and were open for access by them.

But\n    <em>\n     Phisterer\n    </em>\n    only confirms our conclusion that \u00a7 1382 does not require exclusive use, possession, or control. For there we interpreted \"military station\" to mean \"a place where troops are assembled, where military stores, animate or inanimate, are kept or distributed, where military duty is performed or military protection afforded,-where something, in short, more or less closely connected with arms or war is kept or is to be done.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5645112\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/94/219/#p222\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5645112\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/94/219/#p222\">\n     at 222\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . To describe a place as \"more or less closely connected\" with military activities hardly requires that the military hold an exclusive right to the property.

And that, not coincidentally, is precisely how the term \"military\n    installation\" is used elsewhere in federal law.

Brief for Respondent 44-47. So they have, and that is a point in his favor. But those opinions are not intended to be binding. See Dept. of Justice, United States Attorneys' Manual \u00a7 1-1.100 (2009) (\"The Manual provides only internal Department of Justice guidance.

Their views may reflect overly cautious legal advice based on division in the lower courts. Or they may reflect legal error. Either way, we have never held that the Government's reading of a criminal statute is entitled to any deference. See\n    <em>\n     Crandon v.

Some are owned in fee, others are leased. Some are routinely open to the public, others are open for specific occasions or purposes, and no public access whatsoever is permitted on others. Many, including such well-known places as the Washington Navy Yard and the United States Air Force Academy, have roads running through them that are used freely by the public. Nothing in \u00a7 1382 or our history suggests that the statute does not apply to a military base under the command of the Air Force, merely because the Government has conveyed a limited right to travel through a portion of the base or to assemble in a particular area.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    <strong>\n     B\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Section 1382 is most naturally read to apply to places with a defined boundary under the command of a military officer. Apel argues, however, that Vandenberg's commander has no authority on the highways running through the Base or, apparently, in the designated protest area. His arguments more or less reduce to two contentions: that the highways and protest area lie \"outside the entrance to [a] closed military installation[ ],\" Brief for Respondent 22, and that they are \"uncontrolled\" spaces where \"no military operations are performed,\"\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 23. Neither contention is sound.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    First, to say that the highway and protest area are \"outside\" the Vandenberg installation is not a legal argument; it simply assumes the conclusion. Perhaps recognizing as much, Apel tacks: He suggests that because Vandenberg's operational facilities are surrounded by a fence and guarded by a security checkpoint, the Government has determined that it does\n    not control the rest of the Base. The problem with this argument is that the United States has placed the\n    <em>\n     entire\n    </em>\n    Vandenberg property under the administration of the Air Force, which has defined that property as an Air Force base and designated the Base commander to exercise jurisdiction. Federal law makes the commander responsible \"for the protection or security of\" \"property subject to the jurisdiction, administration, or in the custody of the Department of Defense.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20797\">\n     50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 797\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(2), (4); see also 32 CFR \u00a7 809a.2(a) (\"Air Force installation commanders are responsible for protecting personnel and property under their jurisdiction\"). And pursuant to that authority, the Base commander has issued an order closing the entire base to the public. Buck Memorandum Re: Closed Base, App. 51; see also 32 CFR \u00a7 809a.3 (\"any directive issued by the commander of a military installation or facility, which includes the parameters for authorized entry to or exit from a military installation, is legally enforceable against all persons\"). The fact that the Air Force chooses to secure a portion of the Base more closely-be it with a fence, a checkpoint, or a painted green line-does not alter the boundaries of the Base or diminish the jurisdiction of the military commander.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    As for Apel's claim that the protest area specifically is uncontrolled, the record is conclusively to the contrary. The Base commander \"at all times has retained authority and control over who may access the installation,\" including the protest area. Buck Memorandum Re: Protest Activity, App. 58. He has enacted rules to restrict the manner of protests in the designated area. Protest Advisory, App. 53. In particular, he requires two weeks' notice to schedule a protest and prohibits the distribution of pamphlets or leaflets.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20797\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20797\">\n     at 52-53\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Base commander has also publicly stated that persons who are barred from Vandenberg-for whatever reason-may not come onto the Base to protest.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20797\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20797\">\n     at 54\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . And the District Court found, after hearing testimony, that \"the Government exercises substantial control over the designated protest area, including, for example, patrolling the area.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 14a-15a. Apel has never disputed these facts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Instead Apel tells us that, by granting an easement, the military has \"relinquished its right to exclude civilians from Highway 1,\" Brief for Respondent 36, and that the easement does not \"permit[ ]\" use by the military,\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20797\">\n      id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20797\">\n     at 43\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . But the easement itself specifically reserves to Vandenberg's commander the authority to restrict access to the entire Base, including Highway 1, when necessary \"to properly protect the interests of the United States,\" and likewise \"reserves to [the United States] rights-of-way for all purposes.\" Easement, App. 36. We simply do not understand how Apel can claim that \"[n]othing in the easement contemplates, or even permits, military use or occupation; it provides for exclusive civil use and occupation.\" Brief for Respondent 43. Moreover, the Base commander, in an exercise of his command authority, has notified the public that use of the roads is \"limited to ... vehicular travel activity through the base,\" which does not include Apel's protest activity. See Buck Memorandum Re: Closed Base, App. 51.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Apel likewise offers no support for his contention that military functions do not occur on the easement highways. The Government has referred us to instances when the commander of Vandenberg has closed the highways to the public for security purposes or when conducting a military launch. Reply Brief 12, and n. 5; Tr. of Oral Arg. 8-9. In any event, there is no indication that Congress intended \u00a7 1382 to require base commanders to\n    make continuous, uninterrupted use of a place within their jurisdiction, lest they lose authority to exclude individuals who have vandalized military property and been determined to pose a threat to the order and security of the base.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    In sum, we decline Apel's invitation to require civilian judges to examine U.S. military sites around the world, parcel by parcel, to determine which have roads, which have fences, and which have a sufficiently important, persistent military purpose. The use-it-or-lose-it rule that Apel proposes would frustrate the administration of military facilities and raise difficult questions for judges, who are not expert in military operations. And it would discourage commanders from opening portions of their bases for the convenience of the public. We think a much better reading of \u00a7 1382 is that it reaches all property within the defined boundaries of a military place that is under the command of a military officer.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    <strong>\n     III\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Much of the rest of Apel's brief is devoted to arguing that \u00a7 1382 would be unconstitutional as applied to him on this Base. But the Court of Appeals never reached Apel's constitutional arguments, and we decline to do so in the first instance. Apel also attempts to repackage his First Amendment objections as a statutory interpretation argument based on constitutional avoidance. See Brief for Respondent 54 (\"the statute should be interpreted ... not to apply to peaceful protests on a public road outside of a closed military base over which an easement has been granted and that has been declared a protest zone\"). But we do not \"interpret\" statutes by gerrymandering them with a list of exceptions that happen to describe a party's case. \"The canon [of constitutional avoidance] is not a method of adjudicating constitutional questions by other means.\"\n    <em>\n     Clark v.
