It held that the degree of physical force required for a conviction to constitute a \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" is the same as that required for a \"violent felony\" under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i)-namely, violent force-and that Castleman could have been convicted for causing slight injury by nonviolent conduct.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-7\">\n  <em>\n   Held\n  </em>\n  : Castleman's conviction qualifies as a \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\" Pp. 1409 - 1416.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-8\">\n  (a) Section 922(g)(9)'s \"physical force\" requirement is satisfied by the degree of force that supports a common-law battery conviction-namely, offensive touching.

But\n  <em>\n   Johnson\n  </em>\n  resolves this case in the Government's favor: The very reasons for rejecting the common-law meaning in\n  <em>\n   Johnson\n  </em>\n  are reasons to embrace it here. First, whereas it was \"unlikely\" that Congress meant to incorporate in ACCA's \"violent felony\" definition \"a phrase that the common law gave peculiar meaning only in its definition of a misdemeanor,\"\n  <em>\n   id.,\n  </em>\n  at 141,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581927,12446767\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1265/\">\n   130 S.Ct. 1265\n  </extracted-citation>\n  , it is likely that Congress meant to incorporate the misdemeanor-specific meaning of \"force\" in defining a \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\" Second, whereas the word \"violent\" or \"violence\" standing alone \"connotes a substantial degree of force,\"\n  <em>\n   id.,\n  </em>\n  at 140,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581927,12446767\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1265/\">\n   130 S.Ct. 1265\n  </extracted-citation>\n  , that is not true of \"domestic violence,\" which is a term of art encompassing acts that one might not characterize as \"violent\" in a nondomestic context. Third, whereas this Court has hesitated to apply ACCA to \"crimes which, though dangerous, are not typically committed by those whom one normally labels 'armed career criminals,' \"\n  <em>\n   Begay v.

Castleman pleaded guilty to \"intentionally or knowingly caus[ing] bodily injury to\" the mother of his child, and the knowing or intentional causation of bodily injury necessarily involves the use of physical force. First, a \"bodily injury\" must result from \"physical force.\" The common-law concept of \"force\" encompasses even its indirect application, making it impossible to cause bodily injury without applying force in the common-law sense. Second, the knowing or intentional application of force is a \"use\" of force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Leocal v.

But he errs in arguing that although \"[p]oison may have 'forceful physical properties' as a matter of organic chemistry, ... no one would say that a poisoner 'employs' force or 'carries out a purpose by means of force' when he or she sprinkles poison in a victim's drink,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/\">\n     ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The \"use of force\" in Castleman's example is not the act of \"sprinkl[ing]\" the poison; it is the act of employing poison knowingly as a device to cause physical harm. That the harm occurs indirectly, rather than directly (as with a kick or punch), does not matter. Under Castleman's logic, after all, one could say that pulling the trigger on a gun is not a \"use of force\" because it is the bullet, not the trigger, that actually strikes the victim.\n   <em>\n    Leocal\n   </em>\n   held that the \"use\" of force must entail \"a higher degree of intent than negligent or merely accidental conduct,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/\">\n    543 U.S., at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; it did not hold that the word \"use\" somehow alters the meaning of \"force.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Because Castleman's indictment makes clear that the use of physical force was an element of his conviction, that conviction qualifies as a \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We are not persuaded by Castleman's nontextual arguments against our interpretation of \u00a7 922(g)(9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   First, Castleman invokes \u00a7 922(g)(9)'s legislative history to suggest that Congress could not have intended for the provision to apply to acts involving minimal force. But to the extent that legislative history can aid in the interpretation of this statute, Castleman's reliance on it is unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Castleman begins by observing that during the debate over \u00a7 922(g)(9), several Senators argued that the provision would help to prevent gun violence by perpetrators of severe domestic abuse. Senator Lautenberg referred to \"serious spousal or child abuse\" and to \"violent individuals\"; Senator Hutchison to \" 'people who batter their wives' \"; Senator Wellstone to people who \"brutalize\" their wives or children; and Senator Feinstein to \"severe and recurring domestic violence.\" 142 Cong. Rec. 22985-22986, 22988. But as we noted above, see\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1414, the impetus of \u00a7 922(g)(9) was that even perpetrators of severe domestic violence are often convicted \"under generally applicable assault or battery laws.\"\n   <em>\n    Hayes,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679422\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/415/#p427\">\n    555 U.S., at 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679422\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/415/#p427\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So nothing about these Senators' isolated references to severe domestic violence suggests that they would not have wanted \u00a7 922(g)(9) to apply to a misdemeanor assault conviction like Castleman's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Castleman next observes that \u00a7 922(g)(9) is the product of a legislative compromise. The provision originally barred gun possession for any \"crime of domestic violence,\" defined as any \"felony or misdemeanor crime of violence, regardless of length, term, or manner of punishment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   142 Cong. Rec. 5840. Congress rewrote the provision to require the use of physical force in response to the concern \"that the term crime of violence was too broad, and could be interpreted to include an act such as cutting up a credit card with a pair of scissors,\"\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 26675. See\n   <em>\n    Hayes,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679422\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/415/#p427\">\n    555 U.S., at 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679422\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/415/#p427\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Castleman would have us conclude that Congress thus meant \"to narrow the scope of the statute to convictions based on especially severe conduct.\" Brief for Respondent 24. But all Congress meant to do was address the fear that \u00a7 922(g)(9) might be triggered by offenses in which no force at all was directed at a person. As Senator Lautenberg noted, the revised text was not only \"more precise\" than the original but also \"probably broader.\" 142 Cong. Rec. 26675.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We are similarly unmoved by Castleman's invocation of the rule of lenity. Castleman is correct that our \"construction of a criminal statute must be guided by the need for fair warning.\"\n   <em>\n    Crandon v.

This is an easy case if the phrase \"physical force\" has the same meaning in \u00a7 921(a)(33)(A)(ii), the provision that defines \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" for purposes of \u00a7 922(g)(9), as it does in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), the provision interpreted in\n   <em>\n    Johnson,\n   </em>\n   since it is impossible to cause bodily injury without\n   using force \"capable of\" producing that result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   There are good reasons to give the phrase\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   's interpretation.

This case is a textbook candidate for application of the\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   -\n   <em>\n    Northcross\n   </em>\n   branch of the rule. The \"physical force\" clauses at issue here and in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   are worded in nearly identical fashion: The former defines a \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" as an offense that \"has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force,\" \u00a7 921(a)(33)(A)(ii), while the latter defines a \"violent felony\" as an offense that \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\" \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i). And both statutes are designed to promote public safety by deterring a class of criminals from possessing firearms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Respondent's arguments fail to overcome the presumption of consistent usage. In respondent's view, \"physical force\" cannot mean \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   force that produces\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   pain or bodily injury,\" Brief for Respondent 25, because \u00a7 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) defines a\n   <em>\n    violent\n   </em>\n   crime and one can inflict all sorts of minor injuries-bruises, paper cuts, etc.-by engaging in\n   <em>\n    nonviolent\n   </em>\n   behavior. Respondent therefore reasons that \u00a7 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) requires force capable of inflicting \"serious\" bodily injury. That requirement is more demanding than both of the plausible meanings of \"physical force\" we identified in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   : common-law offensive touching (which\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   rejected) and force capable of causing physical pain or injury, serious or otherwise.

It would be surpassing strange to read a statute defining a \"\n   <em>\n    misdemeanor\n   </em>\n   crime of domestic violence\" as requiring greater force than the similarly worded statute in\n   <em>\n    Johnson,\n   </em>\n   which defined a \"violent\n   <em>\n    felony,\n   </em>\n   \" and respondent does not make a convincing case for taking that extraordinary step.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   For these reasons, I would give \"physical force\" the same meaning in \u00a7 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) as in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   . The rest of the analysis is straightforward. Because \"intentionally or knowingly caus[ing] bodily injury,\" App. 27, categorically involves the use of \"force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person,\" 559 U.S., at 140,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581927,12446767\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1265/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , respondent's 2001 domestic-assault conviction qualifies as a \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" under \u00a7 922(g)(9).\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fr9\" name=\"fr9\">\n     1\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n   I would reverse the judgment below on that basis and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Unfortunately, the Court bypasses that narrower interpretation of \u00a7 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) in favor of a much broader one that treats any offensive touching, no matter how slight, as sufficient.

First, the Court invokes the \" 'settled principle of interpretation that, absent other indication, \"Congress intends to incorporate the well-settled meaning of the common-law terms it uses.\" ' \"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1410 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Sekhar v.

Anyway, a more accurate formulation of the principle cited by the Court is that when \" 'a word is obviously transplanted from another legal source, whether the common law\n   <em>\n    or other legislation,\n   </em>\n   it brings the old soil with it.' \"\n   <em>\n    Sekhar,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698481\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/729/#p2724\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----, 133 S.Ct., at 2724 (quoting Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20Colum.%20L.%20Rev.%20527\">\n    47 Colum.

That is to say, an act need not be violent to qualify as \"domestic violence.\" That absurdity is not only at war with the English language, it is flatly inconsistent with definitions of \"domestic violence\" from the period surrounding \u00a7 921(a)(33)(A)(ii)'s enactment. At the time, dictionaries defined \"domestic violence\" as, for instance, \"[v]iolence between members of a household, usu. spouses; an assault or other violent act committed by one member of a household against another,\" Black's Law Dictionary 1564 (7th ed. 1999), and \"[v]iolence toward or physical abuse of one's spouse or domestic partner,\" American Heritage Dictionary 534 (4th ed. 2000).\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fr14\" name=\"fr14\">\n     6\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n   Those definitions, combined with the absence of \"domestic violence\" entries in earlier dictionaries, see,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Black's Law Dictionary 484 (6th ed. 1990); American Heritage Dictionary 550 (3d ed. 1992), make it utterly implausible that Congress adopted a \"term of art\" definition \"encompassing acts that one might not characterize as 'violent' in a nondomestic context,\"\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1411.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Court's inventive, nonviolent definition fares no better when judged against other accepted sources of meaning. Current dictionaries give \"domestic violence\" the same meaning as above: ordinary violence that occurs in a domestic context. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   American Heritage Dictionary 533 (5th ed. 2011) (\"[p]hysical abuse of a household member, especially one's spouse or domestic partner\").

The\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   brief provides a series of definitions-drawn from law-review articles, foreign-government bureaus, and similar sources-that include such a wide range of nonviolent and even\n   <em>\n    nonphysical\n   </em>\n   conduct that they cannot possibly be relevant to the meaning of a statute requiring \"physical force,\" or to the legal meaning of \"domestic violence\" (as opposed to the meaning desired by private and governmental advocacy groups). For example,\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   's definitions describe as \"domestic violence\" acts that \"humiliate, isolate, frighten, ...

The offerings of the Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women are equally capacious and (to put it mildly) unconventional. Its publications define \"domestic violence\" as \"a pattern of abusive behavior ... used by one partner to gain or maintain power and control over another,\" including \"[u]ndermining an individual's sense of self-worth,\" \"name-calling,\" and \"damaging one's relationship with his or her children.\" See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Domestic Violence, online at http:// www. ovw. usdoj. gov/ domviolence. htm (all Internet materials as visited Mar. 21, 2014, and available in the Clerk of Court's case file).\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fr17\" name=\"fr17\">\n     9\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Of course these private organizations and the Department of Justice's (nonprosecuting) Office are entitled to define \"domestic violence\" any way they want for their own purposes-purposes that can include (quite literally) giving all domestic behavior harmful to women a bad name. (What is more abhorrent than\n   <em>\n    violence\n   </em>\n   against women?) But when they (and the Court) impose their all-embracing definition on the rest of us, they not only distort the law, they impoverish the language. When everything is domestic violence, nothing is.

The first is drawn from a health-care manual that provides \"a behavioral definition of domestic violence ...\n    <em>\n     rather than a legal definition,\n    </em>\n    since a behavioral definition is more comprehensive and more relevant to the health care setting.\" A.

Here, of course, we are concerned with the\n    <em>\n     less\n    </em>\n    comprehensive legal definition. The second definition referred to in the footnote equates domestic violence with \"overt violence,\" which in its least serious form consists of \"\n    <em>\n     painful\n    </em>\n    pinching or squeezing.\" M. McCue, Domestic Violence: A Reference Handbook 6 (1995) (emphasis added).
