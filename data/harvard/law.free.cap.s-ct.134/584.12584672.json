(Sprint), a national telecommunications service provider,\n  withheld payment of intercarrier access fees imposed by Windstream Iowa Communications, Inc. (Windstream), a local telecommunications carrier, for long distance Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calls, after concluding that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 preempted intrastate regulation of VoIP traffic. Windstream responded by threatening to block all Sprint customer calls, which led Sprint to ask the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) to enjoin Windstream from discontinuing service to Sprint. Windstream retracted its threat, and Sprint moved to withdraw its complaint. Concerned that the dispute would recur, the IUB continued the proceedings in order to resolve the question whether VoIP calls are subject to intrastate regulation. Rejecting Sprint's argument that this question was governed by federal law, the IUB ruled that intrastate fees applied to VoIP calls.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Sprint sued respondents, IUB members (collectively IUB), in Federal District Court, seeking a declaration that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 preempted the IUB's decision. As relief, Sprint sought an injunction against enforcement of the IUB's order. Sprint also sought review of the IUB's order in Iowa state court, reiterating the preemption argument made in Sprint's federal-court complaint and asserting several other claims.

Rather, the action was initiated by Sprint, a private corporation. No state authority conducted an investigation into Sprint's activities or lodged a formal complaint against Sprint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Once Sprint withdrew the complaint that commenced administrative proceedings, the IUB argues, those proceedings became, essentially, a civil enforcement action. However, the IUB's adjudicative authority was invoked to settle a civil dispute between two private parties, not to sanction Sprint for a wrongful act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In holding that abstention was the proper course, the Eighth Circuit misinterpreted this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Middlesex\n   </em>\n   to mean that\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention is warranted whenever there is (1) \"an ongoing state judicial proceeding, which (2) implicates important state interests, and (3) ... provide [s] an adequate opportunity to raise [federal] challenges.\" In\n   <em>\n    Middlesex,\n   </em>\n   the Court invoked\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   to bar a federal court from entertaining a lawyer's challenge to a state ethics committee's pending investigation of the lawyer. Unlike the IUB's proceeding, however, the state ethics committee's hearing in\n   <em>\n    Middlesex\n   </em>\n   was plainly \"akin to a criminal proceeding\": An investigation and formal complaint preceded the hearing, an agency of the State's Supreme Court initiated the hearing, and the hearing's purpose was to determine whether the lawyer should be disciplined for failing to meet the State's professional conduct standards.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189854\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/423/#p433\">\n    457 U.S., at 433-435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189854\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/423/#p433\">\n    102 S.Ct. 2515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In 2009, however, Sprint decided to withhold payment for a subset of those calls, classified as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), after concluding that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 preempted intrastate regulation of VoIP traffic.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fr1\" name=\"fr1\">\n      1\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    In response, Windstream threatened to block all calls to and from Sprint customers.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    Sprint filed a complaint against Windstream with the IUB asking the Board to enjoin Windstream from discontinuing service to Sprint. In Sprint's view, Iowa law entitled it to withhold payment while it contested the access charges and prohibited Windstream from carrying out its disconnection threat. In answer to Sprint's complaint, Windstream retracted its threat to discontinue serving Sprint, and Sprint moved, successfully, to withdraw its complaint. Because the conflict between Sprint and Windstream over VoIP calls was \"likely to recur,\" however, the IUB decided to continue the proceedings to resolve the underlying legal question,\n    <em>\n     i.e.,\n    </em>\n    whether VoIP calls are subject to intrastate regulation.

The question retained by the IUB, Sprint argued, was governed by federal law, and was not within the IUB's adjudicative jurisdiction. The IUB disagreed, ruling that the intrastate fees applied to VoIP calls.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fr2\" name=\"fr2\">\n      2\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Seeking to overturn the Board's ruling, Sprint commenced two lawsuits. First, Sprint sued the members of the IUB (respondents here)\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fr3\" name=\"fr3\">\n      3\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    in their official capacities in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. In its federal-court complaint, Sprint sought a declaration that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 preempted the IUB's decision; as relief, Sprint requested an injunction against enforcement of the IUB's order. Second, Sprint petitioned for review of the IUB's order in Iowa state court. The state petition reiterated the preemption argument Sprint made in its federal-court complaint; in addition, Sprint asserted state law and procedural due process claims. Because Eighth Circuit precedent effectively required a plaintiff to exhaust state remedies before proceeding to federal court, see\n    <em>\n     Alleghany Corp. v. McCartney,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10538682\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/896/1138/\">\n     896 F.2d 1138\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1990), Sprint urges that it filed the state suit as a protective measure. Failing to do so, Sprint explains, risked losing the opportunity to obtain any review, federal or state, should the federal court decide to abstain after the expiration of the Iowa statute of limitations.

The District Court granted the IUB's motion and dismissed the suit. The IUB's decision, and the pending state-court review of it, the District Court said, composed one \"uninterruptible process\" implicating important state interests. On that ground, the court ruled,\n    <em>\n     Younger\n    </em>\n    abstention was in order.\n    <em>\n     Sprint Communications Co. v.

We invoked\n    <em>\n     Younger\n    </em>\n    in\n    <em>\n     Middlesex\n    </em>\n    to bar a federal court from entertaining a lawyer's challenge to a New Jersey state ethics committee's pending investigation of the lawyer. Unlike the IUB proceeding here, the state ethics committee's hearing in\n    <em>\n     Middlesex\n    </em>\n    was indeed \"akin to a criminal proceeding.\" As we noted, an investigation and formal complaint preceded the hearing, an agency of the State's Supreme Court initiated the hearing, and the purpose of the hearing was to determine whether the lawyer should be disciplined for his failure to meet the State's standards of professional conduct.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189854\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/423/#p433\">\n     457 U.S., at 433-435\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189854\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/423/#p433\">\n     102 S.Ct. 2515\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
