It follows from these cases, and\n   <em>\n    Bilski\n   </em>\n   in particular, that the claims at issue are directed to an abstract idea.

Stating an abstract idea while adding the words \"apply it with a computer\" simply combines those two steps, with the same deficient result. Wholly generic computer implementation is not generally the sort of \"additional\n   featur[e]\" that provides any \"practical assurance that the process is more than a drafting effort designed to monopolize the [abstract idea] itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Mayo, supra,\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188353\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/66/#p1303\">\n    132 S.Ct., at 1297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Viewed as a whole, these method claims simply recite the concept of intermediated settlement as performed by a generic computer. They do not, for example, purport to improve the functioning of the computer itself or effect an improvement in any other technology or technical field.

Petitioner conceded below that its media claims rise or fall with its method claims. And the system claims are no different in substance from the method claims. The method claims recite the abstract idea implemented on a generic computer; the system claims recite a handful of generic computer components configured to implement the same idea.
