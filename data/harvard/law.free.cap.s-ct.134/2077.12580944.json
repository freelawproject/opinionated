A \"chemical weapon\" is \"[a] toxic chemical and its precursors, except where intended for a purpose not prohibited under this chapter.\" \u00a7 229F(1)(A). A \"toxic chemical\" is \"any chemical which through its chemical action on life processes can cause death, temporary\n  incapacitation or permanent harm to humans or animals.

On one occasion Haynes suffered a minor chemical burn that she treated by rinsing with water, but Bond's attempted assaults were otherwise entirely unsuccessful. Federal prosecutors charged Bond with violating, among other things, section 229(a). Bond moved to dismiss the chemical weapons charges on the ground that the Act violates the Tenth Amendment. When the District Court denied her motion, she pleaded guilty but reserved the right to appeal. The Third Circuit initially held that Bond lacked standing to raise her Tenth Amendment challenge, but this Court reversed. On remand, the Third Circuit rejected her Tenth Amendment argument and her additional argument that section 229 does not reach her conduct.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Held\n   </em>\n   : Section 229 does not reach Bond's simple assault.

Pp. 2086 - 2087.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   (b) This Court has no need to interpret the scope of the international Chemical Weapons Convention in this case. The treaty specifies that a signatory nation should implement its obligations \"in accordance with its constitutional processes.\" Art. VII(1), 1974 U.N.T.S. 331.

Ashcroft,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108302\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/452/#p460\">\n    501 U.S. 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 460,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108302\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/452/#p460\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108302\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/452/#p460\">\n    115 L.Ed.2d 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This principle applies to federal laws that punish local criminal activity, which has traditionally been the responsibility of the States. This Court's precedents have referred to basic principles of federalism in the Constitution to resolve ambiguity in federal statutes. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, the ambiguity in the statute derives from the improbably broad reach of the key statutory definition, given the term-\"chemical weapon\"-that is being defined, the deeply serious consequences of adopting such a boundless reading, and the lack of any apparent need to do so in light of the context from which the statute arose-a treaty about chemical warfare and terrorism, not about local assaults. Thus, the Court can reasonably insist on a clear indication that Congress intended to reach\n   purely local crimes before interpreting section 229's expansive language in a way that intrudes on the States' police power. Pp. 2087 - 2090.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (2) No such clear indication is found in section 229. An ordinary speaker would not describe Bond's feud-driven act of spreading irritating chemicals as involving a \"chemical weapon.\" And the chemicals at issue here bear little resemblance to those whose prohibition was the object of an international Convention. Where the breadth of a statutory definition creates ambiguity, it is appropriate to look to the ordinary meaning of the term being defined (here, \"chemical weapon\") in settling on a fair reading of the statute. See\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446767,3581927\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/133/\">\n    559 U.S. 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446767,3581927\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/133/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581927,12446767\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/176/1/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Government's reading of section 229 would transform a statute concerned with acts of war, assassination, and terrorism into a massive federal anti-poisoning regime that reaches the simplest of assaults. In light of the principle that Congress does not normally intrude upon the States' police power, this Court is reluctant to conclude that Congress meant to punish Bond's crime with a federal prosecution for a chemical weapons attack. In fact, only a handful of prosecutions have been brought under section 229, and most of those involved crimes not traditionally within the States' purview,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   terrorist plots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Pennsylvania's laws are sufficient to prosecute assaults like Bond's, and there is no indication in section 229 that Congress intended to abandon its traditional \"reluctan[ce] to define as a federal crime conduct readily denounced as criminal by the States,\"\n   <em>\n    Bass,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173129\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/336/\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173129\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/336/\">\n    at 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173129\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/336/\">\n    92 S.Ct. 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The nearly life-sized work depicts two lines of soldiers, blinded by mustard gas, clinging single file to orderlies guiding them to an improvised aid station. There they would receive little treatment and no relief; many suffered for weeks only to have the gas claim their lives. The soldiers were shown staggering through piles of comrades too seriously burned to even join the procession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The painting reflects the devastation that Sargent witnessed in the aftermath of the Second Battle of Arras during World War I. That battle and others like it led to an overwhelming consensus in the international community that toxic chemicals should never again be used as weapons against human beings. Today that objective is reflected in the international Convention on Chemical Weapons, which has been ratified or acceded to by 190 countries. The United States, pursuant to the Federal Government's constitutionally enumerated power to make treaties, ratified the treaty in 1997. To fulfill the United States' obligations under the Convention, Congress enacted the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act of 1998. The Act makes it a federal crime for a person to use or possess any chemical weapon, and it punishes violators with severe penalties. It is a statute that, like the Convention it implements, deals with crimes of deadly seriousness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The question presented by this case is whether the Implementation Act also reaches a purely local crime: an amateur attempt by a jilted wife to injure her husband's lover, which ended up causing only a minor thumb burn readily treated by rinsing with water. Because our constitutional structure leaves local criminal activity primarily to the States, we have generally declined to read federal law as intruding on that responsibility, unless Congress has clearly indicated that the law should have such reach. The Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act contains no such clear indication, and we accordingly conclude that it does not cover the unremarkable local offense at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In 1997, the President of the United States, upon the advice and consent of the Senate, ratified the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling, and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction.

In 2006, Bond's closest friend, Myrlinda Haynes, announced that she was pregnant. When Bond discovered that her husband was the child's father, she sought revenge against Haynes. Bond stole a quantity of 10-chloro-10H-phenoxarsine (an arsenic-based compound) from her employer, a chemical manufacturer. She also ordered a vial of potassium dichromate (a chemical commonly used in printing photographs or cleaning laboratory equipment) on Amazon.com. Both chemicals are toxic to humans and, in high enough doses, potentially lethal. It is undisputed, however, that Bond did not intend to kill Haynes. She instead hoped that Haynes would touch the chemicals and develop an uncomfortable rash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Between November 2006 and June 2007, Bond went to Haynes's home on at least 24 occasions and spread the chemicals on her car door, mailbox, and door knob. These attempted assaults were almost entirely unsuccessful. The chemicals that Bond used are easy to see, and Haynes was able to avoid them all but once. On that occasion, Haynes suffered a minor chemical burn on her thumb, which she treated by rinsing with water. Haynes repeatedly called the local police to report the suspicious substances, but they took no action. When Haynes found powder on her mailbox, she called the police again, who told her to call the post office. Haynes did so, and postal inspectors placed surveillance cameras around her home. The cameras caught Bond opening Haynes's mailbox, stealing an envelope, and stuffing potassium dichromate inside the muffler of Haynes's car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Federal prosecutors naturally charged Bond with two counts of mail theft, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201708\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . More surprising, they also charged her with two counts of possessing and using a chemical weapon, in violation of section 229(a). Bond moved to dismiss the chemical weapon counts on the ground that section 229 exceeded Congress's enumerated powers and invaded powers reserved to the States by the Tenth Amendment. The District Court denied Bond's motion. She then entered a conditional guilty plea that reserved\n   her right to appeal. The District Court sentenced Bond to six years in federal prison plus five years of supervised release, and ordered her to pay a $2,000 fine and $9,902.79 in restitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Bond appealed, raising a Tenth Amendment challenge to her conviction. The Government contended that Bond lacked standing to bring such a challenge. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit agreed.

Holland\n   </em>\n   would remove all limits on federal authority, so long as the Federal Government ratifies a treaty first. She insists that to effectively afford the Government a police power whenever it implements a treaty would be contrary to the Framers' careful decision to divide power between the States and the National Government as a means of preserving liberty. To the extent that\n   <em>\n    Holland\n   </em>\n   authorizes such usurpation of traditional state authority, Bond says, it must be either limited or overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Government replies that this Court has never held that a statute implementing a valid treaty exceeds Congress's enumerated powers.

Bond argues that section 229 does not cover her conduct. So we consider that argument first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Section 229 exists to implement the Convention, so we begin with that international agreement. As explained, the Convention's drafters intended for it to be a comprehensive ban on chemical weapons. But even with its broadly worded definitions, we have doubts that a treaty about\n   <em>\n    chemical weapons\n   </em>\n   has anything to do with Bond's conduct. The Convention, a product of years of worldwide study, analysis, and multinational negotiation, arose in response to war crimes and acts of terrorism. See Kenyon &amp; Feakes 6. There is no reason to think the sovereign nations that ratified the Convention were interested in anything like Bond's common law assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Even if the treaty does reach that far, nothing prevents Congress from implementing the Convention in the same manner it legislates with respect to innumerable other matters-observing the Constitution's division of responsibility between sovereigns and leaving the prosecution of purely local crimes to the States. The Convention, after all, is agnostic between enforcement at the state versus federal level: It provides that \"[e]ach State Party shall,\n   <em>\n    in accordance with its constitutional processes,\n   </em>\n   adopt the necessary measures to implement its obligations under this Convention.\" Art. VII(1), 1974 U.N.T.S. 331 (emphasis added); see also Tabassi, National Implementation: Article VII, in Kenyon &amp; Feakes 205, 207 (\"Since the creation of\n   national law, the enforcement of it and the structure and administration of government are all sovereign acts reserved exclusively for [State Parties], it is not surprising that the Convention is so vague on the critical matter of national implementation.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Fortunately, we have no need to interpret the scope of the Convention in this case. Bond was prosecuted under section 229, and the statute-unlike the Convention-must be read consistent with principles of federalism inherent in our constitutional structure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In the Government's view, the conclusion that Bond \"knowingly\" \"use[d]\" a \"chemical weapon\" in violation of section 229(a) is simple: The chemicals that Bond placed on Haynes's home and car are \"toxic chemical[s]\" as defined by the statute, and Bond's attempt to assault Haynes was not a \"peaceful purpose.\" \u00a7\u00a7 229F(1), (8), (7). The problem with this interpretation is that it would \"dramatically intrude[ ] upon traditional state criminal jurisdiction,\" and we avoid reading statutes to have such reach in the absence of a clear indication that they do.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In this case, the ambiguity derives from the improbably broad reach of the key statutory definition given the term-\"chemical weapon\"-being defined; the deeply serious consequences of adopting such a boundless reading; and the lack of any apparent need to do so in light of the context from which the statute arose-a treaty about chemical warfare and terrorism. We conclude that, in this curious case, we can insist on a clear indication that Congress meant to reach purely local crimes, before interpreting the statute's expansive language in a way that intrudes on the police power of the States. See\n   <em>\n    Bass,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173129\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/336/\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173129\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/336/\">\n    at 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173129\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/336/\">\n    92 S.Ct. 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fr2\" name=\"fr2\">\n     2\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   We do not find any such clear indication in section 229. \"Chemical weapon\" is the key term that defines the statute's reach, and it is defined extremely broadly. But that general definition does not constitute a clear statement that Congress meant the statute to reach local criminal conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In fact, a fair reading of section 229 suggests that it does not have as expansive a scope as might at first appear. To begin, as a matter of natural meaning, an educated user of English would not describe Bond's crime as involving a \"chemical weapon.\" Saying that a person \"used a chemical weapon\" conveys a very different idea than saying the person \"used a chemical in a way that caused some harm.\" The natural meaning of \"chemical weapon\" takes account of both the particular chemicals that the defendant used and the circumstances in which she used them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   When used in the manner here, the chemicals in this case are not of the sort that an ordinary person would associate with instruments of chemical warfare. The substances that Bond used bear little resemblance to the deadly toxins that are \"of particular danger to the objectives of the Convention.\" Why We Need a Chemical Weapons Convention and an OPCW, in Kenyon &amp; Feakes 17 (describing the Convention's Annex on Chemicals, a nonexhaustive list of covered substances that are subject to special regulation). More to the point, the use of something as a \"weapon\" typically connotes \"[a]n instrument of offensive or defensive combat,\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2589 (2002), or \"[a]n instrument of attack or defense in combat, as a gun, missile, or sword,\" American Heritage Dictionary 2022 (3d ed. 1992). But no speaker in natural parlance would describe Bond's feud-driven act of spreading irritating chemicals on Haynes's door knob and mailbox as \"combat.\" Nor do the other circumstances\n   of Bond's offense-an act of revenge born of romantic jealousy, meant to cause discomfort, that produced nothing more than a minor thumb burn-suggest that a chemical weapon was deployed in Norristown, Pennsylvania. Potassium dichromate and 10-chloro-10H-phenoxarsine might be chemical weapons if used, say, to poison a city's water supply. But Bond's crime is worlds apart from such hypotheticals, and covering it would give the statute a reach exceeding the ordinary meaning of the words Congress wrote.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In settling on a fair reading of a statute, it is not unusual to consider the ordinary meaning of a defined term, particularly when there is dissonance between that ordinary meaning and the reach of the definition.

The ordinary meaning of \"chemical weapon\" plays a similar limiting role here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Government would have us brush aside the ordinary meaning and adopt a reading of section 229 that would sweep in everything from the detergent under the kitchen sink to the stain remover in the laundry room. Yet no one would ordinarily describe those substances as \"chemical weapons.\" The Government responds that because Bond used \"specialized, highly toxic\" (though legal) chemicals, \"this case presents no occasion to address whether Congress intended [section 229] to apply to common household substances.\" Brief for United States 13, n. 3. That the statute\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   apply so broadly, however, is the inescapable conclusion of the Government's position: Any parent would be guilty of a serious federal offense-possession of a chemical weapon-when, exasperated by the children's repeated failure to clean the goldfish tank, he considers poisoning the fish with a few drops of vinegar. We are reluctant to ignore the ordinary meaning of \"chemical weapon\" when doing so would transform a statute passed to implement the international Convention on Chemical Weapons into one that also makes it a federal offense to poison goldfish.

Of course Bond's conduct is serious and unacceptable-and against the laws of Pennsylvania.

And nothing in the Convention shows a clear intent to abrogate that feature. Prosecutorial discretion involves carefully weighing the benefits of a prosecution against the evidence needed to convict, the resources of the public fisc, and the public policy of the State. Here, in its zeal to prosecute Bond, the Federal Government has \"displaced\" the \"public policy of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, enacted in its capacity as sovereign,\" that Bond does not belong in prison for a chemical weapons offense.\n   <em>\n    Bond I,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924754,12450487\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2355/\">\n    131 S.Ct., at 2366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    Jones,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509211\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/848/\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509211\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/848/\">\n    at 859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509211\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/848/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Stevens, J., concurring) (federal prosecution of a traditionally local crime \"illustrates how a criminal law like this may effectively displace a policy choice made by the State\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   As we have explained, \"Congress has traditionally been reluctant to define as a federal crime conduct readily denounced as criminal by the States.\"\n   <em>\n    Bass,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173129\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/336/\">\n    404 U.S., at 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173129\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/336/\">\n    92 S.Ct. 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is no clear indication of a contrary approach here. Section 229 implements the Convention, but Bond's crime could hardly be more unlike the uses of mustard gas on the Western Front or nerve agents in the Iran-Iraq war that form the core concerns of that treaty. See Kenyon &amp; Feakes 6. There are no life-sized paintings of Bond's rival washing her thumb. And there are no apparent interests of the United States Congress or the community of nations in seeing Bond end up in federal prison, rather than dealt with (like virtually all other criminals in Pennsylvania) by the State. The Solicitor General acknowledged as much at oral argument. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 47 (\"I don't think anybody would say [that] whether or not Ms. Bond is prosecuted would give rise to an international incident\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   This case is unusual, and our analysis is appropriately limited. Our disagreement with our colleagues reduces to whether section 229 is \"utterly clear.\"\n   <em>\n    Post,\n   </em>\n   at 2094 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). We think it is not, given that the definition of \"chemical weapon\" in a particular case can reach beyond any normal notion of such a weapon, that the context from which the statute arose demonstrates a much more limited prohibition was intended, and that the most sweeping reading of the statute would fundamentally upset the Constitution's balance between national and local power. This exceptional convergence of factors gives us serious reason to doubt the Government's expansive reading of section 229, and calls for us to interpret the statute more narrowly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In sum, the global need to prevent chemical warfare does not require the Federal Government to reach into the kitchen cupboard, or to treat a local assault with a chemical irritant as the deployment of a chemical weapon.

A \"toxic chemical\" is \"any chemical which through its chemical action on life processes can cause death, temporary incapacitation or permanent harm to humans or animals. The term includes all such chemicals, regardless of their origin or of their method of production, and regardless of whether they are produced in facilities, in munitions or elsewhere.\" \u00a7 229F(8)(A).

The statute parses itself. There is no opinion of ours, and none written by any court or put forward by any commentator since Aristotle, which says, or even suggests, that \"dissonance\" between ordinary meaning and the unambiguous words of a definition is to be resolved in favor of ordinary meaning. If that were the case, there would hardly be any use in providing a definition. No, the true rule is entirely clear: \"When a statute includes an explicit definition, we must follow that definition,\n   <em>\n    even if it varies from that term's ordinary meaning\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Stenberg v.

To apply these presumptions, then, is not to rewrite clear text; it is to interpret words fairly, in light of their statutory context. But there is nothing either (1) realistic or (2) well known about the presumption the Court shoves down the throat of a resisting statute today. Who in the world would have thought that a definition is inoperative if it contradicts ordinary meaning? When this statute was enacted, there was not yet a \"\n   <em>\n    Bond\n   </em>\n   presumption\" to that effect-though presumably Congress will have to take account of the\n   <em>\n    Bond\n   </em>\n   presumption in the future, perhaps by adding at the end of all its definitions that depart from ordinary connotation \"and we really mean it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

[the] Power ... to make Treaties.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   It is obvious what the Clauses, read together, do\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   say. They do not authorize Congress to enact laws for carrying into execution \"Treaties,\" even treaties that do not execute themselves, such as the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fr9\" name=\"fr9\">\n     6\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n   Surely it makes sense, the Government contends, that Congress would have the power to carry out the obligations to which the President and the Senate have committed the Nation. The power to \"carry into Execution\" the \"Power ... to make Treaties,\" it insists,\n   <em>\n    has to\n   </em>\n   mean the power to execute the treaties themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   That argument, which makes no pretense of resting on text, unsurprisingly misconstrues it. Start with the phrase \"to make Treaties.\" A treaty is a contract with a foreign nation\n   <em>\n    made,\n   </em>\n   the Constitution states, by the President with the concurrence\n   of \"two thirds of the Senators present.\" That is true of self-executing and non-self-executing treaties alike; the Constitution does not distinguish between the two. So, because the President and the Senate can enter into a non-self-executing compact with a foreign nation but can never by themselves (without the House) give that compact domestic effect through legislation, the power of the President and the Senate \"to make\" a Treaty cannot possibly mean to \"enter into a compact with a foreign nation and then give that compact domestic legal effect.\" We have said in another context that a right \"to make contracts\" (a treaty, of course, is a contract) does not \"extend ... to conduct ...\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the contract relation has been established.... Such\n   <em>\n    postformation\n   </em>\n   conduct does not involve the right to make a contract, but rather implicates the\n   <em>\n    performance\n   </em>\n   of established contract obligations.\"\n   <em>\n    Patterson v.

In any number of ways. It could have appropriated money for hiring treaty negotiators, empowered the Department of State to appoint those negotiators, formed a commission to study the benefits and risks of entering into the agreement, or paid for a bevy of spies to monitor the treaty-related deliberations of other potential signatories. See G. Lawson &amp; G. Seidman, The Constitution of Empire: Territorial Expansion and American Legal History 63 (2004). The Necessary and Proper Clause interacts similarly with other Article II powers: \"[W]ith respect to the executive branch, the Clause would allow Congress to institute an agency to help the President wisely employ his pardoning power.... Most important, the Clause allows Congress to establish officers to assist the President in exercising his 'executive Power.' \" Calabresi &amp; Prakash, The President's Power to Execute the Laws,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20Yale%20L.J.%20541\">\n    104 Yale L.J. 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 591 (1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   But a power to help the President\n   <em>\n    make\n   </em>\n   treaties is not a power to\n   <em>\n    implement\n   </em>\n   treaties already made. See generally Rosenkranz, Executing the Treaty Power,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=118%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%201867\">\n    118 Harv. L.

Tribe, American Constitutional Law \u00a7 4-4, pp. 645-646 (3d ed. 2000). Though\n   <em>\n    Holland\n   </em>\n   's change to the Constitution's text appears minor (the power to carry into execution the\n   <em>\n    power to make treaties\n   </em>\n   becomes the power to carry into execution\n   <em>\n    treaties\n   </em>\n   ), the change to its structure is seismic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   To see why vast expansion of congressional power is not just a remote possibility, consider two features of the modern practice of treaty making. In our Nation's early history, and extending through the time when\n   <em>\n    Holland\n   </em>\n   was written, treaties were typically bilateral, and addressed only a small range of topics relating to the obligations of each state to the other, and to citizens of the other-military neutrality, for example, or military alliance, or guarantee of most-favored-nation trade treatment. See Bradley, The Treaty Power and American Federalism,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20Mich.%20L.%20Rev.%20390\">\n    97 Mich. L. Rev. 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 396 (1998). But beginning in the last half of the last century, many treaties were \"detailed multilateral instruments negotiated and drafted at international conferences,\"\n   <em>\n    ibid.,\n   </em>\n   and they sought to regulate states' treatment of their own citizens, or even \"the activities of individuals and private entities,\" A. Chayes &amp; A. Chayes, The New Sovereignty: Compliance with International Regulatory Agreements 14 (1995). \"[O]ften vague and open-ended,\" such treaties \"touch on almost every aspect of domestic civil, political, and cultural life.\" Bradley &amp; Goldsmith, Treaties, Human Rights, and Conditional Consent,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=149%20U.%20Pa.%20L.%20Rev.%20399\">\n    149 U. Pa. L. Rev. 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 400 (2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Consider also that, at least according to some scholars, the Treaty Clause comes with no implied subject-matter limitations. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   L. Henkin, Foreign Affairs and the United States Constitution 191, 197 (2d ed. 1996); but see Bradley,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 433-439. On this view, \"[t]he Tenth Amendment ... does not limit the power to make treaties or other agreements,\" Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7 302, Comment\n   <em>\n    d,\n   </em>\n   p. 154 (1986), and the treaty power can be used to regulate matters of strictly domestic concern, see\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at Comment\n   <em>\n    c,\n   </em>\n   p. 153; but see\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 2103 - 2111 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   If that is true, then the possibilities of what the Federal Government may accomplish, with the right treaty in hand, are endless and hardly farfetched. It could begin, as some scholars have suggested, with abrogation of this Court's constitutional rulings.

Imagine the United States' entry into an Antipolygamy Convention, which called for-and Congress enacted-legislation providing that, when a spouse of a man with more than one wife dies intestate, the surviving husband may inherit no part of the estate. Constitutional? The Federalist answers with a rhetorical question: \"Suppose by some forced constructions of its authority (which indeed cannot easily be imagined) the Federal Legislature should attempt to vary the law of descent in any State; would it not be evident that ... it had exceeded its jurisdiction and infringed upon that of the State?\" The Federalist No. 33, at 206 (A. Hamilton). Yet given the Antipolygamy Convention,\n   <em>\n    Holland\n   </em>\n   would uphold it. Or imagine that, to execute a treaty, Congress enacted a statute prohibiting state inheritance taxes on real property. Constitutional? Of course not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Again, The Federalist: \"Suppose ... [Congress] should undertake to abrogate a land tax imposed by the authority of a State, would it not be equally evident that this was an invasion of that concurrent jurisdiction in respect to this species of tax which its constitution plainly supposes to exist in the State governments?\" No. 33, at 206\n   <em>\n    .

See Tr. of Oral Arg. 32-33. The premise of the objection (that the power to make self-executing treaties is limitless) is, to say the least, arguable. But even if it is correct, refusing to extend that proposition to non-self-executing treaties makes a great deal of sense. Suppose, for example, that the self-aggrandizing\n   Federal Government wishes to take over the law of intestacy. If the President and the Senate find in some foreign state a ready accomplice, they have two options. First, they can enter into a treaty with \"stipulations\" specific enough that they \"require no legislation to make them operative,\"\n   <em>\n    Whitney v.

But for that to succeed, the President and a supermajority of the Senate would need to reach agreement on all the details-which, when once embodied in the treaty, could not be altered or superseded by ordinary legislation. The second option-far the better one-is for Congress to gain lasting and flexible control over the law of intestacy by means of a non-self-executing treaty. \"[Implementing] legislation is as much subject to modification and repeal by Congress as legislation upon any other subject.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3524633\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/124/190/#p194\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And to make such a treaty, the President and Senate would need to agree only that they desire power over the law of intestacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The famous scholar and jurist Henry St. George Tucker saw clearly the danger of\n   <em>\n    Holland\n   </em>\n   's\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   five years before it was written:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \"[The statement is made that] if the treaty-making power, composed of the President and Senate, in discharging its functions under the government, finds that it needs certain legislative powers which Congress does not possess to carry out its desires, it may ... infuse into Congress such powers, although the Framers of the Constitution omitted to grant them to Congress....

The Constitution does not, however, comprehensively define the proper bounds of the Treaty Power, and this Court has not yet had occasion to do so.

To the contrary, centuries of experience-reflected in treatises, dictionaries, and actual practice-shaped the contours of that power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Early treatises discussed a wide variety of treaties that nevertheless shared a common\n   thread: All of them governed genuinely international matters such as war, peace, and trade between nations. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   2 H. Grotius, De Jure Belli Ac Pacis 394-396 (1646 ed., F. Kelsey transl. 1925) (treaties are made \"for the sake either of peace or of some alliance,\" including \"for the restoration of captives and of captured property, and for safety\"; \"that neither signatory shall have fortresses in the territory of the other, or defend the subjects of the other, or furnish a passage to the enemy of the other\"; and for \"commercial relations\" and agreements on \"import duties\" (footnote omitted)); 2 S. Pufendorf, De Jure Naturae et Gentium 1331 (1688 ed., C. Oldfather &amp; W. Oldfather transls. 1934) (treaties are made \"to form some union or society, the end of which is either commercial relations, or a united front in war\"); 3 E. Vattel, The Law of Nations 165 (1758 ed., C. Fenwick transl. 1916) (treaties, which \"can be subdivided into as many classes as there are varieties in the character of national relations,\" \"deal with conditions of commerce, with mutual defense, with belligerent relations, with rights of passage, ... stipulations not to fortify certain places, etc.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Founding-era dictionaries reflect a similar understanding. To be sure, some early dictionaries briefly defined \"treaty\" simply as a \"compact of accommodation relating to public affairs.\" See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   2 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language 2056 (rev. 4th ed. 1773). More detailed definitions, however, recognized the particular character of treaties as addressing matters of intercourse between nations rather than domestic regulation. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   J. Buchanan, A New English Dictionary (1769) (defining \"treaty\" as \"[a] covenant or agreement between several nations for peace, commerce, navigation, &amp;c.\"); N. Bailey, An Universal Etymological English Dictionary (26th ed. 1789) (same); J. Montefiore, A Commercial Dictionary (1803) (noting \"treaties of alliance\" for military aid; \"treaties of subsidy\" for the provision of soldiers; treaties of navigation and commerce; treaties governing fishing and timber rights; and treaties on import duties); 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language 97 (1828) (noting \"treaties for regulating commercial intercourse, treaties of alliance, offensive and defensive, treaties for hiring troops, [and] treaties of peace\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Treaty practice under the Articles of Confederation was also consistent with the understanding that treaties govern matters of international intercourse. The Articles provided: \"The United States in Congress assembled, shall have the sole and exclusive right and power of ... entering into treaties and alliances....\" Art. IX. The Congress of the Confederation exercised that power by making treaties that fell squarely within the traditional scope of the power.

The Framers understood that most regulatory matters were to be left to the States. See The Federalist No. 45, at 313 (J. Madison) (\"The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the Federal Government, are few and defined\"); see also\n   <em>\n    Lopez,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339171\" index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/549/#p567\">\n    514 U.S., at 590-592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339171\" index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/549/#p567\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (THOMAS, J., concurring) (citing sources). Consistent with that general understanding of limited federal power, evidence from the ratification campaign suggests that the Treaty Power was limited and, in particular, confined to matters of intercourse with other nations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   In essays during the ratification campaign in New York, James Madison took the view that the Treaty Power was inherently limited. The Federal Government's powers, Madison wrote, \"will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce\"-the traditional subjects of treaty-making. The Federalist No. 45, at 313. If the \"external\" Treaty Power contained a capacious domestic regulatory authority, that would plainly conflict with Madison's firm understanding that \"[t]he powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the Federal Government, are few and defined.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339171\" index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/549/#p567\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339171\" index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/549/#p567\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Madison evidently saw no conflict, however, because the Treaty Power included authority to \"regulate the intercourse with foreign nations\" rather than all domestic affairs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339171\" index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/549/#p567\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339171\" index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/549/#p567\">\n    .,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   No. 42, at 279.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Madison reiterated that understanding at the 1788 Virginia ratifying convention, where the most extensive discussion of the proposed Treaty Power occurred, see Bradley 410; Golove, Treaty-Making and the Nation,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=98%20Mich.%20L.%20Rev.%201075\">\n    98 Mich. L. Rev. 1075\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1141-1142 (2000) (hereinafter Golove). There, Anti-Federalists leveled the charge that the Treaty Power gave the Federal Government excessive power. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   3 Debates on the Federal Constitution 509 (J. Elliot 2d ed. 1876) (hereinafter Elliot's Debates) (G. Mason) (\"The President and Senate can make any treaty whatsoever\");\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 513 (P. Henry) (\"To me this power\n   appears still destructive; for they can make any treaty\"). But Madison insisted that just \"because this power is given to Congress,\" it did not follow that the Treaty Power was \"absolute and unlimited.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 514. The President and the Senate lacked the power \"to dismember the empire,\" for example, because \"[t]he exercise of the power must be consistent with the object of the delegation.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   \"The object of treaties,\" in Madison's oft-repeated formulation, \"is the regulation of intercourse with foreign nations, and is external.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Although Alexander Hamilton undoubtedly believed that the Treaty Power was broad within its proper sphere, see\n   <em>\n    infra,\n   </em>\n   at 2106, the view he expressed in essays during the New York ratification campaign is entirely consistent with Madison's. After noting that the Treaty Power was one of the \"most unexceptionable parts\" of the proposed Constitution, Hamilton distinguished the Treaty Power from the legislative power \"to prescribe rules for the regulation of the society\" and from the executive power to \"execut[e] ... the laws.\" The Federalist No. 75, at 503-504. \"The power of making treaties,\" he concluded, \"is plainly neither the one nor the other.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 504. Rather, Hamilton explained that treaties \"are not rules prescribed by the sovereign to the subject, but agreements between sovereign and sovereign.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 504-505. That description is difficult to square with a view of the Treaty Power that would allow the Federal Government to prescribe rules over all aspects of domestic life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   It did not escape the attention of the Framers that the Treaty Power was drafted without explicitly enumerated limits on what sorts of treaties are permissible. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Hamilton, The Defence No. XXXVI, in 20 Papers of Alexander Hamilton 6 (H. Syrett ed. 1974) (\"A power 'to make treaties,' granted in these indefinite terms, extends to all kinds of treaties and with all the latitude which such a power under any form of Government can possess\"). The Articles of Confederation had, for example, explicitly restricted certain categories of treaties. See Art. IX (\"[N]o treaty of commerce shall be made whereby the legislative power of the respective States shall be restrained from imposing such imposts and duties on foreigners, as their own people are subjected to, or from prohibiting the exportation or importation of any species of goods or commodities whatsoever\"). The Constitution omitted those restrictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   That decision was not a grant of unlimited power, but rather a grant of flexibility; the Federal Government needed the ability to respond to unforeseeable varieties of intercourse with other nations. James Madison, for example, did \"not think it possible to enumerate all the cases in which such external regulations would be necessary.\" 3 Elliot's Debates 514; see also\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 363 (E. Randolph) (\"The various contingencies which may form the object of treaties, are, in the nature of things, incapable of definition\"). But Madison nevertheless recognized that any exercise of the Treaty Power \"must be consistent with the object of the delegation,\" which is \"the regulation of intercourse with foreign nations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 514; see also Hamilton, The Defence,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 6 (\"[W]hatever is a\n   <em>\n    proper subject of compact between Nation &amp; Nation\n   </em>\n   may be embraced by a Treaty\" (emphasis added)). That understanding of the Treaty Power did not permit the President and the Senate to exercise domestic authority commensurate with their substantial power over external affairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   The understanding that treaties are limited to, in Madison's words, \"the regulation\n   of intercourse with foreign nations,\" endured in the years after the Constitution was ratified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   In 1796, an extended debate regarding the proper scope of the Treaty Power arose in the aftermath of a controversial treaty with Great Britain that addressed the validity of prerevolutionary debts and the property rights of British subjects. Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation, Nov. 19, 1794,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20Stat.%20116\">\n    8 Stat. 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , T.S. No. 105. When President Washington requested appropriations to implement that so-called \"Jay Treaty\" (after its chief negotiator, John Jay), the House of Representatives engaged in a month-long floor debate over its own role in the process of implementing treaties. See 5 Annals of Cong. 426 (1796); see generally D. Currie, The Constitution in Congress: The Federalist Period 1789-1801, pp. 211-217 (1997). Some Congressmen argued that the House had a right to independently review the merits of the treaty. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   5 Annals of Cong. 427-428 (remarks of Rep. Livingston) (\"[T]he House w[as] vested with a discretionary power of carrying the Treaty into effect, or refusing it their sanction\"). Others insisted that \"if the Treaty was the supreme law of the land, then there was no discretionary power in the House, except on the question of its constitutionality.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 436-437 (Rep. Murray).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   That latter group relied in part on the observation that the Treaty Power was limited by its nature, and thus the Constitution's failure to specify a role for the House did not pose a mortal threat to that Chamber's legislative prerogatives. Representative James Hillhouse of Connecticut expounded that position in the floor debate. Hillhouse recognized that the House had an \"indispensable duty to look into every Treaty\" to ensure that it is constitutional,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   \"whether it related to objects within the province of the Treaty-making power, a power which is not unlimited.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 660. He further explained that \"[t]he objects upon which it can operate are understood and well defined, and if the Treaty-making power were to embrace other objects, their doings would have no more binding force than if the Legislature were to assume and exercise judicial powers under the name of legislation.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Hillhouse \"advert[ed] to the general definition of the Treaty-making power\" to explain why the Treaty Power was not a threat to the House's legislative prerogatives:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   \"[I]f we look into our code of laws, we shall find few of them that can be affected, to any great degree, by the Treaty-making power. All laws regulating our own internal police, so far as the citizens of the United States alone are concerned, are wholly beyond its reach; no foreign nation having any interest or concern in that business, every attempt to interfere would be a mere nullity, as much as if two individuals were to enter into a contract to regulate the conduct or actions of a third person, who was no party to such contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 662.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   He accordingly denied that \"the President and Senate hav[e] it in their power, by forming Treaties with an Indian tribe or a foreign nation, to legislate over the United States,\" concluding instead that the Treaty Power \"cannot affect the Legislative power of Congress but in a very small and limited degree.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 663.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Other Representatives who participated in the Jay Treaty debates agreed with Hillhouse that the Treaty Power had a limited scope. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 516 (Rep. Sedgwick) (classifying the uses of the power as \"1. To compose and adjust differences, whether to terminate or to prevent war. 2. To form contracts for mutual security or defence; or to make Treaties, offensive or defensive. 3. To regulate an\n   intercourse for mutual benefit, or to form Treaties of commerce\"). James Madison, who opposed the Jay Treaty as a Representative from Virginia, also took the opportunity to reiterate his view that \"the Treaty-making power was a limited power.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 777.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Other historical evidence from the postratification period is in accord. For example, Thomas Jefferson's Senate Manual of Parliamentary Procedure, drafted while he was Vice President and therefore president of the Senate, Bradley 415, noted the need for a treaty to have a nexus to international intercourse. If a treaty did not \"concern the foreign nation, party to the contract,\" then \"it would be a mere nullity\n   <em>\n    res inter alias acta\n   </em>\n   .\" Thomas Jefferson's Senate Manual (1801), in 9 The Writings of Thomas Jefferson 80-81 (H. Washington ed. 1861). Later, Justice Story likewise anchored the Treaty Power in intercourse between nations. J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 552-553 (abr. ed. 1833). (\"The power 'to make treaties' is by the constitution general; and of course it embraces all sorts of treaties, for peace or war; for commerce or territory; for alliance or succours; for indemnity for injuries or payment of debts; for the recognition or enforcement of principles of public law; and for any other purposes, which the policy or interests of independent sovereigns may dictate in their intercourse with each other\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   The touchstone of all of these views was that the Treaty Power is limited to matters of international intercourse. Even if a treaty\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   reach some local matters,\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fr10\" name=\"fr10\">\n     1\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n   it still\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   relate to intercourse with other nations. The Jay Treaty, for example, altered state property law, but only with respect to British subjects, who could hold and devise real property in the United States \"in like manner as if they were natives.\" Art. IX,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20Stat.%20122\">\n    8 Stat. 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . An 1815 treaty with Great Britain was held to pre-empt a state law authorizing the seizure of \" 'free negroes or persons of color' \" at ports in part because the state law applied to British sailors. See\n   <em>\n    Elkison v. Deliesseline,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11969474\" index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-cas/8/493/#p495\">\n    8 F.Cas. 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 495 (No. 4,366) (C.C.S.C.1823) (Johnson, Circuit Justice). And treaties with China and Japan, which afforded subjects of those countries the same rights and privileges as citizens of other nations, were understood to pre-empt state laws that discriminated against Chinese and Japanese subjects. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baker v. Portland,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6119997,6119903\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-cas/2/472/\">\n    2 F.Cas. 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 474 (No. 777) (C.C.Ore.1879). Cf. Brief for United States 29, 33-38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   The postratification theory and practice of treaty-making accordingly confirms the understanding that treaties by their nature relate to intercourse with other nations (including their people and property), rather than to purely domestic affairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   The original understanding that the Treaty Power was limited to international intercourse has been well represented in this Court's precedents.

See Golove 1288 (\"[V]irtually every authority, including the Supreme Court, has on countless occasions from the earliest days recognized general subject matter limitations on treaties\"). The Second Restatement on the Foreign Relations Law of the United States, for example, opined that the Treaty Power is available only if the subject matter of the treaty \"is of international concern.\" \u00a7 117(1)(a) (1964-1965). The Second Restatement explained that a treaty \"must relate to the external concerns of the nation as distinguished from matters of a purely internal nature.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"551477\" index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/252/416/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Comment\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   ; see also Treaties and Executive Agreements: Hearings on S.J. Res. 1 before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., 183 (1955) (Secretary of State Dulles) (Treaties cannot regulate matters \"which do not essentially affect the actions of nations in relation to international affairs, but are purely internal\"); Proceedings of the American Society of International Law 194-196 (1929) (C. Hughes) (\"[The Treaty Power] is not a power intended to be exercised ... with respect to matters that have no relation to international concerns\"). But see Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7 302, Comment\n   <em>\n    c\n   </em>\n   (\"Contrary to what was once suggested, the Constitution does not require that an international agreement deal only with 'matters of international concern' \"). At a minimum, the Second Restatement firmly reflects the understanding shared by the Framers that the Treaty Power has substantive limits. Only in the latter part of the past century have treaties challenged that prevailing conception by addressing \"matters that in the past countries would have addressed wholly domestically\" and \"purport[ing] to regulate the relationship between nations and their own citizens,\" Bradley 396; see also\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2099 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). But even the Solicitor General in this case would not go that far; he acknowledges that \"there may well be a line to be drawn\" regarding \"whether the subject matter of [a] treaty is a proper subject for a treaty.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 43:10-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   In an appropriate case, I would draw a line that respects the original understanding of the Treaty Power. I acknowledge that the distinction between matters of international intercourse and matters of purely domestic regulation may not be obvious in all cases. But this Court has long recognized that the Treaty Power is limited, and hypothetical difficulties in line-drawing are no reason to ignore a constitutional limit on federal power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The parties in this case have not addressed the proper scope of the Treaty Power or the validity of the treaty here. The preservation of limits on the Treaty Power is nevertheless a matter of fundamental constitutional importance, and the Court ought to address the scope of the Treaty Power when that issue is presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Given the increasing frequency with which treaties have begun to test the limits of the Treaty Power, see Bradley 402-409, that chance will come soon enough.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   <strong>\n    Justice ALITO, concurring in the judgment.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   As explained in Part I of Justice SCALIA's concurring opinion, which I join, petitioner's conduct violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"294\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20229\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the federal criminal statute under which she was convicted. I therefore find it necessary to reach the question whether this statute represents a constitutional exercise of federal power, and as the case comes to us, the only possible source of federal power to be considered is the treaty power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   For the reasons set out in Parts I-III of Justice THOMAS' concurring opinion, which I join, I believe that the treaty power is limited to agreements that address matters of legitimate international concern. The treaty pursuant to which \u00a7 229 was enacted, the Chemical Weapons Convention, is not self-executing, and thus the Convention itself does not have domestic effect without congressional action. The control of true chemical weapons, as that term is customarily understood, is a matter of great international concern, and therefore the heart of the Convention clearly represents a valid exercise of the treaty power. But insofar as the Convention may be read to obligate the United States to enact domestic legislation criminalizing conduct of the sort at issue in this case, which typically is the sort of conduct regulated by the States, the Convention exceeds the scope of the treaty power. Section 229 cannot be regarded as necessary and proper to carry into execution the treaty power, and accordingly it lies outside Congress' reach unless supported by some other power enumerated in the Constitution. The Government has presented no such justification for this statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   For these reasons, I would reverse petitioner's conviction on constitutional grounds.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.
