If the parent files a petition within one year of the child's removal, a court \"shall order the return of the child forthwith.\" But when the petition is filed after the 1-year period expires, the court \"shall ... order the return of the child, unless it is demonstrated that the child is now settled in its new environment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Respondent Montoya Alvarez and petitioner Lozano resided with their daughter in London until November 2008, when Montoya Alvarez left with the child for a women's shelter. In July 2009, Montoya Alvarez and the child left the United Kingdom and ultimately settled in New York. Lozano did not locate Montoya Alvarez and the child until November 2010, more than 16 months after Montoya Alvarez and the child had left the United Kingdom. At that point, Lozano filed a Petition for Return of Child pursuant to the Hague Convention in the Southern District of New York. Finding that the petition was filed more than one year after removal, the court denied the petition on the basis that the child was now settled in New York. It also held that the 1-year period could not be extended by equitable tolling.

Though part of the established backdrop of American law, equitable tolling has no proper role in the interpretation of treaties unless that principle is shared by the parties to the \"agreement among sovereign powers,\"\n   <em>\n    Zicherman v.

Lozano has identified no such shared principle among the Convention signatories, and the courts of several signatories have explicitly rejected equitable tolling of the Convention. Thus, the American presumption does not apply to this multilateral treaty.

Statutes of limitations embody a \"policy of repose, designed to protect defendants,\"\n   <em>\n    Burnett v. New York Central R.

Here, the remedy the Convention affords the left-behind parent-return of the child-continues to be available after one year, thus preserving the possibility of relief for that parent and preventing repose for the abducting parent. The period's expiration also does not establish certainty about the parties' respective rights. Instead, it opens the door to consideration of a third party's interests,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   the child's interest in settlement. Because that is not the sort of interest addressed by a statute of limitations, the 1-year period should not be treated as a statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    Young,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 47,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9395201,352189\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/122/1036/\">\n    122 S.Ct. 1036\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , distinguished. Pp. 1233 - 1235.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (3) Without a presumption of equitable tolling, the Convention does not support extending the 1-year period during concealment. Article 12 explicitly provides for the period to commence on \"the date of the wrongful removal or retention\" and makes no provision for an extension. Because the drafters did not choose to delay the period's commencement until discovery of the child's location-the obvious alternative to the date of wrongful removal-the natural implication is that they did not intend to commence the period on that later date. Lozano contends that equitable tolling is nonetheless consistent with the Convention's goal of deterring child abductions, but the Convention does not pursue that goal at any cost, having recognized that the return remedy may be overcome by,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   the child's interest in settlement. And the abducting parent does not necessarily profit by running out the clock, since both American courts and other Convention signatories have considered concealment\n   as a factor in determining whether a child is settled. Equitable tolling is therefore neither required by the Convention nor the only available means to advance its objectives. Pp. 1234 - 1236.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (4) Lozano contends that there is room for United States courts to apply equitable tolling because the Convention recognizes that other sources of law may permit signatory states to return abducted children even when return is not available or required by the Convention. But this contention mistakes the nature of equitable tolling, which may be applied to the Hague Convention only if the treaty drafters so intended. For the foregoing reason, they did not.

Shortly after Montoya Alvarez left in November 2008, he called her sister Gloria in London, but eventually received legal advice not to speak with Montoya Alvarez' family. A mediation service also sent several letters to Montoya Alvarez on Lozano's behalf without receiving a response. In July 2009, Lozano filed an application for a court order in the United Kingdom \" 'to ensure that he obtains regular contact with his [child] and plays an active role in [her] life.' \"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4175586\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/809/197/#p204\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4175586\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/809/197/#p204\">\n     at 210\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Brief for Petitioner 25. Specifically, Lozano contends that the Convention recognizes additional sources of law that permit signatory states to return abducted children even when return is not available or required pursuant to the Convention. Article 34 of the Convention provides that \"for the purpos[e] of obtaining the return of a child,\" the Convention \"shall not restrict the application of an international instrument in force between the State of origin and the State addressed\" or the application of \"other law of the State addressed.\" Treaty Doc., at 13; see also Art. 18,\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 11 (\"The provisions of this Chapter do not limit the power of a judicial or administrative authority to order the return of the child at any time\"). In Lozano's view, equitable tolling principles constitute \"other law\" that should apply here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    That contention mistakes the nature of equitable tolling as this Court has applied it. We do not apply equitable tolling as a matter of some independent authority to reconsider the fairness of legislative judgments balancing the needs for relief and repose. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 7-8. To the contrary, we may apply equitable tolling to the Hague Convention only if we determine that the treaty drafters so intended.

I write separately to explain why\n    courts have equitable discretion under the Hague Convention to order a child's return even after the child has become settled, and how that discretion prevents abuses that petitioner claims will follow from holding that Article 12's 1-year period may not be equitably tolled.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The Convention is designed to protect the interests of children and their parents. Much of the Convention can be understood as an attempt to balance the various interests of children and non-abducting parents when a parent abducts a child from the child's country of habitual residence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    When a child has been absent from the country of habitual residence for less than a year, the Convention conclusively presumes that the child's nascent attachment to the new country is outweighed by the non-abducting parent's interest in prompt return and the child's own interest in returning to the country from which he or she was removed just a few months previously. This is why Article 12 requires return \"forthwith\" if the petition for return is brought within a year of abduction, unless one of the narrow exceptions set forth in Article 13 or 20 applies. Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (Hague Convention or Convention), Oct. 25, 1980, T.I.A.S. No. 11670, S. Treaty Doc. No. 99-11 (Treaty Doc.), p. 9. But, as the Convention recognizes, at some point the child will become accustomed to the new environment, making Article 12's conclusive presumption inappropriate. Thus, if the petition for return is brought after a year has elapsed, the court must determine whether the child has become \"settled\" in the new country; and if this has occurred, the court need not order return.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5708037\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/179/494/#p535\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    As the majority recognizes, this provision of the Convention \"opens the door to consideration of ... the child's interest in settlement.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1234 - 1235.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    But opening the door to consideration of the child's attachment to the new country does not mean closing the door to evaluating all other interests of the child and the non-abducting parent. The fact that, after one year, a child's need for stability requires a court to take into account the child's attachment to the new country does not mean that such attachment becomes the\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    factor worth considering when evaluating a petition for return.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Nothing in Article 12 prohibits courts from taking other factors into account. To the contrary, the Convention explicitly permits them to do so. Article 18 provides that \"[t]he provisions of this Chapter [including Article 12] do not limit the power of a judicial or administrative authority to order the return of the child at any time.\" Hague Convention, Treaty Doc., at 11. A court thus has power to order the child's return in the exercise of its sound discretion even where Article 12's obligation to order such return no longer applies.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    This provision makes eminent sense. Even after a year has elapsed and the child has become settled in the new environment, a variety of factors may outweigh the child's interest in remaining in the new country, such as the child's interest in returning to his or her original country of residence (with which he or she may still have close ties, despite having become settled in the new country); the child's need for contact with the non-abducting parent, who was exercising custody when the abduction occurred; the non-abducting parent's interest in exercising the custody to which he or she is legally entitled; the need to discourage inequitable conduct (such as concealment) by abducting parents; and the need to deter international abductions generally.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Article 12 places no limit on Article 18's grant of discretionary power to order return.

The final clause indicates when the obligation imposed earlier in the sentence terminates; it does not substitute for that obligation a prohibition on ordering return.

Such a prohibition would run counter to other provisions of the Convention. For instance, Article 13(b) gives a court discretion to return or decline to return a child who has not become settled if \"there is a grave risk that ... return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.\" Hague Convention, Treaty Doc., at 10. If a court has discretion to order return even where such return poses \"a grave risk\" of harm or threatens to place the child in an \"intolerable situation,\" surely it has discretion to order return when faced with the lesser risk attendant on removing a child from the child's present environment (especially given that the child will generally be returning to a known environment: her country of habitual residence).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    The State Department has adopted the view that the Convention empowers a court, in its equitable discretion, to return a child who has become settled. In the analysis that it provided to the Senate in connection with the ratification process, the Department made clear that, even when a year has elapsed and the child has become settled, a court may still consider such factors as \"evidence ... concerning the child's contacts with and ties to his or her State of habitual residence,\" \"[t]he reason for the passage of time,\" and any concealment by the abducting parent in determining whether to order return.

The United Kingdom's House of Lords (at the time that nation's highest court) has held that \"a settled child might nevertheless be returned\" by a court in the exercise of its discretion-a conclusion driven in part by acknowledgment of the inequity of rewarding concealment.\n    <em>\n     In re M,\n    </em>\n    [2008] 1 A.C. 1288, 1304, \u00b6 31 (Eng. 2007) (opinion of Baroness Hale of Richmond).

Petitioner predicts dire consequences from the Court's holding. He argues that, as a result of our decision, the United States will become an abduction haven, with parents concealing their children here until Article 12's 1-year period has run and then claiming their children have become settled and hence ineligible for return. But such inequitable conduct would weigh heavily in favor of returning a child even if she has become settled. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    State Legal Analysis,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20Fed.%20Reg.%2010509\">\n     51 Fed. Reg. 10509\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"If the alleged wrongdoer concealed the child's whereabouts from the custodian necessitating a long search for the child and thereby delayed the commencement of a return proceeding by the applicant, it is highly questionable whether the respondent should be permitted to benefit from such conduct absent strong countervailing considerations\");\n    <em>\n     In re M, supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1310, \u00b6 31 (recognizing that a court may take concealment into account in considering whether to return a settled child). Given the courts' discretion to order return in response to concealment, I do not believe the Court's decision today risks incentivizing parents to flee with their children to this country and conceal them.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Equitable discretion is also a far better tool than equitable tolling with which to address the dangers of concealment. Equitable tolling would require return\n    <em>\n     every\n    </em>\n    time the abducting parent conceals the child and thereby prevents the non-abducting parent from filing a return petition within a year, regardless of how settled in the new country the child has become. Thus, on petitioner's view, a court would be bound to return a 14-year-old child who was brought to the United States shortly after birth and had been concealed here ever since. By contrast, when a court exercises its equitable discretion, it may consider other factors in addition to concealment. While concealment is a significant factor and should weigh heavily in a court's analysis, in appropriate cases it can be overcome by circumstances such as the extended length of the child's residence in this country, any strong ties the child has formed here, and the child's attenuated connections to his or her former country.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    In short, I believe the power of a court, in the exercise of its sound discretion, to return even a settled child prevents the inapplicability of equitable tolling to Article 12's 1-year limit from encouraging parents to flee to the United States and conceal their children here.

See\n     <em>\n      In re H,\n     </em>\n     [2000] 2 F.L.R. 51, [2000] 3 F.C.R. 404 (Eng.). It is unclear whether the logic of that decision survived the decision of the Court of Appeals for England and Wales in\n     <em>\n      Cannon\n     </em>\n     .\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"5.\">\n    <p id=\"p-96\">\n     In the State Department's view, the Hague Convention confers equitable discretion on courts to order the return of a child even if the court determines that the child is \"settled\" within the meaning of Article 12. See Brief for United States as\n     <em>\n      Amicus Curiae\n     </em>\n     19-25. If accurate, that interpretation would reinforce that Article 12 is not meant to provide repose to the abducting parent, and it would underscore that the 1-year period is not a statute of limitations. But we do not decide whether, and under what circumstances, a court may exercise discretion to order return notwithstanding the child's subsequent settlement. In the Court of Appeals, Lozano failed to challenge the District Court's decision not to exercise its discretion to order the return of the settled child, see n. 3,\n     <em>\n      supra,\n     </em>\n     and that issue is beyond the scope of the question presented before this Court.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"6.\">\n    <p id=\"p-97\">\n     Lozano argues that the United States delegation referred to the 1-year period as a \"statute of limitations\" at various points during and after the drafting process. Brief for Petitioner 27-28. Because the determination whether the 1-year period is a statute of limitations depends on its functional characteristics, it is not significant that the delegation used that label. In any event, we doubt that the remarks of a single delegation are sufficient under these circumstances to establish the \" 'shared expectations of the contracting parties.' \"\n     <em>\n      Olympic Airways v.
