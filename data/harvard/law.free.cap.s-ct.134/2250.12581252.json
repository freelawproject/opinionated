In aid of executing the judgments, NML sought discovery of Argentina's property, serving subpoenas on two nonparty banks for records relating to Argentina's global financial transactions. The District Court granted NML's motions to compel compliance.

Henceforth, any sort of immunity defense made by a foreign sovereign in an American court must stand or fall on the Act's text. The Act confers on foreign states two kinds of immunity.

The second, execution immunity, generally shields \"property in the United States of a foreign state\" from attachment, arrest, and execution. \u00a7\u00a7 1609, 1610. See also \u00a7 1611(a), (b)(1), (b)(2). The Act has no third provision forbidding or limiting discovery in aid of execution of a foreign-sovereign judgment debtor's assets.

In 2005 and 2010, it restructured most of that debt by offering creditors new securities (with less favorable terms) to swap out for the defaulted ones. Most bondholders went along.

Having been unable to collect on its judgments from Argentina, NML has attempted to execute them against Argentina's property.

For the most part, the two subpoenas target the same kinds of information: documents relating to accounts maintained by or on behalf of Argentina, documents identifying the opening and closing dates of Argentina's accounts, current balances, transaction histories, records of electronic fund transfers, debts owed by the bank to Argentina, transfers in and out of Argentina's accounts, and information about transferors and transferees.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    Argentina, joined by BOA, moved to quash the BOA subpoena. NML moved to compel compliance but, before the court ruled, agreed to narrow its subpoenas by excluding the names of some Argentine officials from the initial electronic-fund-transfer message search. NML also agreed to treat as confidential any documents that the banks so designated.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    The District Court denied the motion to quash and granted the motions to compel. Approving the subpoenas in principle, it concluded that extraterritorial asset discovery did not offend Argentina's sovereign\n    immunity, and it reaffirmed that it would serve as a \"clearinghouse for information\" in NML's efforts to find and attach Argentina's assets.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 69(a)(2) states that, \"[i]n aid of the judgment or execution, the judgment creditor ... may obtain discovery from any person-including the judgment debtor-as provided in the rules or by the procedure of the state where the court is located.\" See 12 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; R. Marcus, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3014, p. 160 (2d ed. 1997) (hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller) (court \"may use the discovery devices provided in [the federal rules] or may obtain discovery in the manner provided by the practice of the state in which the district court is held\"). The general rule in the federal system is that, subject to the district court's discretion, \"[p]arties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party's claim or defense.\" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 26(b)(1). And New York law entitles judgment creditors to discover \"all matter relevant to the satisfaction of [a] judgment,\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Civ.%20Prac.%20Law%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%205223\">\n     N.Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. \u00a7 5223\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (West 1997), permitting \"investigation [of] any person shown to have any light to shed on the subject of the judgment debtor's assets or their whereabouts,\" D. Siegel, New York Practice \u00a7 509, p. 891 (5th ed. 2011).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    The meaning of those rules was much discussed at oral argument. What if the assets targeted by the discovery request are beyond the jurisdictional reach of the court to which the request is made? May the court nonetheless permit discovery so long as the judgment creditor shows that the assets are recoverable under the laws of the jurisdictions in which they reside, whether that be Florida or France? We need not take up those issues today, since Argentina has not put them in contention. In the Court of Appeals, Argentina's only asserted ground for objection to the subpoenas was the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3528953\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/695/201/\">\n     695 F.3d, at 208\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Argentina argues ... that the normally broad scope of discovery in aid of execution is limited in this case by principles of\n    sovereign immunity\"). And Argentina's petition for writ of certiorari asked us to decide only whether that Act \"imposes [a] limit on a United States court's authority to order blanket post-judgment execution discovery on the assets of a foreign state used for any activity anywhere in the world.\" Pet. for Cert. 14. Plainly, then, this is not a case about the breadth of Rule 69(a)(2).\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fr2\" name=\"fr2\">\n      2\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    We thus assume without deciding that, as the Government conceded at argument, Tr. of Oral Arg. 24, and as the Second Circuit concluded below, \"in a run-of-the-mill execution proceeding ... the district court would have been within its discretion to order the discovery from third-party banks about the judgment debtor's assets located outside the United States.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3528953\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/695/201/\">\n     695 F.3d, at 208\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Thus, any sort of immunity defense made by a foreign sovereign in an American court must stand on the Act's text. Or it must fall.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    The text of the Act confers on foreign states two kinds of immunity. First and most significant, \"a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States ... except as provided in sections 1605 to 1607.\" \u00a7 1604. That provision is of no help to Argentina here: A foreign state may waive jurisdictional immunity, \u00a7 1605(a)(1), and in this case Argentina did so, see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3528953\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/695/201/\">\n     695 F.3d, at 203\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Consequently, the Act makes Argentina \"liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.\" \u00a7 1606.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The Act's second immunity-conferring provision states that \"the property in the United States of a foreign state shall be immune from attachment[,] arrest [,] and execution except as provided in sections 1610 and 1611 of this chapter.\" \u00a7 1609. The exceptions to this immunity defense (we will call it \"execution immunity\") are narrower. \"The property in the United States of a foreign state\" is subject to attachment, arrest, or execution if (1) it is \"used for a commercial activity in the United States,\" \u00a7 1610(a),\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    (2) some other enumerated exception to immunity applies, such as the one allowing for waiver, see \u00a7 1610(a)(1)-(7). The Act goes on to confer a more robust execution immunity on designated international-organization property, \u00a7 1611(a), property of a foreign central bank, \u00a7 1611(b)(1), and \"property of a foreign state ... [that] is, or is intended to be, used in connection with a military activity\" and is either \"of a military character\" or \"under the control of a military authority or defense agency,\" \u00a7 1611(b)(2).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    That is the last of the Act's immunity-granting sections. There is no third provision forbidding or limiting discovery in aid of execution of a foreign-sovereign judgment debtor's assets. Argentina concedes that no part of the Act \"expressly address[es] [postjudgment] discovery.\" Brief for Petitioner 22. Quite right. The Act speaks of discovery only once, in an subsection requiring courts to stay discovery requests directed to the United States that would interfere with criminal or national-security matters, \u00a7 1605(g)(1). And that section explicitly suspends certain Federal Rules of Civil Procedure when such a stay is entered, see \u00a7 1605(g)(4). Elsewhere, it is clear when the Act's provisions specifically applicable to suits against sovereigns displace their general federal-rule counterparts. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 1608(d).

Its argument has several parts. First, it asserts that, before and after the Tate Letter, the State Department and American courts routinely accorded\n    <em>\n     absolute\n    </em>\n    execution immunity to foreign-state property. If a thing belonged to a foreign sovereign, then, no matter where it was found, it was immune from execution. And absolute immunity from\n    <em>\n     execution\n    </em>\n    necessarily entailed immunity from\n    <em>\n     discovery in aid of execution\n    </em>\n    . Second, by codifying execution immunity with only a small set of exceptions, Congress merely \"partially lowered the previously unconditional barrier to post-judgment relief.\" Brief for Petitioner 29. Because the Act gives \"no indication that it was authorizing courts to inquire into state property beyond the court's limited enforcement authority,\"\n    <em>\n     ibid.,\n    </em>\n    Argentina contends, discovery of assets that do not fall within an exception to execution immunity (plainly true of a foreign state's extraterritorial assets) is forbidden.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The argument founders at each step. To begin with, Argentina cites no case holding that, before the Act, a foreign state's extraterritorial assets enjoyed absolute execution immunity in United States courts. No surprise there. Our courts generally lack authority in the first place to execute against property in other countries, so how could the question ever have arisen? See Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 3013, at 156 (\"[A] writ of execution ... can be served anywhere within the state in which the district court is held\"). More importantly, even if Argentina were right about the scope of the common-law execution-immunity rule, then it would be obvious that the terms of \u00a7 1609 execution immunity are narrower, since the text of that provision immunizes only foreign-state property \"\n    <em>\n     in the United States\n    </em>\n    .\" So even if Argentina were correct that \u00a7 1609 execution immunity implies coextensive discovery-in-aid-of-execution immunity, the latter would not shield from discovery a foreign sovereign's extraterritorial assets.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    But what of foreign-state property that\n    <em>\n     would\n    </em>\n    enjoy execution immunity under the Act, such as Argentina's diplomatic or military property? Argentina maintains that, if a judgment creditor could not ultimately execute a judgment against certain property, then it has no business pursuing discovery of information pertaining to that property. But the reason for these subpoenas is that NML\n    <em>\n     does not yet know\n    </em>\n    what property Argentina has and where it is, let alone whether it is executable under the relevant jurisdiction's law. If, bizarrely, NML's subpoenas had sought only \"information that could not lead to executable assets in the United States or abroad,\" then Argentina likely would be correct to say that the subpoenas were unenforceable-\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    because information about nonexecutable assets enjoys a penumbral \"discovery immunity\" under the Act, but because information that could not possibly lead to executable assets is simply not \"relevant\" to execution in the first place, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 26(b)(1);\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Civ.%20Prac.%20Law%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%205223\">\n     N.Y. Civ. Prac.

They ask for information about Argentina's worldwide assets generally, so that NML can identify where Argentina may be holding property that\n    <em>\n     is\n    </em>\n    subject to execution. To be sure, that request is bound to turn up information about property that Argentina regards as immune. But NML may think the same property\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    immune. In which case, Argentina's self-serving legal assertion will not automatically prevail; the District Court will have to settle the matter.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Today's decision leaves open what Argentina thinks is a gap in the statute. Could the 1976 Congress really have meant not to protect foreign states from postjudgment discovery \"clearinghouses\"? The riddle is not ours to solve (if it can be solved at all). It is of course possible that, had Congress anticipated the rather unusual circumstances of this case (foreign sovereign waives immunity; foreign sovereign owes money under valid judgments; foreign sovereign does not pay and apparently has no executable assets in the United States), it would have added to the Act a sentence conferring categorical discovery-in-aid-of-execution immunity on a foreign state's extraterritorial assets. Or, just as possible, it would have done no such thing. Either way, \"[t]he question ... is not what Congress 'would have wanted' but what Congress enacted in the FSIA.\"\n    <em>\n     Republic of Argentina v.

These apprehensions are better directed to that branch of government with authority to amend the Act-which, as it happens, is the same branch that forced our retirement from the immunity-by-factor-balancing business nearly 40 years ago.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fr6\" name=\"fr6\">\n      6\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    <em>\n     It is so ordered.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Justice SOTOMAYOR took no part in the decision of this case.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"dissent\">\n   <author id=\"p-48\">\n    <strong>\n     Justice GINSBURG, dissenting.\n    </strong>\n   </author>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201330\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1330\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1602\n    <em>\n     et seq\n    </em>\n    ., if one of several conditions is met, permits execution of a judgment rendered in the United States against a foreign sovereign only on \"property in the United States ... used for a commercial activity.\" \u00a7 1610(a).
