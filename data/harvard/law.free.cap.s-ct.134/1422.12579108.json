Respondent filed suit, asserting, as relevant here, that Northwest had breached its contract by revoking his membership status without valid cause and had violated the duty of good faith and fair dealing because it terminated his membership in a way that contravened his reasonable expectations. The District Court found that the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978(ADA) pre-empted the breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing claim and dismissed the breach of contract claim without prejudice. Respondent appealed only the dismissal of his breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing claim. The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that claim \" 'too tenuously connected to airline regulation to trigger' \" ADA pre-emption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Held:\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   1.

As first enacted, the provision also applied to \"rule[s]\" and \"standard[s],\" a formulation encompassing common-law rules. See\n   <em>\n    CSX Transp., Inc. v.

There, the Court held that the Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971 did not pre-empt a common-law tort claim, but that Act's pre-emption provision is more narrowly worded than the ADA provision. The Boat Safety Act's saving and pre-emption provisions were also enacted at the same time, while the Federal Aviation Act's general remedies saving clause is \"a relic of the pre-ADA/no pre-emption regime,\"\n   <em>\n    Morales,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729384\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/374/#p378\">\n    504 U.S., at 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729384\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/374/#p378\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that \"cannot be allowed to supersede the specific substantive pre-emption provision,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729384\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/374/#p378\">\n     ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Exempting common-law claims would also disserve the ADA's central purpose, which was to eliminate federal regulation of rates, routes, and services so they could be set by market forces. Finally, if\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   state common-law rules fell outside the pre-emption provision's ambit,\n   <em>\n    Wolens\n   </em>\n   would not have singled out a subcategory, for common-law claims based on the parties' voluntary undertaking, as falling outside that provision's coverage. Pp. 1429 - 1431.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (c) Respondent's claim \"relates to\" \"rates, routes, or services.\" It clearly has \"a connection with or reference to airline\" prices, routes, or services,\n   <em>\n    Morales,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729384\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/374/#p378\">\n    504 U.S., at 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729384\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/374/#p378\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As in\n   <em>\n    Wolens,\n   </em>\n   Northwest's program connects to the airline's \"rates\" by awarding mileage credits redeemable for tickets and upgrades, thus eliminating or reducing ticket prices. It also connects to \"services,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   access to flights and higher service categories. Respondent's counterarguments are unpersuasive. His claim that he is contesting his termination, not access to flights or upgrades, ignores his reason for seeking reinstatement: to obtain reduced rates and enhanced services. Although respondent and\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   claim there have been fundamental changes in the way that frequent flyer miles are earned since\n   <em>\n    Wolens\n   </em>\n   was decided, that does not matter here where respondent did not assert that he earned miles from any activity but taking flights or that he attempted to redeem miles for anything but tickets and upgrades. Pp. 1425 - 1431.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   2. Because respondent's implied covenant claim seeks to enlarge his contractual agreement with petitioners, it is pre-empted by \u00a7 41713(b)(1). Under Minnesota law, which controls here, the implied covenant must be regarded as a state-imposed obligation. Minnesota law does not permit parties to contract out of the covenant. And when a State's law does not authorize parties to free themselves from the covenant, a breach of covenant claim is pre-empted under\n   <em>\n    Wolens\n   </em>\n   . As an independent basis for this conclusion, if, as Minnesota law provides, the implied covenant applies to \"every contract\" except employment contracts for \"policy reasons,\" then the decision not to exempt other types of contracts must likewise be based on a policy determination, namely, that the policy reason for the employment contract rule does not apply in other contexts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Petitioners claim that the refusal to pre-empt all implied covenant claims, regardless\n   of state law, will lead to a patchwork of rules that will frustrate the ADA's deregulatory aim. But airlines can avoid such a result if they contract out of covenants where permitted by state law. Nor are participants in frequent flyer programs left without protection. They can avoid an airline with a poor reputation and possibly enroll in a more favorable rival program. Moreover, the Department of Transportation has the authority to investigate complaints about frequent flyer programs. Finally, respondent might have been able to vindicate his claim of ill treatment by Northwest had he appealed his breach of contract claim.

The exception for employment contracts is based, in significant part, on \"policy reasons,\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10658167\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/384/853/#p857\">\n      id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10658167\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/384/853/#p857\">\n     at 858\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , and therefore the decision not to exempt other types of contracts must be based on a policy determination, namely, that the \"policy reasons\" that support the rule for employment contracts do not apply (at least with the same force) in other contexts. When the application of the implied covenant depends on state policy, a breach of implied covenant claim cannot be viewed as simply an attempt to vindicate the parties' implicit understanding of the contract.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    For these reasons, the breach of implied covenant claim in this case cannot stand, but petitioners exhort us to go further and hold that all such claims, no matter the content of the law of the relevant jurisdiction, are pre-empted. If pre-emption depends on state law, petitioners warn, airlines will be faced with a baffling patchwork of rules, and the deregulatory aim of the ADA will be frustrated. But the airlines have means to avoid such a result. A State's implied covenant rules will escape pre-emption only if the law of the relevant State permits an airline to contract around those rules in its frequent flyer program agreement, and if an airline's agreement is governed by the law of such a State, the airline can specify that the agreement does not incorporate the covenant. While the inclusion of such a provision may impose transaction costs and presumably would not enhance the attractiveness of the program, an airline can decide whether the benefits of such a provision are worth the potential costs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Our holding also does not leave participants in frequent flyer programs without protection. The ADA is based on the view that the best interests of airline passengers are most effectively promoted, in the main, by allowing the free market to operate. If an airline acquires a reputation for mistreating the participants in its frequent flyer program (who are generally the airline's most loyal and valuable customers), customers can avoid that program and may be able to enroll in a more favorable rival program.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Federal law also provides protection for frequent flyer program participants. Congress has given the Department of Transportation (DOT) the general authority to prohibit and punish unfair and deceptive practices in air transportation and in the sale of air transportation,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2041712\">\n     49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41712\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a), and Congress has specifically authorized the DOT to investigate complaints relating to frequent flyer programs. See FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, \u00a7 408(6),\n    <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=126%20Stat.%2087\">\n     126 Stat. 87\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Pursuant to these provisions, the DOT regularly entertains and acts on such complaints.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fr3\" name=\"fr3\">\n      3\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    We note, finally, that respondent's claim of ill treatment by Northwest might have been vindicated if he had pursued his breach-of-contract claim after its dismissal by the District Court. Respondent argues that, contrary to the holding of the District Court, the frequent flyer agreement did not actually give Northwest unfettered discretion to terminate his membership in the program, see Brief for Respondent 20-21, and the United States makes a related argument, namely, that even if the agreement gave Northwest complete discretion with respect to a determination regarding abuse of the program, the agreement did not necessarily bar a claim asserting that membership was ended for an ulterior reason, such as an effort to cut costs. If respondent had appealed the dismissal of his breach-of-contract claim, he could have presented these arguments to the Court of Appeals, but he chose not to press that claim. He voluntarily dismissed the breach-of-contract claim and instead appealed only the breach of implied covenant claim, which we hold to be pre-empted.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    * * *\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Because respondent's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim seeks to enlarge his contractual agreement with petitioners, we hold that\n    <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2041713\">\n     49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41713\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(1) pre-empts the claim.
