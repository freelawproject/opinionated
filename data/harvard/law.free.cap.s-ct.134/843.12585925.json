Respondent Mirowski Family Ventures, LLC, owns patents relating to implantable heart stimulators. They have a licensing agreement that permits Medtronic to practice certain Mirowski patents in exchange for royalty payments, and that specifies procedures to identify products covered by the license and to resolve disputes between the parties. Pursuant to those procedures, Mirowski notified Medtronic of its belief that several of Medtronic's products infringed the licensed patents, and Medtronic then challenged that assertion of infringement in a declaratory judgment action, while accumulating disputed royalties in an escrow account for distribution to the prevailing party. The District Court concluded that Mirowski, as the party asserting infringement, had the burden of proving infringement and that Mirowski had not met that burden. The Federal Circuit disagreed. It acknowledged that a patentee normally bears the burden of proof, but concluded that where the patentee is a declaratory judgment defendant and, like Mirowski, is foreclosed from asserting an infringement counterclaim by the continued existence of a licensing agreement, the party seeking the declaratory judgment, namely Medtronic, bears the burden of persuasion.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-7\">\n  <em>\n   Held:\n  </em>\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-8\">\n  1.

Practical considerations lead to the same conclusion. Shifting the burden based on the form of the action could create postlitigation uncertainty about a patent's scope. It may also create unnecessary complexity by compelling a licensee to prove a negative. Finally, burden shifting is difficult to reconcile with the Declaratory Judgment Act's purpose of ameliorating the \"dilemma\" posed by \"putting\" one challenging a patent's scope \"to the choice between abandoning his rights or risking\" suit,\n   <em>\n    MedImmune, Inc. v.

To the extent that the Federal Circuit's burden shifting rule makes the declaratory judgment procedure disadvantageous, that rule recreates the dilemma that the Declaratory Judgment Act sought to avoid. Pp. 849 - 851.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (b) Several arguments to the contrary are unconvincing. First,\n   <em>\n    Schaffer v.

For reasons explained in this case, declaratory judgment suits like this one are an exception to\n   <em>\n    Schaffer\n   </em>\n   's default rule. Second, the fact that the Federal Circuit limited its holding to the circumstance where a license forecloses an infringement counterclaim by a patentee cannot, by itself, show that the holding is legally justified. Third, contrary to one\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   ' concern that this Court's holding will permit licensees to force patent holders into full-blown infringement litigation, such litigation can occur only when there is a genuine and sufficiently \"immedia[te]\" dispute about a patent's validity or application,\n   <em>\n    MedImmune,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 127,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553591\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/118/#p129\">\n    127 S.Ct. 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This case asks us to decide whether the burden of proof shifts when the patentee is a defendant in a declaratory judgment action, and the plaintiff (the potential infringer) seeks a judgment that he does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   infringe the patent. We hold that, when a licensee seeks a declaratory judgment against a patentee to establish that there is no infringement, the burden of proving infringement remains with the patentee. We reverse the Federal Circuit's determination to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We set forth a simplified version of the facts. The parties are Medtronic, Inc., a firm that (among other things) designs, makes, and sells medical devices, and Mirowski Family Ventures, LLC, a firm that owns patents relating to implantable heart stimulators. In 1991 Medtronic and Mirowski entered into an agreement permitting Medtronic to practice certain Mirowski patents in exchange for royalty payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In less simplified form: Mirowski entered into a license agreement with Eli Lilly &amp; Co., which then sublicensed the Mirowski patents to Medtronic. Guidant Corp. is Eli Lilly's successor in interest. For present purposes we shall ignore Eli Lilly, Guidant, and other parties on Mirowski's side, using \"Mirowski\" to refer to any and all of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The 1991 agreement also provided that, if Mirowski gave notice to Medtronic that a new Medtronic product \"infringe[d]\" a\n   Mirowski patent, Medtronic had a choice. App. 13. Medtronic could simply \"cure the nonpayment of royalties.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3450413\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/74/583/#p609\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Or it could pay royalties and, at the same time, \"challenge\" the \"assertion of infringement of any of the Mirowski patents through a Declaratory Judgment action.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3450413\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/74/583/#p609\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Medtronic, of course, might just ignore the agreement and decide not to pay royalties at all, in which case Mirowski would have \"the right to terminate the [l]icense,\"\n   <em>\n    ibid.,\n   </em>\n   and, if it wished, bring an infringement action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In 2006 the parties entered into a further agreement that slightly modified the procedure for resolving disputes. If Medtronic, having received \"timely written notice of infringement,\" chose to pursue a declaratory judgment action \"challenging infringement,\" it could \"accumulate disputed royalties\" in an escrow account.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 24, 27. The prevailing party in the declaratory judgment action would receive the royalties.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In 2007 the parties found themselves in the midst of an \"infringement\" dispute. Mirowski gave Medtronic notice that it believed seven new Medtronic products violated various claims contained in two of its patents (related to devices that cause the heart's ventricles to contract simultaneously as the heart beats). Medtronic thought that its products did not infringe Mirowski's patents, either because the products fell outside the scope of the patent claims or because the patents were invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In 2007 Medtronic brought this declaratory judgment action in Federal District Court in Delaware. It sought a declaration that its products did not infringe Mirowski's patents and that the patents were invalid. But, as its agreement with Mirowski provided, Medtronic paid all the relevant royalties into an escrow account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The District Court recognized that Mirowski was the defendant in the action. But it nonetheless believed that Mirowski, \"[a]s the part[y] asserting infringement,\" bore the burden of proving infringement.\n   <em>\n    Medtronic, Inc. v.

After a bench trial, the court found that Mirowski had not proved infringement, either directly or under the doctrine of equivalents. And since Mirowski, the patentee, bore the burden of proof, it lost.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3834891\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/777/750/#p766\">\n    777 F.Supp.2d, at 767-770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit considered the burden of proof question, and it came to the opposite conclusion. It held that Medtronic, the declaratory judgment plaintiff, bore the burden. It acknowledged that normally the patentee, not the accused infringer, bears the burden of proving infringement, and that the burden normally will not \"shift\" even when the patentee is \"a counterclaiming defendant in a declaratory judgment action.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3527851\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/695/1266/\">\n    695 F.3d 1266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1272 (2012). Nonetheless, the Court of Appeals believed that a different rule applies where that patentee is a declaratory judgment defendant\n   <em>\n    and,\n   </em>\n   like Mirowski, that patentee/defendant is \"foreclosed\" from asserting an \"infringement counterclaim\" by the \"continued existence of a license.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3527851\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/695/1266/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3527851\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/695/1266/\">\n    at 1274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Medtronic believes-and seeks to establish in this declaratory judgment suit-that it does not owe royalties because its products are noninfringing. If Medtronic were to act on that belief (by not paying royalties and not bringing a declaratory judgment action), Mirowski could terminate the license and bring an ordinary federal patent law action for infringement. See Brief for Respondent 48 (acknowledging that if Medtronic had \"chosen not to pay the royalties ... it would have subjected itself to a suit for infringement\").

In that suit, who bears the burden of proof, or, to be more precise, the burden of persuasion? Must the patentee prove infringement or must the licensee prove noninfringement?

[is] part of the very substance of [the plaintiff's] claim and cannot be considered a mere incident of a form of procedure\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Taken together these three legal propositions indicate that, in a licensee's declaratory judgment action, the burden of proving infringement should remain with the patentee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Several practical considerations lead to the same conclusion. To shift the burden depending upon the form of the action could create postlitigation uncertainty about the scope of the patent. Suppose the evidence is inconclusive, and an alleged\n   infringer loses his declaratory judgment action because he failed to prove noninfringement. The alleged infringer, or others, might continue to engage in the same allegedly infringing behavior, leaving it to the patentee to bring an infringement action. If the burden shifts, the patentee might\n   <em>\n    lose\n   </em>\n   that action because, the evidence being inconclusive, he failed to prove infringement. So, both sides might lose as to infringement, leaving the infringement question undecided, creating uncertainty among the parties and others who seek to know just what products and processes they are free to use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The example is not fanciful. The Restatement (Second) of Judgments says that relitigation of an issue (say, infringement) decided in one suit \"is not precluded\" in a subsequent suit where the burden of persuasion \"has shifted\" from the \"party against whom preclusion is sought ... to his adversary.\" Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 28(4) (1980). Rather, the\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \"[f]ailure of one party to carry the burden of persuasion on an issue should not establish the issue in favor of an adversary who otherwise would have the burden of persuasion on that issue in later litigation.\" 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4422, p. 592 (2d ed. 2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Thus the declaratory judgment suit in the example above would have failed to achieve its object: to provide \"an immediate and definitive determination of the legal rights of the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Aetna, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 241,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"336718\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/300/227/#p240\">\n    57 S.Ct. 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Moreover, to shift the burden can, at least on occasion, create unnecessary complexity by making it difficult for the licensee to understand upon just what theory the patentee's infringement claim rests. A complex patent can contain many pages of claims and limitations. A patent holder is in a better position than an alleged infringer to know, and to be able to point out, just where, how, and why a product (or process) infringes a claim of that patent. Until he does so, however, the alleged infringer may have to work in the dark, seeking, in his declaratory judgment complaint, to negate every conceivable infringement theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Finally burden shifting here is difficult to reconcile with a basic purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act. In\n   <em>\n    MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   a case that similarly concerned a patent licensee that brought a declaratory judgment action after the patentee accused it of infringement, we wrote that the \" 'very purpose' \" of that Act is to \" 'ameliorate' \" the \"dilemma\" posed by \"putting\" one who challenges a patent's scope \"to the choice between abandoning his rights or risking\" suit.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553591\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/118/#p129\">\n    549 U.S., at 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553591\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/118/#p129\">\n    127 S.Ct. 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Abbott Laboratories v.

In the absence of the declaratory judgment procedure, Medtronic would face the precise dilemma that\n   <em>\n    MedImmune\n   </em>\n   describes. Either Medtronic would have to abandon its right to challenge the scope of Mirowski's patents, or it would have to stop paying royalties, risk losing an ordinary patent infringement lawsuit, and thereby risk liability for treble damages and attorney's fees as well as injunctive relief. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20283-285\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 283-285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (providing for injunctive relief, treble damages, and-in \"exceptional cases\"-attorney's fees as remedies for patent infringement). As in\n   <em>\n    MedImmune,\n   </em>\n   the declaratory judgment action rescues Medtronic from this dilemma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Federal Circuit's burden shifting rule does not deprive Medtronic of the right to seek a declaratory judgment. But it does create a significant obstacle to use of that action. It makes the declaratory judgment procedure-compared to, say,\n   just refusing to pay royalties-disadvantageous. To that extent it recreates the dilemma that the Declaratory Judgment Act sought to avoid. As we have made clear (and as we explain below), we are unaware of any strong reason for creating that obstacle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   We are not convinced by the arguments raised to the contrary.

For the reasons we have set forth in Part III-A,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   declaratory judgment suits like the one at issue here constitute a further exception to the basic rule\n   <em>\n    Schaffer\n   </em>\n   described.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Second, the Federal Circuit emphasized that its holding applied only in \"the limited circumstance when an infringement counterclaim by a patentee is foreclosed by the continued existence of a license.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3527851\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/695/1266/\">\n    695 F.3d, at 1274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The fact that the Federal Circuit's opinion is limited, however, does not support its conclusion. The \"limited circumstance\" it described is often present when a patent licensee faces an ordinary but disputed claim of infringement. And that \"circumstance\" is virtually identical to\n   <em>\n    MedImmune,\n   </em>\n   where we found a declaratory judgment action constitutionally permissible. In any event, the fact that a rule's scope is limited cannot, by itself, show that the rule is legally justified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Third, an\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   supporting Mirowski fears that our holding, unlike the Federal Circuit's rule, will \"burden ... patent owners\" by permitting \"a licensee ...-at its sole discretion-[to] force the patentee into full-blown patent-infringement litigation.\" Brief for Intellectual Property Owners Association as\n   <em>\n    Amicus Curiae\n   </em>\n   9. The short answer to this argument, however, is that litigation can occur only in the presence of a genuine dispute, \" 'of sufficient immediacy and reality,' \" about the patent's validity or its application.\n   <em>\n    MedImmune,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 127,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553591\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/118/#p129\">\n    127 S.Ct. 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Maryland Casualty Co. v.

Indeed, it was Mirowski that set the present dispute in motion by accusing Medtronic of infringement. And in such an instance, we see no convincing reason why burden of proof law should favor the patentee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The public interest, of course, favors the maintenance of a well-functioning patent system.
