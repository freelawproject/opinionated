In her opinion for a plurality of the Court, Justice O'Connor understood enemy combatants to include \"an individual who ... was part of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition partners in Afghanistan and who engaged in an armed conflict against the United States there.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/\">\n    at 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). She concluded that the \"detention of individuals falling into the\n   <em>\n    limited category we are considering, for the duration of the particular conflict in which they were captured,\n   </em>\n   \" is \"an exercise of the 'necessary and appropriate force' \" that Congress authorized under the AUMF.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/\">\n    at 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). She explained, however, that the President's power to detain under the AUMF may be different when the \"practical circumstances\" of the relevant conflict are \"entirely unlike those of the conflicts that informed the development of the law of war.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/\">\n    at 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this case, the District Court concluded, and the Court of Appeals agreed, that petitioner Abdul Al Qader Ahmed Hussain could be detained under the AUMF because he was \"part of al-Qaeda\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   the Taliban at the time of his apprehension.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3955821\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/821/67/#p76\">\n    821 F.Supp.2d 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 76-79 (D.D.C.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added); accord,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4049698,3664751\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/718/964/\">\n    718 F.3d 964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 966-967 (C.A.D.C.2013). But even assuming this is correct, in either case-that is, irrespective of whether Hussain was part of al Qaeda\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   the Taliban-it is possible that Hussain was not an \"individual who ... was part of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition partners\n   <em>\n    in Afghanistan\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    who engaged in an armed conflict against the United States there\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/\">\n    542 U.S., at 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court has not directly addressed whether the AUMF authorizes, and the Constitution permits, detention on the basis that an individual was part of al Qaeda, or part of the Taliban, but was not \"engaged in an armed conflict against the United States\" in Afghanistan prior to his capture. Nor have we considered whether, assuming detention on these bases is permissible, either the AUMF or the Constitution limits the duration of detention.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
