Religious employers, such as churches, are exempt from this contraceptive mandate. HHS has also effectively exempted religious\n   nonprofit organizations with religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptive services. Under this accommodation, the insurance issuer must exclude contraceptive coverage from the employer's plan and provide plan participants with separate payments for contraceptive services without imposing any cost-sharing requirements on the employer, its insurance plan, or its employee beneficiaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In these cases, the owners of three closely held for-profit corporations have sincere Christian beliefs that life begins at conception and that it would violate their religion to facilitate access to contraceptive drugs or devices that operate after that point. In separate actions, they sued HHS and other federal officials and agencies (collectively HHS) under RFRA and the Free Exercise Clause, seeking to enjoin application of the contraceptive mandate insofar as it requires them to provide health coverage for the four objectionable contraceptives. In No. 13-356, the District Court denied the Hahns and their company-Conestoga Wood Specialties-a preliminary injunction. Affirming, the Third Circuit held that a for-profit corporation could not \"engage in religious exercise\" under RFRA or the First Amendment, and that the mandate imposed no requirements on the Hahns in their personal capacity. In No. 13-354, the Greens, their children, and their companies-Hobby Lobby Stores and Mardel-were also denied a preliminary injunction, but the Tenth Circuit reversed. It held that the Greens' businesses are \"persons\" under RFRA, and that the corporations had established a likelihood of success on their RFRA claim because the contraceptive mandate substantially burdened their exercise of religion and HHS had not demonstrated a compelling interest in enforcing the mandate against them; in the alternative, the court held that HHS had not proved that the mandate was the \"least restrictive means\" of furthering a compelling governmental interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Held\n   </em>\n   : As applied to closely held corporations, the HHS regulations imposing the contraceptive mandate violate RFRA. Pp. 2761 - 2785.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   (a) RFRA applies to regulations that govern the activities of closely held for-profit corporations like Conestoga, Hobby Lobby, and Mardel. Pp. 2761 - 2775.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (1) HHS argues that the companies cannot sue because they are for-profit corporations, and that the owners cannot sue because the regulations apply only to the companies, but that would leave merchants with a difficult choice: give up the right to seek judicial protection of their religious liberty or forgo the benefits of operating as corporations. RFRA's text shows that Congress designed the statute to provide very broad protection for religious liberty and did not intend to put merchants to such a choice. It employed the familiar legal fiction of including corporations within RFRA's definition of \"persons,\" but the purpose of extending rights to corporations is to protect the rights of people associated with the corporation, including shareholders, officers, and employees. Protecting the free-exercise rights of closely held corporations thus protects the religious liberty of the humans who own and control them. Pp. 2761 - 2768.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (2) HHS and the dissent make several unpersuasive arguments. Pp. 2768 - 2775.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (i) Nothing in RFRA suggests a congressional intent to depart from the Dictionary Act definition of \"person,\" which \"include[s] corporations, ... as well as individuals.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court has entertained RFRA and free-exercise claims brought by nonprofit corporations. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonzales v. O Centro Esp\u00edrita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5947540\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/418/\">\n    546 U.S. 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5947540\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/418/\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5947540\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/418/\">\n    163 L.Ed.2d 1017\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   And HHS's concession that a nonprofit corporation can be a \"person\" under RFRA effectively dispatches any argument that the term does not reach for-profit corporations; no conceivable definition of \"person\" includes natural persons and nonprofit corporations, but not for-profit corporations. Pp. 2768 - 2769.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (ii) HHS and the dissent nonetheless argue that RFRA does not cover Conestoga, Hobby Lobby, and Mardel because they cannot \"exercise ... religion.\" They offer no persuasive explanation for this conclusion. The corporate form alone cannot explain it because RFRA indisputably protects nonprofit corporations. And the profit-making objective of the corporations cannot explain it because the Court has entertained the free-exercise claims of individuals who were attempting to make a profit as retail merchants.\n   <em>\n    Braunfeld v. Brown,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285738\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/366/599/\">\n    366 U.S. 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285738\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/366/599/\">\n    81 S.Ct. 1144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285738\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/366/599/\">\n    6 L.Ed.2d 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Business practices compelled or limited by the tenets of a religious doctrine fall comfortably within the understanding of the \"exercise of religion\" that this Court set out in\n   <em>\n    Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4852\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/872/#p877\">\n    494 U.S. 872\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 877,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4852\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/872/#p877\">\n    110 S.Ct. 1595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4852\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/872/#p877\">\n    108 L.Ed.2d 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Any suggestion that for-profit corporations are incapable of exercising religion because their purpose is simply to make money flies in the face of modern corporate law. States, including those in which the plaintiff corporations were incorporated, authorize corporations to pursue any lawful purpose or business, including the pursuit of profit in conformity with the owners' religious principles. Pp. 2769 - 2772.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (iii) Also flawed is the claim that RFRA offers no protection because it only codified pre-\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   Free Exercise Clause precedents, none of which squarely recognized free-exercise rights for for-profit corporations. First, nothing in RFRA as originally enacted suggested that its definition of \"exercise of religion\" was meant to be tied to pre-\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   interpretations of the First Amendment. Second, if RFRA's original text were not clear enough, the RLUIPA amendment surely dispels any doubt that Congress intended to separate the definition of the phrase from that in First Amendment case law. Third, the pre-\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   case of\n   <em>\n    Gallagher v. Crown Kosher Super Market of Mass., Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285904\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/366/617/\">\n    366 U.S. 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285904\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/366/617/\">\n    81 S.Ct. 1122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285904\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/366/617/\">\n    6 L.Ed.2d 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , suggests, if anything, that for-profit corporations can exercise religion. Finally, the results would be absurd if RFRA, a law enacted to provide very broad protection for religious liberty, merely restored this Court's pre-\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   decisions in ossified form and restricted RFRA claims to plaintiffs who fell within a category of plaintiffs whose claims the Court had recognized before\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   . Pp. 2772 - 2774.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (3) Finally, HHS contends that Congress could not have wanted RFRA to apply to for-profit corporations because of the difficulty of ascertaining the \"beliefs\" of large, publicly traded corporations, but HHS has not pointed to any example of a publicly traded corporation asserting RFRA rights, and numerous practical restraints would likely prevent that from occurring. HHS has also provided no evidence that the purported problem of determining the sincerity of an asserted religious belief moved Congress to exclude for-profit corporations from RFRA's protection. That disputes among the owners of corporations might arise is not a problem unique to this context. State corporate law provides a ready means for resolving any conflicts by, for example, dictating how a corporation can establish its governing structure. Courts will turn to that structure and the underlying state law in resolving disputes. Pp. 2774 - 2775.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (b) HHS's contraceptive mandate substantially burdens the exercise of religion. Pp. 2775 - 2779.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (1) It requires the Hahns and Greens to engage in conduct that seriously violates their sincere religious belief that life begins at conception. If they and their companies refuse to provide contraceptive coverage, they face severe economic consequences: about $475 million per year for Hobby Lobby, $33 million per year for Conestoga, and $15 million per year for Mardel. And if they drop coverage altogether, they could face penalties of roughly $26 million for Hobby Lobby, $1.8 million for Conestoga, and $800,000 for Mardel. Pp. 2775 - 2776.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (2)\n   <em>\n    Amici\n   </em>\n   supporting HHS argue that the $2,000 per-employee penalty is less than the average cost of providing insurance, and therefore that dropping insurance coverage eliminates any substantial burden imposed by the mandate. HHS has never argued this and the Court does not know its position with respect to the argument. But even if the Court reached the argument, it would find it unpersuasive: It ignores the fact that the plaintiffs have religious reasons for providing health-insurance coverage for their employees, and it is far from clear that the net cost to the companies of providing insurance is more than the cost of dropping their insurance plans and paying the ACA penalty. Pp. 2776 - 2777.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (3) HHS argues that the connection between what the objecting parties must do and the end that they find to be morally wrong is too attenuated because it is the employee who will choose the coverage and contraceptive method she uses. But RFRA's question is whether the mandate imposes a substantial burden on the objecting parties' ability to conduct business in accordance with\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    their religious beliefs.\n   </em>\n   The belief of the Hahns and Greens implicates a difficult and important question of religion and moral philosophy, namely, the circumstances under which it is immoral for a person to perform an act that is innocent in itself but that has the effect of enabling or facilitating the commission of an immoral act by another. It is not for the Court to say that the religious beliefs of the plaintiffs are mistaken or unreasonable.

HHS has not shown that it lacks other means of achieving its desired goal without imposing a substantial burden on the exercise of religion. The Government could,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   assume the cost of providing the four contraceptives to women unable to obtain coverage due to their\n   employers' religious objections. Or it could extend the accommodation that HHS has already established for religious nonprofit organizations to non-profit employers with religious objections to the contraceptive mandate.

The plain terms of RFRA make it perfectly clear that Congress did not discriminate in this way against men and women who wish to run their businesses as for-profit corporations in the manner required by their religious beliefs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Since RFRA applies in these cases, we must decide whether the challenged HHS regulations substantially burden the exercise of religion, and we hold that they do. The owners of the businesses have religious objections to abortion, and according to their religious beliefs the four contraceptive methods at issue are abortifacients. If the owners comply with the HHS mandate, they believe they will be facilitating abortions, and if they do not comply, they will pay a very heavy price-as much as $1.3 million per day, or about $475 million per year, in the case of one of the companies. If these consequences do not amount to a substantial burden, it is hard to see what would.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Under RFRA, a Government action that imposes a substantial burden on religious exercise must serve a compelling government interest, and we assume that the HHS regulations satisfy this requirement. But in order for the HHS mandate to be sustained, it must also constitute the least restrictive means of serving that interest, and the mandate plainly fails that test. There are other ways in which Congress or HHS could equally ensure that every woman has cost-free access to the particular contraceptives at issue here and, indeed, to all FDA-approved contraceptives.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    In fact, HHS has already devised and implemented a system that seeks to respect the religious liberty of religious nonprofit corporations while ensuring that the employees of these entities have precisely the same access to all FDA-approved contraceptives as employees of companies whose owners have no religious objections to providing such coverage. The employees of these religious nonprofit corporations still have access to insurance coverage without cost sharing for all FDA-approved contraceptives; and according to HHS, this system imposes no net economic burden on the insurance companies that are required to provide or secure the coverage.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Although HHS has made this system available to religious nonprofits that have religious objections to the contraceptive mandate, HHS has provided no reason why the same system cannot be made available when the owners of for-profit corporations have similar religious objections. We therefore conclude that this system constitutes an alternative that achieves all of the Government's aims while providing greater respect for religious liberty. And under RFRA, that conclusion means that enforcement of the\n    HHS contraceptive mandate against the objecting parties in these cases is unlawful.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    As this description of our reasoning shows, our holding is very specific. We do not hold, as the principal dissent alleges, that for-profit corporations and other commercial enterprises can \"opt out of any law (saving only tax laws) they judge incompatible with their sincerely held religious beliefs.\"\n    <em>\n     Post,\n    </em>\n    at 2787 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.). Nor do we hold, as the dissent implies, that such corporations have free rein to take steps that impose \"disadvantages ... on others\" or that require \"the general public [to] pick up the tab.\"\n    <em>\n     Post,\n    </em>\n    at 2787\n    <em>\n     .\n    </em>\n    And we certainly do not hold or suggest that \"RFRA demands accommodation of a for-profit corporation's religious beliefs no matter the impact that accommodation may have on ... thousands of women employed by Hobby Lobby.\"\n    <em>\n     Post,\n    </em>\n    at 2787.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fr1\" name=\"fr1\">\n      1\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    The effect of the HHS-created accommodation on the women employed by Hobby Lobby and the other companies involved in these cases would be precisely zero. Under that accommodation, these women would still be entitled to all FDA-approved contraceptives without cost sharing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    <strong>\n     I\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    <strong>\n     A\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Congress enacted RFRA in 1993 in order to provide very broad protection for religious liberty\n    <em>\n     .\n    </em>\n    RFRA's enactment came three years after this Court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v.

In that case, five Orthodox Jewish merchants who ran small retail businesses in Philadelphia challenged a Pennsylvania Sunday closing law as a violation of the Free Exercise Clause. Because of their faith, these merchants closed their shops on Saturday, and they argued that requiring them to remain shut on Sunday threatened them with financial ruin. The Court entertained their claim (although it ruled against them on the merits), and if a similar claim were raised today under RFRA against a jurisdiction still subject to the Act (for example, the District of Columbia, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-2(2)), the merchants would be entitled to be heard. According to HHS, however, if these merchants chose to incorporate their businesses-without in any way changing the size or nature of their businesses-they would forfeit all RFRA (and free-exercise) rights. HHS would put these merchants to a difficult choice: either give up the right to seek judicial protection of their religious liberty or forgo the benefits, available to their competitors, of operating as corporations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    As we have seen, RFRA was designed to provide very broad protection for religious liberty. By enacting RFRA, Congress went far beyond what this Court has held is constitutionally required.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fr18\" name=\"fr18\">\n      18\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    Is there any reason to think that the Congress that enacted such sweeping protection put small-business owners to the choice that HHS suggests? An examination of\n    RFRA's text, to which we turn in the next part of this opinion, reveals that Congress did no such thing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    As we will show, Congress provided protection for people like the Hahns and Greens by employing a familiar legal fiction: It included corporations within RFRA's definition of \"persons.\" But it is important to keep in mind that the purpose of this fiction is to provide protection for human beings. A corporation is simply a form of organization used by human beings to achieve desired ends. An established body of law specifies the rights and obligations of the\n    <em>\n     people\n    </em>\n    (including shareholders, officers, and employees) who are associated with a corporation in one way or another. When rights, whether constitutional or statutory, are extended to corporations, the purpose is to protect the rights of these people. For example, extending Fourth Amendment protection to corporations protects the privacy interests of employees and others associated with the company. Protecting corporations from government seizure of their property without just compensation protects all those who have a stake in the corporations' financial well-being.

While it is certainly true that a central objective of for-profit corporations is to make money, modern corporate law does not require for-profit corporations to pursue profit at the expense of everything else, and many do not do so. For-profit corporations, with ownership approval, support a wide variety of charitable causes, and it is not at all uncommon for such corporations to further humanitarian and other altruistic objectives. Many examples come readily to mind. So long as its owners agree, a for-profit corporation may take costly pollution-control and energy-conservation measures that go beyond what the law requires. A for-profit corporation that operates facilities in other countries may exceed the requirements of local law regarding working conditions and benefits. If for-profit corporations may pursue such worthy objectives, there is no apparent reason why they may not further religious objectives as well.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    HHS would draw a sharp line between nonprofit corporations (which, HHS concedes, are protected by RFRA) and for-profit corporations (which HHS would leave unprotected), but the actual picture is less clear-cut. Not all corporations that decline to organize as nonprofits do so in order to maximize profit. For example, organizations with religious and charitable aims might organize as for-profit corporations because of the potential advantages of that corporate form, such as the freedom to participate in lobbying for legislation or campaigning for political candidates who promote their religious or charitable goals.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fr24\" name=\"fr24\">\n      24\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    In fact, recognizing the inherent compatibility between establishing a for-profit corporation and pursuing nonprofit goals, States have increasingly adopted laws formally recognizing hybrid corporate forms. Over half of the States, for instance, now recognize the \"benefit corporation,\" a dual-purpose entity that seeks to achieve both a benefit for the public and a profit for its owners.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fr25\" name=\"fr25\">\n      25\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    In any event, the objectives that may properly be pursued by the companies in these cases are governed by the laws of the States in which they were incorporated-Pennsylvania and Oklahoma-and the laws of those States permit for-profit corporations to pursue \"any lawful purpose\" or \"act,\" including the pursuit of profit in conformity with the owners' religious principles. 15 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 1301 (2001) (\"Corporations may be incorporated under\n    this subpart for any lawful purpose or purposes\"); Okla.

This argument has many flaws.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    First, nothing in the text of RFRA as originally enacted suggested that the statutory phrase \"exercise of religion under the First Amendment\" was meant to be tied to this Court's pre-\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    interpretation of that Amendment. When first enacted, RFRA defined the \"exercise of religion\" to mean \"the exercise of religion under the First Amendment\"-not the exercise of religion as recognized only by then-existing Supreme Court precedents. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-2(4) (1994 ed.). When Congress wants to link the meaning of a statutory provision to a body of this Court's case law, it knows how to do so. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d)(1) (authorizing habeas relief from a state-court decision that \"was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Second, if the original text of RFRA was not clear enough on this point-and we think it was-the amendment of RFRA through RLUIPA surely dispels any doubt. That amendment deleted the prior reference to the First Amendment, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-2(4) (2000 ed.) (incorporating \u00a7 2000cc-5), and neither HHS nor the principal dissent can explain why Congress did this if it wanted to tie RFRA coverage tightly to the specific holdings of our pre-\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    free-exercise cases. Moreover, as discussed, the amendment went further, providing that the exercise of religion \"shall be construed in favor of a broad protection of religious exercise, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of this chapter and the Constitution.\" \u00a7 2000cc-3(g). It is simply not possible to read these provisions as restricting the concept of the \"exercise of religion\" to those practices specifically addressed in our pre-\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    decisions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Third, the one pre-\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    case involving the free-exercise rights of a for-profit corporation suggests, if anything, that for-profit corporations possess such rights.

It is quite a stretch to argue that RFRA, a law enacted to provide very broad protection for religious liberty, left for-profit corporations unprotected simply because in\n    <em>\n     Gallagher\n    </em>\n    -the only pre-\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    case in which the issue was raised-a majority of the Justices did not find it necessary to decide whether the kosher market's corporate status barred it from raising a free-exercise claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Finally, the results would be absurd if RFRA merely restored this Court's pre-\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    decisions in ossified form and did not allow a plaintiff to raise a RFRA claim unless that plaintiff fell within a category of plaintiffs one of whom had brought a free-exercise claim that this Court entertained in the years before\n    <em>\n     Smith.\n    </em>\n    For example, we are not aware of any pre-\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    case in which this Court entertained a free-exercise claim brought by a resident noncitizen. Are such persons also beyond RFRA's protective reach simply because the Court never addressed their rights before\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    ?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Presumably in recognition of the weakness of this argument, both HHS and the principal dissent fall back on the broader contention that the Nation lacks a tradition of exempting for-profit corporations from generally applicable laws. By contrast, HHS contends, statutes like Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-19(A), expressly exempt churches and other nonprofit religious institutions but not for-profit corporations. See Brief for HHS in No. 13-356, p. 26. In making this argument, however, HHS did not call to our attention the fact that some federal statutes\n    <em>\n     do\n    </em>\n    exempt categories of entities that include for-profit corporations from laws that would otherwise require these entities to engage in activities to which they object on grounds of conscience. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300a-7(b)(2); \u00a7 238n(a).\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fr27\" name=\"fr27\">\n      27\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    If Title VII and similar\n    laws show anything, it is that Congress speaks with specificity when it intends a religious accommodation not to extend to for-profit corporations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    <strong>\n     4\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Finally, HHS contends that Congress could not have wanted RFRA to apply to for-profit corporations because it is difficult as a practical matter to ascertain the sincere \"beliefs\" of a corporation. HHS goes so far as to raise the specter of \"divisive, polarizing proxy battles over the religious identity of large, publicly traded corporations such as IBM or General Electric.\" Brief for HHS in No. 13-356, at 30.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    These cases, however, do not involve publicly traded corporations, and it seems unlikely that the sort of corporate giants to which HHS refers will often assert RFRA claims. HHS has not pointed to any example of a publicly traded corporation asserting RFRA rights, and numerous practical restraints would likely prevent that from occurring. For example, the idea that unrelated shareholders-including institutional investors with their own set of stakeholders-would agree to run a corporation under the same religious beliefs seems improbable. In any event, we have no occasion in these cases to consider RFRA's applicability to such companies. The companies in the cases before us are closely held corporations, each owned and controlled by members of a single family, and no one has disputed the sincerity of their religious beliefs.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fr28\" name=\"fr28\">\n      28\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    HHS has also provided no evidence that the purported problem of determining the sincerity of an asserted religious belief moved Congress to exclude for-profit corporations from RFRA's protection. On the contrary, the scope of RLUIPA shows that Congress was confident of the ability of the federal courts to weed out insincere claims. RLUIPA applies to \"institutionalized persons,\" a category that consists primarily of prisoners, and by the time of RLUIPA's enactment, the propensity of some prisoners to assert claims of dubious sincerity was well documented.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fr29\" name=\"fr29\">\n      29\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    Nevertheless, after our decision in\n    <em>\n     City of Boerne,\n    </em>\n    Congress enacted RLUIPA to preserve the right of prisoners to raise religious liberty claims. If Congress thought that the federal courts were up to the job of dealing with insincere prisoner claims, there is no reason to believe that Congress limited RFRA's reach out of concern for the seemingly less difficult task of doing the same in corporate cases. And if, as HHS seems to concede, Congress wanted RFRA to apply to nonprofit corporations, see, Reply Brief in No. 13-354, at 7-8, what reason is there to think that Congress believed that spotting insincere claims would be tougher in cases involving for-profits?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    HHS and the principal dissent express concern about the possibility of disputes among the owners of corporations, but that is not a problem that arises because of RFRA or that is unique to this context. The owners of closely held corporations may-and sometimes do-disagree about\n    the conduct of business. 1 Treatise of the Law of Corporations \u00a7 14:11. And even if RFRA did not exist, the owners of a company might well have a dispute relating to religion. For example, some might want a company's stores to remain open on the Sabbath in order to make more money, and others might want the stores to close for religious reasons. State corporate law provides a ready means for resolving any conflicts by, for example, dictating how a corporation can establish its governing structure. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g., ibid;\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285808\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/366/420/#p578\">\n      id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 3:2; Del.Code Ann., Tit. 8, \u00a7 351 (2011) (providing that certificate of incorporation may provide how \"the business of the corporation shall be managed\"). Courts will turn to that structure and the underlying state law in resolving disputes.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    For all these reasons, we hold that a federal regulation's restriction on the activities of a for-profit closely held corporation must comply with RFRA.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fr30\" name=\"fr30\">\n      30\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    <strong>\n     IV\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    Because RFRA applies in these cases, we must next ask whether the HHS contraceptive mandate \"substantially burden[s]\" the exercise of religion. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-1(a). We have little trouble concluding that it does.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    <strong>\n     A\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    As we have noted, the Hahns and Greens have a sincere religious belief that life begins at conception. They therefore object on religious grounds to providing health insurance that covers methods of birth control that, as HHS acknowledges, see Brief for HHS in No. 13-354, at 9, n. 4, may result in the destruction of an embryo. By requiring the Hahns and Greens and their companies to arrange for such coverage, the HHS mandate demands that they engage in conduct that seriously violates their religious beliefs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    If the Hahns and Greens and their companies do not yield to this demand, the economic consequences will be severe. If the companies continue to offer group health plans that do not cover the contraceptives at issue, they will be taxed $100 per day for each affected individual. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980D. For Hobby Lobby, the bill could amount to $1.3 million per day or\n    about $475 million per year; for Conestoga, the assessment could be $90,000 per day or $33 million per year; and for Mardel, it could be $40,000 per day or about $15 million per year. These sums are surely substantial.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    It is true that the plaintiffs could avoid these assessments by dropping insurance coverage altogether and thus forcing their employees to obtain health insurance on one of the exchanges established under ACA. But if at least one of their full-time employees were to qualify for a subsidy on one of the government-run exchanges, this course would also entail substantial economic consequences. The companies could face penalties of $2,000 per employee each year. \u00a7 4980H. These penalties would amount to roughly $26 million for Hobby Lobby, $1.8 million for Conestoga, and $800,000 for Mardel.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    <strong>\n     B\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    Although these totals are high,\n    <em>\n     amici\n    </em>\n    supporting HHS have suggested that the $2,000 per-employee penalty is actually less than the average cost of providing health insurance, see Brief for Religious Organizations 22, and therefore, they claim, the companies could readily eliminate any substantial burden by forcing their employees to obtain insurance in the government exchanges.

HHS, which presumably could have compiled the relevant statistics, has never made this argument-not in its voluminous briefing or at oral argument in this Court nor, to our knowledge, in any of the numerous cases in which the issue now before us has been litigated around the country. As things now stand, we do not even know what the Government's position might be with respect to these\n    <em>\n     amici's\n    </em>\n    intensely empirical argument.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fr31\" name=\"fr31\">\n      31\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    For this same reason, the plaintiffs have never had an opportunity to respond to this novel claim that-contrary to their longstanding practice and that of most large employers-they would be better off discarding their employer insurance plans altogether.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    Even if we were to reach this argument, we would find it unpersuasive. As an initial matter, it entirely ignores the fact that the Hahns and Greens and their companies have religious reasons for providing health-insurance coverage for their employees. Before the advent of ACA, they were not legally compelled to provide insurance, but they nevertheless did so-in part, no doubt, for conventional business reasons, but also in part because their religious beliefs govern their relations with their employees. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 13-356, p. 11g; App. in No. 13-354, at 139.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    Putting aside the religious dimension of the decision to provide insurance, moreover, it is far from clear that the net cost to the companies of providing insurance is more than the cost of dropping their insurance plans and paying the ACA penalty. Health insurance is a benefit that employees value. If the companies simply eliminated that benefit and forced employees to\n    purchase their own insurance on the exchanges, without offering additional compensation, it is predictable that the companies would face a competitive disadvantage in retaining and attracting skilled workers. See App. in No. 13-354, at 153.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    The companies could attempt to make up for the elimination of a group health plan by increasing wages, but this would be costly. Group health insurance is generally less expensive than comparable individual coverage, so the amount of the salary increase needed to fully compensate for the termination of insurance coverage may well exceed the cost to the companies of providing the insurance. In addition, any salary increase would have to take into account the fact that employees must pay income taxes on wages but not on the value of employer-provided health insurance.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20106\">\n     26 U.S.C. \u00a7 106\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a). Likewise, employers can deduct the cost of providing health insurance, see \u00a7 162(a)(1), but apparently cannot deduct the amount of the penalty that they must pay if insurance is not provided; that difference also must be taken into account. Given these economic incentives, it is far from clear that it would be financially advantageous for an employer to drop coverage and pay the penalty.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fr32\" name=\"fr32\">\n      32\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    In sum, we refuse to sustain the challenged regulations on the ground-never maintained by the Government-that dropping insurance coverage eliminates the substantial burden that the HHS mandate imposes. We doubt that the Congress that enacted RFRA-or, for that matter, ACA-would have believed it a tolerable result to put family-run businesses to the choice of violating their sincerely held religious beliefs or making all of their employees lose their existing healthcare plans.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    <strong>\n     C\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    In taking the position that the HHS mandate does not impose a substantial burden on the exercise of religion, HHS's main argument (echoed by the principal dissent) is basically that the connection between what the objecting parties must do (provide health-insurance coverage for four methods of contraception that may operate after the fertilization of an egg) and the end that they find to be morally wrong (destruction of an embryo) is simply too attenuated. Brief for HHS in 13-354, pp. 31-34;\n    <em>\n     post,\n    </em>\n    at 2798 - 2799.

The Hahns and Greens believe that providing the coverage demanded by the HHS regulations is connected to the destruction of an embryo in a way that is sufficient to make it immoral for them to provide the coverage. This belief implicates a difficult and important question of religion and moral philosophy, namely, the circumstances under which it is wrong for a person to perform an act that is innocent in itself but that has the effect of enabling or facilitating the commission of an immoral act by another.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fr34\" name=\"fr34\">\n      34\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    Arrogating the authority to provide a binding national answer to this religious and philosophical question, HHS and the principal dissent in effect tell the plaintiffs that their beliefs are flawed.

Even a compelling interest may be outweighed in some circumstances by another even weightier consideration. In these cases, however, the interest served by one of the biggest exceptions, the exception for grandfathered plans, is simply the interest of employers in avoiding the inconvenience of amending an existing plan. Grandfathered plans are required \"to comply with a subset of the Affordable Care Act's health reform provisions\" that provide what HHS has described as \"particularly significant protections.\" 75 Fed.Reg. 34540 (2010).

HHS has not shown that it lacks other means of achieving its desired goal without imposing a substantial burden on the exercise of religion by the objecting parties in these cases. See \u00a7\u00a7 2000bb-1(a), (b) (requiring the Government to \"demonstrat[e] that application of [a substantial] burden to\n    <em>\n     the person\n    </em>\n    ... is the least restrictive means of furthering [a] compelling governmental interest\" (emphasis added)).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    The most straightforward way of doing this would be for the Government to assume the cost of providing the four contraceptives at issue to any women who are unable to obtain them under their health-insurance policies due to their employers' religious objections. This would certainly be less restrictive of the plaintiffs' religious liberty, and HHS has not shown, see \u00a7 2000bb-1(b)(2), that this is not a viable alternative. HHS has not provided any estimate of the average cost per employee of providing access to these contraceptives, two of which, according to the FDA, are designed primarily for emergency use. See Birth Control: Medicines to Help You, online at http:// www. fda. gov/ forconsumers/ byaudience/ forwomen/ free publications/ ucm 313215. htm. Nor has HHS provided any statistics regarding the number of employees who might be affected because they work for corporations like Hobby Lobby, Conestoga, and Mardel. Nor has HHS told us that it is unable to provide such\n    statistics. It seems likely, however, that the cost of providing the forms of contraceptives at issue in these cases (if not all FDA-approved contraceptives) would be minor when compared with the overall cost of ACA. According to one of the Congressional Budget Office's most recent forecasts, ACA's insurance-coverage provisions will cost the Federal Government more than $1.3 trillion through the next decade. See CBO, Updated Estimates of the Effects of the Insurance Coverage Provisions of the Affordable Care Act, April 2014, p. 2.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fr36\" name=\"fr36\">\n      36\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    If, as HHS tells us, providing all women with cost-free access to all FDA-approved methods of contraception is a Government interest of the highest order, it is hard to understand HHS's argument that it cannot be required under RFRA to pay\n    <em>\n     anything\n    </em>\n    in order to achieve this important goal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    HHS contends that RFRA does not permit us to take this option into account because \"RFRA cannot be used to require creation of entirely new programs.\" Brief for HHS in 13-354, at 15.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fr37\" name=\"fr37\">\n      37\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    But we see nothing in RFRA that supports this argument, and drawing the line between the \"creation of an entirely new program\" and the modification of an existing program (which RFRA surely allows) would be fraught with problems. We do not doubt that cost may be an important factor in the least-restrictive-means analysis, but both RFRA and its sister statute, RLUIPA, may in some circumstances require the Government to expend additional funds to accommodate citizens' religious beliefs. Cf. \u00a7 2000cc-3(c) (RLUIPA: \"[T]his chapter may require a government to incur expenses in its own operations to avoid imposing a substantial burden on religious exercise.\"). HHS's view that RFRA can never require the Government to spend even a small amount reflects a judgment about the importance of religious liberty that was not shared by the Congress that enacted that law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    In the end, however, we need not rely on the option of a new, government-funded\n    program in order to conclude that the HHS regulations fail the least-restrictive-means test. HHS itself has demonstrated that it has at its disposal an approach that is less restrictive than requiring employers to fund contraceptive methods that violate their religious beliefs. As we explained above, HHS has already established an accommodation for nonprofit organizations with religious objections. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2763 - 2764, and nn. 8-9. Under that accommodation, the organization can self-certify that it opposes providing coverage for particular contraceptive services.

Nor has HHS provided evidence that any significant number of employers sought exemption, on religious grounds, from any of ACA's coverage requirements other than the contraceptive mandate.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    It is HHS's apparent belief that no insurance-coverage mandate would violate RFRA-no matter how significantly it impinges on the religious liberties of employers-that would lead to intolerable consequences. Under HHS's view, RFRA would permit the Government to require all employers to provide coverage for any medical procedure allowed by law in the jurisdiction in question-for instance, third-trimester abortions or assisted suicide. The owners of many closely held corporations could not in good conscience provide such coverage, and thus HHS would effectively exclude these people from full participation in the economic life of the Nation. RFRA was enacted to prevent such an outcome.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    In any event, our decision in these cases is concerned solely with the contraceptive mandate. Our decision should not be understood to hold that an insurance-coverage mandate must necessarily fall if it conflicts with an employer's religious beliefs. Other coverage requirements, such as immunizations, may be supported by different interests (for example, the need to combat the spread of infectious diseases) and may involve different arguments about the least restrictive means of providing them.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    The principal dissent raises the possibility that discrimination in hiring, for example on the basis of race, might be cloaked as religious practice to escape legal sanction. See\n    <em>\n     post,\n    </em>\n    at 2804 - 2805. Our decision today provides no such shield. The Government has a compelling interest in providing an equal opportunity to participate in the workforce without regard to race, and prohibitions on racial discrimination are precisely tailored to achieve that critical goal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-155\">\n    HHS also raises for the first time in this Court the argument that applying the contraceptive mandate to for-profit employers with sincere religious objections is essential to the comprehensive health-insurance scheme that ACA establishes. HHS analogizes the contraceptive mandate to the requirement to pay Social Security taxes, which we upheld in\n    <em>\n     Lee\n    </em>\n    despite the religious objection of an employer, but these\n    cases are quite different. Our holding in\n    <em>\n     Lee\n    </em>\n    turned primarily on the special problems associated with a national system of taxation. We noted that \"[t]he obligation to pay the social security tax initially is not fundamentally different from the obligation to pay income taxes.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11304762\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/252/\">\n     455 U.S., at 260\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11304762\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/252/\">\n     102 S.Ct. 1051\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Based on that premise, we explained that it was untenable to allow individuals to seek exemptions from taxes based on religious objections to particular Government expenditures: \"If, for example, a religious adherent believes war is a sin, and if a certain percentage of the federal budget can be identified as devoted to war-related activities, such individuals would have a similarly valid claim to be exempt from paying that percentage of the income tax.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11304762\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/252/\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    We observed that \"[t]he tax system could not function if denominations were allowed to challenge the tax system because tax payments were spent in a manner that violates their religious belief.\"\n    <em>\n     Ibid.\n    </em>\n    ; see\n    <em>\n     O Centro,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5947540\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/418/\">\n     546 U.S., at 435\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5947540\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/418/\">\n     126 S.Ct. 1211\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-156\">\n    <em>\n     Lee\n    </em>\n    was a free-exercise, not a RFRA, case, but if the issue in\n    <em>\n     Lee\n    </em>\n    were analyzed under the RFRA framework, the fundamental point would be that there simply is no less restrictive alternative to the categorical requirement to pay taxes. Because of the enormous variety of government expenditures funded by tax dollars, allowing taxpayers to withhold a portion of their tax obligations on religious grounds would lead to chaos. Recognizing exemptions from the contraceptive mandate is very different. ACA does not create a large national pool of tax revenue for use in purchasing healthcare coverage.

For those who choose this course, free exercise is essential in preserving their own dignity and in striving for a self-definition shaped by their religious precepts. Free exercise in this sense implicates more than just freedom of belief. See\n    <em>\n     Cantwell v.

It means, too, the right to express those beliefs and to establish one's religious (or nonreligious) self-definition in the political, civic, and economic life of our larger community. But in a complex society and an era of pervasive governmental regulation, defining the proper realm for free exercise can be difficult. In these cases the plaintiffs deem it necessary to exercise their religious beliefs within the context of their own closely held, for-profit corporations.

The Government must demonstrate that the application of a substantial burden to a person's exercise of religion \"(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.\" \u00a7 2000bb-1(b).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    As to RFRA's first requirement, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) makes the case that the mandate serves the Government's compelling interest in providing insurance coverage that is necessary to protect the health of\n    female employees, coverage that is significantly more costly than for a male employee.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2779; see,\n    <em>\n     e.g\n    </em>\n    ., Brief for HHS in No. 13-354, pp. 14-15.

It is important to confirm that a premise of the Court's opinion is its assumption that the HHS regulation here at issue furthers a legitimate and compelling interest in the health of female employees.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2780.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    But the Government has not made the second showing required by RFRA, that the means it uses to regulate is the least restrictive way to further its interest. As the Court's opinion explains, the record in these cases shows that there is an existing, recognized, workable, and already-implemented framework to provide coverage. That framework is one that HHS has itself devised, that the plaintiffs have not criticized with a specific objection that has been considered in detail by the courts in this litigation, and that is less restrictive than the means challenged by the plaintiffs in these cases.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2763 - 2764, and n. 9, 2781 - 2782.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    The means the Government chose is the imposition of a direct mandate on the employers in these cases.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2762 - 2763. But in other instances the Government has allowed the same contraception coverage in issue here to be provided to employees of nonprofit religious organizations, as an accommodation to the religious objections of those entities. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2763 - 2764, and n. 9, 2781 - 2782. The accommodation works by requiring insurance companies to cover, without cost sharing, contraception coverage for female employees who wish it. That accommodation equally furthers the Government's interest but does not impinge on the plaintiffs' religious beliefs. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2782.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    On this record and as explained by the Court, the Government has not met its burden of showing that it cannot accommodate the plaintiffs' similar religious objections under this established framework. RFRA is inconsistent with the insistence of an agency such as HHS on distinguishing between different religious believers-burdening one while accommodating the other-when it may treat both equally by offering both of them the same accommodation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-170\">\n    The parties who were the plaintiffs in the District Courts argue that the Government could pay for the methods that are found objectionable.

The Court properly does not resolve whether one freedom should be protected by creating incentives for additional government constraints. In these cases, it is the Court's understanding that an accommodation may be made to the employers without imposition of a whole new program or burden on the Government. As the Court makes clear, this is not a case where it can be established that it is difficult to accommodate the government's interest, and in fact the mechanism for doing so is already in place.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2781 - 2782.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-171\">\n    \"[T]he American community is today, as it long has been, a rich mosaic of religious faiths.\"\n    <em>\n     Town of Greece v.

Among the reasons the United States is so open, so tolerant, and so free is that no person may be restricted or demeaned by government in exercising his or her religion. Yet neither may that\n    same exercise unduly restrict other persons, such as employees, in protecting their own interests, interests the law deems compelling. In these cases the means to reconcile those two priorities are at hand in the existing accommodation the Government has designed, identified, and used for circumstances closely parallel to those presented here. RFRA requires the Government to use this less restrictive means. As the Court explains, this existing model, designed precisely for this problem, might well suffice to distinguish the instant cases from many others in which it is more difficult and expensive to accommodate a governmental program to countless religious claims based on an alleged statutory right of free exercise.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2782 - 2783.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-172\">\n    For these reasons and others put forth by the Court, I join its opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    <strong>\n     Justice GINSBURG, with whom Justice Sotomayor joins, and with whom Justice BREYER and Justice KAGAN join as to all but Part III-C-1, dissenting.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    In a decision of startling breadth, the Court holds that commercial enterprises, including corporations, along with partnerships and sole proprietorships, can opt out of any law (saving only tax laws) they judge incompatible with their sincerely held religious beliefs.

Compelling governmental interests in uniform compliance with the law, and disadvantages that religion-based opt-outs impose on others, hold no sway, the Court decides, at least when there is a \"less restrictive alternative.\" And such an alternative, the Court suggests, there always will be whenever, in lieu of tolling an enterprise claiming a religion-based exemption, the government,\n    <em>\n     i.e.,\n    </em>\n    the general public, can pick up the tab.

Congress acted on that understanding when, as part of a nationwide insurance program intended to be comprehensive, it called for coverage of preventive care responsive to women's needs. Carrying out Congress' direction, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in consultation with public health experts, promulgated regulations requiring group health plans to cover all forms of contraception approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Rec. 28841 (2009) (statement of Sen. Boxer). To correct this oversight, Senator Barbara Mikulski introduced the Women's Health Amendment, which added to the ACA's minimum coverage requirements a new category of preventive services specific to women's health.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    Women paid significantly more than men for preventive care, the amendment's proponents noted; in fact, cost barriers operated to block many women from obtaining needed care at all.

No. 103-111, p. 12 (1993) (hereinafter Senate Report) (RFRA's purpose was \"only to overturn the Supreme Court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Smith,\n    </em>\n    \" not to \"unsettle other areas of the law.\"); 139 Cong. Rec. 26178 (1993) (statement of Sen. Kennedy) (RFRA was \"designed to restore the compelling interest test for deciding free exercise claims.\"). In line with this restorative purpose, Congress expected courts considering RFRA claims to \"look to free exercise cases decided prior to\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    for guidance.\" Senate Report 8. See also H.R.Rep. No. 103-88, pp. 6-7 (1993) (hereinafter House Report) (same).

Rec. 26178 (statement of Sen. Kennedy). Given the Act's moderate purpose, it is hardly surprising that RFRA's enactment in 1993 provoked little controversy. See Brief for Senator Murray et al. as\n    <em>\n     Amici Curiae\n    </em>\n    8 (hereinafter Senators Brief) (RFRA was approved by a 97-to-3 vote in the Senate and a voice vote in the House of Representatives).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-196\">\n    <strong>\n     B\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-197\">\n    Despite these authoritative indications, the Court sees RFRA as a bold initiative departing from, rather than restoring, pre-\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    jurisprudence. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2761, n. 3, 2761 - 2762, 2767, 2771 - 2773. To support its conception of RFRA as a measure detached from this Court's decisions, one that sets a new course, the Court points first to the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc\n    <em>\n     et seq.,\n    </em>\n    which altered RFRA's definition of the term \"exercise of religion.\" RFRA, as originally enacted, defined that term to mean \"the exercise of religion under the First Amendment to the Constitution.\" \u00a7 2000bb-2(4) (1994 ed.). See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2761 - 2762. As amended by RLUIPA, RFRA's definition now includes \"any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.\" \u00a7 2000bb-2(4) (2012 ed.) (cross-referencing \u00a7 2000cc-5). That definitional change, according to the Court, reflects \"an obvious effort to effect a complete separation from First Amendment case law.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2761 - 2762.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-198\">\n    The Court's reading is not plausible. RLUIPA's alteration clarifies that courts should not question the centrality of a particular religious exercise. But the amendment in no way suggests that Congress meant to expand the class of entities qualified to mount religious accommodation claims, nor does it relieve courts of the obligation to inquire whether a government action substantially burdens a religious exercise.

See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2790 - 2791.

See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Senate Report 5 (\"Where [a substantial] burden is placed\n    upon the free exercise of religion, the Court ruled [in\n    <em>\n     Sherbert\n    </em>\n    ], the Government must demonstrate that it is the least restrictive means to achieve a compelling governmental interest.\"). And the view that the pre-\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    test included a \"least restrictive means\" requirement had been aired in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee by experts on religious freedom. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Hearing on S. 2969 before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 102d Cong., 2d Sess., 78-79 (1993) (statement of Prof. Douglas Laycock).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-201\">\n    Our decision in\n    <em>\n     City of Boerne,\n    </em>\n    it is true, states that the least restrictive means requirement \"was not used in the pre-\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    jurisprudence RFRA purported to codify.\" See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2761, n. 3, 2767, n. 18.

The requirement carries no command that Hobby Lobby or Conestoga purchase or provide the contraceptives they find objectionable. Instead, it calls on the companies covered by the requirement to direct money into undifferentiated funds that finance a wide variety of benefits under comprehensive health plans. Those plans, in order to comply with the ACA, see\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2788 - 2790, must offer contraceptive coverage without cost sharing, just as they must cover an array of other preventive services.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-221\">\n    Importantly, the decisions whether to claim benefits under the plans are made not by Hobby Lobby or Conestoga, but by the covered employees and dependents, in consultation with their health care providers. Should an employee of Hobby Lobby or Conestoga share the religious beliefs of the Greens and Hahns, she is of course under no compulsion to use the contraceptives in question. But \"[n]o individual decision by an employee and her physician-be it to use contraception, treat an infection, or have a hip replaced-is in any meaningful sense [her employer's] decision or action.\"\n    <em>\n     Grote v.

It is doubtful that Congress, when it specified that burdens must be \"substantia[l],\" had in mind a linkage thus interrupted by independent decisionmakers (the woman and her health counselor) standing between the challenged government action and the religious exercise claimed to be infringed. Any decision to use contraceptives made by a woman covered under Hobby Lobby's or Conestoga's plan will not be propelled by the Government, it will be the woman's autonomous choice, informed by the physician she consults.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-222\">\n    <strong>\n     3\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-223\">\n    Even if one were to conclude that Hobby Lobby and Conestoga meet the substantial burden requirement, the Government has shown that the contraceptive coverage for which the ACA provides furthers compelling interests in public health and women's well being. Those interests are concrete, specific, and demonstrated by a wealth of empirical evidence. To recapitulate, the mandated contraception coverage enables women to avoid the health problems unintended pregnancies may visit on them and their children. See IOM Report 102-107. The coverage helps safeguard the health of women for whom pregnancy may be hazardous, even life threatening. See Brief for American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists et al. as\n    <em>\n     Amici Curiae\n    </em>\n    14-15. And the mandate secures benefits wholly unrelated to pregnancy, preventing certain cancers, menstrual disorders, and pelvic pain.

The first half of this statement is a tautology; for-profit corporations do indeed differ from nonprofits insofar as they seek to make a profit for their owners, but the second part is factually untrue. As the activities of the for-profit corporations involved in these cases show, some for-profit corporations do seek \"to perpetuate the religious values shared,\" in these cases, by their owners.

The dissent would evidently glean from that vote an intent by the Senate to prohibit for-profit corporate employers from refusing to offer contraceptive coverage for religious reasons, regardless of whether the contraceptive mandate could pass muster under RFRA's standards. But that is not the only plausible inference from the failed amendment-or even the most likely. For one thing, the text of the amendment was \"written so broadly that it would allow any employer to deny any health service to any American for virtually any reason-\n     <em>\n      not just for religious objections\n     </em>\n     .\" 158 Cong. Rec. S1165 (Mar. 1, 2012) (emphasis added). Moreover, the amendment would have authorized a blanket exemption for religious or moral objectors; it would not have subjected religious-based objections to the judicial scrutiny called for by RFRA, in which a court must consider not only the burden of a requirement on religious adherents, but also the government's interest and how narrowly tailored the requirement is. It is thus perfectly reasonable to believe that the amendment was voted down because it extended more broadly than the pre-existing protections of RFRA. And in any event, even if a rejected amendment to a bill could be relevant in other contexts, it surely cannot be relevant here, because any \"Federal statutory law adopted after November 16, 1993 is subject to [RFRA] unless such law\n     <em>\n      explicitly excludes\n     </em>\n     such application by reference to [RFRA].\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-3(b) (emphasis added).

In order to provide full compensation for employees, the companies would have to calculate the value to employees of the convenience of retaining their employer-provided coverage and thus being spared the task of attempting to find and sign up for a comparable plan on an exchange. And because some but not all of the companies' employees may qualify for subsidies on an exchange, it would be nearly impossible to calculate a salary increase that would accurately restore the status quo ante for all employees.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"33.\">\n    <p id=\"p-288\">\n     This argument is not easy to square with the position taken by HHS in providing exemptions from the contraceptive mandate for religious employers, such as churches, that have the very same religious objections as the Hahns and Greens and their companies. The connection between what these religious employers would be required to do if not exempted (provide insurance coverage for particular contraceptives) and the ultimate event that they find morally wrong (destruction of an embryo) is exactly the same. Nevertheless, as discussed, HHS and the Labor and Treasury Departments authorized the exemption from the contraceptive mandate of group health plans of certain religious employers, and later expanded the exemption to include certain nonprofit organizations with religious objections to contraceptive coverage. 78 Fed.Reg. 39871.

Nothing in the text of RFRA or its basic purposes supports giving the Government an entirely free hand to impose burdens on religious exercise so long as those burdens confer a benefit on other individuals. It is certainly true that in applying RFRA \"courts must take adequate account of the burdens a requested accommodation may impose on nonbeneficiaries.\"\n     <em>\n      Cutter v.

That consideration will often inform the analysis of the Government's compelling interest and the availability of a less restrictive means of advancing that interest. But it could not reasonably be maintained that any burden on religious exercise, no matter how onerous and no matter how readily the government interest could be achieved through alternative means, is permissible under RFRA so long as the relevant legal obligation requires the religious adherent to confer a benefit on third parties. Otherwise, for example, the Government could decide that all supermarkets must sell alcohol for the convenience of customers (and thereby exclude Muslims with religious objections from owning supermarkets), or it could decide that all restaurants must remain open on Saturdays to give employees an opportunity to earn tips (and thereby exclude Jews with religious objections from owning restaurants). By framing any Government regulation as benefiting a third party, the Government could turn all regulations into entitlements to which nobody could object on religious grounds, rendering RFRA meaningless. In any event, our decision in these cases need not result in any detrimental effect on any third party. As we explain, see\n     <em>\n      infra,\n     </em>\n     at 2781 - 2782, the Government can readily arrange for other methods of providing contraceptives, without cost sharing, to employees who are unable to obtain them under their health-insurance plans due to their employers' religious objections.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"38.\">\n    <p id=\"p-293\">\n     HHS has concluded that insurers that insure eligible employers opting out of the contraceptive mandate and that are required to pay for contraceptive coverage under the accommodation will not experience an increase in costs because the \"costs of providing contraceptive coverage are balanced by cost savings from lower pregnancy-related costs and from improvements in women's health.\" 78 Fed.Reg. 39877. With respect to self-insured plans, the regulations establish a mechanism for the eligible employers' third-party administrators to obtain a compensating reduction in the fee paid by insurers to participate in the federally facilitated exchanges.

It can scarcely be maintained that RFRA enlarges these exemptions to allow Hobby Lobby and Conestoga to hire only persons who share the religious beliefs of the Greens or Hahns. Nor does the Court suggest otherwise. Cf.\n     <em>\n      ante,\n     </em>\n     at 2773.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-314\">\n     The Court does identify two statutory exemptions it reads to cover for-profit corporations, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300a-7(b)(2) and 238n(a), and infers from them that \"Congress speaks with specificity when it intends a religious accommodation not to extend to for-profit corporations,\"\n     <em>\n      ante,\n     </em>\n     at 2774. The Court's inference is unwarranted. The exemptions the Court cites cover certain medical personnel who object to performing or assisting with abortions. Cf.\n     <em>\n      ante,\n     </em>\n     at 2773, n. 27 (\"the protection provided by \u00a7 238n(a) differs significantly from the protection provided by RFRA\"). Notably, the Court does not assert that these exemptions have in fact been afforded to for-profit corporations. See \u00a7 238n(c) (\"health care entity\" covered by exemption is a term defined to include \"an individual physician, a postgraduate physician training program, and a participant in a program of training in the health professions\"); Tozzi, Whither Free Exercise:\n     <em>\n      Employment Division v. Smith\n     </em>\n     and the Rebirth of State Constitutional Free Exercise Clause Jurisprudence?, 48 J. Catholic Legal Studies 269, 296, n. 133 (2009) (\"Catholic physicians, but not necessarily hospitals, ... may be able to invoke [\u00a7 238n(a) ]....\"); cf. S. 137, 113th Cong., 1st Sess. (2013) (as introduced) (Abortion Non-Discrimination Act of 2013, which would amend the definition of \"health care entity\" in \u00a7 238n to include \"hospital[s],\" \"health insurance plan[s],\" and other health care facilities). These provisions are revealing in a way that detracts from one of the Court's main arguments. They show that Congress is not content to rest on the Dictionary Act when it wishes to ensure that particular entities are among those eligible for a religious accommodation.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-315\">\n     Moreover, the exemption codified in \u00a7 238n(a) was not enacted until three years after RFRA's passage.

Perhaps so, but as Hobby Lobby's case demonstrates, such claims are indeed pursued by large corporations, employing thousands of persons of different faiths, whose ownership is not diffuse. \"Closely held\" is not synonymous with \"small.\" Hobby Lobby is hardly the only enterprise of sizable scale that is family owned or closely held. For example, the family-owned candy giant Mars, Inc., takes in $33 billion in revenues and has some 72,000 employees, and closely held Cargill, Inc., takes in more than $136 billion in revenues and employs some 140,000 persons.
