Petitioner CTS Corporation sold property on which it had stored chemicals as part its operations as an electronics plant. Twenty-four years later, respondents, the owners of portions of that property and adjacent landowners, sued, alleging damages from the stored contaminants. CTS moved to dismiss, citing a state statute of repose that prevented subjecting a defendant to a tort suit brought more than 10 years after the defendant's last culpable act. Because CTS's last act occurred when it sold the property, the District Court granted the motion. Finding \u00a7 9658 ambiguous, the Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that the statute's remedial purpose favored pre-emption.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Held\n   </em>\n   : The judgment is reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065071\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/723/434/\">\n    723 F.3d 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Justice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to all but Part II-D, concluding that \u00a7 9658 does not pre-empt state statutes of repose. Pp. 2182 - 2188.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   (a) The outcome here turns on whether \u00a7 9658 distinguishes between statutes of limitations and statutes of repose, which are both used to limit the temporal extent or duration of tort liability. There is considerable common ground in the policies underlying the two, but their specified time periods are measured differently and they seek to attain different purposes and objectives. Statutes of limitations are designed to promote justice by encouraging\n   plaintiffs to pursue claims diligently and begin to run when a claim accrues. Statutes of repose effect a legislative judgment that a defendant should be free from liability after a legislatively determined amount of time and are measured from the date of the defendant's last culpable act or omission. The application of equitable tolling underscores their difference in purpose. Because a statute of limitations' purpose is not furthered by barring an untimely action brought by a plaintiff who was prevented by extraordinary circumstances from timely filing, equitable tolling operates to pause the running of the statute. The purpose of statutes of repose are unaffected by such circumstances, and equitable tolling does not apply. Pp. 2182 - 2183.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   (b) The text and structure of \u00a7 9658 resolve this case. Under that provision, pre-emption is characterized as an \"[e]xception,\" \u00a7 9658(a)(1), to the regular rule that the \"the statute of limitations established under State law\" applies. The \"applicable limitations period,\" the \"commencement date\" of which is subject to pre-emption, is defined as \"the period specified in a statute of limitations.\" \u00a7 9658(b)(2). That term appears four times, and \"statute of repose\" does not appear at all. While it is apparent from the historical development of the two terms that their general usage has not always been precise, their distinction was well enough established to be reflected in the 1982 Study Group Report that guided \u00a7 9658's enactment, acknowledged the distinction, and urged the repeal of both types of statutes. Because that distinction is not similarly reflected in \u00a7 9658, it is proper to conclude that Congress did not intend to pre-empt statutes of repose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Other textual features further support this conclusion. It would be awkward to use the singular \"applicable limitations period\" to mandate pre-emption of two different time periods with two different purposes. And the definition of that limitations period as \"the period\" during which a \"civil action\" under state law \"may be brought,\" \u00a7 9658(b)(2), presupposes that a civil action exists. A statute of repose, in contrast, can prohibit a cause of action from ever coming into existence. Section 9658's inclusion of a tolling rule also suggests that the statute's reach is limited to statutes of limitations, which traditionally have been subject to tolling. Respondents contend that \u00a7 9658 also effects an implied pre-emption because statutes of repose create an obstacle to Congress' purposes and objectives, see\n   <em>\n    Wyeth v. Levine,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/#p563\">\n    555 U.S. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 563-564,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/#p563\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/#p563\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the level of generality at which the statute's purpose is framed affects whether a specific reading will further or hinder that purpose. Here, where Congress chose to leave many areas of state law untouched, respondents have not shown that statutes of repose pose an unacceptable obstacle to the attainment of statutory purposes.

Under this framework, statutes of limitations in covered actions begin to run when a plaintiff discovers, or reasonably should have discovered, that the harm in question was caused by the contaminant.

The Act provided a federal cause of action to recover costs of cleanup from culpable entities but not a federal cause of action for personal injury or property damage.

(Comm. Print 1982) (hereinafter Study Group Report or Report). As relevant here, the Study Group Report noted the long latency periods involved in harm caused by toxic substances and \"recommend[ed] that all states that have not already done so, clearly adopt the rule that an action accrues when the plaintiff discovers or should have discovered the injury or disease and its cause.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209651\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at pt. 1, 256.

Instead, Congress decided to act at the federal level. Congress amended CERCLA in 1986 to add the provision now codified in \u00a7 9658. Whether \u00a7 9658 repeals statutes of repose, as the Study Group Report recommended, is the question to be addressed here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The instant case arose in North Carolina, where CTS Corporation ran an electronics plant in Asheville from 1959 to 1985. (A subsidiary, CTS of Asheville, Inc., ran the plant until 1983, when CTS Corporation took over.) The plant manufactured and disposed of electronics and electronic parts. In the process, it stored the chemicals trichloroethylene (TCE) and cis-1, 2-dichloroethane (DCE). In 1987, CTS sold the property, along with a promise that the site was environmentally sound. The buyer eventually sold portions of the property to individuals who, along with adjacent landowners, brought this suit alleging damage from contaminants on the land. Those who alleged the injury and damage were the plaintiffs in the trial court and are respondents here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Their suit was brought in 2011, 24 years after CTS sold the property. The suit, filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, was a state-law nuisance action against CTS, petitioner here. Respondents sought \"reclamation\" of \"toxic chemical contaminants\" belonging to petitioner, \"remediation of the environmental harm caused\" by contaminants, and \"monetary damages in an amount that will fully compensate them for all the losses and damages they have suffered, ... and will suffer in the future.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 57a. Respondents claim that in 2009 they learned from the Environmental Protection Agency that their well water was contaminated, allegedly while petitioner operated its electronics plant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Citing North Carolina's statute of repose, CTS moved to dismiss the claim. That statute prevents subjecting a defendant to a tort suit brought more than 10 years after the last culpable act of the defendant. N.C. Gen.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 1-52(16) (Lexis 2013) (\"[N]o cause of action shall accrue more than 10 years from the last act or omission of the defendant giving rise to the cause of action\");\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

Because CTS' last act occurred in 1987, when it sold the electronics plant, the District Court accepted the recommendation of a Magistrate Judge and granted CTS' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed, ruling that \u00a7 9658 pre-empted the statute of repose.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065071\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/723/434/\">\n    723 F.3d 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013).

Statutes of limitations and statutes of repose both are mechanisms used to limit the temporal extent or duration of liability for tortious acts. Both types of statute can operate to bar a plaintiff's suit, and in each instance time is the controlling factor. There is considerable common ground in the policies underlying the two types of statute. But the time periods specified are measured from different points, and the statutes seek to attain different purposes and objectives. And, as will be explained, \u00a7 9658 mandates a distinction between the two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In the ordinary course, a statute of limitations creates \"a time limit for suing in a civil case, based on the date when the claim accrued.\" Black's Law Dictionary 1546 (9th ed. 2009) (Black's); see also\n   <em>\n    Heimeshoff v.

Measured by this standard, a claim accrues in a personal-injury or property-damage action \"when the injury occurred or was discovered.\" Black's 1546. For example, North Carolina, whose laws are central to this case, has a statute of limitations that allows a person three years to bring suit for personal injury or property damage, beginning on the date that damage \"becomes apparent or ought reasonably to have become apparent to the claimant, whichever event first occurs.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 1-52(16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   A statute of repose, on the other hand, puts an outer limit on the right to bring a civil action. That limit is measured not from the date on which the claim accrues but instead from the date of the last culpable act or omission of the defendant. A statute of repose \"bar[s] any suit that is brought after a specified time since the defendant acted (such as by designing or manufacturing a product), even if this period ends before the plaintiff has suffered a resulting injury.\" Black's 1546.

Statutes of repose also encourage plaintiffs to bring actions in a timely manner, and for many of the same reasons. But the rationale has a different emphasis. Statutes of repose effect a legislative judgment that a defendant should \"be free from liability after the legislatively determined period of time.\" C.J.S. \u00a7 7, at 24; see also\n   <em>\n    School Board of Norfolk v.

Like a discharge in bankruptcy, a statute of repose can be said to provide a fresh start or freedom from liability.

Congressional intent is discerned primarily from the statutory text. In any event, were the Court to adopt a presumption to help resolve ambiguity, substantial support also exists for the proposition that \"the States' coordinate role in government counsels against reading\" federal laws such as \u00a7 9658 \"to restrict the States' sovereign capacity to regulate\" in areas of traditional state concern.\n   <em>\n    FTC v.

Section 9658 contains another subsection, with the heading \"State law generally applicable,\" that provides the rule that \"the statute of limitations established under State law shall apply.\" \u00a7 9658(a)(2). Under this structure, state law is not pre-empted unless it fits into the precise terms of the exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The statute defines the \"applicable limitations period,\" the \"commencement date\" of which is subject to pre-emption, as a period specified in \"a statute of limitations.\" \u00a7 9658(b)(2). Indeed, \u00a7 9658 uses the term \"statute of limitations\" four times (not including the caption), but not the term \"statute of repose.\" This is instructive, but it is not dispositive. While the term \"statute of limitations\" has acquired a precise meaning, distinct from \"statute of repose,\" and while that is its primary meaning, it must be acknowledged that the term \"statute of limitations\" is sometimes used in a less formal way. In that sense, it can refer to any provision restricting the time in which a plaintiff must bring suit. See Black's 1546; see also\n   <em>\n    Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175010\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/185/#p210\">\n    425 U.S. 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 210,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175010\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/185/#p210\">\n    96 S.Ct. 1375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175010\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/185/#p210\">\n    47 L.Ed.2d 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976). Congress has used the term \"statute of limitations\" when enacting statutes of repose. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-6(h)(1)(B)(iii)(I)(aa) (2012 ed.) (creating a statute of repose and placing it in a provision entitled \"Statute of limitations\");\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202278\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same). And petitioner does not point out an example in which Congress has used the term \"statute of repose.\" So the Court must proceed to examine other evidence of the meaning of the term \"statute of limitations\" as it is used in \u00a7 9658. The parties debate the historical development of the terms \"statute of limitations\" and \"statute of repose\" in an effort to show how these terms were likely understood in 1986, when Congress enacted \u00a7 9658. It is apparent that the distinction between statutes of limitations and statutes of repose was understood by some courts and scholars before 1986. The 1977 Restatement of Torts noted that \"[i]n recent years special 'statutes of repose' have been adopted in some states.... The statutory period in these acts is usually longer than that for\n   the regular statute of limitations, but ... may have run before a cause of action came fully into existence.\" Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 899, Comment\n   <em>\n    g\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   But that usage, now predominant, then was not the only definition of the two terms. One scholar, writing in 1981, described multiple usages of the terms, including both a usage in which the terms are equivalent and also the modern, more precise usage. McGovern, The Variety, Policy and Constitutionality of Product Liability Statutes of Repose,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20Am.%20U.%20L.%20Rev.%20579\">\n    30 Am.

That statement likely reflects an earlier, broader usage in which the term \"statute of repose\" referred to all provisions delineating the time in which a plaintiff must bring suit.

Statutes of limitation are statutes of repose\"); Ballentine's Law Dictionary 1233 (2d ed. 1948) (similar). That usage does not necessarily support respondents' interpretation, because the broad usage of the term \"statute of repose\" does not mean that the term \"statute of limitations\" must refer to both types of statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   From all this, it is apparent that general usage of the legal terms has not always been precise, but the concept that statutes of repose and statutes of limitations are distinct was well enough established to be reflected in the 1982 Study Group Report, commissioned by Congress. In one of its recommendations, the Study Group Report called on States to adopt the discovery rule now embodied in \u00a7 9658. Study Group Report, pt. 1, at 256. The Report acknowledged that statutes of repose were not equivalent to statutes of limitations and that a recommendation to pre-empt the latter did not necessarily include the former. For immediately it went on to state: \"The Recommendation is intended also to cover the repeal of the statutes of repose which, in a number of states[,] have the same effect as some statutes of limitation in barring [a] plaintiff's claim before he knows that he has one.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=293%20A.2d%20662\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The scholars and professionals who were discussing this matter (and indeed were advising Congress) knew of a clear distinction between the two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Report clearly urged the repeal of statutes of repose as well as statutes of limitations. But in so doing the Report did what the statute does not: It referred to statutes of repose as a distinct category. And when Congress did not make the same distinction, it is proper to conclude that Congress did not exercise the full scope of its pre-emption power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   While the use of the term \"statute of limitations\" in \u00a7 9658 is not dispositive, the Court's textual inquiry does not end there, for other features of the statutory text further support the exclusion of statutes of repose. The text of \u00a7 9658 includes language describing the covered period in the singular. The statute uses the terms \"the applicable limitations period,\" \"such period\n   shall commence,\" and \"the statute of limitations established under State law.\" This would be an awkward way to mandate the pre-emption of two different time periods with two different purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   True, the Dictionary Act states that \"words importing the singular include and apply to several persons, parties, or things\" unless \"the context indicates otherwise.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It is true that in a literal sense a statute of repose limits the time during which a suit \"may be brought\" because it provides a point after which a suit cannot be brought.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ; see C.J.S. \u00a7 7, at 24 (\"A statute of repose ... limits the time within which an action may be brought\"). But the definition of the \"applicable limitations period\" presupposes that \"a [covered] civil action\" exists. \u00a7 9658(b)(2). Black's Law Dictionary defines a \"civil action\" as identical to an \"action at law,\" which in relevant part is defined as a \"civil suit stating a legal cause of action.\" Black's 32-33, 279 (9th ed. 2009); see also\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 222 (5th ed. 1979).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   A statute of repose, however, as noted above, \"is not related to the accrual of any cause of action.\" C.J.S. \u00a7 7, at 24. Rather, it mandates that there shall be no cause of action beyond a certain point, even if no cause of action has yet accrued. Thus, a statute of repose can prohibit a cause of action from coming into existence. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   N.C. Gen.Stat.

As a consequence, the inclusion of a tolling rule in \u00a7 9658 suggests that the statute's reach is limited to statutes of limitations, which traditionally have been subject to tolling. It would be odd for Congress, if it did seek to pre-empt statutes of repose, to pre-empt not just the commencement date of statutes of repose but also state law prohibiting tolling of statutes of repose-all without an express indication that \u00a7 9658 was intended to reach the latter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In addition to their argument that \u00a7 9658 expressly pre-empts statutes of repose, respondents contend that \u00a7 9658 effects an implied pre-emption because statutes of repose \"creat[e] an unacceptable 'obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.' \"\n   <em>\n    Wyeth v.

The definition key to this controversy, however, appears in \u00a7 9658(b)(4)(A): \" '[F]ederally required commencement date' means the date the plaintiff knew (or reasonably should have known) that [her] injury ... [was] caused ... by the hazardous substance ... concerned.\" Congress, in short, directed, in \u00a7 9658(a)(1), that the federally prescribed discovery rule, set out in \u00a7 9658(b)(4), shall apply \"in lieu of\" the earlier \"commencement date\" (the defendant's \"last act or omission\") specified in N.C. Gen.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 1-52(16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Why does the Court fight this straightforward reading? At length, the Court's opinion distinguishes statutes of limitations from statutes of repose. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2182 - 2188. Yet North Carolina itself made its repose period a component of the statute prescribing periods for \"the commencement of actions.\" \u00a7\u00a7 1-46, 1-52(16). What is a repose period, in essence, other than a limitations period unattended by a discovery rule? See Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, Superfund Section 301(e) Study Group, Injuries and Damages from Hazardous Wastes-Analysis and Improvement of Legal Remedies, 97th Cong., 2d Sess., (pt. 1) 255-256 (Comm. Print 1982) (hereinafter Study Group Report).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The legislative history of \u00a7 9658, moreover, shows why the distinction the Court draws between statutes of limitations and repose prescriptions cannot be what Congress ordered. As the Court recognizes,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2180 - 2181, Congress amended CERCLA to include \u00a7 9658 in response to the report of an expert Study Group commissioned when CERCLA was enacted. That report directed its proposals to the States rather than to Congress. It \"recommend[ed] that the several states enhance and develop common law and statutory remedies, and that they remove unreasonable procedural and other barriers to recovery in court action for personal injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous waste.\" Study Group Report 255. The report then made specific proposals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Under the heading \"Statutes of Limitations,\" the Study Group proposed (1) \"that all [S]tates ... clearly adopt the rule that an action accrues when the plaintiff discovers or should have discovered the injury or disease and its cause\" and (2) that States repeal \"statutes of repose which, in a number of [S]tates have the same effect as some statutes of limitation in barring plaintiff's claim before he knows he has one.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n    at 255-256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Both measures are necessary, the report explained, because \"many of the hazardous wastes are carcinogens\" with \"latency period[s] for the appearance of injury or disease ... likely to [run] for thirty years or more.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n    at 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Beyond question, a repose period, like the 10-year period at issue here, will prevent recovery for injuries with latency periods running for decades. Thus, altering statutes of limitations to include a discovery rule would be of little use in States with repose prescriptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Rather than await action by the States, Congress decided to implement the Study Group's proposal itself by adopting \u00a7 9658.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2181. The Conference Report relates the Study Group Report's observation that \"certain State statutes deprive plaintiffs of their day in court\" because \"[i]n the case of a long-latency disease, such as cancer,\" a limitations period that begins to run before the plaintiff has discovered her injury frequently will make timely suit impossible. Conference Report 261. The Conference Report then states that \"[t]his section\"-\u00a7 9658-\"addresses the problem identified in the [Study Group Report].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As the Study Group Report makes clear, \"the problem\" it identified, to which the Conference Report adverted, cannot be solved when statutes of repose remain operative. The Court's interpretation thus thwarts Congress' clearly expressed intent to fix \"the problem\" the Study Group described.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In lieu of uniform application of the \"federally required commencement date,\" \u00a7 9658(b)(4), the Court allows those responsible for environmental contamination, if they are located in the still small number of States with repose periods,\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fr1\" name=\"fr1\">\n     *\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n   to escape liability for the devastating harm they cause, harm hidden from detection for more than 10 years. Instead of encouraging prompt identification and remediation of toxic contamination before it can kill, the Court's decision gives contaminators an incentive to conceal the hazards they have created until the repose period has run its full course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Far from erring, see\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2180, 2184 - 2185, the Fourth Circuit, I am convinced, got it exactly right in holding that \u00a7 9658 supersedes state law contrary to the federally required discovery rule. I would affirm that court's sound judgment.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.
