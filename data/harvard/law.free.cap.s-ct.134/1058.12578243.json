The Act defines \"covered security\" to include, as relevant here, only securities traded on a national exchange. \u00a7\u00a7 78bb(f)(5)(E), 77r(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Four sets of plaintiffs, respondents here, filed civil class actions under state law, contending that the defendants, petitioners here, helped Allen Stanford and his companies perpetrate a Ponzi scheme by\n   falsely representing that uncovered securities (certificates of deposit in Stanford International Bank) that plaintiffs were purchasing were backed by covered securities. The District Court dismissed each case under the Litigation Act. Although the certificates of deposit were not covered securities, the court concluded, the Bank's misrepresentation that its holdings in covered securities made investments in its uncovered securities more secure provided the requisite \"connection\" (under the Litigation Act) between the plaintiffs' state-law actions and transactions in covered securities. The Fifth Circuit reversed, concluding that the falsehoods about the Bank's holdings in covered securities were too tangentially related to the fraud to trigger the Litigation Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em>\n    Held\n   </em>\n   : The Litigation Act does not preclude the plaintiffs' state-law class actions. Pp. 1065 - 1072.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   (a) Several factors support the conclusion that the scope of \u00a7 78bb(f)(1)(A)'s phrase \"misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security\" does not extend further than misrepresentations that are material to the decision by one or more individuals (other than the fraudster) to purchase or sell a covered security. First, this interpretation is consistent with the Act's basic focus on transactions in covered, not uncovered, securities. Second, the interpretation is supported by the Act's language. The phrase \"material fact in connection with the purchase or sale\" suggests a connection that matters. And a connection matters where the misrepresentation makes a significant difference to someone's decision to purchase or to sell a covered security, not an uncovered one, something about which the Act expresses no concern. See\n   <em>\n    Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano,\n   </em>\n   563 U.S. ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457891,5941206\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/1309/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1317-1319,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457891,5941206\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/1309/\">\n    179 L.Ed.2d 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, for the connection to matter, the \"someone\" making the decision to purchase or sell a covered security must be a party other than the fraudster. Third, the securities cases in which this Court has found a fraud to be \"in connection with\" a purchase or sale of a security, under both the Litigation Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (which also uses the \"in connection with\" phrase), have involved victims who took, who tried to take, who divested themselves of, who tried to divest themselves of, or who maintained an ownership interest in financial instruments that fall within the relevant statutory definition. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. v. Dabit,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275615\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/71/#p77\">\n    547 U.S. 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 77,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275615\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/71/#p77\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275615\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/71/#p77\">\n    164 L.Ed.2d 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Fourth, this Court reads the Litigation Act in light of and consistent with the language and purpose of the underlying regulatory statutes, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Securities Act of 1933, which refer to persons engaged in securities transactions that lead to the taking or dissolving of ownership positions, and which make it illegal to deceive a person when he or she is doing so. The basic purpose of the 1934 and 1933 regulatory statutes is to protect investor confidence in the securities markets. Nothing in those statutes, or in the Litigation Act, suggests their object is to protect persons whose connection with the statutorily defined securities is more remote than buying or selling. Fifth, a broader interpretation of the necessary statutory \"connection\" would interfere with state efforts to provide remedies for victims of ordinary state-law frauds, despite the fact that the Litigation Act purposefully seeks to avoid such results by maintaining States' legal authority\n   over matters that are primarily of state concern, see,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 78bb(f)(4). Pp. 1066 - 1069.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   (b) Respondents and the Government make two important, but unavailing, counterarguments. First, they point to this Court's suggestions that the phrase \"in connection with\" should be given a broad interpretation. But every case in which this Court interpreted the phrase to cover a fraud involved a false statement (or the like) that was \"material\" to another individual's decision to \"purchase or s[ell]\" a statutorily defined \"security\" or \"covered security,\"\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dabit, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 75-77,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275615\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/71/#p77\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and where the transaction was by or on behalf of someone other than the fraudster. Second, the Government warns that a narrow interpretation would curtail the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement powers under \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, which uses the same \"in connection with the purchase or sale\" phrase. To the contrary, this Court's interpretation is perfectly consistent with past SEC practice. The authority of the SEC and the Department of Justice extends to all \"securities\" under \u00a7 10(b), not just to those traded on national exchanges. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(a)(10). The SEC has accordingly brought successful enforcement actions against Stanford and his associates, based on the Bank's fraudulent sales of certificates of deposit-products that are \"securities\" even if not \"covered securities.\" Neither the Government nor the dissent has pointed to an example of any prior SEC enforcement action that the instant holding would have prevented the SEC from bringing. Pp. 1069 - 1071.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   (c) Respondents' complaints do not allege, for Litigation Act purposes, misrepresentations or omissions of material fact \"in connection with\" the \"purchase or sale of a covered security.\" At most, they allege misrepresentations about the Bank's ownership of covered securities. But the Bank is the fraudster, not the fraudster's victim; nor is it some other person transacting in covered securities. Thus, there is not the necessary \"connection\" between the materiality of the misstatements and the statutorily required \"purchase or sale of a covered security.\" In addition, while the District Court found that one plaintiff acquired Bank certificates with proceeds from the sale of covered securities, the plaintiffs did not allege that the sale of these covered securities constituted any part of the fraudulent scheme or that Stanford or his associates were interested in how the plaintiffs obtained the funds to purchase the certificates. Thus, those sales were only incidental to the fraud.

It says that plaintiffs may not maintain a class action \"based upon the statutory or common law of any State\" in which the plaintiffs allege \"a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact\n    <em>\n     in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security\n    </em>\n    .\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78bb(f)(1) (emphasis added). The Act defines \"class actions\" as those involving more than 50 members. See \u00a7 78bb(f)(5). It defines \"covered security\" narrowly to include only securities traded on a national exchange (or, here irrelevant, those issued by investment companies). \u00a7\u00a7 78bb(f)(5)(E), 77r(b)(1)-(2).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    The question before us is whether the Litigation Act encompasses a class action in which the plaintiffs allege (1) that they \"purchase[d]\"\n    <em>\n     uncovered\n    </em>\n    securities (certificates of deposit that are\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    traded on any national exchange), but (2) that the defendants falsely told the victims that the\n    <em>\n     uncovered\n    </em>\n    securities were backed by\n    <em>\n     covered\n    </em>\n    securities. We note that the plaintiffs do not allege that the defendants' misrepresentations led anyone to buy or to sell (or to maintain positions in)\n    <em>\n     covered\n    </em>\n    securities. Under these circumstances, we conclude the Act does not apply.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    In light of the dissent's characterization of our holding,\n    <em>\n     post,\n    </em>\n    at 1077 - 1078 (opinion of KENNEDY, j.)-which we believe is incorrect-we specify at the outset that this holding does\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    limit the Federal Government's authority to prosecute \"frauds like the one here.\"\n    <em>\n     Post,\n    </em>\n    at 1077 - 1078\n    <em>\n     .\n    </em>\n    The Federal Government\n    <em>\n     has\n    </em>\n    in fact brought successful prosecutions against the fraudsters at the heart of this litigation, see\n    <em>\n     infra,\n    </em>\n    at 1074 - 1075, and we fail to understand the dissent's repeated suggestions to the contrary,\n    <em>\n     post,\n    </em>\n    at 1073, 1073 - 1074, 1077 - 1078, 1078, 1081.

Green,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3750942\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/675/503/\">\n     675 F.3d 503\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 522 (C.A.5 2012). The plaintiffs expected that Stanford International Bank would use the money it received to buy highly lucrative assets. But instead, Stanford and his associates used the money provided by new investors to repay old investors, to finance an elaborate lifestyle, and to finance speculative real estate ventures.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    The Department of Justice brought related criminal charges against Allen Stanford. A jury convicted Stanford of mail fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and obstruction of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. Stanford was sentenced to prison and required to forfeit $6 billion. The SEC, noting that the Bank certificates of deposit fell within the 1934 Securities Exchange Act's broad definition of \"security,\" filed a \u00a7 10(b) civil case against Allen Stanford, the Stanford International Bank, and related Stanford companies and associates. The SEC won the civil action, and\n    the court imposed a civil penalty of $6 billion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    <strong>\n     2\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    The plaintiffs in each of the four civil class actions are private investors who bought the Bank's certificates of deposit. Two groups of plaintiffs filed their actions in Louisiana state court against firms and individuals who helped sell the Bank's certificates by working as \"investment advisers\" affiliated with Stanford, or who provided Stanford-related companies with trust, insurance, accounting, or reporting services. (The defendants included a respondent here, SEI Investments Company.) The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants helped the Bank perpetrate the fraud, thereby violating Louisiana state law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Two other groups of plaintiffs filed their actions in federal court for the Northern District of Texas. One group sued Willis of Colorado (and related Willis companies) and Bowen, Miclette &amp; Britt, two insurance brokers; the other group sued Proskauer Rose and Chadbourne &amp; Parke, two law firms. Both groups claimed that the defendants helped the Bank (and Allen Stanford) perpetrate the fraud or conceal it from regulators, thereby violating Texas securities law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    The Louisiana state-court defendants removed their cases to federal court, and the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation moved the Louisiana cases to the Northern District of Texas. A single federal judge heard all four class actions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    The defendants in each of the cases moved to dismiss the complaints. The District Court concluded that the Litigation Act required dismissal. The court recognized that the certificates of deposit themselves were not \"covered securities\" under the Litigation Act, for they were not \" 'traded nationally [or] listed on a regulated national exchange.' \" App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 12-86, p. 62. But each complaint in one way or another alleged that the fraud included misrepresentations that the Bank maintained significant holdings in \" 'highly marketable securities issued by stable governments [and] strong multinational companies,' \" and that the Bank's ownership of these \"covered\" securities made investments in the uncovered certificates more secure.\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 66. The court concluded that this circumstance provided the requisite statutory \"connection\" between (1) the plaintiffs' state-law fraud claims, and (2) \"transactions in covered securities.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 64, 66-67. Hence, the court dismissed the class actions under the Litigation Act.\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 75.

First, the Act focuses upon transactions in covered securities, not upon transactions in uncovered securities. An interpretation that insists upon a material connection with a transaction in a covered security is consistent with the Act's basic focus.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Second, a natural reading of the Act's language supports our interpretation. The language requires the dismissal of a state-law-based class action where a private party alleges a \"misrepresentation or omission of a material fact\" (or engages in other forms of deception, not relevant here) \"in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.\" \u00a7 78bb(f)(1). The phrase \"material fact in connection with the purchase or sale\" suggests a connection that matters. And for present purposes, a connection matters where the misrepresentation makes a significant difference to someone's decision to purchase or to sell a covered security, not to purchase or to sell an uncovered security, something about which the Act expresses no concern. See generally\n    <em>\n     Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano,\n    </em>\n    563 U.S. ----, ----,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457891,5941206\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/1309/\">\n     131 S.Ct. 1309\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1317-1319,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457891,5941206\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/1309/\">\n     179 L.Ed.2d 398\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2011) (a misrepresentation or omission is \"material\" if a reasonable investor would have considered the information significant when contemplating a statutorily relevant investment decision). Further, the \"someone\" making that decision to purchase or sell must be a party other than the fraudster. If the only party who decides to buy or sell a covered security as a result of a lie is the liar, that is not a \"connection\" that matters.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Third, prior case law supports our interpretation. As far as we are aware, every securities case in which this Court has found a fraud to be \"in connection with\" a purchase or sale of a security has involved victims who took, who tried to take, who divested themselves of, who tried to divest themselves of, or who maintained\n    <em>\n     an ownership interest\n    </em>\n    in financial instruments that fall within the relevant statutory definition.

The regulatory statutes refer to persons engaged in securities transactions that lead to the taking or dissolving of ownership positions. And they make it illegal to deceive a person when he or she is doing so. Section 5 of the 1933 Act, for example, makes it unlawful to \"offer to sell or offer to buy ... any security, unless a registration statement has been filed as to such security.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77e(c). Section 17 of the 1933 Act makes it unlawful \"in the offer or sale of any securities ... to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud, or to obtain money or property by means of any untrue statement of a material fact.\" \u00a7\u00a7 77q(a)(1)-(2). And \u00a7 10(b) of the 1934 Act makes it unlawful to \"use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security ... any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance.\" \u00a7 78j(b).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Not only language but also purpose suggests a statutory focus upon transactions involving the statutorily relevant securities. The basic purpose of the 1934 and 1933 regulatory statutes is \"to insure honest securities markets and thereby promote investor confidence.\" See\n    <em>\n     O'Hagan,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915949\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/642/#p651\">\n      supra,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915949\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/642/#p651\">\n     at 658\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915949\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/642/#p651\">\n     117 S.Ct. 2199\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Nothing in the regulatory statutes suggests their object is to protect persons whose connection with the statutorily defined securities is more remote than words such as \"buy,\" \"sell,\" and the like, indicate. Nor does anything in the Litigation Act provide us\n    with reasons for interpreting its similar language more broadly.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    The dissent correctly points out that the federal securities laws have another purpose, beyond protecting investors. Namely, they also seek to protect securities\n    <em>\n     issuers,\n    </em>\n    as well as the investment advisers, accountants, and brokers who help them sell financial products, from abusive class-action lawsuits.\n    <em>\n     Post,\n    </em>\n    at 1074 - 1075. Both the PSLRA and the Litigation Act were enacted in service of that goal. By imposing heightened pleading standards, limiting damages, and pre-empting state-law suits where the claims pertained to covered securities, Congress sought to reduce frivolous suits and mitigate legal costs for firms and investment professionals that participate in the market for nationally traded securities.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    We fail to see, however, how our decision today undermines that objective. The dissent worries our approach will \"subject many persons and entities whose profession it is to give advice, counsel, and assistance in investing in the securities markets to complex and costly state-law litigation.\"\n    <em>\n     Post,\n    </em>\n    at 1074. To the contrary, the\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    issuers, investment advisers, or accountants that today's decision will continue to subject to state-law liability are those who do not sell or participate in selling securities traded on U.S. national exchanges. We concede that this means a bank, chartered in Antigua and whose sole product is a fixed-rate debt instrument not traded on a U.S. exchange, will not be able to claim the benefit of preclusion under the Litigation Act. But it is difficult to see why the federal securities laws would be-or should be-concerned with shielding such entities from lawsuits.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Fifth, to interpret the necessary statutory \"connection\" more broadly than we do here would interfere with state efforts to provide remedies for victims of ordinary state-law frauds. A broader interpretation would allow the Litigation Act to cover, and thereby to prohibit, a lawsuit brought by creditors of a small business that falsely represented it was creditworthy, in part because it owns or intends to own exchange-traded stock. It could prohibit a lawsuit brought by homeowners against a mortgage broker for lying about the interest rates on their mortgages-if, say, the broker (not the homeowners) later sold the mortgages to a bank which then securitized them in a pool and sold off pieces as \"covered securities.\" Brief for Sixteen Law Professors as\n    <em>\n     Amici Curiae\n    </em>\n    24.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The dissent all but admits this. Its proposed rule is that whenever \"the purchase or sale of the securities [including by the fraudster] is what enables the fraud,\" the Litigation Act pre-empts the suit.\n    <em>\n     Post,\n    </em>\n    at 1078. In other words,\n    <em>\n     any time\n    </em>\n    one person convinces another to loan him money, by pretending he owns nationally traded securities or will acquire them for himself in the future, the action constitutes federal securities fraud, is subject to federal enforcement, and is\n    <em>\n     also\n    </em>\n    precluded by the Litigation Act if it qualifies as a \"covered class action\" under \u00a7 78bb(f)(5)(B) (\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    involves more than 50 members).

And the relevant statements or omissions were material to a transaction in the relevant securities by or on behalf of someone other than the fraudster.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Second, the Government points out that \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act also uses the phrase \"in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b). And the Government warns that a narrow interpretation of \"in connection with\" here threatens a similarly narrow interpretation there, which could limit the SEC's enforcement capabilities. See Brief for United States as\n    <em>\n     Amicus Curiae\n    </em>\n    28.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    We do not understand, however, how our interpretation could significantly curtail the SEC's enforcement powers. As far as the Government has explained the matter, our interpretation seems perfectly consistent with past SEC practice. For one thing, we have cast no doubt on the SEC's ability to bring enforcement actions against Stanford and Stanford International Bank. The SEC has already done so successfully. As we have repeatedly pointed\n    out, the term \"security\" under \u00a7 10(b) covers a wide range of financial products beyond those traded on national exchanges, apparently including the Bank's certificates of deposit at issue in these cases. No one here denies that, for \u00a7 10(b) purposes, the \"material\" misrepresentations by Stanford and his associates were made \"in connection with\" the \"purchases\" of those certificates.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    We find it surprising that the dissent worries that our decision will \"narro [w] and constric[t] essential protection for our national securities market,\"\n    <em>\n     post,\n    </em>\n    at 1073, and put \"frauds like the one here ... not within the reach of federal regulation,\"\n    <em>\n     post,\n    </em>\n    at 1077 - 1078. That would be news to Allen Stanford, who was sentenced to 110 years in federal prison after a successful federal prosecution, and to Stanford International Bank, which was ordered to pay billions in federal fines, after the same. Frauds like the one here-including\n    <em>\n     this fraud itself\n    </em>\n    -will continue to be within the reach of federal regulation because the authority of the SEC and Department of Justice extends to all \"securities,\" not just to those traded on national exchanges. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(a)(10); accord, \u00a7 77b(a)(1), \u00a7 80a-2(a)(36), \u00a7 80b-2(a)(18). When the fraudster peddles an uncovered security like the CDs here, the Federal Government will have the full scope of its usual powers to act. The only difference between our approach and that of the dissent, is that we\n    <em>\n     also\n    </em>\n    preserve the ability for investors to obtain relief under state laws when the fraud bears so remote a connection to the national securities market that no person actually believed he was taking an ownership position in that market.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Thus, despite the Government's and the dissent's hand wringing, neither has been able to point to an example of any prior SEC enforcement action brought during the past 80 years that our holding today would have prevented the SEC from bringing. At oral argument, the Government referred to an administrative proceeding,\n    <em>\n     In re Richard Line,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=62%20SEC%20Docket%202879\">\n     62 S.E.C.

Our examination of the report of that case, however, indicates that the defendant was a fraudster to whom the fraud's victims had loaned money, expecting that he would purchase securities on\n    <em>\n     their\n    </em>\n    behalf.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=62%20SEC%20Docket%202879\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=62%20SEC%20Docket%202879\">\n     at 2880\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Line represented to investors that he would invest their non-admitted assets in various securities, including U.S. Treasury notes, mutual fund shares, and collateralized debt obligations\");\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=62%20SEC%20Docket%202879\">\n      ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (\"[He] fabricated account statements which falsely recited that securities had been purchased on behalf of certain investors\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The Government's brief refers to two other proceedings as demonstrating the SEC's broad \u00a7 10(b) enforcement powers.

We have examined SEC records without finding any further examples.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    For these reasons, the dissent's warning that our decision will \"inhibit\" \"litigants from using federal law to police frauds\" and will \"undermine the primacy of federal law in policing abuses in the securities markets\" rings hollow.\n    <em>\n     Post,\n    </em>\n    at 1073 - 1074, 1074 - 1075. The dissent cannot point to one example of a federal securities action-public or private-that would have been permissible in the past\n    but that our approach will disallow in the future. And the irony of the dissent's position is that federal law would have\n    <em>\n     precluded\n    </em>\n    private recovery in these very suits, because \u00a7 10(b) does not create a private right of action for investors vis-\u00e0-vis \"secondary actors\" or \"aiders and abettors\" of securities fraud.\n    <em>\n     Stoneridge Investment Partners,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675633\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/148/#p153\">\n     552 U.S., at 152, 155\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675633\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/148/#p153\">\n     128 S.Ct. 761\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     Central Bank of Denver,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1146992\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/164/#p179\">\n     511 U.S., at 180\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1146992\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/164/#p179\">\n     114 S.Ct. 1439\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; accord, Brief for Petitioners in No. 12-86, p. 46 (\"Any federal securities action against Petitioners would clearly run afoul of\n    <em>\n     Central Bank\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Stoneridge\n    </em>\n    \"); Brief for Respondents 48 (same); Brief for United States as\n    <em>\n     Amicus Curiae\n    </em>\n    28 (same).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    <strong>\n     III\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Respondents' complaints specify that their claims rest upon their purchases of uncovered, not of covered, securities.

But the Bank is an entity that made the misrepresentations. The Bank is the fraudster, not the fraudster's victim.

And consequently, there is not the necessary \"connection\" between the materiality of the misstatements and the statutorily required \"purchase or sale of a covered security.\" See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1076.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    A final point: The District Court found that one of the plaintiffs acquired Bank certificates \"with the proceeds of selling\" covered securities contained in his IRA portfolio.

For purposes of this litigation all accept the premise that Allen Stanford and SIB induced the investors to purchase the CDs by fraudulent representations. In various state and federal courts the investors filed state-law suits against persons and entities, including attorneys, accountants, brokers, and investment advisers, alleging that they participated in or enabled the fraud. The defendants in the state-court suits removed the actions to federal court, where they were consolidated with the federal-court suits. The defendants contended that the state-law suits are precluded under the terms of the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (SLUSA or Act), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78bb(f)(1). As the investors prevailed in the Court of Appeals, they are the respondents here. The persons and entities who were defendants in the state-law actions are the petitioners. The investors contend the state-law suits are not precluded by SLUSA, and the petitioners contend the suits are precluded.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    For purposes of determining SLUSA's reach, all can agree that the CD purchases would not have been, without more, transactions\n    regulated by that Act; for the CDs were not themselves covered securities. As a result, in determining whether the Act must be invoked, a further circumstance must be considered: The investors purchased the CDs based on the misrepresentations that the CDs were, or would be, backed by investments in, among other assets, covered securities.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    What must be resolved, to determine whether the Act precludes the state-law suits at issue, is whether the misrepresentations regarding covered securities and the ensuing failure to invest in those securities were so related to the purchase of the CDs that the misrepresentations were \"misrepresentation[s] or omission[s] of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78bb(f)(1)(A).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    The opinion for the Court, it seems fair to say, adopts this beginning framework, and it is quite correct to do so. The Court is further correct to view this litigation as involving a fraud of a type, scale, and perhaps sophistication that has not yet been addressed in its precedents with respect to the applicability of the federal securities laws.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    It is the premise of this dissent that the more simple frauds addressed in this Court's precedents, where the Court did find fraud \"in connection with the purchase or sale,\" are applicable here. In those cases, as here, the immediate cause of loss to the victim of the fraud was not simply a purchase or sale but rather a fraud that depended on the purchase or sale of securities or the promise to do so. It is submitted that this litigation should not come out differently simply because the fraud here was so widespread that many investors were misled by misrepresentations respecting investments, or promised investments, in regulated securities in the markets. And it is necessary to caution that, in holding otherwise, the Court adopts a new approach, an approach which departs from the rules established in the earlier, albeit simpler, cases. And, as a consequence, today's decision, to a serious degree, narrows and constricts essential protection for our national securities markets, protection vital for their strength and integrity. The result will be a lessened confidence in the market, a force for instability that should otherwise be countered by the proper interpretation of federal securities laws and regulations. Though the reasons supporting the Court's opinion are set forth with care and clarity, this respectful dissent submits that established principles do not support its holding.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    <strong>\n     I\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    It must be determined whether the misrepresentations to the investors-misrepresentations that led them to buy CDs in the belief they could rely on the expertise and sophistication of Stanford and SIB in the national securities markets-were \"misrepresentation[s] or omission[s] of ... material fact[s] in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78bb(f)(1). This is the central provision of SLUSA for purposes of this litigation. The Court's precedents instruct that this language has broad application and must be construed flexibly in order to encompass new and ever more ingenious fraudulent schemes.\n    <em>\n     Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. v.

First, SLUSA seeks to preclude a broad range of state-law securities claims in order to protect those who advise, counsel, and otherwise assist investors from abusive and multiplicitous class actions designed to extract settlements from defendants vulnerable to litigation costs. This, in turn, protects the integrity of the markets. Second, even as the Act cuts back on the availability of state-law securities claims, a fair interpretation of its language ensures robust federal regulation of the national securities markets. That is because, in designing SLUSA, Congress \"imported the key phrase\" from \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 10b-5, which provide a private cause of action, as well as SEC enforcement authority, for securities fraud.\n    <em>\n     Dabit,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275615\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/71/#p77\">\n     547 U.S., at 79, 85\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275615\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/71/#p77\">\n     126 S.Ct. 1503\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The investors had-or were led to believe they could have-the advantages of Stanford's and SIB's expertise in investments in the national market. So here, as in\n    <em>\n     Zandford,\n    </em>\n    the success of the fraud turned on the promise to trade in regulated securities. According to the complaints, SIB represented that it would \" 're-inves[t]' \" the plaintiffs' money on their behalf in \"a well-diversified portfolio of highly marketable securities issued by stable national governments, strong multinational companies, and major international banks\" to ensure a \"safe, liquid,\" and above-market return. See App. 244, 249, 250, 253, 336, 342, 345, 444, 470, 480, 628. The misrepresentation was about nationally traded securities and lent credence to SIB's promise that the CDs were a liquid investment that \"could be redeemed with just a few days' notice.\" See\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 253, 345, 445, 628.

The fraud could not have succeeded without the misrepresentation: The investors gave SIB money because they expected it to be invested in the national securities markets. The connection between the promised purchases and the misrepresentation is more direct than in\n    <em>\n     Zandford,\n    </em>\n    because the misrepresentation was essential to the fraud.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Here, and again just as in\n    <em>\n     Zandford,\n    </em>\n    the fraud was not complete until the representation about securities transactions became untrue, just as Stanford intended all along. Instead of purchasing covered securities, SIB purchased some but fewer covered securities than it promised-only 10% of its portfolio, according to an affidavit attached to a complaint-and primarily speculated in Caribbean real estate. Brief for Respondents 37; App. 594; but see Tr. of Oral Arg. 43-44 (suggesting SIB did not purchase securities). It was not until SIB rendered the CDs illiquid by failing to make substantial investments in the nationally traded securities it promised that the fraud was consummated. At that point, SIB blocked the plaintiffs' access to the market. The fraud and SIB's failure to purchase all that it promised were not independent events. Rather, the false promises to invest in covered securities enabled and furthered the CD fraud. Without the false promise, there would have been no money to purchase the covered securities. On these facts, this Court's controlling precedents instruct that these misrepresentations were made \"in connection with the purchase or sale\" of regulated securities; and, as a result, state-law claims concerning them should be precluded.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    <em>\n     Dabit\n    </em>\n    provides further support for this conclusion. There, the Court held that an investment bank that deceived brokers into advising their clients to hold covered securities made misrepresentations \"in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.\" \"Under our precedents,\" the Court explained, \"it is enough that the fraud alleged 'coincide' with a securities transaction-whether by the plaintiff or by someone else.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275615\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/71/#p77\">\n     547 U.S., at 85\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275615\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/71/#p77\">\n     126 S.Ct. 1503\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Here, for like reasons, it does not matter that the fraud victims, as opposed to Stanford and SIB, were not the ones to fail to invest in the market. The very essence of the fraud was to induce purchase of the CDs on the (false) promise that investors should rely on SIB's special skills and expertise in making market investments in covered securities on their behalf.

So, for example, the statutory language does not extend to cover a thief who steals money from a store to buy securities or to a fraudster who defrauds a bank for a loan that he uses to buy securities. See\n    <em>\n     O'Hagan,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915949\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/642/#p651\">\n      supra,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915949\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/642/#p651\">\n     at 656\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915949\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/642/#p651\">\n     117 S.Ct. 2199\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The victims in those cases are not concerned about their ability to act as investors but rather about their duties as a store clerk or a loan officer. Those frauds involve securities transactions only as happenstance. As a result, the interpretation submitted in this dissent strikes the balance that Congress intended between forbidding frauds by intermediaries in the market without reaching frauds that touch the markets in only tangential ways.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    The key question is whether the misrepresentation coincides with the purchase or sale of a covered security or the purchase or sale of the securities is what enables the fraud. Stanford's misrepresentation did so. Stanford promised to purchase covered securities for investors, using his special expertise, thus allowing investors to rely on his skill to participate in the national securities markets. The entire scheme rested on investors falling for the trick. When covered securities are so integral to the fraud, the false promise is incident to the purchase or sale of regulated securities because it coincides with it, and the misrepresentation respecting national securities enabled the fraud.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    <strong>\n     D\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    The Court interprets the phrase \"misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security\"-the key phrase in SLUSA and Rule 10b-5-in a different manner. The result, it is submitted, is inconsistent with the statutory scheme Congress enacted and casts doubt on the applicability of federal securities law to cases of serious securities fraud.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    The Court construes the text of SLUSA and Rule 10b-5 to require a misrepresentation that \"is material to a decision by one or more individuals (other than the fraudster) to buy or sell a 'covered security.' \"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1066. The Act simply does not say that the purchase or sale-or the promise to make a purchase or sale-must be by one other than the fraudster. Rather the Act states that there must be \"a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78bb(f)(1)(A). See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n     17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .10b-5 (2013) (requiring an \"untrue statement of a material fact\" \"in connection with the purchase or sale of any security\"). The Court narrows the statute Congress wrote in two ways. It excises the important \"in connection with\" language, resulting in a confined reading inconsistent with the Act's purpose, structure, and operation. And, by requiring the purchase or sale be made by someone \"other than the fraudster,\" the Court inserts a limiting phrase that nowhere appears in the language of the provisions. In litigation like this, this new rule has it upside down. When the violation that adversely affects the securities market is done by the fraudster himself, that is all the more reason for applying federal law. This is not a case where Congress has limited its coverage to a certain subset of purchasers. Congress enacted such a limit two subsections later in SLUSA when detailing which actions are not precluded. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78bb(f)(3)(A)(ii)(I) (\"the purchase or sale of securities by the issuer or an affiliate of the issuer exclusively from or to holders of equity securities of the issuer\"). But it did not do so in the provision at issue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    The Court's reconstruction of the language of the provisions also casts doubt on the applicability of federal securities law to three established instances of federal securities fraud and one instance of preclusion under the Act as adjudged by the Court and the SEC in earlier cases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    First, the Court's interpretation necessarily suggests that\n    <em>\n     Zandford\n    </em>\n    is incorrect and that dishonest brokers need not fear Rule 10b-5 liability. The deceit in\n    <em>\n     Zandford\n    </em>\n    was that the broker would act as the victim's fiduciary when in fact he planned on selling (and did sell) the investor's securities for his own benefit.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"352191\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/813/#p822\">\n     535 U.S., at 820\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"352191\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/813/#p822\">\n     122 S.Ct. 1899\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; see also\n    <em>\n     Line,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=62%20SEC%20Docket%202879\">\n     62 S.E.C. Docket 2879\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (broker's deceit was false promise to buy). The Court's rule that liability must rest on a finding that someone other than the fraudster purchased or sold securities is inconsistent with\n    <em>\n     Zandford,\n    </em>\n    where the recipient of the misrepresentation did not buy or sell. The Court's opinion disregards the hazards to the market when the fraudster is the one acting in the market and frustrates the investment objectives of his victims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Second, the Court's interpretation is difficult to reconcile with liability for insider trading. In\n    <em>\n     O'Hagan,\n    </em>\n    the Court held that the \"in connection with\" element \"is satisfied because the fiduciary's fraud is consummated, not when the fiduciary gains the confidential information, but when, without disclosure to his principal, he uses the information to purchase or sell securities,\" \"even though the person or entity defrauded is not the other party to the trade.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915949\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/642/#p651\">\n     521 U.S., at 656\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915949\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/642/#p651\">\n     117 S.Ct. 2199\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Court's requirement that someone other than the fraudster purchase or sell a security is hard to square with\n    <em>\n     O'Hagan\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    Third, the Court's interpretation is difficult to square with the SEC's position in\n    <em>\n     In re Orlando Joseph Jett,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20SEC%20Docket%201211\">\n     82 S.E.C. Docket 1211\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2004). There, the SEC held liable a trader who fabricated complex trades to supplement the returns of his real trades, so as to increase his standing in his company. The SEC likened Jett to \"garden-\n    variety securities fraud cases in which a broker-dealer or investment adviser engages in unsuccessful securities trades for a client and then hides the losses or inflates the profits by sending out false account statements.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20SEC%20Docket%201211\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20SEC%20Docket%201211\">\n     at 1253\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The decision of the Court today would require that Jett's misrepresentation led to the purchase or sale of securities by someone other than Jett. But the SEC found Jett's own purchases and sales to be sufficient to come within the securities laws.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    Finally, the Court's analysis is inconsistent with the unanimous opinion in\n    <em>\n     Dabit,\n    </em>\n    which interpreted the same statutory language at issue in this litigation.\n    <em>\n     Dabit\n    </em>\n    squarely rejected the view that \"an alleged fraud is 'in connection with' a purchase or sale of securities only when the plaintiff himself was defrauded into purchasing or selling particular securities.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275615\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/71/#p77\">\n     547 U.S., at 85\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275615\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/71/#p77\">\n     126 S.Ct. 1503\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Instead, it approved the SEC's interpretation that a broker who \" 'sells customer securities with intent to misappropriate the proceeds' \" satisfies the \"in connection with the purchase or sale\" requirement.\n    <em>\n     Ibid.,\n    </em>\n    n. 10.\n    <em>\n     Dabit\n    </em>\n    cannot be reconciled with today's decision to require someone other than the fraudster buy or sell a security.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    It is correct that there is no case precisely standing for the proposition that a victim does not have to take an ownership position. However,\n    <em>\n     O'Hagan\n    </em>\n    supports that view.\n    <em>\n     O'Hagan\n    </em>\n    clearly states that in insider trading cases \"the person or entity defrauded is not the other party to the trade.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915949\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/642/#p651\">\n     521 U.S., at 656\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915949\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/642/#p651\">\n     117 S.Ct. 2199\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . And in\n    <em>\n     Zandford\n    </em>\n    a fraudster told customers he would invest \"their money\" in securities and then sold those securities.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"352191\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/813/#p822\">\n     535 U.S., at 815\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"352191\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/813/#p822\">\n     122 S.Ct. 1899\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Here the fraudster told plaintiffs that he would \"re-invest\" \"their\" money in securities and then bought different securities. App. 250, 470, 715. The only difference is that there the fraudster sold and here he bought. Federal regulation should not turn on whether a fraudster arrives before or after an investor makes his first purchase.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    <strong>\n     II\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    The Court's interpretation also introduces confusion into securities law by not defining what it means for someone \"other than the fraudster to buy or sell\" a security, a rule that it derives from its view that the precedents all involve victims who had an ownership interest in securities.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1076 - 1077. The precedents the Court cites involve what the parties have called direct ownership, where the victim buys or sells an entire equity. By using the term ownership interest instead of ownership, the Court also appears to accept the respondents' concession that indirect ownership, where the victim buys or sells shares in a defendant fund that itself owns equities, is sufficient in certain circumstances, such as when a victim has \"some interest in the defendant's supposed portfolio.\" Brief for Respondents 16.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    An ownership rule distinguishing between different types of indirect ownership is unworkable. Indirect ownership is a common type of investment. See M. Fink, The Rise of Mutual Funds 1 (2008) (U.S. mutual funds have over 88 million American shareholders and over $11 trillion in assets). Yet whether indirect ownership involves an interest in the underlying equities is a complex question of corporation, LLC, or partnership law. See\n    <em>\n     In re Bernard L. Madoff Inv. Securities LLC,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3541858,4170483\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/708/422/\">\n     708 F.3d 422\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 427 (C.A.2 2013). Congress likely did not intend preclusion of state-law suits to depend on the complexities of the Delaware Code.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    The Court's ownership approach also casts doubt on the scope of Rule 10b-5. Under the Court's interpretation, \u00a7 10(b) applies to fraudulent mutual or hedge\n    funds not because those funds invest in securities but because investments in the funds are securities. But not all such investments are securities. 2 L. Ribstein &amp; R. Keatinge, Limited Liability Companies \u00a7 14:2 (2010) (discussing test for a security from\n    <em>\n     SEC v. W.J. Howey Co.,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377246\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/328/293/\">\n     328 U.S. 293\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377246\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/328/293/\">\n     66 S.Ct. 1100\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377246\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/328/293/\">\n     90 L.Ed. 1244\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1946)); 1 H. Bloomenthal &amp; S. Wolff, Securities Law Handbook \u00a7\u00a7 2:3 to 2:4 (2010). For those that are not, the Court seems to envision liability only when the investment confers an ownership interest in the fund's securities. And the general rule for investments in funds organized as LLPs and LLCs is that they do not convey such claims. 1 Ribstein &amp; Keatinge,\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 7:11; see\n    <em>\n     In re Herald,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702716\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/112/\">\n     730 F.3d 112\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (C.A.2 2013). As a result, in important instances Rule 10b-5 may not extend to mutual and hedge funds under the Court's interpretation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    It is true that the SEC pursued the fraudster with success here. But that is because the CDs are securities. See Order Denying Motion to Dismiss in\n    <em>\n     SEC v. Stanford International Bank,\n    </em>\n    No. 3-09-CV-0298-N (N.D.Tex., Nov. 30, 2011), pp. 5-10. This aspect of Stanford's fraud is not a necessary feature of all frauds involving funds similar to SIB.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    <strong>\n     III\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    The fraudster in this litigation misrepresented that he would purchase nationally traded securities. That misrepresentation was made \"in connection with the purchase or sale\" of the promised securities because it coincided with them. The fraud turned on the misrepresentation. The Court's contrary interpretation excises the phrase \"in connection with\" from the Act, a phrase that the Court in earlier cases held to require a broad and flexible meaning. At the same time, by holding that the purchase or sale of securities be made by someone other than the fraudster, the Court engrafts a limitation that does not appear in the text. The result is to constrict the application of federal securities regulation in instances where dishonest brokers, insider traders, and lying employees purchase or sell securities, or promise to do so, as part of the fraud. Today's decision introduces confusion in the enforcement of securities laws.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    For these reasons, it is submitted that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"*\">\n    <p id=\"p-136\">\n     Together with No. 12-86,\n     <em>\n      Willis of Colorado Inc. et al. v.
