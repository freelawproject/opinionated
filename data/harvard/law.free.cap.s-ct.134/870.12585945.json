U.S. Steel contends that this donning-and-doffing time, which would otherwise be compensable under the Act, is noncompensable under a provision of its collective-bargaining agreement with petitioners' union. That provision's validity depends on\n  <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n   29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (\n  <em>\n   o\n  </em>\n  ), which allows parties to collectively bargain over whether \"time spent in changing clothes ... at the beginning or end of each workday\" must be compensated. The District Court granted U.S. Steel summary judgment in pertinent part, holding that petitioners' donning and doffing constituted \"changing clothes\" under \u00a7 203(\n  <em>\n   o\n  </em>\n  ). It also assumed that any time spent donning and doffing items that were not \"clothes\" was \"\n  <em>\n   de minimis\n  </em>\n  \" and hence noncompensable.

The Act was amended in 1949, however, to provide that the compensability of time spent \"changing clothes or washing at the beginning or end of each workday\" is a subject appropriately committed to collective bargaining, \u00a7 203(\n  <em>\n   o\n  </em>\n  ). Whether petitioners' donning and doffing qualifies as \"changing clothes\" depends on the meaning of that statutory phrase. Pp. 874 - 877.\n </syllabus>\n <opinion id=\"p-9\">\n  (b) The term \"clothes,\" which is otherwise undefined, is \"interpreted as taking [its] ordinary, contemporary, common meaning.\"\n  <em>\n   Perrin v. United States,\n  </em>\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11304612\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/444/37/#p42\">\n   444 U.S. 37\n  </extracted-citation>\n  , 42,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11304612\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/444/37/#p42\">\n   100 S.Ct. 311\n  </extracted-citation>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11304612\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/444/37/#p42\">\n   62 L.Ed.2d 199\n  </extracted-citation>\n  . In dictionaries from the era of \u00a7 203(\n  <em>\n   o\n  </em>\n  )'s enactment, \"clothes\" denotes items that are both designed and used to cover the body and are commonly regarded as articles of dress. Nothing in \u00a7 203(\n  <em>\n   o\n  </em>\n  )'s text or context suggests anything other than this ordinary meaning. There is no basis for petitioners' proposition that the unmodified term \"clothes\" somehow omits protective clothing. Section 203(\n  <em>\n   o\n  </em>\n  )'s exception applies only when the changing of clothes is \"an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities for which covered workmen are employed,\"\n  <em>\n   Steiner v.

And protective gear is the\n  <em>\n   only\n  </em>\n  clothing that is integral and indispensable to the work of many occupations, such as butchers and longshoremen. Petitioners' position is also incompatible with the historical context of \u00a7 203(\n  <em>\n   o\n  </em>\n  )'s passage, contradicting contemporaneous Labor Department regulations and dictum in\n  <em>\n   Steiner,\n  </em>\n  see\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032164\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/350/247/#p256\">\n   350 U.S., at 248, 254-255\n  </extracted-citation>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032164\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/350/247/#p256\">\n   76 S.Ct. 330\n  </extracted-citation>\n  . The interpretation adopted here leaves room for distinguishing between clothes and wearable items that are not clothes, such as some equipment and devices. The view of respondent and its\n  <em>\n   amici\n  </em>\n  that \"clothes\" encompasses the entire outfit that one puts on to be ready for work is also devoid of any textual foundation. Pp. 876 - 879.\n </opinion>\n <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n  (c) While the normal meaning of \"changing clothes\" connotes substitution, \"changing\" also carried the meaning to \"alter\" at the time of \u00a7 203(\n  <em>\n   o\n  </em>\n  )'s enactment. The broader statutory context makes plain that \"time spent in changing clothes\" includes time spent in altering dress. Whether one exchanges street clothes for work clothes or simply chooses to layer one over the other may be a matter of purely personal choice, and \u00a7 203(\n  <em>\n   o\n  </em>\n  ) should not be read to allow workers to opt into or out of its coverage at random or at\n  will when another reading is textually permissible. Pp. 878 - 879.\n </blockquote>\n <history id=\"p-11\">\n  (d) Applying these principles here, it is evident that the donning and doffing in this case qualifies as \"changing clothes\" under \u00a7 203(\n  <em>\n   o\n  </em>\n  ). Of the 12 items at issue, only 3-safety glasses, earplugs, and a respirator-do not fit within the elaborated interpretation of \"clothes.\" Apparently concerned that federal judges would have to separate the minutes spent clothes-changing and washing from the minutes devoted to other activities during the relevant period, some Courts of Appeals have invoked the doctrine\n  <em>\n   de minimis non curat lex\n  </em>\n  (the law does not take account of trifles). But that doctrine does not fit comfortably within this statute, which is all about trifles. A more appropriate way to proceed is for courts to ask whether the period at issue can,\n  <em>\n   on the whole,\n  </em>\n  be fairly characterized as \"time spent in changing clothes or washing.\" If an employee devotes the vast majority of that time to putting on and off equipment or other non-clothes items, the entire period would not qualify as \"time spent in changing clothes\" under \u00a7 203(\n  <em>\n   o\n  </em>\n  ), even if some clothes items were also donned and doffed. But if the vast majority of the time is spent in donning and doffing \"clothes\" as defined here, the entire period qualifies, and the time spent putting on and off other items need not be subtracted. Here, the Seventh Circuit agreed with the District Court's conclusion that the time spent donning and doffing safety glasses and earplugs was minimal. And this Court is disinclined to disturb the District Court's additional factual finding, not addressed by the Seventh Circuit, that the respirators were donned and doffed as needed during the normal workday and thus fell beyond \u00a7 203(\n  <em>\n   o\n  </em>\n  )'s scope.

In the aggregate, the amount of time-and thus money-involved is likely to be quite large. Because this donning-and-doffing time would otherwise be compensable under the Act, U.S. Steel's contention of noncompensability stands or falls upon the validity of a provision of its collective-bargaining agreement with petitioners' union, which says that this time is noncompensable.\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fr4\" name=\"fr4\">\n     3\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n   The validity of that provision depends, in turn, upon the applicability of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   ) to the time at issue.

See Webster's New International Dictionary of the English Language 507 (2d ed. 1950) (Webster's Second) (defining\n   \"clothes\" as \"[c]overing for the human body; dress; vestments; vesture\"); see also,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   2 Oxford English Dictionary 524 (1933) (defining \"clothes\" as \"[c]overing for the person; wearing apparel; dress, raiment, vesture\").

That position creates a distinction between \"protection,\" on the one hand, and \"decency or comfort,\" on the other-a distinction that petitioners appear to have derived from Webster's Second, which elaborates that \"clothes\" is \"a general term for whatever covering is worn, or is made to be worn,\n   <em>\n    for decency or comfort\n   </em>\n   .\" Webster's Second 507 (emphasis added). But that definition does not exclude, either explicitly or implicitly, items with a protective function, since \"protection\" and \"comfort\" are not incompatible, and are often synonymous. A parasol protects against the sun, enhancing the comfort of the bearer-just as work gloves protect against scrapes and cuts, enhancing the comfort of the wearer. Petitioners further assert that protective items of apparel are referred to as \"clothing\" rather than \"clothes.\" They point out that, when introduced by the adjective \"protective,\" the noun \"clothing\" is used more commonly than \"clothes.\" That is true enough, but it seems to us explained by euphonic preference rather than difference in meaning. We see no basis for the proposition that the unmodified term \"clothes\" somehow omits protective clothing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Petitioners' proffered distinction, moreover, runs the risk of reducing \u00a7 203(\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   ) to near nothingness. The statutory compensation requirement to which \u00a7 203(\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   ) provides an exception embraces the changing of clothes only when that conduct constitutes \"an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities for which covered workmen are employed.\"\n   <em>\n    Steiner,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032164\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/350/247/#p256\">\n    350 U.S., at 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032164\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/350/247/#p256\">\n    76 S.Ct. 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But protective gear is the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   clothing that is integral and indispensable to the work of factory workers, butchers, longshoremen, and a host of other occupations. Petitioners' definition of \"clothes\" would largely limit the application of \u00a7 203(\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   ) to what might be called workers' costumes, worn by such employees as waiters, doormen, and train conductors. Petitioners insist that their definition excludes only items with some specific\n   <em>\n    work-hazard-related\n   </em>\n   protective function, but that limitation essentially abandons the assertion that clothes are for decency or comfort, leaving no basis whatever for the distinction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Petitioners' position is also incompatible with the historical context surrounding \u00a7 203(\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   )'s passage, since it flatly contradicts an illustration provided by the Labor Department's 1947 regulations to show how \"changing clothes\" could be intimately related to a principal activity.

Yet even acknowledging that it may be impossible to eliminate all vagueness when interpreting a word as wide-ranging as \"clothes,\" petitioners' fanciful hypotheticals give us little pause. The statutory context makes clear that the \"clothes\" referred to are items that are integral to job performance; the donning and doffing of other items would create no claim to compensation under the Act, and hence no need for the \u00a7 203(\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   ) exception. Moreover, even with respect to items that can be regarded as integral to job performance, our definition does not embrace the view, adopted by some Courts of Appeals, that \"clothes\" means essentially anything worn on the body-including accessories, tools, and so forth. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Salazar v. Butterball, LLC,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5649167\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/644/1130/#p1139\">\n    644 F.3d 1130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1139-1140 (C.A.10 2011) (\"clothes\" are \"items or garments worn by a person\" and include \"knife holders\"). The construction we adopt today is considerably more contained. Many accessories-necklaces and knapsacks, for instance-are not \"both designed and used to cover the body.\" Nor are tools \"commonly regarded as articles of dress.\" Our definition leaves room for distinguishing between clothes and wearable items that are not clothes, such as some equipment and devices.\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fr7\" name=\"fr7\">\n     6\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Respondent and its\n   <em>\n    amici,\n   </em>\n   by contrast, give the term in question a capacious construction, effectively echoing the Courts of Appeals mentioned above. On this view, \"clothes\" encompasses the entire outfit that one puts on to be ready for work. That interpretation is, to be sure, more readily administrable, but it is even more devoid of a textual foundation than petitioners' offering. Congress could have declared bargainable under \u00a7 203(\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   ) \"time spent in changing\n   <em>\n    outfits,\n   </em>\n   \" or \"time spent in putting on and off\n   <em>\n    all the items needed for work\n   </em>\n   .\" For better or worse, it used the narrower word \"clothes.\" \"The role of this Court is to apply the statute as it is written-even if we think some other approach might accord with good policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Burrage v.

That is undoubtedly true. See Webster's Second 448 (defining \"change\" as \"to make substitution of, for, or among, often among things of the same kind ...; as, to\n   <em>\n    change\n   </em>\n   one's clothes\"). One would not normally\n   say he has changed clothes when he puts on an overcoat. Petitioners conclude from this that items of protective gear that are put on\n   <em>\n    over\n   </em>\n   the employee's street clothes are not covered by \u00a7 203(\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   We disagree. Although it is true that the normal meaning of \"changing clothes\" connotes substitution, the phrase is certainly able to have a different import. The term \"changing\" carried two common meanings at the time of \u00a7 203(\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   )'s enactment: to \"substitute\" and to \"alter.\" See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   2 Oxford English Dictionary 268 (defining \"change,\" among other verb forms, as \"to substitute another (or others) for, replace by another (or others)\" and \"[t]o make (a thing) other than it was; to render different, alter, modify, transmute\"). We think that despite the usual meaning of \"changing clothes,\" the broader statutory context makes it plain that \"time spent in changing clothes\" includes time spent in altering dress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The object of \u00a7 203(\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   ) is to permit collective bargaining over the compensability of clothes-changing time and to promote the predictability achieved through mutually beneficial negotiation. There can be little predictability, and hence little meaningful negotiation, if \"changing\" means only \"substituting.\" Whether one actually exchanges street clothes for work clothes or simply layers garments atop one another after arriving on the job site is often a matter of purely personal choice. That choice may be influenced by such happenstances and vagaries as what month it is, what styles are in vogue, what time the employee wakes up, what mode of transportation he uses, and so on. As the Fourth Circuit has put it, if the statute imposed a substitution requirement \"compensation for putting on a company-issued shirt might turn on something as trivial as whether the employee did or did not take off the t-shirt he wore into work that day.\"\n   <em>\n    Sepulveda v.

Where another reading is textually permissible, \u00a7 203(\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   ) should not be read to allow workers to opt into or out of its coverage at random or at will.\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fr8\" name=\"fr8\">\n     7\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Applying the foregoing principles to the facts of this case, we hold that petitioners' donning and doffing of the protective gear at issue qualifies as \"changing clothes\" within the meaning of \u00a7 203(\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Petitioners have pointed to 12 particular items: a flame-retardant jacket, pair of pants, and hood; a hardhat; a snood; wristlets; work gloves; leggings; metatarsal boots; safety glasses; earplugs; and a respirator. The first nine clearly fit within the interpretation of \"clothes\" elaborated above: they are both designed and used to cover the body and are commonly regarded as articles of dress. That proposition is obvious with respect to the jacket, pants, hood, and gloves. The hardhat is simply a type of hat. The snood is basically a hood that also covers the neck and upper shoulder area; on the ski slopes, one might call it a \"balaclava.\" The wristlets are essentially detached shirtsleeves. The leggings\n   look much like traditional legwarmers, but with straps. And the metatarsal boots-more commonly known as \"steel-toed\" boots-are just a special kind of shoe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The remaining three items, by contrast, do not satisfy our standard. Whereas glasses and earplugs may have a covering function, we do not believe that they are commonly regarded as articles of dress. And a respirator obviously falls short on both grounds. The question is whether the time devoted to the putting on and off of these items must be deducted from the noncompensable time. If so, federal judges must be assigned the task of separating the minutes spent clothes-changing and washing from the minutes devoted to other activities during the period in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Some Courts of Appeals, including the Court of Appeals in this case, have sought to avoid, or at least mitigate, this difficulty by invoking the doctrine\n   <em>\n    de minimis non curat lex\n   </em>\n   (the law does not take account of trifles). This, they hold, enables them to declare noncompensable a few minutes actually spent on something other than clothes-changing-to wit, donning and doffing non-clothes items.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Although the roots of the\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   doctrine stretch to ancient soil, its application in the present context began with\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   . There, the Court declared that because \"[s]plit-second absurdities are not justified by the actualities of working conditions or by the policy of the Fair Labor Standards Act,\" such \"trifles\" as \"a few seconds or minutes of work beyond the scheduled working hours\" may be \"disregarded.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377256\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/328/680/\">\n    328 U.S., at 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377256\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/328/680/\">\n    66 S.Ct. 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"We [thus] do not ... preclude the application of a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   rule.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377256\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/328/680/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   We doubt that the\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   doctrine can properly be applied to the present case. To be sure,\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   included \"putting on aprons and overalls\" and \"removing shirts\" as activities to which \"it is appropriate to apply a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   doctrine.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377256\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/328/680/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377256\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/328/680/\">\n    at 692-693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377256\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/328/680/\">\n    66 S.Ct. 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It said that, however, in the context of determining what preliminary activities had to be counted as part of the gross workweek under \u00a7 207(a) of the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fr9\" name=\"fr9\">\n     8\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n   A\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   doctrine does not fit comfortably within the statute at issue here, which, it can fairly be said, is\n   <em>\n    all about\n   </em>\n   trifles-the relatively insignificant periods of time in which employees wash up and put on various items of clothing needed for their jobs. Or to put it in the context of the present case, there is no more reason to\n   <em>\n    disregard\n   </em>\n   the minute or so necessary to put on glasses, earplugs, and respirators, than there is to\n   <em>\n    regard\n   </em>\n   the minute or so necessary to put on a snood. If the statute in question requires courts to select among trifles,\n   <em>\n    de minimis non curat lex\n   </em>\n   is not Latin for\n   <em>\n    close enough for government work.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   That said, we nonetheless agree with the basic perception of the Courts of Appeals that it is most unlikely Congress meant \u00a7 203(\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   ) to convert federal judges into time-study professionals. That is especially so since the consequence of dispensing with the intricate exercise of separating the minutes spent clothes-changing and washing from the minutes devoted to other activities is not to prevent compensation for the uncovered segments, but merely to\n   leave the issue of compensation to the process of collective bargaining. We think it is possible to give the text of \u00a7 203(\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   ) a meaning that avoids such relatively inconsequential judicial involvement in \"a morass of difficult, fact-specific determinations,\"\n   <em>\n    Sepulveda,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3507057\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/591/209/#p216\">\n    591 F.3d, at 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The forerunner of \u00a7 203(\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   )-the Portal-to-Portal Act provision whose interpretation by the Labor Department prompted its enactment-focused narrowly on the activities involved: \"activities which are preliminary to or postliminary to [the employee's] principal activity or activities.\" \u00a7 254(a)(2). Section 203(\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   ), by contrast, is addressed not to certain \"activities,\" but to \"time spent\" on certain activities, viz., \"changing clothes or washing.\" Just as one can speak of \"spending the day skiing\" even when less-than-negligible portions of the day are spent having lunch or drinking hot toddies, so also one can speak of \"time spent changing clothes and washing\" when the vast preponderance of the period in question is devoted to those activities. To be sure, such an imprecise and colloquial usage will not ordinarily be attributed to a statutory text, but for the reasons we have discussed we think that appropriate here. The question for courts is whether the period at issue can,\n   <em>\n    on the whole,\n   </em>\n   be fairly characterized as \"time spent in changing clothes or washing.\" If an employee devotes the vast majority of the time in question to putting on and off equipment or other non-clothes items (perhaps a diver's suit and tank) the entire period would not qualify as \"time spent in changing clothes\" under \u00a7 203(\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   ), even if some clothes items were donned and doffed as well. But if the vast majority of the time is spent in donning and doffing \"clothes\" as we have defined that term, the entire period qualifies, and the time spent putting on and off other items need not be subtracted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In the present case, the District Court stated that \"the time expended by each employee donning and doffing\" safety glasses and earplugs \"is minimal,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%203430222\">\n    2009 WL 3430222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *6, a conclusion with which the Seventh Circuit agreed,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3873858\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/678/590/\">\n    678 F.3d, at 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
