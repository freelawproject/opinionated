His counsel was ready; the State was not. When the court swore in the jury and invited the State to present its first witness, the State declined to present any evidence. So Martinez moved for a directed not-guilty verdict, and the court granted it. The State appealed, arguing that the trial court should have granted its motion for a continuance. The question is whether the Double Jeopardy Clause bars the State's attempt to appeal in the hope of subjecting Martinez to a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The Illinois Supreme Court manifestly erred in allowing the State's appeal, on the theory that jeopardy never attached because Martinez \"was never at risk of conviction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20IL%20113475\">\n    2013 IL 113475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 39,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=371%20Ill.%20Dec.%20315\">\n    371 Ill.Dec. 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20N.E.2d%20215\">\n    990 N.E.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 224.

There is simply no doubt that Martinez was subjected to jeopardy. And because the trial court found the State's evidence insufficient to sustain a conviction, there is equally no doubt that Martinez may not be retried.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We therefore grant Martinez's petition for certiorari and reverse the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The State of Illinois indicted Martinez in August 2006 on charges of aggravated battery and mob action against Avery Binion and Demarco Scott. But Martinez's trial date did not arrive for nearly four years.\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn0\" id=\"fr0\" name=\"fr0\">\n     1\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The story picks up for present purposes on July 20, 2009, when the State moved to continue an August 3 trial date because it had not located the complaining witnesses, Binion and Scott. The State subpoenaed both men four days later, and the court rescheduled Martinez's trial to September 28. But the State sought another continuance, shortly before that date, because it still had not found Binion and Scott. The court rescheduled the trial to November 9, and the State reissued subpoenas. But November 9 came and went (the court continued the case when Martinez showed up late) and the trial was eventually delayed to the following March 29. In early February, the State yet again subpoenaed Binion and Scott. When March 29 arrived, the trial court granted the State another continuance. It reset the trial date for May 17 and ordered Binion and Scott to appear in court on May 10. And the State once more issued subpoenas.\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fr1\" name=\"fr1\">\n     2\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On the morning of May 17, however, Binion and Scott were again nowhere to be found. At 8:30, when the trial was set to begin, the State asked for a brief continuance. The court offered to delay swearing the jurors until a complete jury had been empaneled and told the State that it could at that point either have the jury sworn or move to dismiss its case. When Binion and Scott still had not shown up after the jury was chosen, the court offered to call the other cases on its docket so as to delay swearing the jury a bit longer. But when all these delays had run out, Binion and Scott were still nowhere in sight. The State filed a written motion for a continuance, arguing that it was \"unable to proceed\" without Binion and Scott. Tr. 7. The court denied that motion:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"The case before the Court began on July 7, 2006. In two months we will then be embarking upon half a decade of pending a Class 3 felony.

But when the State made clear that Binion and Scott's \"whereabouts\" remained \"unknown,\" the court concluded that the delay \"would be a further waste of time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 10. The following colloquy ensued:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"THE COURT: ....

After instructing the jury, the court directed the State to proceed with its opening statement. The prosecutor demurred: \"Your Honor, respectfully, the State is not participating in this case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 20. After the defense waived its opening statement, the court directed the State to call its first witness. Again, the prosecutor demurred: \"Respectfully, your Honor, the State is not participating in this matter.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   The defense then moved for a judgment of acquittal:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: Judge, the jury has been sworn.

See 6 LaFave \u00a7 25.1(g) (surveying circumstances in which retrial is and is not allowed). Here, there is no doubt that Martinez's jeopardy ended in a manner that bars his retrial: The trial court acquitted him of the charged offenses. \"Perhaps the most fundamental rule in the history of double jeopardy jurisprudence has been that '[a] verdict of acquittal ... could not be reviewed ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   without putting [a defendant] twice in jeopardy, and thereby violating the Constitution.' \"\n   <em>\n    Martin Linen,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12126181\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/564/#p569\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12126181\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/564/#p569\">\n    at 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12126181\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/564/#p569\">\n    97 S.Ct. 1349\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \"[O]ur cases have defined an acquittal to encompass any ruling that the prosecution's proof is insufficient to establish criminal liability for an offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Evans v.

And the trial court clearly made such a ruling here. After the State declined to present evidence against Martinez, his counsel moved for \"directed findings of not guilty to both counts,\" and the court \"grant[ed] the motion for a directed finding.\" Tr. 21. That is a textbook acquittal: a finding that the State's evidence cannot support a conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Illinois Supreme Court thought otherwise.

It had previously granted the State a number of continuances for the same purpose. See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 2072. And, critically, the court told the State on the day of trial that it could \"move to dismiss\n   [its] case\" before the jury was sworn. Tr. 3. Had the State accepted that invitation, the Double Jeopardy Clause would not have barred it from recharging Martinez. Instead, the State participated in the selection of jurors and did not ask for dismissal before the jury was sworn.
