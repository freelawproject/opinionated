(Hartford) is the administrator of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.'s (Wal-Mart) Group Long Term Disability Plan (Plan), an employee benefit plan covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The Plan's insurance policy requires any suit to recover benefits pursuant to the judicial review provision in ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B),\n  <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n   29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (a)(1)(B), to be filed within three years after \"proof of loss\" is due. Petitioner Heimeshoff filed a claim for long-term disability benefits with Hartford. After petitioner exhausted the mandatory administrative review process, Hartford issued its final denial. Almost three years after that final denial but more than three years after proof of loss was due, Heimeshoff filed a claim for judicial review pursuant to ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B). Hartford and Wal-Mart moved to dismiss on the ground that the claim was untimely. The District Court granted the motion, recognizing that while ERISA does not provide a statute of limitations, the contractual 3-year limitations period was enforceable under applicable State law and Circuit precedent. The Second Circuit affirmed.\n </history>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Held\n   </em>\n   : The Plan's limitations provision is enforceable. Pp. 609 - 616.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   (a) The courts of appeals require participants in an employee benefit plan covered by ERISA to exhaust the plan's administrative remedies before filing suit to recover benefits. A plan participant's cause of action under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) therefore does not accrue until the plan issues a final denial. But it does not follow that a plan and its participants cannot agree to commence the limitations period before that time. Pp. 609 - 612.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   (1) The rule set forth in\n   <em>\n    Order of United Commercial Travelers of America v. Wolfe,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6158463\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/331/586/#p608\">\n    331 U.S. 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 608,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6158463\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/331/586/#p608\">\n    67 S.Ct. 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6158463\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/331/586/#p608\">\n    91 L.Ed. 1687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , provides that a contractual limitations provision is enforceable so long as the limitations period is of reasonable length and there is no controlling statute to the contrary. That is the appropriate framework for determining the enforceability of the Plan's limitations provision. The\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   approach necessarily allows parties to agree both to the length of a limitations period and to its commencement. Pp. 610 - 612.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   (2) The principle that contractual limitations provisions should ordinarily be enforced as written is especially appropriate in the context of an ERISA plan. Heimeshoff's cause of action is bound up with the written terms of the Plan, and ERISA authorizes a participant to bring suit \"to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan.\" \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). This Court has thus recognized the particular importance\n   of enforcing plan terms as written in \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) claims, see,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CIGNA Corp. v. Amara,\n   </em>\n   563 U.S. ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12458996,5957262\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/1866/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12458996,5957262\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/1866/\">\n    179 L.Ed.2d 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and will not presume from statutory silence that Congress intended a different approach here. Pp. 611 - 612.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   (b) Unless the limitations period is unreasonably short or there is a \"controlling statute to the contrary,\"\n   <em>\n    Wolfe,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6158463\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/331/586/#p608\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6158463\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/331/586/#p608\">\n    at 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6158463\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/331/586/#p608\">\n    67 S.Ct. 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Plan's limitations provision must be given effect. Pp. 612 - 616.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (1) The Plan's period is not unreasonably short. Applicable regulations mean for mainstream claims to be resolved by plans in about one year. Here, the Plan's administrative review process (\"internal review\") required more time than usual but still left Heimeshoff with approximately one year to file suit. Her reliance on\n   <em>\n    Occidental Life Ins. Co. of Cal. v. EEOC,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179538\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/432/355/\">\n    432 U.S. 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179538\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/432/355/\">\n    97 S.Ct. 2447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179538\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/432/355/\">\n    53 L.Ed.2d 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which this Court declined to enforce a 12-month statute of limitations applied to Title VII employment discrimination actions where the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission faced an 18- to 24-month backlog, is unavailing in the absence of any evidence that similar obstacles exist to bringing a timely ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) claim. Pp. 612 - 613.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (2) This Court rejects the contentions of Heimeshoff and the United States that the limitations provision is unenforceable because it will undermine ERISA's two-tiered remedial scheme. Pp. 613 - 616.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (i) Enforcement of the Plan's limitation provision is unlikely to cause participants to shortchange the internal review process. The record for judicial review generally has been limited to the administrative record, so participants who fail to develop evidence during internal review risk forfeiting the use of that evidence in district court. In addition, many plans vest discretion over benefits determinations in the plan administrator, and courts ordinarily review such determinations only for abuse of discretion. Pp. 613 - 614.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (ii) It is also unlikely that enforcing limitations periods that begin to run before the internal review process is exhausted will endanger judicial review. To the extent that administrators attempt to prevent judicial review by delaying the resolution of claims in bad faith, the penalty for failure to meet the regulatory deadlines is immediate access to judicial review for the participant. Evidence from forty years of ERISA administration of this common contractual provision suggests that the good-faith administration of internal review will not diminish the availability of judicial review either. Heimeshoff identifies only a handful of cases in which ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) plaintiffs have been time barred as a result of the 3-year limitations provision, and these cases suggest that the bar falls on participants who have not diligently pursued their rights. Moreover, courts are well equipped to apply traditional doctrines, such as waiver or estoppel, see,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thompson v. Phenix Ins. Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217863\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/136/287/#p298\">\n    136 U.S. 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 298-299,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217863\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/136/287/#p298\">\n    10 S.Ct. 1019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217863\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/136/287/#p298\">\n    34 L.Ed. 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and equitable tolling, see,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Irwin v.

Finally, plans offering appeals or dispute resolution beyond what is contemplated in the internal review regulations must agree to toll the limitations provision during that time.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202560.503-1\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(ii). Pp. 614 - 616.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (3) Heimeshoff's additional arguments are unpersuasive. The limitations period need not be tolled as a matter of course during internal review because that would be inconsistent with the text of the limitations provision, which is enforceable. And\n   federal courts need not inquire whether state law would toll the limitations period during internal review because the limitations period is set by contract, not borrowed from state law.

Courts have generally required participants to exhaust the plan's administrative remedies before filing suit to recover benefits. ERISA does not, however, specify a statute of limitations for filing suit under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B). Filling that gap, the plan at issue here requires participants to bring suit within three years after \"proof of loss\" is due. Because proof of loss is due before a plan's administrative process can be completed, the administrative exhaustion requirement will, in practice, shorten the contractual limitations period. The question presented is whether the contractual limitations provision is enforceable. We hold that it is.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    <strong>\n     I\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    In 2005, petitioner Julie Heimeshoff began to report chronic pain and fatigue that interfered with her duties as a senior public relations manager for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Her physician later diagnosed her with lupus and fibromyalgia. Heimeshoff stopped working on June 8.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    On August 22, 2005, Heimeshoff filed a claim for long-term disability benefits with Hartford Life &amp; Accident Insurance Co., the administrator of Wal-Mart's Group Long Term Disability Plan (Plan). Her claim form, supported by a statement from her rheumatologist, listed her symptoms as \" 'extreme fatigue, significant pain, and difficulty in concentration.' \"\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fr1\" name=\"fr1\">\n      1\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    App. to Pet. for Cert. 7. In November 2005, Hartford notified Heimeshoff that it could not determine whether she was disabled because her rheumatologist had never responded\n    to Hartford's request for additional information. Hartford denied the claim the following month for failure to provide satisfactory proof of loss. Hartford instructed Heimeshoff that it would consider an appeal filed within 180 days, but later informed her that it would reopen her claim, without the need for an appeal, if her rheumatologist provided the requested information.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    In July 2006, another physician evaluated Heimeshoff and concluded that she was disabled. Heimeshoff submitted that evaluation and additional medical evidence in October 2006. Hartford then retained a physician to review Heimeshoff's records and speak with her rheumatologist. That physician issued a report in November 2006 concluding that Heimeshoff was able to perform the activities required by her sedentary occupation. Hartford denied Heimeshoff's claim later that November.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    In May 2007, Heimeshoff requested an extension of the Plan's appeal deadline until September 30, 2007, in order to provide additional evidence. Hartford granted the extension. On September 26, 2007, Heimeshoff submitted her appeal along with additional cardiopulmonary and neuropsychological evaluations. After two additional physicians retained by Hartford reviewed the claim, Hartford issued its final denial on November 26, 2007.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    On November 18, 2010, almost three years later (but more than three years after proof of loss was due), Heimeshoff filed suit in District Court seeking review of her denied claim pursuant to ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B). Hartford and Wal-Mart moved to dismiss on the ground that Heimeshoff's complaint was barred by the Plan's limitations provision, which stated: \"Legal action cannot be taken against The Hartford ... [more than] 3 years after the time written proof of loss is required to be furnished according to the terms of the policy.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n      Id\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     ., at 10\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    The District Court granted the motion to dismiss. Recognizing that ERISA does not provide a statute of limitations for actions under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B), the court explained that the limitations period provided by the most nearly analogous state statute applies. See\n    <em>\n     North Star Steel Co. v.

Upon exhaustion of the internal review process, the participant is entitled to proceed immediately to judicial review, the second tier of ERISA's remedial scheme.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    <strong>\n     2\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Heimeshoff and the United States first claim that the Plan's limitations provision will undermine the foregoing internal review process. They contend that participants will shortchange their own rights during that process in order to have more time in which to seek judicial review. Their premise-that participants will sacrifice\n    the benefits of internal review to preserve additional time for filing suit-is highly dubious in light of the consequences of that course of action.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    First, to the extent participants fail to develop evidence during internal review, they risk forfeiting the use of that evidence in district court. The Courts of Appeals have generally limited the record for judicial review to the administrative record compiled during internal review. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Foster v. PPG Industries, Inc.,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3518568\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/693/1226/#p1231\">\n     693 F.3d 1226\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1231 (C.A.10 2012);\n    <em>\n     Fleisher v.

Second, participants are not likely to value judicial review of plan determinations over internal review. Many plans (including this Plan) vest discretion over benefits determinations in plan administrators. See\n    <em>\n     Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v.

In short, participants have much to lose and little to gain by giving up the full measure of internal review in favor of marginal extra time to seek judicial review.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    <strong>\n     3\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Heimeshoff and the United States next warn that it will endanger judicial review to allow plans to set limitations periods that begin to run before internal review is complete. The United States suggests that administrators may attempt to prevent judicial review by delaying the resolution of claims in bad faith. Brief for United States as\n    <em>\n     Amicus Curiae\n    </em>\n    19; see also\n    <em>\n     White,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2914729\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/488/240/#p245\">\n     488 F.3d, at 247-248\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . But administrators are required by the regulations governing the internal review process to take prompt action, see\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 10-11, and the penalty for failure to meet those deadlines is immediate access to judicial review for the participant.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202560.503-1\">\n     29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\n    <em>\n     l\n    </em>\n    ). In addition, that sort of dilatory behavior may implicate one of the traditional defenses to a statute of limitations. See\n    <em>\n     infra,\n    </em>\n    at 14-15.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The United States suggests that even good-faith administration of internal review will significantly diminish the availability of judicial review if this limitations provision is enforced. Forty years of ERISA administration suggest otherwise. The limitations provision at issue is quite common; the vast majority of States require certain insurance policies to include 3-year limitations periods that run from the date proof of loss is due.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fr5\" name=\"fr5\">\n      5\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    But there is\n    no significant evidence that limitations provisions like the one here have similarly thwarted judicial review. As explained above, see\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 10-11, ERISA regulations structure internal review to proceed in an expeditious manner. It stands to reason that the cases in which internal review leaves participants with less than one year to file suit are rare. Heimeshoff identifies only a handful of cases in which \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) plaintiffs are actually time barred as a result of this 3-year limitations provision. See\n    <em>\n     Abena v.

First, Heimeshoff argues-for the first time in this litigation-that the limitations period should be tolled as a matter of course during internal review. By effectively delaying the commencement of the limitations period until the conclusion of internal review, however, this approach reconstitutes the contractual revision we declined to make. As we explained, the parties' agreement should be enforced unless the limitations period is unreasonably short or foreclosed by ERISA. The limitations period here is neither. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 612 - 613, 613 - 615, and this page.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Nor do the ERISA regulations require tolling during internal review. A plan must agree to toll the limitations provision only in one particular circumstance: when a plan offers voluntary internal appeals beyond what is permitted by regulation. \u00a7 2560.503-1(c)(3)(ii). Even then, the limitations period is tolled only during that specific portion of internal review. This limited tolling requirement would be superfluous if the regulations contemplated tolling throughout the process.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Finally, relying on our decision in\n    <em>\n     Hardin v.
