The Act provides both equitable and legal remedies for infringement: an injunction \"on such terms as [a court] may deem reasonable to prevent or restrain infringement of a copyright,\" \u00a7 502(a); and, at the copyright owner's election, either (1) the \"owner's actual damages and any additional profits of the infringer,\" \u00a7 504(a)(1), which petitioner seeks in this case, or (2) specified statutory damages, \u00a7 504(c). The Act's statute of limitations provides: \"No civil action shall be maintained under the [Act] unless it is commenced within three years after the claim accrued.\" \u00a7 507(b). A claim ordinarily accrues when an infringing act occurs. Under the separate-accrual rule that attends the copyright statute of limitations, when a defendant has committed successive violations, each infringing act starts a new limitations period. However, under \u00a7 507(b), each infringement is actionable only within three years of its occurrence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Here, the allegedly infringing work is the motion picture Raging Bull, based on the life of boxing champion Jake LaMotta, who, with Frank Petrella, told his story in,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   a screenplay copyrighted in 1963. In 1976, the pair assigned their rights and renewal rights, which were later acquired by respondent United Artists Corporation, a subsidiary of respondent Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. (collectively, MGM). In 1980, MGM released, and registered a copyright in, the film Raging Bull, and it continues to market the film today. Frank Petrella died during the initial copyright term, so renewal rights reverted to his heirs. Plaintiff below, petitioner here, Paula Petrella (Petrella), his daughter, renewed the 1963 copyright in 1991, becoming its sole owner. Seven\n   years later, she advised MGM that its exploitation of Raging Bull violated her copyright and threatened suit. Some nine years later, on January 6, 2009, she filed an infringement suit, seeking monetary and injunctive relief limited to acts of infringement occurring on or after January 6, 2006. Invoking the equitable doctrine of laches, MGM moved for summary judgment. Petrella's 18-year delay in filing suit, MGM argued, was unreasonable and prejudicial to MGM. The District Court granted MGM's motion, holding that laches barred Petrella's complaint. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em>\n    Held\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   1. Laches cannot be invoked as a bar to Petrella's pursuit of a claim for damages brought within \u00a7 507(b)'s three-year window. Pp. 1972 - 1977.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   (a) By permitting a successful plaintiff to gain retrospective relief only three years back from the time of suit, the copyright statute of limitations itself takes account of delay. Brought to bear here, \u00a7 507(b) directs that Petrella cannot reach MGM's returns on its investment in Raging Bull in years before 2006. Moreover, if infringement within the three-year window is shown, a defendant may offset against profits made in that period expenses incurred in generating those profits. See \u00a7 504(b). In addition, a defendant may retain the return on investment shown to be attributable to its own enterprise, as distinct from the value created by the infringed work.

See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holmberg v. Armbrecht,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"413909\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/327/392/#p395\">\n    327 U.S. 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 395, 396,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"413909\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/327/392/#p395\">\n    66 S.Ct. 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"413909\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/327/392/#p395\">\n    90 L.Ed. 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Pp. 1972 - 1974.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   (b) MGM's principal arguments regarding the contemporary scope of the laches defense are unavailing. Pp. 1974 - 1977.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (1) MGM urges that, because laches is listed in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(c) as an affirmative defense discrete from a statute of limitations defense, the plea should be \"available ... in every civil action\" to bar all forms of relief. Such an expansive role careens away from understandings, past and present, of the essentially gap-filling, not legislation-overriding, office of laches. This Court has never applied laches to bar in their entirety claims for discrete wrongs occurring within a federally prescribed limitations period. Inviting individual judges to set a time limit other than the one Congress prescribed would tug against the uniformity Congress sought to achieve in enacting \u00a7 507(b). Pp. 1974 - 1975.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (2) MGM contends that laches, like equitable tolling, should be \"read into every federal statute of limitation,\"\n   <em>\n    Holmberg,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"413909\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/327/392/#p395\">\n    327 U.S., at 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"413909\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/327/392/#p395\">\n    66 S.Ct. 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, tolling lengthens the time for commencing a civil action where there is a statute of limitations and is, in effect, a rule of interpretation tied to that statutory limit. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Young v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"352189\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/43/#p49\">\n    535 U.S. 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 49-50,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9395201,352189\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/122/1036/\">\n    122 S.Ct. 1036\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"352189\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/43/#p49\">\n    152 L.Ed.2d 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, laches, which originally served as a guide when no statute of limitations controlled, can scarcely be described as a rule for interpreting a statutory prescription. Pp. 1975 - 1976.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (3) MGM insists that the laches defense must be available to prevent a copyright owner from sitting still, doing nothing, waiting to see what the outcome of an alleged infringer's investment will be. It is hardly incumbent on copyright owners, however, to challenge each and every actionable infringement. And there is nothing untoward about waiting to see whether an infringer's exploitation undercuts the\n   value of the copyrighted work, has no effect on that work, or even complements it. Section 507(b)'s limitations period, coupled to the separate-accrual rule, allows a copyright owner to defer suit until she can estimate whether litigation is worth the candle. Pp. 1975 - 1976.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (4) MGM is concerned that evidence needed or useful to defend against liability will be lost during a copyright owner's inaction. But Congress must have been aware that the passage of time and the author's death could cause evidentiary issues when it provided for reversionary renewal rights that an author's heirs can exercise long after a work was written and copyrighted. Moreover, because a copyright plaintiff bears the burden of proving infringement, any hindrance caused by evidence unavailability is as likely to affect plaintiffs as defendants. The need for extrinsic evidence is also reduced by the registration mechanism, under which both the certificate and the original work must be on file with the Copyright Office before a copyright owner can sue for infringement. Pp. 1976 - 1977.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (5) Finally, when a copyright owner engages in intentionally misleading representations concerning his abstention from suit, and the alleged infringer detrimentally relies on such deception, the doctrine of estoppel may bar the copyright owner's claims completely, eliminating all potential remedies. The gravamen of estoppel, a defense long recognized as available in actions at law, is wrongdoing, overt misleading, and consequent loss. Estoppel does not undermine the statute of limitations, for it rests on misleading, whether engaged in early on, or later in time. P. 1977.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   2. While laches cannot be invoked to preclude adjudication of a claim for damages brought within the Act's three-year window, in extraordinary circumstances, laches may, at the very outset of the litigation, curtail the relief equitably awarded. For example, where owners of a copyrighted architectural design, although aware of an allegedly infringing housing project, delayed suit until the project was substantially constructed and partially occupied, an order mandating destruction of the project would not be tolerable. See\n   <em>\n    Chirco v. Crosswinds Communities, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5713242\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/474/227/#p236\">\n    474 F.3d 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 236. Nor, in the face of an unexplained delay in commencing suit, would it be equitable to order \"total destruction\" of a book already printed, packed, and shipped. See\n   <em>\n    New Era Publications Int'l v. Henry Holt &amp; Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10532799\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/873/576/#p584\">\n    873 F.2d 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 584-585. No such extraordinary circumstance is present here. Petrella notified MGM of her copyright claims\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   MGM invested millions of dollars in creating a new edition of Raging Bull, and the equitable relief she seeks-\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   disgorgement of unjust gains and an injunction against future infringement-would not result in anything like \"total destruction\" of the film. Allowing Petrella's suit to go forward will put at risk only a fraction of the income MGM has earned during the more than three decades Raging Bull has been marketed and will work no unjust hardship on innocent third parties. Should Petrella ultimately prevail on the merits, the District Court, in determining appropriate injunctive relief and assessing profits, may take account of Petrella's delay in commencing suit. In doing so, however, the court must closely examine MGM's alleged reliance on Petrella's delay, taking account of MGM's early knowledge of her claims, the protection MGM might have achieved through a declaratory judgment action, the extent to which MGM's investment was protected by the separate-accrual rule, the court's authority to order injunctive relief \"on such terms as it may deem reasonable,\" \u00a7 502(a), and any other relevant considerations.

This case presents the question whether the equitable defense of laches (unreasonable, prejudicial delay in commencing suit) may bar relief on a copyright infringement claim brought within \u00a7 507(b)'s three-year limitations period. Section 507(b), it is undisputed, bars relief of any kind for conduct occurring prior to the three-year limitations period. To the extent that an infringement suit seeks relief solely for conduct occurring within the limitations period, however, courts are not at liberty to jettison Congress' judgment on the timeliness of suit. Laches, we hold, cannot be invoked to preclude adjudication of a claim for damages brought within the three-year window. As to equitable relief, in extraordinary circumstances, laches may bar at the very threshold the particular relief requested by the plaintiff. And a plaintiff's delay can always be brought to bear at the remedial stage, in determining appropriate injunctive relief, and in assessing the \"profits of the infringer ... attributable to the infringement.\" \u00a7 504(b).\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fr1\" name=\"fr1\">\n      1\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Petitioner Paula Petrella, in her suit for copyright infringement, sought no relief for conduct occurring outside \u00a7 507(b)'s three-year limitations period. Nevertheless, the courts below held that laches barred her suit in its entirety, without regard to the currency of the conduct of which Petrella complains. That position,\n    we hold, is contrary to \u00a7 507(b) and this Court's precedent on the province of laches.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    <strong>\n     I\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    The Copyright Act (Act),\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    <em>\n     et seq.,\n    </em>\n    grants copyright protection to original works of authorship. \u00a7 102(a).

For works copyrighted under the pre-1978 regime in which an initial period of protection may be followed by a renewal period, Congress provided that the author's heirs inherit the renewal rights.

A court may issue an injunction \"on such terms as it may deem reasonable to prevent or restrain infringement of a copyright.\" \u00a7 502(a).

Until 1957, federal copyright law did not include a statute of limitations for civil suits. Federal courts therefore used analogous state statutes of limitations to determine the timeliness of infringement claims. See S.Rep. No. 1014, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1957) (hereinafter Senate Report). And they sometimes invoked laches to abridge the state-law prescription.

After retiring from the ring, LaMotta worked with his longtime friend, Frank Petrella, to tell the story of the boxer's career. Their venture resulted in three copyrighted works: two screenplays, one registered in 1963, the other in 1973, and a book, registered in 1970. This case centers on the screenplay registered in 1963. The registration identified Frank Petrella as sole author, but also stated that the screenplay was written \"in collaboration with\" LaMotta. App. 164.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    In 1976, Frank Petrella and LaMotta assigned their rights in the three works, including renewal rights, to Chartoff-Winkler Productions, Inc. Two years later, respondent United Artists Corporation, a subsidiary of respondent Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. (collectively, MGM), acquired the motion picture rights to the book and both screenplays, rights stated by the parties to be \"exclusiv[e] and forever, including all periods of copyright and renewals and extensions thereof.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 49. In 1980, MGM released, and registered a copyright in, the film Raging Bull, directed\n    by Martin Scorcese and starring Robert De Niro, who won a Best Actor Academy Award for his portrayal of LaMotta. MGM continues to market the film, and has converted it into formats unimagined in 1980, including DVD and Blu-ray.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Frank Petrella died in 1981, during the initial terms of the copyrights in the screenplays and book. As this Court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Stewart\n    </em>\n    confirmed, Frank Petrella's renewal rights reverted to his heirs, who could renew the copyrights unburdened by any assignment previously made by the author.

Learning of this Court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Stewart,\n    </em>\n    Petrella engaged an attorney who, in 1991, renewed the copyright in the 1963 screenplay. Because the copyrights in the 1973 screenplay and the 1970 book were not timely renewed, the infringement claims in this case rest exclusively on the screenplay registered in 1963. Petrella is now sole owner of the copyright in that work.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fr8\" name=\"fr8\">\n      8\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    In 1998, seven years after filing for renewal of the copyright in the 1963 screenplay, Petrella's attorney informed MGM that Petrella had obtained the copyright to that screenplay. Exploitation of any derivative work, including Raging Bull, the attorney asserted, infringed on the copyright now vested in Petrella. During the next two years, counsel for Petrella and MGM exchanged letters in which MGM denied the validity of the infringement claims, and Petrella repeatedly threatened to take legal action.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    <strong>\n     B\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Some nine years later, on January 6, 2009, Petrella filed a copyright infringement suit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. She alleged that MGM violated and continued to violate her copyright in the 1963 screenplay by using, producing, and distributing Raging Bull, a work she described as derivative of the 1963 screenplay. Petrella's complaint sought monetary and injunctive relief. Because the statute of limitations for copyright claims requires commencement of suit \"within three years after the claim accrued,\" \u00a7 507(b), Petrella sought relief only for acts of infringement occurring on or after January 6, 2006. No relief, she recognizes, can be awarded for infringing acts prior to that date.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    MGM moved for summary judgment on several grounds, among them, the equitable doctrine of laches. Petrella's 18-year delay, from the 1991 renewal of the copyright on which she relied, until 2009, when she commenced suit, MGM maintained, was unreasonable and prejudicial to MGM. See Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment in No. CV 09-0072 (CD Cal.).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    The District Court granted MGM's motion. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a-48a. As to the merits of the infringement claims, the court found, disputed issues of material fact precluded summary adjudication. See\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6164284\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/362/373/\">\n      id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 34a-42a. Even so, the court held, laches barred Petrella's complaint.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6164284\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/362/373/\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 42a-48a. Petrella had unreasonably delayed suit by not filing until 2009, the court concluded, and further determined\n    that MGM was prejudiced by the delay.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6164284\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/362/373/\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 42a-46a. In particular, the court stated, MGM had shown \"expectations-based prejudice,\" because the company had \"made significant investments in exploiting the film\"; in addition, the court accepted that MGM would encounter \"evidentiary prejudice,\" because Frank Petrella had died and LaMotta, then aged 88, appeared to have sustained a loss of memory.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6164284\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/362/373/\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 44a-46a.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fr9\" name=\"fr9\">\n      9\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the laches-based dismissal.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3527361\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/695/946/\">\n     695 F.3d 946\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2012).

The Ninth Circuit erred, we hold, in failing to recognize that the copyright statute of limitations, \u00a7 507(b), itself takes account of delay. As earlier observed, see\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1969 - 1970, a successful plaintiff can gain retrospective relief only three years back from the time of suit. No recovery may be had for infringement in earlier years. Profits made in those years remain the defendant's to keep. Brought to bear here, \u00a7 507(b) directs that MGM's returns on its investment in Raging Bull in years outside the three-year window (years before 2006) cannot be reached by Petrella. Only by disregarding that feature of the statute, and the separate-accrual rule attending \u00a7 507(b), see\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1968 - 1970, could the Court of Appeals presume that infringing acts occurring before January 6, 2006 bar all relief, monetary and injunctive, for infringement occurring on and after that date.

In addition, the defendant may prove and offset \"elements of profit attributable to factors other than the copyrighted work.\" \u00a7 504(b). The defendant thus may retain the return on investment shown to be attributable to its own enterprise, as distinct from the value created by the infringed work. See\n    <em>\n     Sheldon v.

That is so here, because the statute, \u00a7 507(b), makes the starting trigger an infringing act committed three years back from the commencement of suit, while laches, as conceived by the Ninth Circuit and advanced by MGM, makes the presumptive trigger the defendant's\n    <em>\n     initial\n    </em>\n    infringing act.

See Brief for Respondents 48. In this case, MGM stresses, \"[Petrella]\n    <em>\n     conceded\n    </em>\n    that she waited to file because 'the film was deeply in debt and in the red and would probably never recoup.' \"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    ., at 47 (quoting from App. 110).

And there is nothing untoward about waiting to see whether an infringer's exploitation undercuts the value of the copyrighted work, has no effect on the original work, or even complements it. Fan sites prompted by a book or film, for example, may benefit the copyright owner. See Wu, Tolerated Use,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20Colum.%20J.L.%20%26%20Arts%20617\">\n     31 Colum.

Even if an infringement is harmful, the harm may be too small to justify the cost of litigation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    If the rule were, as MGM urges, \"sue soon, or forever hold your peace,\" copyright owners would have to mount a federal case fast to stop seemingly innocuous infringements, lest those infringements eventually grow in magnitude. Section 507(b)'s three-year limitations period, however, coupled to the separate-accrual rule, see\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1968 - 1970, avoids such litigation profusion. It allows a copyright owner to defer suit until she can estimate whether litigation is worth the candle. She will miss out on damages for periods prior to the three-year look-back, but her right to prospective injunctive relief should, in most cases, remain unaltered.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fr19\" name=\"fr19\">\n      19\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    <strong>\n     D\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    MGM points to the danger that evidence needed or useful to defend against liability will be lost during a copyright owner's inaction.

See,\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1967 - 1968. At that time, the author, and perhaps other witnesses to the creation of the work, will be dead. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1970. Congress must have been aware that the passage of time and the author's death could cause a loss or dilution of evidence. Congress chose, nonetheless, to give the author's family \"a second chance to obtain fair remuneration.\"\n    <em>\n     Stewart,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633900\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/207/#p221\">\n     495 U.S., at 220\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633900\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/207/#p221\">\n     110 S.Ct. 1750\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Moreover, a copyright plaintiff bears the burden of proving infringement. See 3 W. Patry, Copyright \u00a7 9.4, p. 9-18 (2013) (hereinafter Patry) (\"As in other civil litigation, a copyright owner bears the burden of establishing a prima facie case.\"). But cf.\n    <em>\n     post,\n    </em>\n    at 1981 (overlooking plaintiff's burden to show infringement and the absence of any burden upon the defendant \"to prove that it did not infringe\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    ). Any hindrance caused by the unavailability of evidence, therefore, is at least as likely to affect plaintiffs as it is to disadvantage defendants. That is so in cases of the kind Petrella is pursuing, for a deceased author most probably would have supported his heir's claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The registration mechanism, we further note, reduces the need for extrinsic evidence. Although registration is \"permissive,\" both the certificate and the original work must be on file with the Copyright Office before a copyright owner can sue for infringement. \u00a7\u00a7 408(b), 411(a). Key evidence in the litigation, then, will be the certificate, the original work, and the allegedly infringing work. And the adjudication will often turn on the factfinder's direct comparison of the original and the infringing works,\n    <em>\n     i.e.,\n    </em>\n    on the factfinder's \"good eyes and common sense\" in comparing the two works' \"total concept and overall feel.\"\n    <em>\n     Peter F.

See 6 Patry \u00a7 20:58, at 20-110 to 20-112.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fr21\" name=\"fr21\">\n      21\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    The test for estoppel is more exacting than the test for laches, and the two defenses are differently oriented.

Delay may be involved, but is not an element of the defense. For laches, timeliness is the essential element. In contrast to laches, urged by MGM entirely to override the statute of limitations Congress prescribed, estoppel does not undermine Congress' prescription, for it rests on misleading, whether engaged in early on, or later in time.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Stating that the Ninth Circuit \"ha[d] taken a wrong turn in its formulation and application of laches in copyright cases,\" Judge Fletcher called for fresh consideration of the issue.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3527361\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/695/946/\">\n     695 F.3d, at 959\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . \"A recognition of the distinction between ... estoppel and laches,\" he suggested, \"would be a good place to start.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3527361\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/695/946/\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    We agree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    <strong>\n     V\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The courts below summarily disposed of Petrella's case based on laches, preventing adjudication of any of her claims on the merits and foreclosing the possibility of any form of relief. That disposition, we have explained, was erroneous. Congress' time provisions secured to authors a copyright term of long duration, and a right to sue for infringement occurring no more than three years back from the time of suit. That regime leaves \"little place\" for a doctrine that would further limit the timeliness of a copyright owner's suit. See 1 Dobbs \u00a7 2.6(1), at 152.

That is because it is a rolling limitations period, which restarts upon each \"separate accrual\" of a claim. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1969; 6 W. Patry, Copyright \u00a7 20:23, pp. 20-44 to 20-46 (2013). If a defendant reproduces or sells an infringing work on a continuing basis, a plaintiff can sue every 3 years until the copyright term expires-which may be up to 70 years\n    after the author's death. \u00a7 302(a) (works created after January 1, 1978, are protected until 70 years after the author's death); \u00a7 304(a) (works created before January 1, 1978, are protected for 28 years plus a 67-year renewal period). If, for example, a work earns no money for 20 years, but then, after development expenses have been incurred, it earns profits for the next 30, a plaintiff can sue in year 21 and at regular 3-year intervals thereafter. Each time the plaintiff will collect the defendant's profits earned during the prior three years, unless he settles for a lump sum along the way. The defendant will recoup no more than his outlays and any \"elements of profit attributable to factors other than the copyrighted work.\" \u00a7\u00a7 504(a)(1), (b).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    A 20-year delay in bringing suit could easily prove inequitable. Suppose, for example, the plaintiff has deliberately waited for the death of witnesses who might prove the existence of understandings about a license to reproduce the copyrighted work, or who might show that the plaintiff's work was in fact derived from\n    <em>\n     older\n    </em>\n    copyrighted materials that the defendant has licensed. Or, suppose the plaintiff has delayed in bringing suit because he wants to avoid bargaining with the defendant up front over a license. He knows that if he delays legal action, and the defendant invests time, effort, and resources into making the derivative product, the plaintiff will be in a much stronger position to obtain favorable licensing terms through settlement. Or, suppose the plaintiff has waited until he becomes certain that the defendant's production bet paid off, that the derivative work did and would continue to earn money, and that the plaintiff has a chance of obtaining, say, an 80% share of what is now a 90% pure profit stream. (N.B. The plaintiff's profits recovery will be reduced by any \"deductible expenses\" incurred by the defendant in producing the work, and by any \"elements of profits attributable to factors other than the copyrighted work,\" \u00a7 504(b)). Or, suppose that all of these circumstances exist together.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Cases that present these kinds of delays are not imaginary.

The petitioner claims the MGM film Raging Bull violated a copyright originally owned by her father, which she inherited and then renewed in 1991. She waited 18 years after renewing the copyright, until 2009, to bring suit. During those 18 years, MGM spent millions of dollars developing different editions of, and marketing, the film. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a. MGM also entered into numerous licensing agreements, some of which allowed television networks to broadcast the film through 2015.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5713242\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/474/227/#p236\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 14a. Meanwhile, three key witness died or became unavailable, making it more difficult for MGM to prove that it did not infringe the petitioner's copyright (either because the 1963 screenplay was in fact derived from a different book, the rights to which MGM owned under a nonchallenged license, or because MGM held a license to the screenplay under a 1976 agreement that it signed with Jake LaMotta, who coauthored the screenplay with the petitioner's father, see\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5713242\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/474/227/#p236\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 3a, 5a; App. 128-129, 257-258, 266-267). Consequently, I believe the Court of Appeals acted lawfully in dismissing the suit due to laches.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Long delays do not automatically prove inequity, but, depending upon the circumstances, they raise that possibility. Indeed, suppose that that the copyright-holders in the song cases cited above, or their heirs, facing sudden revivals in demand or eventual deaths of witnesses, had brought their claims 50, or even 60 years after those claims first accrued. Or suppose that the loss of evidence was clearly critical to the defendants' abilities to prove their cases. The Court holds that insofar as a copyright claim seeks damages, a court cannot\n    <em>\n     ever\n    </em>\n    apply laches, irrespective of the length of the plaintiff's delay, the amount of the harm that it caused, or the inequity of permitting the action to go forward.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    <strong>\n     II\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Why should laches not be available in an appropriate case? Consider the reasons the majority offers. First, the majority says that the 3-year \"copyright statute of limitations ... itself takes account of delay,\" and so additional safeguards like laches are not needed.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1972. I agree that sometimes that is so. But I also fear that sometimes it is not. The majority correctly points out that the limitations period limits the retrospective relief a plaintiff can recover. It imposes a cap equal to the profits earned during the prior three years, in addition to any actual damages sustained during this time.\n    <em>\n     Ibid.\n    </em>\n    ; \u00a7 504(b). Thus, if the plaintiff waits from, say, 1980 until 2001 to bring suit, she cannot recover profits for the 1980 to 1998 period. But she can recover the defendant's profits from 1998 through 2001, which might be precisely when net revenues turned positive. And she can sue every three years thereafter until the copyright expires, perhaps in the year 2060. If the plaintiff's suit involves the type of inequitable circumstances I have described, her ability to recover profits from 1998 to 2001 and until the copyright expires could be just the kind of unfairness that laches is designed to prevent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Second, the majority points out that the plaintiff can recover only the defendant's profits less \" 'deductible expenses' incurred in generating those profits.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1973 (quoting \u00a7 504(b)). In other words, the majority takes assurance from the fact that the Act enables the defendant to recoup his outlays in developing or selling the allegedly infringing work. Again, sometimes that fact will prevent inequitable results. But sometimes it will not. A\n    plaintiff's delay may mean that the defendant has already recovered the majority of his expenses, and what is left is primarily profit. It may mean that the defendant has dedicated decades of his life to producing the work, such that the loss of a future profit stream (even if he can recover past expenses) is tantamount to the loss of any income in later years. And in circumstances such as those described, it could prove inequitable to give the profit to a plaintiff who has unnecessarily delayed in filing an action. Simply put, the \"deductible expenses\" provision does not protect the defendant from the potential inequity highlighted by Judge Hand nearly 100 years ago in his influential copyright opinion. That is, it does not stop a copyright-holder (or his heirs) from \"stand[ing] inactive while the proposed infringer spends large sums of money\" in a risky venture; appearing on the scene only when the venture has proved a success; and thereby collecting substantially more money than he could have obtained at the outset, had he bargained with the investor over a license and royalty fee.\n    <em>\n     Haas,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6739860\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f/234/105/#p107\">\n     234 F., at 108\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

But why does the majority believe that part of what Congress intended to \"achieve\" was the elimination of the equitable defense of laches? As the majority recognizes, Congress enacted a uniform statute of limitations for copyright claims in 1957 so that federal courts, in determining timeliness, no longer had to borrow from state law which varied from place to place. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1968 - 1969. Nothing in the 1957 Act-or anywhere else in the text of the copyright statute-indicates that Congress also sought to bar the operation of laches. The Copyright Act is silent on the subject. And silence is consistent, not inconsistent, with the application of equitable doctrines.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    For one thing, the legislative history for \u00a7 507 shows that Congress chose not to \"specifically enumerat[e] certain equitable considerations which might be advanced in connection with civil copyright actions\" because it understood that \" '[f]ederal district courts, generally, recognize these equitable defenses anyway.' \" S.Rep. No. 1014, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., 2-3 (1957) (quoting the House Judiciary Committee). Courts prior to 1957 had often applied laches in federal copyright cases.

Since 1938, Congress and the Federal Rules have replaced what would once have been actions \"at law\" and actions \"in equity\" with the \"civil action.\" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 2 (\"There is one form of action-the civil action\"). A federal civil action is subject to both equitable and legal defenses. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c)(1) (\"In responding to a pleading, a party must affirmatively state any avoidance or affirmative defense, including: ... estoppel ... laches ... [and] statute of limitations\"). Accordingly, since 1938, federal courts have frequently allowed defendants to assert what were formerly equitable defenses-including laches-in what were formerly legal actions. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1984 - 1985 (citing cases). Why should copyright be treated differently? Indeed, the majority concedes that \"restitutional remedies\" like \"profits\" (which are often claimed in copyright cases) defy clear classification as \"equitable\" or \"legal.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1967, n. 1 (internal quotation marks omitted). Why should lower courts have to make these uneasy and unnatural distinctions?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    Fifth, the majority believes it can prevent the inequities that laches seeks to avoid through the use of a different doctrine, namely equitable estoppel.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1977. I doubt that is so. As the majority recognizes, \"the two defenses are differently oriented.\"\n    <em>\n     Ibid.\n    </em>\n    The \"gravamen\" of estoppel is a misleading representation by the plaintiff that the defendant relies on to his detriment. 6 Patry, Copyright \u00a7 20:58, at 20-110 to 20-112. The gravamen of laches is the plaintiff's unreasonable delay, and the consequent prejudice to the defendant.\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 20:54, at 20-96. Where due to the passage of time, evidence favorable to the defense has disappeared or the defendant has continued to invest in a derivative work, what misleading representation by the plaintiff is there to estop?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    In sum, as the majority says, the doctrine of laches may occupy only a \" 'little place' \" in a regime based upon statutes of\n    limitations.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1977 (quoting 1 D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies \u00a7 2.6(1), p. 152 (2d ed. 1993)). But that place is an important one. In those few and unusual cases where a plaintiff unreasonably delays in bringing suit and consequently causes inequitable harm to the defendant, the doctrine permits a court to bring about a fair result. I see no reason to erase the doctrine from copyright's lexicon, not even in respect to limitations periods applicable to damages actions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    Consequently, with respect, I dissent.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"*\">\n    <p id=\"p-117\">\n     The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.
