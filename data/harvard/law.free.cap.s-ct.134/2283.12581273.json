I can understand that attitude: It parallels my own toward the playing in public of rock music or Stravinsky.

Certain of this Court's cases, however, have allowed the aversion to religious displays to be enforced directly\n   <em>\n    through\n   </em>\n   the First Amendment, at least in public facilities and with respect to public ceremonies-this despite the fact that the First Amendment explicitly favors religion and is, so to speak, agnostic about music.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In the decision below, the en banc Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit relied on those cases to condemn a suburban Milwaukee school district's decision to hold high-school graduations in a church. We recently confronted and curtailed this errant line of precedent in\n   <em>\n    Town of Greece v. Galloway,\n   </em>\n   572 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12580225,12706999\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1811/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , --- L.Ed.2d ---- (2014), which upheld under the Establishment Clause the saying of prayers before monthly town-council meetings. Because that case made clear a number of points with which the Seventh Circuit's decision is fundamentally inconsistent, the Court ought, at a minimum, to grant certiorari, vacate the judgment, and remand for reconsideration (GVR).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Endorsement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   First,\n   <em>\n    Town of Greece\n   </em>\n   abandoned the antiquated \"endorsement test,\" which formed the basis for the decision below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In this case, at the request of the student bodies of the two relevant schools, the Elmbrook School District decided to hold its high-school graduation ceremonies at Elmbrook Church, a nondenominational Christian house of worship. The students of the first school to move its ceremonies preferred that site to what had been the usual venue, the school's gymnasium, which was cramped, hot, and uncomfortable. The church offered more space, air conditioning, and cushioned seating. No one disputes that the church was chosen only because of these amenities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Despite that, the Seventh Circuit held that the choice of venue violated the Establishment Clause, primarily because it failed the endorsement test. That infinitely malleable standard asks whether governmental action has the purpose or effect of \"endorsing\" religion. See\n   <em>\n    County of Allegheny v.

We reversed the judgment without applying that test.

And there is good reason to believe that this omission was material. As demonstrated by\n    <em>\n     Conway,\n    </em>\n    the Wisconsin case mentioned above, public schools have long held graduations in churches. This should come as no surprise, given that \"[e]arly public schools were often held in rented rooms, church halls and basements, or other buildings that resembled Protestant churches.\" W. Reese, America's Public Schools 39 (2005). An 1821 Illinois law, for example, provided that a meetinghouse erected by a Presbyterian congregation \"may serve to have the gospel preached therein, and likewise may be used for a school-house for the township.\" Ill. Laws p. 153.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    We ought to remand this case to the Seventh Circuit to conduct the historical inquiry mandated by\n    <em>\n     Town of Greece\n    </em>\n    -or we ought to set the case for argument and conduct that inquiry ourselves.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    * * *\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    It is perhaps the job of school officials to prevent hurt feelings at school events. But that is decidedly not the job of the Constitution. It may well be, as then-Chief Judge Easterbrook suggested, that the decision of the Elmbrook School District to hold graduations under a Latin cross in a Christian church was \"unwise\" and \"offensive.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5862524\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/687/840/#p849\">\n     687 F.3d, at 869\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (dissenting opinion).
