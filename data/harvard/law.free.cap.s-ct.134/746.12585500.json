Their complaint alleges that Mercedes-Benz Argentina (MB Argentina), an Argentinian subsidiary of Daimler, collaborated with state security forces during Argentina's 1976-1983 \"Dirty War\" to kidnap, detain, torture, and kill certain MB Argentina workers, among them, plaintiffs or persons closely related to plaintiffs. Based on those allegations, plaintiffs asserted claims under the Alien Tort Statute and the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991, as well as under California and Argentina law. Personal jurisdiction over Daimler was predicated on the California contacts of Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA), another Daimler subsidiary, one incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in New Jersey. MBUSA distributes Daimler-manufactured vehicles to independent dealerships throughout the United States, including California. Daimler moved to dismiss the action for want of personal jurisdiction. Opposing that motion, plaintiffs argued that jurisdiction over Daimler could be founded on the California contacts of MBUSA. The District Court granted Daimler's motion to dismiss. Reversing the District Court's judgment, the Ninth Circuit held that MBUSA, which it assumed to fall within the California courts' all-purpose jurisdiction, was Daimler's \"agent\" for jurisdictional purposes, so that Daimler, too, should generally be answerable to suit in that State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Held\n   </em>\n   : Daimler is not amenable to suit in California for injuries allegedly caused by conduct of MB Argentina that took place entirely outside the United States.

Thus, the inquiry here is whether the Ninth Circuit's holding comports with the limits imposed by federal due process. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 4(k)(1)(A). P. 753.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   (b) For a time, this Court held that a tribunal's jurisdiction over persons was necessarily limited by the geographic bounds of the forum.

As is evident from these post-\n   <em>\n    International Shoe\n   </em>\n   decisions, while specific jurisdiction has been cut loose from\n   <em>\n    Pennoyer\n   </em>\n   's sway, general jurisdiction has not been stretched beyond limits traditionally recognized. Pp. 753 - 758.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   (c) Even assuming, for purposes of this decision, that MBUSA qualifies as at home in California, Daimler's affiliations with California are not sufficient to subject it to the general jurisdiction of that State's courts. Pp. 758 - 763.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (1) Whatever role agency theory might play in the context of general jurisdiction, the Court of Appeals' analysis in this case cannot be sustained. The Ninth Circuit's agency determination rested primarily on its observation that MBUSA's services were \"important\" to Daimler, as gauged by Daimler's hypothetical readiness to perform those services itself if MBUSA did not exist. But if \"importan[ce]\" in this sense were sufficient to justify jurisdictional attribution, foreign corporations would be amenable to suit on any or all claims wherever they have an in-state subsidiary or affiliate, an outcome that would sweep beyond even the \"sprawling view of general jurisdiction\" rejected in\n   <em>\n    Goodyear\n   </em>\n   .564 U.S., at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450505,4332867\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2846/\">\n    131 S.Ct., at 2856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Pp. 758 - 760.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (2) Even assuming that MBUSA is at home in California and that MBUSA's contacts are imputable to Daimler, there would still be no basis to subject Daimler to general jurisdiction in California. The paradigm all-purpose forums for general jurisdiction are a corporation's place of incorporation and principal place of business.\n   <em>\n    Goodyear,\n   </em>\n   564 U.S., at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450505,4332867\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2846/\">\n    131 S.Ct., at 2853-2854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs' reasoning, however, would reach well beyond these exemplar bases to approve the exercise of general jurisdiction in every State in which a corporation \"engages in a substantial, continuous, and systematic course of business.\" Brief for Respondents 16-17, and nn. 7-8. The words \"continuous and systematic,\" plaintiffs and the Court of Appeals overlooked, were used in\n   <em>\n    International Shoe\n   </em>\n   to describe situations in which the exercise of\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction would be appropriate. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157001\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/310/\">\n    326 U.S., at 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157001\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/310/\">\n    66 S.Ct. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With respect to all-purpose jurisdiction,\n   <em>\n    International Shoe\n   </em>\n   spoke instead of \"instances in which the continuous corporate operations within a state [are] so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit ... on causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those activities.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157001\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/310/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157001\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/310/\">\n    at 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157001\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/310/\">\n    66 S.Ct. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the proper inquiry, this Court has explained, is whether a foreign corporation's \"affiliations with the State are so 'continuous and systematic' as to render [it] essentially at home in the forum State.\"\n   <em>\n    Goodyear,\n   </em>\n   564 U.S., at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450505,4332867\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2846/\">\n    131 S.Ct., at 2851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Neither Daimler nor MBUSA is incorporated in California, nor does either entity have its principal place of business there. If Daimler's California activities sufficed to allow adjudication of this Argentina-rooted case in California, the same global reach would presumably be available in every other State in which MBUSA's sales are sizable. No decision of this Court sanctions a view of general jurisdiction so grasping. The Ninth Circuit, therefore, had no warrant to conclude that Daimler, even with MBUSA's contacts attributed to it, was at home in California, and hence subject to suit there on claims by foreign plaintiffs having nothing to do with anything that occurred or had its principal impact in California. Pp. 760 - 762.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (3) Finally, the transnational context of this dispute bears attention. This Court's recent precedents have rendered infirm plaintiffs' Alien Tort Statute and Torture Victim Protection Act claims. See\n   <em>\n    Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.,\n   </em>\n   569 U.S. ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697039\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/108/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697039\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/108/\">\n    185 L.Ed.2d 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Mohamad v.

The litigation commenced in 2004, when twenty-two Argentinian residents\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fr1\" name=\"fr1\">\n      1\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against DaimlerChrysler Aktiengesellschaft\n    (Daimler),\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fr2\" name=\"fr2\">\n      2\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    a German public stock company, headquartered in Stuttgart, that manufactures Mercedes-Benz vehicles in Germany. The complaint alleged that during Argentina's 1976-1983 \"Dirty War,\" Daimler's Argentinian subsidiary, Mercedes-Benz Argentina (MB Argentina) collaborated with state security forces to kidnap, detain, torture, and kill certain MB Argentina workers, among them, plaintiffs or persons closely related to plaintiffs. Damages for the alleged human-rights violations were sought from Daimler under the laws of the United States, California, and Argentina. Jurisdiction over the lawsuit was predicated on the California contacts of Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA), a subsidiary of Daimler incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in New Jersey. MBUSA distributes Daimler-manufactured vehicles to independent dealerships throughout the United States, including California.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    The question presented is whether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment precludes the District Court from exercising jurisdiction over Daimler in this case, given the absence of any California connection to the atrocities, perpetrators, or victims described in the complaint. Plaintiffs invoked the court's general or all-purpose jurisdiction. California, they urge, is a place where Daimler may be sued on any and all claims against it, wherever in the world the claims may arise. For example, as plaintiffs' counsel affirmed, under the proffered jurisdictional theory, if a Daimler-manufactured vehicle overturned in Poland, injuring a Polish driver and passenger, the injured parties could maintain a design defect suit in California. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 28-29. Exercises of personal jurisdiction so exorbitant, we hold, are barred by due process constraints on the assertion of adjudicatory authority.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v.

Plaintiffs seek to hold Daimler vicariously liable for MB Argentina's alleged malfeasance. Daimler is a German\n    <em>\n     Aktiengesellschaft\n    </em>\n    (public stock company) that manufactures Mercedes-Benz vehicles in Germany and has its headquarters in Stuttgart. At times relevant to this case, MB Argentina was a subsidiary wholly owned by Daimler's predecessor in interest.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Daimler moved to dismiss the action for want of personal jurisdiction. Opposing the motion, plaintiffs submitted declarations and exhibits purporting to demonstrate the presence of Daimler itself in California. Alternatively, plaintiffs maintained that jurisdiction over Daimler could be founded on the California contacts of MBUSA, a distinct corporate entity that, according to plaintiffs, should be treated as Daimler's agent for jurisdictional purposes.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    MBUSA, an indirect subsidiary of Daimler, is a Delaware limited liability corporation.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fr3\" name=\"fr3\">\n      3\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    MBUSA serves as Daimler's exclusive importer and distributor in the United States, purchasing Mercedes-Benz automobiles from Daimler in Germany, then importing those vehicles, and ultimately distributing them to independent dealerships located throughout the Nation. Although MBUSA's principal place of business is in New Jersey, MBUSA has multiple California-based facilities, including a regional office in Costa Mesa, a Vehicle Preparation Center in Carson, and a Classic Center in Irvine. According to the record developed below, MBUSA is the largest supplier of luxury vehicles to the California market.

See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 4(k)(1)(A) (service of process is effective to establish personal jurisdiction over a defendant \"who is subject to the jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is located\"). Under California's long-arm statute, California state courts may exercise personal jurisdiction \"on any basis not inconsistent with the Constitution of this state or of the United States.\" Cal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7 410.10 (West 2004). California's long-arm statute allows the exercise of personal jurisdiction to the full extent permissible under the U.S. Constitution.

In the proceedings below, the parties agreed on, or failed to contest, certain points we now take as given. Plaintiffs have never attempted to fit this case into the\n    <em>\n     specific\n    </em>\n    jurisdiction category. Nor did plaintiffs challenge on appeal the District Court's holding that Daimler's own contacts with California were, by themselves, too sporadic to justify the exercise of general jurisdiction. While plaintiffs ultimately persuaded the Ninth Circuit to impute MBUSA's California contacts to Daimler on an agency theory, at no point have they maintained that MBUSA is an alter ego of Daimler.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Daimler, on the other hand, failed to object below to plaintiffs' assertion that the California courts could exercise all-purpose jurisdiction over MBUSA.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fr12\" name=\"fr12\">\n      12\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    But see Brief for Petitioner 23, n. 4 (suggestion that in light of\n    <em>\n     Goodyear\n    </em>\n    , MBUSA may not be amenable to general jurisdiction in California); Brief for United States as\n    <em>\n     Amicus Curiae\n    </em>\n    16, n. 5 (hereinafter U.S. Brief) (same).

The Ninth Circuit's agency analysis derived from Circuit precedent considering principally whether the subsidiary \"performs services that are sufficiently important to the foreign corporation that if it did not have a representative to perform them, the corporation's own officials would undertake to perform substantially similar services.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5648408\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/644/909/\">\n     644 F.3d, at 920\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Doe v.

Daimler argues, and several Courts of Appeals have held, that a subsidiary's jurisdictional contacts can be imputed to its parent only when the former is so dominated by the latter as to be its alter ego. The Ninth Circuit adopted a less rigorous test based on what it described as an \"agency\" relationship. Agencies, we note, come in many sizes and shapes: \"One may be an agent for some business purposes and not others so that the fact that one may be an agent for one purpose does not make him or her an agent for every purpose.\" 2A C. J. S., Agency \u00a7 43, p. 367 (2013) (footnote omitted).\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fr13\" name=\"fr13\">\n      13\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    A subsidiary, for example, might be its parent's agent for claims arising in the place where the subsidiary operates, yet not its agent regarding claims arising elsewhere. The Court of Appeals did not advert to that prospect. But we need not pass judgment on invocation of an agency theory in the context of general jurisdiction, for in no event can the appeals court's analysis be sustained.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The Ninth Circuit's agency finding rested primarily on its observation that MBUSA's services were \"important\" to Daimler, as gauged by Daimler's hypothetical readiness to perform those services itself if MBUSA did not exist. Formulated this way, the inquiry into importance stacks the deck, for it will always yield a pro-jurisdiction answer: \"Anything a corporation does through an independent contractor, subsidiary, or distributor is presumably something that the corporation would do 'by other means' if the independent contractor, subsidiary, or distributor did not exist.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3755806\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/774/\">\n     676 F.3d, at 777\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (O'Scannlain, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fr14\" name=\"fr14\">\n      14\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    The Ninth Circuit's agency theory\n    thus appears to subject foreign corporations to general jurisdiction whenever they have an in-state subsidiary or affiliate, an outcome that would sweep beyond even the \"sprawling view of general jurisdiction\" we rejected in\n    <em>\n     Goodyear\n    </em>\n    . 564 U.S., at ----, 131 S.Ct., at 2856.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fr15\" name=\"fr15\">\n      15\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    <strong>\n     B\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Even if we were to assume that MBUSA is at home in California, and further to assume MBUSA's contacts are imputable to Daimler, there would still be no basis to subject Daimler to general jurisdiction in California, for Daimler's slim contacts with the State hardly render it at home there.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fr16\" name=\"fr16\">\n      16\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    <em>\n     Goodyear\n    </em>\n    made clear that only a limited set of affiliations with a forum will render a defendant amenable to all-purpose jurisdiction there. \"For an individual, the paradigm forum for the exercise of general jurisdiction is the individual's domicile; for a corporation, it is an equivalent place, one in which the corporation is fairly regarded as at home.\" 564 U.S., at ----, 131 S.Ct., at 2853-2854 (citing Brilmayer et al., A General Look at General Jurisdiction,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=66%20Tex.%20L.%20Rev.%20721\">\n     66 Texas L.Rev. 721\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 728 (1988)).

I concur only in the judgment, however, because I cannot agree with the path the Court takes to arrive at that result.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The Court acknowledges that Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA), Daimler's wholly owned subsidiary, has considerable contacts with California. It has multiple facilities in the State, including a regional headquarters. Each year, it distributes in California tens of thousands of cars, the sale of which generated billions of dollars in the year this suit was brought. And it provides service and sales support to customers throughout the State. Daimler has conceded that California courts may exercise general jurisdiction over MBUSA on the basis of these contacts, and the Court assumes that MBUSA's contacts may be attributed to Daimler for the purpose of deciding whether Daimler is also subject to general jurisdiction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Are these contacts sufficient to permit the exercise of general jurisdiction over\n    Daimler? The Court holds that they are not, for a reason wholly foreign to our due process jurisprudence. The problem, the Court says, is not that Daimler's contacts with California are too few, but that its contacts with other forums are too many. In other words, the Court does not dispute that the presence of multiple offices, the direct distribution of thousands of products accounting for billions of dollars in sales, and continuous interaction with customers throughout a State would be enough to support the exercise of general jurisdiction over some businesses. Daimler is just not one of those businesses, the Court concludes, because its California contacts must be viewed in the context of its extensive \"nationwide and worldwide\" operations.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 762, n. 20. In recent years, Americans have grown accustomed to the concept of multinational corporations that are supposedly \"too big to fail\"; today the Court deems Daimler \"too big for general jurisdiction.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    The Court's conclusion is wrong as a matter of both process and substance. As to process, the Court decides this case on a ground that was neither argued nor passed on below, and that Daimler raised for the first time in a footnote to its brief. Brief for Petitioner 31-32, n. 5. As to substance, the Court's focus on Daimler's operations outside of California ignores the lodestar of our personal jurisdiction jurisprudence: A State may subject a defendant to the burden of suit if the defendant has sufficiently taken advantage of the State's laws and protections through its contacts in the State; whether the defendant has contacts elsewhere is immaterial.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Regrettably, these errors are unforced. The Court can and should decide this case on the far simpler ground that, no matter how extensive Daimler's contacts with California, that State's exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable given that the case involves foreign plaintiffs suing a foreign defendant based on foreign conduct, and given that a more appropriate forum is available. Because I would reverse the judgment below on this ground, I concur in the judgment only.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    <strong>\n     I\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    I begin with the point on which the majority and I agree: The Ninth Circuit's decision should be reversed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Our personal jurisdiction precedents call for a two-part analysis. The contacts prong asks whether the defendant has sufficient contacts with the forum State to support personal jurisdiction; the reasonableness prong asks whether the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable under the circumstances.\n    <em>\n     Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p464\">\n     471 U.S. 462\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 475-478,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p464\">\n     105 S.Ct. 2174\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p464\">\n     85 L.Ed.2d 528\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1985). As the majority points out, all of the cases in which we have applied the reasonableness prong have involved specific as opposed to general jurisdiction.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 762, n. 20. Whether the reasonableness prong should apply in the general jurisdiction context is therefore a question we have never decided,\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fr21\" name=\"fr21\">\n      1\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    and it is one on which I can appreciate\n    the arguments on both sides. But it would be imprudent to decide that question in this case given that respondents have failed to argue against the application of the reasonableness prong during the entire 8-year history of this litigation. See Brief for Respondents 11, 12, 13, 16 (conceding application of the reasonableness inquiry); Plaintiffs' Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Quash Service of Process and to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction in No. 04-00194-RMW (ND Cal., May 16, 2005), pp. 14-23 (same).

The majority's focus on the extent of a corporate defendant's out-of-forum contacts is untethered from this rationale. After all, the degree to which a company\n    intentionally benefits from a forum State depends on its interactions with that State, not its interactions elsewhere. An article on which the majority relies (and on which\n    <em>\n     Goodyear\n    </em>\n    relied as well, 564 U.S., at ----, 131 S.Ct., at 2853-2854) expresses the point well: \"We should not treat defendants as less amenable to suit merely because they carry on more substantial business in other states....

Our cases have long stated the rule that a defendant's contacts with a forum State must be continuous, substantial, and systematic in order for the defendant to be subject to that State's general jurisdiction. See\n    <em>\n     Perkins,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"640833\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/342/437/\">\n     342 U.S., at 446\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"640833\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/342/437/\">\n     72 S.Ct. 413\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . We offered additional guidance in\n    <em>\n     Goodyear\n    </em>\n    , adding the phrase \"essentially at home\" to our prior formulation of the rule. 564 U.S., at ----, 131 S.Ct., at 2851 (a State may exercise general jurisdiction where a defendant's \"affiliations with the State are so 'continuous and systematic' as to render [the defendant] essentially at home in the forum State\"). We used the phrase \"at home\" to signify that in order for an out-of-state defendant to be subject to general jurisdiction, its continuous and substantial contacts with a forum State must be akin to those of a local enterprise that actually is \"at home\" in the State. See Brilmayer,\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 742.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fr28\" name=\"fr28\">\n      8\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Under this standard, Daimler's concession that MBUSA is subject to general jurisdiction in California (a concession the Court accepts,\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 758, 759) should be dispositive. For if MBUSA's California contacts are so substantial and the resulting benefits to MBUSA so significant as to make MBUSA \"at home\" in California, the same must be true of Daimler when MBUSA's contacts and benefits are viewed as its own. Indeed, until a footnote in its brief before this Court, even Daimler did not dispute this conclusion for eight years of the litigation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    <strong>\n     B\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    The majority today concludes otherwise. Referring to the \"continuous and systematic\" contacts inquiry that has been taught to generations of first-year law students as \"unacceptably grasping,\"\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 760, the majority announces the new rule that in order for a foreign defendant to be subject to general jurisdiction, it must not only possess continuous and systematic contacts with a forum State, but those contacts must also surpass some unspecified level when viewed in comparison to the company's \"nationwide and worldwide\" activities.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 762, n. 20.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fr29\" name=\"fr29\">\n      9\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    Neither of the majority's two rationales for this proportionality requirement is persuasive. First, the majority suggests that its approach is necessary for the sake of predictability. Permitting general jurisdiction in every State where a corporation has continuous and substantial contacts, the majority asserts, would \"scarcely permit out-of-state defendants 'to structure their primary conduct with some minimum assurance as to where that conduct will and will not render them liable to suit.' \"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 762 (quoting\n    <em>\n     Burger King Corp.,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p464\">\n     471 U.S., at 472\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p464\">\n     105 S.Ct. 2174\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ). But there is nothing unpredictable about a rule that instructs multinational corporations that if they engage in continuous and substantial contacts with more than one State, they will be subject to general jurisdiction in each one. The majority may not favor that rule as a matter of policy, but such disagreement does not render an otherwise routine test unpredictable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Nor is the majority's proportionality inquiry any more predictable than the approach it rejects. If anything, the majority's approach injects an additional layer of uncertainty because a corporate defendant must now try to foretell a court's analysis as to both the sufficiency of its contacts with the forum State itself, as well as the relative sufficiency of those contacts in light of the company's operations elsewhere. Moreover, the majority does not even try to explain just how extensive the company's in-state contacts must be in the context of its global operations in order for general jurisdiction to be proper.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    The majority's approach will also lead to greater unpredictability by radically expanding the scope of jurisdictional discovery.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Rather than ascertaining the extent of a corporate defendant's forum-state contacts alone, courts will now have to identify the extent of a company's contacts in every other forum where it does business in order to compare them against the company's in-state contacts. That considerable burden runs headlong into the majority's recitation of the familiar principle that \" '[s]imple jurisdictional rules ... promote greater predictability.' \"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 760 - 761 (quoting\n    <em>\n     Hertz Corp. v.

In the era of\n    <em>\n     International Shoe,\n    </em>\n    it was rare for a corporation to have such substantial nationwide contacts that it would be subject to general jurisdiction in a large number of States.

What has changed since\n    <em>\n     International Shoe\n    </em>\n    is not the due process principle of fundamental fairness but rather the nature of the global economy. Just as it was fair to say in the 1940's that an out-of-state company could enjoy the benefits of a forum State enough to make it \"essentially at home\" in the State, it is fair to say today that a multinational conglomerate can enjoy such extensive benefits in multiple forum States that it is \"essentially at home\" in each one.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    In any event, to the extent the majority is concerned with the modern-day consequences of\n    <em>\n     International Shoe\n    </em>\n    's conception of personal jurisdiction, there remain other judicial doctrines available to mitigate any resulting unfairness to large corporate defendants.

Unfortunately, the majority short circuits that process by enshrining today's narrow rule of general jurisdiction as a matter of constitutional law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    <strong>\n     C\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    The majority's concern for the consequences of its decision should have led it\n    the other way, because the rule that it adopts will produce deep injustice in at least four respects.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    First, the majority's approach unduly curtails the States' sovereign authority to adjudicate disputes against corporate defendants who have engaged in continuous and substantial business operations within their boundaries.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fr30\" name=\"fr30\">\n      10\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    The majority does not dispute that a State can exercise general jurisdiction where a corporate defendant has its corporate headquarters, and hence its principal place of business within the State. Cf.\n    <em>\n     Hertz Corp.,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581808\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/77/#p94\">\n     559 U.S., at 93\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581808\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/77/#p94\">\n     130 S.Ct. 1181\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Yet it never explains why the State should lose that power when, as is increasingly common, a corporation \"divide[s] [its] command and coordinating functions among officers who work at several different locations.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581808\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/77/#p94\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581808\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/77/#p94\">\n     at 95-96\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581808\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/77/#p94\">\n     130 S.Ct. 1181\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Suppose a company divides its management functions equally among three offices in different States, with one office nominally deemed the company's corporate headquarters. If the State where the headquarters is located can exercise general jurisdiction, why should the other two States be constitutionally forbidden to do the same? Indeed, under the majority's approach, the result would be unchanged even if the company has substantial operations within the latter two States (and even if the company has no sales or other business operations in the first State). Put simply, the majority's rule defines the Due Process Clause so narrowly and arbitrarily as to contravene the States' sovereign prerogative to subject to judgment defendants who have manifested an unqualified \"intention to benefit from and thus an intention to submit to the[ir] laws,\"\n    <em>\n     J. McIntyre,\n    </em>\n    564 U.S., at ----, 131 S.Ct., at 2787 (plurality opinion).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    Second, the proportionality approach will treat small businesses unfairly in comparison to national and multinational conglomerates. Whereas a larger company will often be immunized from general jurisdiction in a State on account of its extensive contacts outside the forum, a small business will not be. For instance, the majority holds today that Daimler is not subject to general jurisdiction in California despite its multiple offices, continuous operations, and billions of dollars' worth of sales there. But imagine a small business that manufactures luxury vehicles principally targeting the California market and that has substantially all of its sales and operations in the State-even though those sales and operations may amount to one-thousandth of Daimler's. Under the majority's rule, that small business will be subject to suit in California on any cause of action involving any of its activities anywhere in the world, while its far more pervasive competitor, Daimler, will not be. That will be so even if the small business incorporates and sets up its headquarters elsewhere (as Daimler does), since the small business' California sales and operations would still predominate when \"apprais[ed]\" in proportion to its minimal \"nationwide and worldwide\" operations,\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 762, n. 20.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Third, the majority's approach creates the incongruous result that an individual defendant whose only contact with a forum State is a one-time visit will be subject to general jurisdiction if served with process during that visit,\n    <em>\n     Burnham v. Superior Court of Cal., County of Marin,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634278\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/604/#p617\">\n     495 U.S. 604\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634278\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/604/#p617\">\n     110 S.Ct. 2105\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634278\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/604/#p617\">\n     109 L.Ed.2d 631\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1990), but a large corporation that owns property, employs workers, and does billions of dollars' worth of business in the State will not be, simply because the corporation has similar contacts elsewhere (though the visiting individual surely does as well).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    Finally, it should be obvious that the ultimate effect of the majority's approach will be to shift the risk of loss from multinational corporations to the individuals harmed by their actions. Under the majority's rule, for example, a parent whose child is maimed due to the negligence of a foreign hotel owned by a multinational conglomerate will be unable to hold the hotel to account in a single U.S. court, even if the hotel company has a massive presence in multiple States.

See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Walpex Trading Co. v. Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7396464\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/712/383/\">\n     712 F.Supp. 383\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (S.D.N.Y.1989).\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fr32\" name=\"fr32\">\n      12\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    Indeed, the majority's approach would preclude the plaintiffs in these examples from seeking recourse anywhere in the United States even if no other judicial system was available to provide relief. I cannot agree with the majority's conclusion that the Due Process Clause requires these results.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    The Court rules against respondents today on a ground that no court has considered in the history of this case, that this Court did not grant certiorari to decide, and that Daimler raised only in a footnote of its brief. In doing so, the Court adopts a new rule of constitutional law that is unmoored from decades of precedent. Because I would reverse the Ninth Circuit's decision on the narrower ground that the exercise of jurisdiction over Daimler would be unreasonable in any event, I respectfully concur in the judgment only.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"*\">\n    <p id=\"p-118\">\n     The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.

That is because the two forms of jurisdiction address different concerns. Whereas specific jurisdiction focuses on the relationship between a defendant's challenged conduct and the forum State, general jurisdiction focuses on the defendant's substantial presence in the State irrespective of the location of the challenged conduct.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"11.\">\n    <p id=\"p-154\">\n     See also,\n     <em>\n      e.g.,\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Woods v.

Under the majority's rule, for example, a General Motors autoworker who retires to Florida would be unable to sue GM in that State for disabilities that develop from the retiree's labor at a Michigan parts plant, even though GM undertakes considerable business operations in Florida.
