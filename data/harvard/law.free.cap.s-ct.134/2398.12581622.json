Levinson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14213\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/224/\">\n    485 U.S. 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14213\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/224/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14213\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/224/\">\n    99 L.Ed.2d 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this Court held that investors could satisfy this reliance requirement by\n   invoking a presumption that the price of stock traded in an efficient market reflects all public, material information-including material misrepresentations. The Court also held, however, that a defendant could rebut this presumption by showing that the alleged misrepresentation did not actually affect the stock price-that is, that it had no \"price impact.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Respondent Erica P. John Fund, Inc. (EPJ Fund), filed a putative class action against Halliburton and one of its executives (collectively Halliburton), alleging that they made misrepresentations designed to inflate Halliburton's stock price, in violation of section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-5. The District Court initially denied EPJ Fund's class certification motion, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed. But this Court vacated that judgment, concluding that securities fraud plaintiffs need not prove loss causation-a causal connection between the defendants' alleged misrepresentations and the plaintiffs' economic losses-at the class certification stage in order to invoke\n   <em>\n    Basic\n   </em>\n   's presumption of reliance. On remand, Halliburton argued that class certification was nonetheless inappropriate because the evidence it had earlier introduced to disprove loss causation also showed that its alleged misrepresentations had not affected its stock price. By demonstrating the absence of any \"price impact,\" Halliburton contended, it had rebutted the\n   <em>\n    Basic\n   </em>\n   presumption. And without the benefit of that presumption, investors would have to prove reliance on an individual basis, meaning that individual issues would predominate over common ones and class certification would be inappropriate under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3). The District Court rejected Halliburton's argument and certified the class. The Fifth Circuit affirmed, concluding that Halliburton could use its price impact evidence to rebut the\n   <em>\n    Basic\n   </em>\n   presumption only at trial, not at the class certification stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em>\n    Held\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   1.

The Court recognized in\n   <em>\n    Basic\n   </em>\n   , however, that requiring direct proof of reliance from every individual plaintiff \"would place an unnecessarily unrealistic evidentiary burden on the ... plaintiff who has traded on an impersonal market,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14213\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/224/\">\n    485 U.S., at 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14213\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/224/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and \"effectively would\" prevent plaintiffs \"from proceeding with a class action\" in Rule 10b-5 suits,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14213\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/224/\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14213\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/224/\">\n    at 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14213\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/224/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To address these concerns, the Court held that plaintiffs could satisfy the reliance element of a Rule 10b-5 action by invoking a rebuttable presumption of reliance. The Court based that presumption on what is known as the \"fraud-on-the-market\" theory, which holds that \"the market price of shares traded on well-developed markets reflects all publicly available information, and, hence, any material misrepresentations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14213\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/224/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14213\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/224/\">\n    at 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14213\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/224/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court also noted that the typical \"investor who buys or sells stock at the price set by the market does so in reliance on the integrity of that price.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14213\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/224/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14213\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/224/\">\n    at 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14213\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/224/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, whenever an investor buys or sells stock at the market price, his \"reliance on any public material misrepresentations ... may be presumed for purposes of a Rule 10b-5 action.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14213\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/224/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14213\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/224/\">\n    at 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14213\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/224/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Basic\n   </em>\n   also emphasized that the presumption of\n   reliance was rebuttable rather than conclusive.

Pp. 2408 - 2409.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (2) Halliburton also contends that\n   <em>\n    Basic\n   </em>\n   rested on two premises that have been undermined by developments in economic theory. First, it argues that the\n   <em>\n    Basic\n   </em>\n   Court espoused \"a robust view of market efficiency\" that is no longer tenable in light of empirical evidence ostensibly showing that material, public information often is not quickly incorporated into stock prices. The Court in\n   <em>\n    Basic\n   </em>\n   acknowledged, however, the debate among economists about the efficiency of capital markets and refused to endorse \"any particular theory of how quickly and completely publicly available information is reflected in market price.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14213\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/224/\">\n    485 U.S., at 248, n. 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14213\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/224/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court instead based the presumption of reliance on the fairly modest premise that \"market professionals generally consider most publicly announced material statements about companies, thereby affecting stock market prices.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14213\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/224/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14213\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/224/\">\n    at 247, n. 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14213\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/224/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, in making the presumption rebuttable,\n   <em>\n    Basic\n   </em>\n   recognized that market efficiency is a matter of degree and accordingly made it a matter of proof. Halliburton has not identified the kind of fundamental shift in economic theory that could justify overruling a precedent on the ground that it misunderstood, or has since been overtaken by, economic realities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Halliburton also contests the premise that investors \"invest 'in reliance on the integrity of [the market] price,' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14213\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/224/\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14213\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/224/\">\n    at 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14213\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/224/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , identifying a number of classes of investors for whom \"price integrity\" is supposedly \"marginal or irrelevant.\" But\n   <em>\n    Basic\n   </em>\n   never denied the existence of such investors, who in any event rely at least on the facts that market prices will incorporate public information within a reasonable period and that market prices, however inaccurate, are not distorted by fraud. Pp. 2409 - 2411.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (c) The principle of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   has \" 'special force' \" \"in respect to statutory interpretation\" because \" 'Congress remains free to alter what [the Court has] done.' \"\n   <em>\n    John R.

So too with\n   <em>\n    Basic\n   </em>\n   's presumption of reliance. The presumption is not inconsistent with this Court's more recent decisions construing the Rule 10b-5 cause of action. In\n   <em>\n    Central Bank of Denver, N.A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N.A.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1146992\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/164/\">\n    511 U.S. 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1146992\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/164/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1146992\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/164/\">\n    128 L.Ed.2d 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675633\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/148/\">\n    552 U.S. 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675633\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/148/\">\n    128 S.Ct. 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675633\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/148/\">\n    169 L.Ed.2d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Court declined to effectively eliminate the reliance element by extending liability to entirely new categories of defendants who themselves had not made any material, public misrepresentation. The\n   <em>\n    Basic\n   </em>\n   presumption, by contrast, merely provides an alternative means of satisfying the reliance element. Nor is the\n   <em>\n    Basic\n   </em>\n   presumption inconsistent with the Court's recent decisions governing class action certification, which require plaintiffs to\n   <em>\n    prove\n   </em>\n   -not simply plead-that their proposed class satisfies each requirement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, including, if applicable, the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes,\n   </em>\n   564 U.S. ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2541/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Basic\n   </em>\n   presumption does not relieve plaintiffs of that burden but rather sets forth what plaintiffs must prove to demonstrate predominance. Finally, Halliburton emphasizes the possible harmful consequences of the securities class actions facilitated by the\n   <em>\n    Basic\n   </em>\n   presumption, but such concerns are more appropriately addressed to Congress, which has in fact responded, to some extent, to many of them. Pp. 2411 - 2413.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   2. For the same reasons the Court declines to overrule\n   <em>\n    Basic\n   </em>\n   's presumption of reliance, it also declines to modify the prerequisites for invoking the presumption by requiring plaintiffs to prove \"price impact\" directly at the class certification stage. The\n   <em>\n    Basic\n   </em>\n   presumption incorporates two constituent presumptions: First, if a plaintiff shows that the defendant's misrepresentation was public and material and that the stock traded in a generally efficient market, he is entitled to a presumption that the misrepresentation affected the stock price. Second, if the plaintiff also shows that he purchased the stock at the market price during the relevant period, he is entitled to a further presumption that he purchased the stock in reliance on the defendant's misrepresentation. Requiring plaintiffs to prove price impact directly would take away the first constituent presumption. Halliburton's argument for doing so is the same as its argument for overruling the\n   <em>\n    Basic\n   </em>\n   presumption altogether, and it meets the same fate. Pp. 2413 - 2414.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   3. The Court agrees with Halliburton, however, that defendants must be afforded an opportunity to rebut the presumption of reliance before class certification with evidence of a\n   <em>\n    lack\n   </em>\n   of price impact. Defendants may already introduce such evidence at the merits stage to rebut the\n   <em>\n    Basic\n   </em>\n   presumption, as well as at the class certification stage to counter a plaintiff's showing of market efficiency. Forbidding defendants to rely on the same evidence prior to class certification for the particular purpose of rebutting the presumption altogether makes no sense, and can readily lead to results that are inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Basic\n   </em>\n   's own logic.\n   <em>\n    Basic\n   </em>\n   allows plaintiffs to establish price impact indirectly, by showing that a stock traded in an efficient market and that a defendant's misrepresentations were public and material. But an indirect proxy should not preclude consideration of a defendant's direct, more salient evidence showing that an alleged misrepresentation did not actually affect the stock's price and, consequently, that the\n   <em>\n    Basic\n   </em>\n   presumption does not apply.\n   <em>\n    Amgen\n   </em>\n   does not require a different result. There, the Court held that materiality, though a prerequisite for invoking the\n   <em>\n    Basic\n   </em>\n   presumption, should be left to the merits stage because it does not bear on the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). In contrast, the fact that a misrepresentation has price impact is \"\n   <em>\n    Basic\n   </em>\n   's fundamental premise.\"\n   <em>\n    Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co.,\n   </em>\n   563 U.S. ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450129,5918078\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2179/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450129,5918078\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2179/\">\n    180 L.Ed.2d 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It thus has everything to do with the issue of predominance at the class certification stage. That is why, if reliance is to be shown through the\n   <em>\n    Basic\n   </em>\n   presumption, the publicity and market efficiency prerequisites must be proved before class certification. Given that such indirect evidence of price impact will be before the court at the class certification stage in any event, there is no reason to artificially limit the inquiry at that stage by excluding direct evidence of price impact.

According to EPJ Fund, between June 3, 1999, and December 7, 2001, Halliburton made a series of misrepresentations regarding its potential liability in asbestos litigation, its expected revenue from certain construction contracts, and the anticipated benefits of its merger with another company-all in an attempt to inflate the price of its stock. Halliburton subsequently made a number\n    of corrective disclosures, which, EPJ Fund contends, caused the company's stock price to drop and investors to lose money.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    EPJ Fund moved to certify a class comprising all investors who purchased Halliburton common stock during the class period. The District Court found that the proposed class satisfied all the threshold requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a): It was sufficiently numerous, there were common questions of law or fact, the representative parties' claims were typical of the class claims, and the representatives could fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.

Debates about the precise\n    <em>\n     degree\n    </em>\n    to which stock prices accurately reflect public information are thus largely beside the point. \"That the ... price [of a stock] may be inaccurate does not detract from the fact that false statements affect it, and cause loss,\" which is \"all that\n    <em>\n     Basic\n    </em>\n    requires.\"\n    <em>\n     Schleicher v.

In securities class action cases, the crucial requirement for class certification will usually be the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). The\n    <em>\n     Basic\n    </em>\n    presumption does not relieve plaintiffs of the burden of proving-before class certification-that this requirement is met.\n    <em>\n     Basic\n    </em>\n    instead establishes that a plaintiff satisfies that burden by proving the prerequisites for invoking the presumption-namely, publicity, materiality, market efficiency, and market timing.

See\n    <em>\n     Amgen,\n    </em>\n    568 U.S., at ----, 133 S.Ct., at 1200-1201. And to prevent plaintiffs from circumventing these restrictions by bringing securities class actions under state law in state court, Congress also enacted the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=112%20Stat.%203227\">\n     112 Stat. 3227\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , which precludes many state law class actions alleging securities fraud.

It should not be enough, Halliburton contends, for plaintiffs to demonstrate the general efficiency of the market in which the stock traded. Halliburton's second proposed alternative would allow defendants to rebut the presumption of reliance with evidence of a\n    <em>\n     lack\n    </em>\n    of price impact, not only at the merits stage-which all agree defendants may already do-but also before class certification.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    <strong>\n     A\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    As noted, to invoke the\n    <em>\n     Basic\n    </em>\n    presumption, a plaintiff must prove that: (1) the alleged misrepresentations were publicly known, (2) they were material, (3) the stock traded in an efficient market, and (4) the plaintiff traded the stock between when the misrepresentations were made and when the truth was revealed.

What is called the\n    <em>\n     Basic\n    </em>\n    presumption actually incorporates two constituent presumptions: First, if a plaintiff shows that the defendant's misrepresentation was public and material and that the stock traded in a generally efficient market, he is entitled to a presumption that the misrepresentation affected the stock price. Second, if the plaintiff also shows that he purchased the stock at the market price during the relevant period, he is entitled to a further presumption that he purchased the stock in reliance on the defendant's misrepresentation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    By requiring plaintiffs to prove price impact directly, Halliburton's proposal would take away the first constituent presumption. Halliburton's argument for doing so is the same as its primary argument for overruling the\n    <em>\n     Basic\n    </em>\n    presumption altogether: Because market efficiency is not a yes-or-no proposition, a public, material misrepresentation might not affect a stock's price even in a generally efficient market. But as explained,\n    <em>\n     Basic\n    </em>\n    never suggested otherwise; that is why it affords defendants an opportunity to rebut the presumption by showing, among other things, that the particular misrepresentation at issue did not affect the stock's market price. For the same reasons we declined to completely jettison the\n    <em>\n     Basic\n    </em>\n    presumption, we decline to effectively jettison half of it by revising the prerequisites for invoking it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    <strong>\n     B\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Even if plaintiffs need not directly prove price impact to invoke the\n    <em>\n     Basic\n    </em>\n    presumption, Halliburton contends that defendants should at least be allowed to defeat the presumption at the class certification stage through evidence that the misrepresentation did not in fact affect the stock price.

In this case, for example, EPJ Fund submitted an event study of various episodes that might have been expected to affect the price of Halliburton's stock, in order to demonstrate that the market for that stock takes account of material, public information about the company.

Suppose a defendant at the certification stage submits an event study looking at the impact on the price of its stock from six discrete events, in an effort to refute the plaintiffs' claim of general market efficiency. All agree the defendant may do this. Suppose one of the six events is the specific misrepresentation asserted by the plaintiffs. All agree that this too is perfectly acceptable. Now suppose the district court determines that, despite the defendant's study, the plaintiff has carried its burden to prove market efficiency, but that the evidence shows no price impact with respect to the specific misrepresentation challenged in the suit. The evidence at the certification stage thus shows an efficient market, on which the alleged misrepresentation had no price impact. And yet under EPJ Fund's view, the plaintiffs' action should be certified and proceed as a class action (with all that entails), even though the fraud-on-the-market theory does not apply and common reliance thus cannot be presumed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Such a result is inconsistent with\n    <em>\n     Basic\n    </em>\n    's own logic. Under\n    <em>\n     Basic\n    </em>\n    's fraud-on-the-market theory, market efficiency and the other prerequisites for invoking the presumption constitute an indirect way of showing price impact. As explained, it is appropriate to allow plaintiffs to rely on this indirect proxy for price impact, rather than requiring them to prove price impact directly, given\n    <em>\n     Basic\n    </em>\n    's rationales for recognizing a presumption of reliance in the first place. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2408, 2413 - 2414.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    But an indirect proxy should not preclude direct evidence when such evidence is available. As we explained in\n    <em>\n     Basic,\n    </em>\n    \"[a]ny showing that severs the link between the alleged misrepresentation and ... the price received (or paid) by the plaintiff ... will be sufficient to rebut the presumption of reliance\" because \"the basis for finding that the fraud had been\n    transmitted through market price would be gone.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14213\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/224/\">\n     485 U.S., at 248\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14213\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/224/\">\n     108 S.Ct. 978\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . And without the presumption of reliance, a Rule 10b-5 suit cannot proceed as a class action: Each plaintiff would have to prove reliance individually, so common issues would not \"predominate\" over individual ones, as required by Rule 23(b)(3).\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14213\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/224/\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14213\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/224/\">\n     at 242\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"14213\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/224/\">\n     108 S.Ct. 978\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

While\n    <em>\n     Basic\n    </em>\n    allows plaintiffs to establish that precondition indirectly, it does not require courts to ignore a defendant's direct, more salient evidence showing that the alleged misrepresentation did not actually affect the stock's market price and, consequently, that the\n    <em>\n     Basic\n    </em>\n    presumption does not apply.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    <strong>\n     2\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    The Court of Appeals relied on our decision in\n    <em>\n     Amgen\n    </em>\n    in holding that Halliburton could not introduce evidence of lack of price impact at the class certification stage. The question in\n    <em>\n     Amgen\n    </em>\n    was whether plaintiffs could be required to prove (or defendants be permitted to disprove) materiality before class certification. Even though materiality is a prerequisite for invoking the\n    <em>\n     Basic\n    </em>\n    presumption, we held that it should be left to the merits stage, because it does not bear on the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). We reasoned that materiality is an objective issue susceptible to common, classwide proof. 568 U.S., at ----, 133 S.Ct., at 1195-1196. We also noted that a failure to prove materiality would necessarily defeat every plaintiff's claim on the merits; it would not simply preclude invocation of the presumption and thereby cause individual questions of reliance to predominate over common ones.\n    <em>\n     Ibid.\n    </em>\n    See also\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at ----, 133 S.Ct., at 1199-1200. In this latter respect, we explained, materiality differs from the publicity and market efficiency prerequisites, neither of which is necessary to prove a Rule 10b-5 claim on the merits.\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at ---- - ----, 133 S.Ct., at 1198-1200.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    EPJ Fund argues that much of the foregoing could be said of price impact as well. Fair enough. But price impact differs from materiality in a crucial respect. Given that the other\n    <em>\n     Basic\n    </em>\n    prerequisites must still be proved at the class certification stage, the common issue of materiality can be left to the merits stage without risking the certification of classes in which individual issues will end up overwhelming common ones. And because materiality is a discrete issue that can be resolved in isolation from the other prerequisites, it can be wholly confined to the merits stage.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Price impact is different. The fact that a misrepresentation \"was reflected in the market price at the time of [the] transaction\"-that it had price impact-is \"\n    <em>\n     Basic\n    </em>\n    's fundamental premise.\"\n    <em>\n     Halliburton I,\n    </em>\n    563 U.S., at ----, 131 S.Ct., at 2186. It thus has everything to do with the issue of predominance at the class certification stage. That is why, if reliance is to be shown through the\n    <em>\n     Basic\n    </em>\n    presumption, the publicity and market efficiency prerequisites must be proved before class certification. Without proof of those prerequisites, the fraud-on-the-market theory underlying the presumption completely collapses, rendering class certification inappropriate.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    But as explained, publicity and market efficiency are nothing more than prerequisites for an indirect showing of price impact. There is no dispute that at least such indirect proof of price impact \"is needed to ensure that the questions of law or fact common to the class will 'predominate.' \"\n    <em>\n     Amgen,\n    </em>\n    568 U.S., at ----, 133 S.Ct., at 1195 (emphasis deleted); see\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at ----, 133 S.Ct., at 1198-1199. That is\n    so even though such proof is also highly relevant at the merits stage.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Our choice in this case, then, is not between allowing price impact evidence at the class certification stage or relegating it to the merits. Evidence of price impact will be before the court at the certification stage in any event. The choice, rather, is between limiting the price impact inquiry before class certification to indirect evidence, or allowing consideration of direct evidence as well. As explained, we see no reason to artificially limit the inquiry at the certification stage to indirect evidence of price impact. Defendants may seek to defeat the\n    <em>\n     Basic\n    </em>\n    presumption at that stage through direct as well as indirect price impact evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    * * *\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    More than 25 years ago, we held that plaintiffs could satisfy the reliance element of the Rule 10b-5 cause of action by invoking a presumption that a public, material misrepresentation will distort the price of stock traded in an efficient market, and that anyone who purchases the stock at the market price may be considered to have done so in reliance on the misrepresentation. We adhere to that decision and decline to modify the prerequisites for invoking the presumption of reliance. But to maintain the consistency of the presumption with the class certification requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, defendants must be afforded an opportunity before class certification to defeat the presumption through evidence that an alleged misrepresentation did not actually affect the market price of the stock.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Because the courts below denied Halliburton that opportunity, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    <em>\n     It is so ordered.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    <strong>\n     Justice GINSBURG, with whom Justice BREYER and Justice SOTOMAYOR join, concurring.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Advancing price impact consideration from the merits stage to the certification stage may broaden the scope of discovery available at certification.

As it turns out, however, the realities of class-action procedure make rebuttal based on an individual plaintiff's lack of reliance virtually impossible. At the class-certification stage, rebuttal is only directed at the class representatives, which means that counsel only needs to find one class member who can withstand the challenge. See Grundfest, Damages and Reliance Under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 69 Bus. Lawyer 307, 362 (2014). After class certification, courts have refused to allow defendants to challenge any plaintiff's reliance on the integrity of the market price prior to a determination on classwide liability. See Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America et al. as\n    <em>\n     Amici Curiae\n    </em>\n    13-14 (collecting cases rejecting postcertification attempts to rebut individual class members' reliance on price integrity as not pertinent to classwide liability). One search for rebuttals on individual-reliance grounds turned up only six cases out of the thousands of Rule 10b-5 actions brought since\n    <em>\n     Basic\n    </em>\n    . Grundfest,\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 360.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fr7\" name=\"fr7\">\n      7\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    The apparent unavailability of this form of rebuttal has troubling implications. Because the presumption is conclusive in practice with respect to investors' reliance on price integrity, even\n    <em>\n     Basic\n    </em>\n    's watered-down reliance requirement has been effectively eliminated. Once the presumption attaches, the reliance element is no longer an obstacle to prevailing on the claim, even though many class members will not have transacted in reliance on price integrity, see\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2421 - 2422.
