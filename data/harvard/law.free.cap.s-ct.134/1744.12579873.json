For reasons we explain in\n   <em>\n    Octane\n   </em>\n   , the determination whether a case is \"exceptional\" under \u00a7 285 is a matter of discretion. And as in our prior cases involving similar determinations, the exceptional-case determination is to be reviewed only for abuse of discretion.\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fr2\" name=\"fr2\">\n     2\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Pierce,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775136\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/552/#p558\">\n    487 U.S., at 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775136\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/552/#p558\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (determinations whether a litigating position is \"substantially justified\" for purposes of fee-shifting under the Equal Access to Justice Act are to be reviewed for abuse of discretion);\n   <em>\n    Cooter &amp; Gell v.
