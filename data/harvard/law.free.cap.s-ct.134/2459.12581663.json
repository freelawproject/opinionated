Plan participants may direct their contributions into any of a number of investment options, including an \"employee stock ownership plan\" (ESOP), which invests its funds primarily in Fifth Third stock. Respondents, former Fifth Third employees and ESOP participants, filed this lawsuit against petitioners, Fifth Third and several of its officers who are alleged to be fiduciaries of the ESOP. The complaint alleges that petitioners breached the fiduciary duty of prudence imposed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201104\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B). Specifically, the complaint alleges that petitioners should have known-on the basis of both publicly available information and inside information available to petitioners because they were Fifth Third officers-that Fifth Third stock was overpriced and excessively risky. It further alleges that a prudent fiduciary in petitioners' position would have responded to this information by selling off the ESOP's holdings of Fifth Third stock, refraining from purchasing more Fifth Third stock, or disclosing the negative inside information so that the market could correct the stock's price downward. According to the complaint, petitioners did none of these things, and the price of Fifth Third stock ultimately fell, reducing respondents' retirement savings. The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim, but the Sixth Circuit reversed. It concluded that ESOP fiduciaries are entitled to a\n   \"presumption of prudence\" that does not apply to other ERISA fiduciaries but that the presumption is an evidentiary one and therefore does not apply at the pleading stage. The court went on to hold that the complaint stated a claim for breach of fiduciary duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Held\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   1. ESOP fiduciaries are not entitled to any special presumption of prudence. Rather, they are subject to the same duty of prudence that applies to ERISA fiduciaries in general, \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(B), except that they need not diversify the fund's assets, \u00a7 1104(a)(2). This conclusion follows from the relevant provisions of ERISA. Section 1104(a)(1)(B) \"imposes a 'prudent person' standard by which to measure fiduciaries' investment decisions and disposition of assets.\"\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v.

And \u00a7 1104(a)(2) establishes the extent to which those duties are loosened in the ESOP context by providing that \"the diversification requirement of [\u00a7 1104(a)(1)(C) ] and the prudence requirement (only to the extent that it requires diversification) of [\u00a7 1104(a)(1)(B) ] [are] not violated by acquisition or holding of [employer stock].\" Section 1104(a)(2) makes no reference to a special \"presumption\" in favor of ESOP fiduciaries and does not require plaintiffs to allege that the employer was,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   on the \"brink of collapse.\" It simply modifies the duties imposed by \u00a7 1104(a)(1) in a precisely delineated way. Thus, aside from the fact that ESOP fiduciaries are not liable for losses that result from a failure to diversify, they are subject to the duty of prudence like other ERISA fiduciaries.

Pp. 2471 - 2473.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   (a) Where a stock is publicly traded, allegations that a fiduciary should have recognized on the basis of publicly available information that the market was overvaluing or undervaluing the stock are generally implausible and thus insufficient to state a claim under\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   . Pp. 2471 - 2472.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   (b) To state a claim for breach of the duty of prudence, a complaint must plausibly allege an alternative action that the defendant could have taken, that would have been legal, and that a prudent fiduciary in the same circumstances would not have viewed as more likely to harm the fund than to help it. Where the complaint alleges that a fiduciary was imprudent in failing to act on the basis of inside information, the analysis is informed by the following points. First, ERISA's duty of prudence never requires a fiduciary to break the law, and so a fiduciary cannot be imprudent for failing to buy or sell stock in violation of the insider trading laws. Second, where a complaint faults fiduciaries for failing to decide, based on negative inside information, to refrain from making additional stock purchases or for failing to publicly disclose that information so that the stock would no longer be overvalued, courts should consider the extent to which imposing an ERISA-based obligation either to refrain from making a planned trade or to disclose inside information to the public could conflict with the complex insider trading and corporate disclosure requirements set forth by the federal securities laws or with the objectives of those laws. Third, courts confronted with such claims should consider whether the complaint\n   has plausibly alleged that a prudent fiduciary in the defendant's position could not have concluded that stopping purchases or publicly disclosing negative information would do more harm than good to the fund by causing a drop in the stock price and a concomitant drop in the value of the stock already held by the fund.

This case focuses upon that duty of prudence as applied to the fiduciary of an \"employee stock ownership plan\" (ESOP), a type of pension plan that invests primarily in the stock of the company that employs the plan participants.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    We consider whether, when an ESOP fiduciary's decision to buy or hold the employer's stock is challenged in court, the fiduciary is entitled to a defense-friendly standard that the lower courts have called a \"presumption of prudence.\" The Courts of Appeals that have considered the question have held that such a presumption does apply, with the presumption generally defined as a requirement that the plaintiff make a showing that would not be required in an ordinary duty-of-prudence case, such as that the employer was on the brink of collapse.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    We hold that no such presumption applies. Instead, ESOP fiduciaries are subject to the same duty of prudence that applies to ERISA fiduciaries in general, except that they need not diversify the fund's assets. \u00a7 1104(a)(2).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    <strong>\n     I\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    Petitioner Fifth Third Bancorp, a large financial services firm, maintains for its employees a defined-contribution retirement savings plan. Employees may choose to contribute a portion of their compensation to the Plan as retirement savings, and Fifth Third provides matching contributions of up to 4% of an employee's compensation. The Plan's assets are invested in 20 separate funds, including\n    mutual funds and an ESOP. Plan participants can allocate their contributions among the funds however they like; Fifth Third's matching contributions, on the other hand, are always invested initially in the ESOP, though the participant can then choose to move them to another fund. The Plan requires the ESOP's funds to be \"invested primarily in shares of common stock of Fifth Third.\" App. 350.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    Respondents, who are former Fifth Third employees and ESOP participants, filed this putative class action in Federal District Court in Ohio. They claim that petitioners, Fifth Third and various Fifth Third officers, were fiduciaries of the Plan and violated the duties of loyalty and prudence imposed by ERISA. See \u00a7\u00a7 1109(a), 1132(a)(2). We limit our review to the duty-of-prudence claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    The complaint alleges that by July 2007, the fiduciaries knew or should have known that Fifth Third's stock was overvalued and excessively risky for two separate reasons. First, publicly available information such as newspaper articles provided early warning signs that subprime lending, which formed a large part of Fifth Third's business, would soon leave creditors high and dry as the housing market collapsed and subprime borrowers became unable to pay off their mortgages. Second, nonpublic information (which petitioners knew because they were Fifth Third insiders) indicated that Fifth Third officers had deceived the market by making material misstatements about the company's financial prospects. Those misstatements led the market to overvalue Fifth Third stock-the ESOP's primary investment-and so petitioners, using the participants' money, were consequently paying more for that stock than it was worth.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    The complaint further alleges that a prudent fiduciary in petitioners' position would have responded to this information in one or more of the following ways: (1) by selling the ESOP's holdings of Fifth Third stock before the value of those holdings declined, (2) by refraining from purchasing any more Fifth Third stock, (3) by canceling the Plan's ESOP option, and (4) by disclosing the inside information so that the market would adjust its valuation of Fifth Third stock downward and the ESOP would no longer be overpaying for it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    Rather than follow any of these courses of action, petitioners continued to hold and buy Fifth Third stock. Then the market crashed, and Fifth Third's stock price fell by 74% between July 2007 and September 2009, when the complaint was filed. Since the ESOP's funds were invested primarily in Fifth Third stock, this fall in price eliminated a large part of the retirement savings that the participants had invested in the ESOP. (The stock has since made a partial recovery to around half of its July 2007 price.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4272386\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/757/753/\">\n     757 F.Supp.2d 753\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (S.D.Ohio 2010).

Thus, the Third Circuit has held that \"an ESOP fiduciary who invests the [ESOP's] assets in employer stock is entitled to a presumption that it acted consistently with ERISA\" in doing so.\n    <em>\n     Moench v.

The Ninth Circuit has said that to \"overcome the presumption of prudent investment, plaintiffs must ... make allegations that clearly implicate the company's viability as an ongoing concern or show a precipitous decline in the employer's stock ... combined with evidence that the company is on the brink of collapse or is undergoing serious mismanagement.\"\n    <em>\n     Quan v.

In petitioners' view, the \"purpose of the plan,\" in the case of an ESOP, is promoting employee ownership of the employer's stock over the long term. And, petitioners assert, that purpose is \"substantially impair[ed]\"-rendering continued investment imprudent-only when \"a serious threat to the employer's viability\" makes it likely that the employer will go out of business. This is because the goal of employee ownership will be substantially impaired only if the employer goes out of business, leaving the employees with no company to own.\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 24.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    We must decide whether ERISA contains some such presumption.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    <strong>\n     III\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    <strong>\n     A\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    In our view, the law does not create a special presumption favoring ESOP fiduciaries. Rather, the same standard of prudence applies to all ERISA fiduciaries, including ESOP fiduciaries, except that an ESOP fiduciary is under no duty to diversify the ESOP's holdings. This conclusion follows from the pertinent provisions of ERISA, which are set forth above.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Section 1104(a)(1)(B) \"imposes a 'prudent person' standard by which to measure fiduciaries' investment decisions and disposition of assets.\"\n    <em>\n     Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196892\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/134/#p143\">\n     473 U.S. 134\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 143, n. 10,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196892\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/134/#p143\">\n     105 S.Ct. 3085\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196892\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/134/#p143\">\n     87 L.Ed.2d 96\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1985). Section 1104(a)(1)(C) requires ERISA fiduciaries to diversify plan assets. And \u00a7 1104(a)(2) establishes the extent to which those duties are loosened in the ESOP context to ensure that employers are permitted and encouraged to offer ESOPs. Section 1104(a)(2) makes no reference to a special \"presumption\" in favor of ESOP fiduciaries. It does not require plaintiffs to allege that the employer was on the \"brink of collapse,\" under \"extraordinary circumstances,\" or the like. Instead, \u00a7 1104(a)(2) simply modifies the duties imposed by \u00a7 1104(a)(1) in a precisely delineated way: It provides that an ESOP fiduciary is exempt from \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(C)'s diversification requirement and also from \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(B)'s duty of prudence, but \"\n    <em>\n     only to the extent that it requires diversification\n    </em>\n    .\" \u00a7 1104(a)(2) (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Thus, ESOP fiduciaries, unlike ERISA fiduciaries generally, are not liable for losses that result from a failure to diversify. But aside from that distinction, because ESOP fiduciaries are ERISA fiduciaries and because \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(B)'s duty of prudence applies to all ERISA fiduciaries, ESOP fiduciaries are subject to the duty of prudence just as other ERISA fiduciaries are.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    <strong>\n     B\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Petitioners make several arguments to the contrary. First, petitioners argue that the special purpose of an ESOP-investing participants' savings in the stock of their employer-calls for a presumption that such investments are prudent. Their argument is as follows: ERISA defines the duty of prudence in terms of what a prudent person would do \"in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.\" \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(B). The \"character\" and \"aims\" of an ESOP differ from those of an ordinary retirement investment, such as a diversified mutual fund. An ordinary plan seeks (1) to maximize retirement savings\n    for participants while (2) avoiding excessive risk. But an ESOP also seeks (3) to promote employee ownership of employer stock. For instance, Fifth Third's Plan requires the ESOP's assets to be \"invested primarily in shares of common stock of Fifth Third.\" App. 350. In light of this additional goal, an ESOP fiduciary's decision to buy more shares of employer stock, even if it would be imprudent were it viewed solely as an attempt to secure financial retirement benefits while avoiding excessive risk, might nonetheless be prudent if understood as an attempt to promote employee ownership of employer stock, a goal that Congress views as important. See Tax Reform Act of 1976, \u00a7 803(h),\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=90%20Stat.%201590\">\n     90 Stat. 1590\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Thus, a claim that an ESOP fiduciary's investment in employer stock was imprudent as a way of securing retirement savings should be viewed unfavorably because, unless the company was about to go out of business, that investment was advancing the additional goal of employee ownership of employer stock.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    We cannot accept the claim that underlies this argument, namely, that the content of ERISA's duty of prudence varies depending upon the specific nonpecuniary goal set out in an ERISA plan, such as what petitioners claim is the nonpecuniary goal here. Taken in context, \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(B)'s reference to \"an enterprise of a like character and with like aims\" means an enterprise with what the immediately preceding provision calls the \"exclusive purpose\" to be pursued by all ERISA fiduciaries: \"providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries\" while \"defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan.\" \u00a7\u00a7 1104(a)(1)(A)(i), (ii). Read in the context of ERISA as a whole, the term \"benefits\" in the provision just quoted must be understood to refer to the sort of\n    <em>\n     financial\n    </em>\n    benefits (such as retirement income) that trustees who manage investments typically seek to secure for the trust's beneficiaries. Cf. \u00a7 1002(2)(A) (defining \"employee pension benefit plan\" and \"pension plan\" to mean plans that provide employees with \"retirement income\" or other \"deferral of income\"). The term does not cover nonpecuniary benefits like those supposed to arise from employee ownership of employer stock.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Consider the statute's requirement that fiduciaries act \"in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan\n    <em>\n     insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the provisions of this subchapter\n    </em>\n    .\" \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(D) (emphasis added). This provision makes clear that the duty of prudence trumps the instructions of a plan document, such as an instruction to invest exclusively in employer stock even if financial goals demand the contrary. See also \u00a7 1110(a) (With irrelevant exceptions, \"any provision in an agreement or instrument which purports to relieve a fiduciary from responsibility ... for any ... duty under this part shall be void as against public policy\"). This rule would make little sense if, as petitioners argue, the duty of prudence is defined by the aims of the particular plan as set out in the plan documents, since in that case the duty of prudence could never conflict with a plan document.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Consider also \u00a7 1104(a)(2), which exempts an ESOP fiduciary from \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(B)'s duty of prudence but \"only to the extent that it requires diversification.\" What need would there be for this specific provision were the nature of \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(B)'s duty of prudence altered anyway in the case of an ESOP in light of the ESOP's aim of promoting employee ownership of employer stock?

But we are not convinced that Congress\n    <em>\n     also\n    </em>\n    sought to promote ESOPs by further relaxing the duty of prudence as applied to ESOPs with the sort of presumption proposed by petitioners.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Second, and relatedly, petitioners contend that the duty of prudence should be read in light of the rule under the common law of trusts that \"the settlor can reduce or waive the prudent man standard of care by specific language in the trust instrument.\" G. Bogert &amp; G. Bogert, Law of Trusts and Trustees \u00a7 541, p. 172 (rev. 2d ed. 1993); see also Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 174, Comment\n    <em>\n     d\n    </em>\n    (1957) (\"By the terms of the trust the requirement of care and skill may be relaxed or modified\"). The argument is that, by commanding the ESOP fiduciary to invest primarily in Fifth Third stock, the plan documents waived the duty of prudence to the extent that it comes into conflict with investment in Fifth Third stock-at least unless \"extraordinary circumstances\" arise that so threaten the goal of employee ownership of Fifth Third stock that the fiduciaries must assume that the settlor would want them to depart from that goal under the common-law \"deviation doctrine.\" See\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201104\">\n      id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 167. This argument fails, however, in light of this Court's holding that, by contrast to the rule at common law, \"trust documents cannot excuse trustees from their duties under ERISA.\"\n    <em>\n     Central States, Southeast &amp; Southwest Areas Pension Fund,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1512303\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/472/559/#p570\">\n     472 U.S., at 568\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1512303\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/472/559/#p570\">\n     105 S.Ct. 2833\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201104\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1104\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(1)(D), 1110(a).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Third, petitioners argue that subjecting ESOP fiduciaries to a duty of prudence without the protection of a special presumption will lead to conflicts with the legal prohibition on insider trading. The potential for conflict arises because ESOP fiduciaries often are company insiders and because suits against insider fiduciaries frequently allege, as the complaint in this case alleges, that the fiduciaries were imprudent in failing to act on inside information they had about the value of the employer's stock.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    This concern is a legitimate one. But an ESOP-specific rule that a fiduciary does not act imprudently in buying or holding company stock unless the company is on the brink of collapse (or the like) is an ill-fitting means of addressing it. While ESOP fiduciaries may be more likely to have insider information about a company that the fund is investing in than are other ERISA fiduciaries, the potential for conflict with the securities laws would be the same for a non-ESOP fiduciary who had relevant inside information about a potential investment. And the potential for conflict is the same for an ESOP fiduciary whose company is on the brink of collapse as for a fiduciary who is invested in a healthier company. (Surely a fiduciary is not obligated to break the insider trading laws even if his company is about to fail.) The potential for conflict therefore does not persuade us to accept a presumption of\n    the sort adopted by the lower courts and proposed by petitioners. We discuss alternative means of dealing with the potential for conflict in Part IV,\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Finally, petitioners argue that, without some sort of special presumption, the threat of costly duty-of-prudence lawsuits will deter companies from offering ESOPs to their employees, contrary to the stated intent of Congress. Cf.\n    <em>\n     Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins.

ESOP plans instruct their fiduciaries to invest in company stock, and \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(D) requires fiduciaries to follow plan documents so long as they do not conflict with ERISA. Thus, in many cases an ESOP fiduciary who fears that continuing to invest in company stock may be imprudent finds himself between a rock and a hard place: If he keeps investing and the stock goes down he may be sued for acting imprudently in violation of \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(B), but if he stops investing and the stock goes up he may be sued for disobeying the plan documents in violation of \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(D).

The complaint alleges, among other things, that petitioners \"continued to allow the Plan's investment in Fifth Third Stock even during the time that the stock price was declining in value as a result of [the] collapse of the housing market\" and that \"[a] prudent fiduciary facing similar circumstances would not have stood idly by as the Plan's assets were decimated.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 53.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    In our view, where a stock is publicly traded, allegations that a fiduciary should have recognized from publicly available information alone that the market was over- or undervaluing the stock are implausible as a general rule, at least in the absence of special circumstances.

In this case, the Court of Appeals held that the complaint stated a claim because respondents \"allege that Fifth Third engaged in lending practices that were equivalent to participation in the subprime lending market, that Defendants were aware of the risks of such investments by the start of the class period, and that such risks made Fifth Third stock an imprudent investment.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3514372\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/692/410/\">\n     692 F.3d, at 419-420\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Court of Appeals did not point to any special circumstance rendering reliance on the market price imprudent.

In particular, the complaint alleges that petitioners had inside information indicating that the market was overvaluing Fifth Third stock and that they could have used this information to prevent losses to the fund by (1) selling the ESOP's holdings of Fifth Third stock; (2) refraining from future stock purchases (including by removing the Plan's ESOP option altogether); or (3) publicly disclosing the inside information so that the market would correct the stock price downward, with the result that the ESOP could continue to buy Fifth Third stock without paying an inflated price for it. See App. 17, 88-89, 113.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    To state a claim for breach of the duty of prudence on the basis of inside information, a plaintiff must plausibly allege an alternative action that the defendant could have taken that would have been consistent with the securities laws and that a prudent fiduciary in the same circumstances would not have viewed as more likely to harm the fund than to help it. The following three points inform the requisite analysis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    First, in deciding whether the complaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted, courts must bear in mind that the duty of prudence, under ERISA as under the common law of trusts, does not require a fiduciary to break the law. Cf. Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 166, Comment\n    <em>\n     a\n    </em>\n    (\"The trustee is not under a duty to the beneficiary to do an act which is criminal or tortious\"). Federal securities laws \"are violated when a corporate insider trades in the securities of his corporation on the basis of material, nonpublic information.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v.

As every Court of Appeals to address the question has held, ERISA's duty of prudence cannot require an ESOP fiduciary to perform an action-such as divesting the fund's holdings of the employer's stock on the basis of inside information-that would violate the securities laws.

To the extent that the Sixth Circuit denied dismissal based on the theory that the duty of prudence required petitioners to sell the ESOP's holdings of Fifth Third stock, its denial of dismissal was erroneous.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Second, where a complaint faults fiduciaries for failing to decide, on the basis of the inside information, to refrain from making additional stock purchases or for failing to disclose that information to the public so that the stock would no longer be overvalued, additional considerations arise. The courts should consider the extent to which an ERISA-based obligation either to refrain on the basis of inside information from making a planned trade or to disclose inside information to the public could conflict with the complex insider trading and corporate disclosure requirements imposed by the federal securities laws or with the objectives of those laws.
