Lane eventually terminated Schmitz' employment. Shortly thereafter, federal authorities indicted Schmitz on charges of mail fraud and theft concerning a program receiving federal funds. Lane testified, under subpoena, regarding the events that led to his terminating Schmitz. Schmitz was convicted and sentenced to 30 months in prison. Meanwhile, CITY was experiencing significant budget shortfalls. Respondent Franks, then CACC's president, terminated Lane along with 28 other employees in a claimed effort to address the financial difficulties. A few days later, however, Franks rescinded all but 2 of the 29 terminations-those of Lane and one other employee. Lane sued Franks in his individual and official capacities under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , alleging that Franks had violated the First Amendment by firing him in retaliation for testifying against Schmitz.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The District Court granted Franks' motion for summary judgment, holding that the individual-capacity claims were barred by qualified immunity and the official-capacity claims were barred by the Eleventh Amendment.

Pp. 2378 - 2380.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (1) Sworn testimony in judicial proceedings is a quintessential example of citizen speech for the simple reason that anyone who testifies in court bears an obligation, to the court and society at large, to tell the truth. That obligation is distinct and independent from any separate obligations a testifying public employee might have to his employer. The Eleventh Circuit read\n   <em>\n    Garcetti\n   </em>\n   far too broadly in holding that Lane did not speak as a citizen when he testified simply because he learned of the subject matter of that testimony in the course of his employment.\n   <em>\n    Garcetti\n   </em>\n   said nothing about speech that relates to public employment or concerns information learned in the course of that employment. The critical question under\n   <em>\n    Garcetti\n   </em>\n   is whether the speech at issue is itself ordinarily within the scope of an employee's duties, not whether it merely concerns those duties. Indeed, speech by public employees on subject matter related to their employment holds special value precisely because those employees gain knowledge of matters of public concern through their employment. Pp. 2378 - 2380.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (2) Whether speech is a matter of public concern turns on the \"content, form, and context\" of the speech.\n   <em>\n    Connick v. Myers,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298262\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/138/#p147\">\n    461 U.S. 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 147-148,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298262\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/138/#p147\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298262\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/138/#p147\">\n    75 L.Ed.2d 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, corruption in a public program and misuse of state funds obviously involve matters of significant public concern. See\n   <em>\n    Garcetti,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275534\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/410/#p421\">\n    547 U.S., at 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275534\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/410/#p421\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And the form and context of the speech-sworn testimony in a judicial proceeding-fortify that conclusion. See\n   <em>\n    United States v. Alvarez,\n   </em>\n   567 U.S. ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407413\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/709/#p2546\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2546,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407413\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/709/#p2546\">\n    183 L.Ed.2d 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . P. 2380.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (c) Turning to\n   <em>\n    Pickering\n   </em>\n   's second step, the employer's side of the scale is entirely empty. Respondents do not assert, and cannot demonstrate, any government interest that tips the balance in their favor-for instance, evidence that Lane's testimony was false or erroneous or that Lane unnecessarily disclosed sensitive, confidential, or privileged information while testifying. Pp. 2380 - 2381.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   2. Franks is entitled to qualified immunity for the claims against him in his individual capacity. The question here is whether Franks reasonably could have believed that, when he fired Lane, a government employer could fire an employee because of testimony the employee gave, under oath and outside the scope of his ordinary job responsibilities. See\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v. al-Kidd,\n   </em>\n   563 U.S. ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924024,12459540\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2074/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924024,12459540\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2074/\">\n    179 L.Ed.2d 1149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At the relevant time, Eleventh Circuit precedent did not preclude Franks from holding that belief, and no decision of this Court was sufficiently clear to cast doubt on controlling Circuit precedent. Any discrepancies in Eleventh Circuit precedent only serve to highlight the dispositive point that the question was not beyond debate at the time Franks acted.

Rather, the First Amendment protection of a public employee's speech depends on a careful balance \"between the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\"\n    <em>\n     Pickering v.

In\n    <em>\n     Pickering,\n    </em>\n    the Court struck the balance in favor of the public employee, extending First Amendment protection to a teacher who was fired after writing a letter to the editor of a local newspaper criticizing the school board that employed him. Today, we consider whether the First Amendment similarly protects a public employee who provided truthful sworn testimony, compelled by subpoena, outside the course of\n    his ordinary job responsibilities. We hold that it does.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    <strong>\n     I\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    In 2006, Central Alabama Community College (CACC) hired petitioner Edward Lane to be the Director of Community Intensive Training for Youth (CITY), a statewide program for underprivileged youth. CACC hired Lane on a probationary basis. In his capacity as Director, Lane was responsible for overseeing CITY's day-to-day operations, hiring and firing employees, and making decisions with respect to the program's finances.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    At the time of Lane's appointment, CITY faced significant financial difficulties. That prompted Lane to conduct a comprehensive audit of the program's expenses. The audit revealed that Suzanne Schmitz, an Alabama State Representative on CITY's payroll, had not been reporting to her CITY office. After unfruitful discussions with Schmitz, Lane shared his finding with CACC's president and its attorney. They warned him that firing Schmitz could have negative repercussions for him and CACC.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Lane nonetheless contacted Schmitz again and instructed her to show up to the Huntsville office to serve as a counselor. Schmitz refused; she responded that she wished to \" 'continue to serve the CITY program in the same manner as [she had] in the past.' \"\n    <em>\n     Lane v. Central Ala.

In November 2006, Lane testified before a federal grand jury about his reasons for firing Schmitz. In January 2008, the grand jury indicted Schmitz on four counts of mail fraud and four counts of theft concerning a program receiving federal funds. See\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Lane testified, under subpoena, regarding the events that led to his terminating Schmitz. The jury failed to reach a verdict. Roughly six months later, federal prosecutors retried Schmitz, and Lane testified once again. This time, the jury convicted Schmitz on three counts of mail fraud and four counts of theft concerning a program receiving federal funds. The District Court sentenced her to 30 months in prison and ordered her to pay $177,251.82 in restitution and forfeiture.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Meanwhile, CITY continued to experience considerable budget shortfalls. In November 2008, Lane began reporting to respondent Steve Franks, who had become president of CACC in January 2008. Lane recommended that Franks consider layoffs to address the financial difficulties. In January 2009, Franks decided to terminate 29 probationary CITY employees, including Lane. Shortly thereafter, however, Franks rescinded all but 2 of the 29 terminations-those of Lane and one other employee-because of an \"ambiguity in [those other employees'] probationary service.\" Brief for Respondent Franks 11.

But this debate over whether\n    <em>\n     Martinez\n    </em>\n    or\n    <em>\n     Morris\n    </em>\n    applies to Lane's claim only highlights the dispositive point: At the time of Lane's termination, Eleventh Circuit precedent did not provide clear notice that subpoenaed testimony concerning information acquired through public employment is speech of a citizen entitled to First\n    Amendment protection. At best, Lane can demonstrate only a discrepancy in Eleventh Circuit precedent, which is insufficient to defeat the defense of qualified immunity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Finally, Lane argues that decisions of the Third and Seventh Circuits put Franks on notice that his firing of Lane was unconstitutional. See\n    <em>\n     Reilly,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4030908\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/532/216/#p231\">\n     532 F.3d, at 231\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (C.A.3) (truthful testimony in court is citizen speech protected by the First Amendment);\n    <em>\n     Morales v.

But, as the court below acknowledged, those precedents were in direct conflict with Eleventh Circuit precedent. See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=523%20Fed.%20Appx.%20709\">\n     523 Fed.Appx., at 712, n. 3\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    There is no doubt that the Eleventh Circuit incorrectly concluded that Lane's testimony was not entitled to First Amendment protection. But because the question was not \"beyond debate\" at the time Franks acted,\n    <em>\n     al-Kidd,\n    </em>\n    563 U.S., at ----, 131 S.Ct., at 2083, Franks is entitled to qualified immunity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    <strong>\n     V\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Lane's speech is entitled to First Amendment protection, but because respondent Franks is entitled to qualified immunity, we affirm the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit as to the claims against Franks in his individual capacity. Our decision does not resolve, however, the claims against Burrow-initially brought against Franks when he served as President of CACC-in her official capacity. Although the District Court dismissed those claims for prospective relief as barred by the Eleventh Amendment, the Eleventh Circuit declined to consider that question on appeal, see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=523%20Fed.%20Appx.%20709\">\n     523 Fed.Appx., at 711\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Because Lane has failed to establish a\n    <em>\n     prima facie\n    </em>\n    case of retaliation, we do not decide about Franks' defense of sovereign immunity\"), and the parties have not asked us to consider it now. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit as to those claims and remand for further proceedings.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    * * *\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    <em>\n     It is so ordered.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    <strong>\n     Justice THOMAS, with whom Justice SCALIA and Justice ALITO join, concurring.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    This case presents the discrete question whether a public employee speaks \"as a citizen on a matter of public concern,\"\n    <em>\n     Garcetti v.

Answering that question requires little more than a straightforward application of\n    <em>\n     Garcetti\n    </em>\n    . There, we held that when a public employee speaks \"pursuant to\" his official duties, he is not speaking \"as a citizen,\" and First Amendment protection is unavailable.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275534\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/410/#p421\">\n     547 U.S., at 421-422\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275534\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/410/#p421\">\n     126 S.Ct. 1951\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The petitioner in this case did not speak \"pursuant to\" his ordinary job duties because his responsibilities did not include testifying in court proceedings, see\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2378, n. 4, and no party has suggested that he was subpoenaed as a representative of his employer, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 30(b)(6) (requiring subpoenaed organizations to designate witnesses to testify on their behalf). Because petitioner did not testify to \"fulfil[l] a [work] responsibility,\"\n    <em>\n     Garcetti,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 421,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275534\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/410/#p421\">\n     126 S.Ct. 1951\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , he spoke \"as a citizen,\" not as an employee.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    We accordingly have no occasion to address the quite different question whether a public employee speaks \"as a citizen\" when he testifies in the course of his ordinary job responsibilities. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2378, n. 4. For some public employees-such as police officers, crime scene technicians, and laboratory analysts-testifying is a routine and critical part of their employment duties. Others may be called to testify in the context of particular litigation as the designated representatives of their employers. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 30(b)(6). The Court properly leaves the constitutional questions raised by these scenarios for another day.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"*\">\n    <p id=\"p-89\">\n     The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.

For that reason, Lane asked the Court to decide only whether truthful sworn testimony that is not a part of an employee's ordinary job responsibilities is citizen speech on a matter of public concern.
