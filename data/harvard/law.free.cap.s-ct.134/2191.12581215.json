A sponsored individual, known as the principal beneficiary, is placed into a \"family preference\" category based on his relationship with the petitioner.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201153\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)-(4). The principal beneficiary's spouse and minor children in turn qualify as derivative beneficiaries, \"entitled to the same status\" and \"order of consideration\" as the principal. \u00a7 1153(d). The beneficiaries then become eligible to apply for visas in order of \"priority date\"-that is, the date a petition was filed. \u00a7 1153(e)(1). Because the immigration process often takes years or decades to complete, a child seeking to immigrate may \"age out\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   reach adulthood and lose her immigration status-before she reaches the front of the visa queue. The Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) sets forth a remedy in that circumstance, providing that \"[i]f the age of an alien is determined ... to be 21 years of age or older,\" notwithstanding certain allowances for bureaucratic delay, \u00a7\u00a7 1153(h)(1)-(2), \"the alien's petition shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date issued upon receipt of the original petition.\" \u00a7 1153(h)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Respondents, principal beneficiaries who became LPRs, filed petitions for their aged-out children, asserting that the newly filed petitions should receive the same priority date as their original petitions. Instead, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) gave the new petitions current priority dates. The District Court granted the Government summary judgment, deferring to the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA's) determination that only those petitions that can be seamlessly converted from one family preference category to another without the need for a new sponsor are entitled to conversion under \u00a7 1153(h)(3). The en banc Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the provision unambiguously entitled all aged-out derivative beneficiaries to automatic conversion and priority date retention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em>\n    Held\n   </em>\n   : The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3527616\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/695/1003/\">\n    695 F.3d 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , reversed and remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Justice KAGAN, joined by Justice KENNEDY and Justice GINSBURG, concluded that the BIA's textually reasonable construction of \u00a7 1153(h)(3)'s ambiguous\n   language was entitled to deference. Pp. 2203 - 2213.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   (a) Because \u00a7 1153(h)(3) does not speak unambiguously to the issue here, a court must defer to the BIA's reasonable interpretation. See\n   <em>\n    Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/#p844\">\n    467 U.S. 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 844,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/#p844\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/#p844\">\n    81 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The first clause of \u00a7 1153(h)(3) states a condition that encompasses every aged-out beneficiary of a family preference petition. The second clause, however, does not easily cohere with the first. It prescribes a remedy that can apply to only a subset of the beneficiaries described in the first clause. This remedial prescription directs immigration officials to take the alien's petition and convert it from a category benefitting a child to an appropriate category for adults, without any change in the petition, including its sponsor, or any new filing. Moreover, this conversion is to be \"automati[c]\"-that is, one involving no additional decisions, contingencies, or delays. Thus, the only aliens who may benefit from \u00a7 1153(h)(3)'s back half are those for whom automatic conversion is possible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The understanding that \"automatic conversion\" entails nothing more than picking up the petition from one category and dropping it into another for which the alien now qualifies matches the exclusive way immigration law used the term when \u00a7 1153(h)(3) was enacted. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.2\">\n    8 CFR \u00a7 204.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(1)-(3) (2002). And Congress used the word \"conversion\" in the identical way elsewhere in the CSPA. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1151(f)(2), (3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   If the term meant more than that in \u00a7 1153(h)(3), it would undermine the family preference system's core premise: that each immigrant must have a qualified and willing sponsor. See \u00a7\u00a7 1154(a), (b). If an original sponsor does not have a legally recognized relationship with the aged-out derivative beneficiary, another sponsor,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   the old principal beneficiary, must be swapped in for the alien to qualify for a new family preference category. But immigration officials cannot assume that a new sponsor is eligible and willing to petition on the alien's behalf, given the numerous requirements the law imposes on family preference petitioners. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1154(a)(1)(B)(i)(II). Neither can they figure out whether a valid sponsor exists unless he files and USCIS approves a new petition-the very thing \u00a7 1153(h)(3) says is not required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In any case, a new qualified sponsor will rarely exist at the requisite time. An alien is deemed to age out on \"the date on which an immigrant visa number became available for the alien's parent.\" \u00a7 1153(h)(1)(A). Since aging out triggers automatic conversion, the date of automatic conversion is best viewed as the same. But at that time, the aged-out beneficiary's parent cannot yet be a citizen or LPR, and so no new, qualified sponsor will be ready to step into the old one's shoes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On the above account, \u00a7 1153(h)(3)'s second clause provides a remedy to those principal and derivative beneficiaries who had a qualifying relationship with an LPR both before and after they aged out. In contrast, aliens like respondents' children-the nieces, nephews, and grandchildren of the initial sponsors-cannot qualify for \"automatic conversion\": they lacked a qualifying preference relationship with the initial petitioner, and so cannot fit into a new preference category without obtaining a new sponsor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The ambiguity created by \u00a7 1153(h)(3)'s ill-fitting clauses left the BIA to choose how to reconcile the statute's different commands. It reasonably opted to abide by the inherent limits of \u00a7 1153(h)(3)'s remedial clause, rather than go beyond those limits so as to match the\n   sweep of the first clause's condition. When an agency thus resolves statutory tension, ordinary principles of administrative deference require this Court to defer. See\n   <em>\n    National Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573372\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/644/#p666\">\n    551 U.S. 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 666,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573372\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/644/#p666\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573372\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/644/#p666\">\n    168 L.Ed.2d 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Pp. 2203 - 2207\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (b) Respondents take issue with the BIA's interpretation, but none of their contentions is persuasive. Pp. 2207 - 2213.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (1) Respondents aver that every aged-out beneficiary could be automatically converted if immigration officials substituted new sponsors and managed the timing of conversion so that a new sponsor existed on the relevant date. These administrative maneuvers are not in keeping with the natural and long-established meaning of \"automatic conversion,\" they require conversion to occur on a date that has no connection to the alien's aging out, and they demand administrative juggling to make automatic conversion work. And that painstakingly managed process still cannot succeed because a derivative's parent may never become able to sponsor a visa-and immigration officials cannot practicably tell whether a given parent has done so. Pp. 2207 - 2210.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (2) Respondents argue that the word \"and\" in the second clause of \u00a7 1153(h)(3) indicates that priority date retention is a benefit wholly independent of automatic conversion. But \"and\" does not necessarily disjoin two phrases, and context suggests that the instructions work in tandem. In other statutory and regulatory provisions respecting \"conversions,\" retention of a priority date is conditional on a conversion occurring. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1154(k)(1)-(3). Respondent's reading would make priority date retention conditional on something the statute nowhere mentions. And it would engender unusual results that, without some clearer statement, the Court cannot conclude that Congress intended. Pp. 2210 - 2212.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (3) Finally, respondents contend that, assuming \u00a7 1153(h)(3) is ambiguous, the BIA acted unreasonably in choosing the more restrictive reading. But the BIA's interpretation benefits from administrative simplicity and fits with immigration law's basic first-come, first-served rule. By contrast, respondents would scramble the priority order Congress established by allowing aged-out derivative beneficiaries, like respondents' sons and daughters, to enter the visa queue ahead of beneficiaries who had a qualifying relationship with an LPR for a far longer time. Pp. 2212 - 2213.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by Justice SCALIA, agreed that the BIA's interpretation was reasonable, but not because an agency has authority to resolve direct conflicts within a statute. There is no conflict or internal tension in \u00a7 1153(h)(3). The first clause of the provision defines the persons potentially affected, but does not grant anything to anyone. The particular benefit provided by the statute-automatic conversion and retention of priority date-is found exclusively in the second clause, and that relief requires, at minimum, that an aged-out beneficiary have his own eligible sponsor who is committed to providing financial support for the beneficiary. Beyond that, Congress did not speak clearly to which petitions can be automatically converted. The BIA's reasonable interpretation of \u00a7 1153(h)(3) is consistent with the ordinary meaning of the statutory terms, with the established meaning of automatic conversion in immigration law, and with the structure of the family-based immigration system.

Such a sponsored individual is known as the petition's principal beneficiary. In turn, any principal beneficiary's minor child-meaning an unmarried child under the age of 21-qualifies as a derivative beneficiary, \"entitled to the same [immigration] status\" and \"order of consideration\" as his parent. \u00a7 1153(d). Accordingly, when a visa becomes available to the petition's principal beneficiary, one also becomes available to her minor child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   But what happens if, sometime after the relevant petition was filed, a minor child (whether a principal or a derivative beneficiary) has turned 21-or, in immigration lingo, has \"aged out\"? The immigration process may take years or even decades to complete, due in part to bureaucratic delays associated with reviewing immigration documents and in (still greater) part to long queues for the limited number of visas available each year. So someone who was a youngster at the start of the process may be an adult at the end, and no longer qualify for an immigration status given to minors. The Child Status Protection Act (CSPA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20Stat.%20927\">\n    116 Stat. 927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , ensures that the time Government officials have spent processing immigration papers will not count against the beneficiary in assessing his status. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201153\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(1). But even with that provision, the beneficiary may age out solely because of the time he spent waiting in line for a visa to become available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The question presented in this case is whether the CSPA grants a remedy to all aliens who have thus outpaced the immigration process-that is, all aliens who counted as child beneficiaries when a sponsoring\n   petition was filed, but no longer do so (even after excluding administrative delays) by the time they reach the front of the visa queue. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or Board) said no. It interpreted the CSPA as providing relief to only a subset of that group-specifically, those aged-out aliens who qualified or could have qualified as principal beneficiaries of a visa petition, rather than only as derivative beneficiaries piggy-backing on a parent. We now uphold the Board's determination as a permissible construction of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   An alien needs an immigrant visa to enter and permanently reside in the United States.

See \u00a7\u00a7 1151(b)(2)(A)(i), 1101(b)(1). Five other categories-crucial to this case, and often denominated \"preference\" categories-are for \"family-sponsored immigrants,\" who include more distant or independent relatives of U.S. citizens, and certain close relatives of LPRs.\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fr2\" name=\"fr2\">\n     2\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n   Specifically, those family preference categories are:\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    F1: the unmarried, adult (21 or over) sons and daughters of U.S. citizens;\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    F2A: the spouses and unmarried, minor (under 21) children of LPRs;\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    F2B: the unmarried, adult (21 or over) sons and daughters of LPRs;\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    F3: the married sons and daughters of U.S. citizens;\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    F4: the brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens. \u00a7\u00a7 1151(a)(1), 1153(a)(1)-(4).\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fr3\" name=\"fr3\">\n      3\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    (A word to the wise: Dog-ear this page for easy reference, because these categories crop up regularly throughout this opinion.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The road to obtaining any family-based immigrant visa begins when a sponsoring U.S. citizen or LPR files a petition on behalf of a foreign relative, termed the principal beneficiary.

The sponsor (otherwise known as the petitioner-we use the words interchangeably) must provide U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) with evidence showing, among other things, that she has the necessary familial relationship with the beneficiary, see \u00a7\u00a7 204.2(a)(2), (d)(2), (g)(2), and that she has not committed any conduct disqualifying her from sponsoring an alien for a visa, see,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201154\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(1)(B)(i)(II) (barring an LPR from submitting a petition if she has committed certain offenses against minors).

(The case is different for \"immediate relatives\" of U.S. citizens, who can apply for and receive a visa as soon as a sponsoring petition is approved.) The law caps the number of visas issued each year in the five family preference categories, see \u00a7\u00a7 1151(c)(1), 1152, 1153(a)(1)-(4), and demand regularly exceeds the supply. As a consequence, the principal beneficiary of an approved petition is placed in a queue with others in her category (F1, F2A, or what have you) in order of \"priority date\"-that is, the date a petition was filed with USCIS. See \u00a7 1153(e)(1);\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.1\">\n     8 CFR \u00a7 204.1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b); 22 CFR 42.53(a) (2013). Every month, the Department of State sets a cut-off date for each family preference category, indicating that visas (sometimes referred to by \"visa numbers\") are available for beneficiaries with priority dates earlier than the cut-off. See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20245.1\">\n     8 CFR \u00a7 245.1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (g)(1);\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2042.51\">\n     22 CFR \u00a7 42.51\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b). The system is thus first-come, first-served within each preference category, with visas becoming available in order of priority date.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Such a date may benefit not only the principal beneficiary of a family preference petition, but also her spouse and minor children. Those persons, labeled the petition's \"derivative beneficiar[ies],\" are \"entitled to the same status, and the same order of consideration\" as the principal.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201153\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1153\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d), (h). Accordingly, when a visa becomes available for the principal, one becomes available for her spouse and minor children too. And that is so even when (as is usually but not always the case) the spouse and children would not qualify for any family preference category on their own. For example, the child of an F4 petition's principal beneficiary is the niece or nephew of a U.S. citizen, and federal immigration law does not recognize that relationship. Nonetheless, the child can piggy-back on his qualifying parent in seeking an immigrant visa-although, as will be further discussed, he may not immigrate without her.

Such an application requires an alien to demonstrate in various ways her admissibility to the United States.

Notably, one necessary showing involves the U.S. citizen or LPR who filed the initial petition: To mitigate any possibility of becoming a \"public charge,\" the visa applicant (whether a principal or derivative beneficiary) must append an \"affidavit of support\" executed by that sponsoring individual. \u00a7\u00a7 1182(a)(4)(C)(ii), 1183a(a)(1).

Remember that not all offspring, but only those under the age of 21 can qualify as an \"immediate relative\" of a U.S. citizen, or as the principal beneficiary of an LPR's F2A petition, or (most crucially here) as the derivative beneficiary of any family preference petition. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2197, 2198. So an alien eligible to immigrate at the start of the process (when a sponsor files a petition) might not be so at the end (when an immigration official reviews his documents for admission). He may have \"aged out\" of his original immigration status by the simple passage of time.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    In 2002, Congress enacted the Child Status Protection Act (CSPA),\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20Stat.%20927\">\n     116 Stat. 927\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , to address the treatment of those once-but-no-longer-minor aliens. One section of the Act neatly eliminates the \"aging out\" problem for the offspring of U.S. citizens seeking to immigrate as \"immediate relatives.\" Under that provision, the \"determination of whether [such] an alien satisfies the [immigration law's] age requirement ... shall be made using [his] age\" on the date the initial petition was filed.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201151\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (f)(1).

The first two are complex but, with some perseverance, comprehensible. The third-the key provision here-is through and through perplexing.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fr8\" name=\"fr8\">\n      8\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    The first paragraph, \u00a7 1153(h)(1), contains a formula for calculating the age of an alien \"[f]or purposes of subsections (a)(2)(A) and (d)\"-that is, for any alien seeking an immigrant visa directly under F2A or as a derivative beneficiary of any preference category.

See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2198 - 2199. The months that elapse before USCIS personnel approve a family preference petition (\"the period during which the applicable petition described in paragraph (2) was pending\") do not count against an alien in determining his statutory \"age.\" Neither do the months a consular officer lets pass before adjudicating the alien's own visa application (the period after \"an immigrant visa number becomes available for such alien (or ... [his] parent)\"). But the time in between-the months or, more likely, years the alien spends simply waiting for a visa to become available-is not similarly excluded in calculating his age: Every day the alien stands in that line is a day he grows older, under the immigration laws no less than in life. And so derivative beneficiaries, as well as principal beneficiaries of F2A petitions, can still \"age out\"-in other words, turn 21, notwithstanding \u00a7 1153(h)(1)'s dual age adjustments-prior to receiving an opportunity to immigrate.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    What happens then (if anything) is the subject of \u00a7 1153(h)'s third paragraph-the provision at issue in this case. That paragraph states:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    \"If the age of an alien is determined under paragraph (1) to be 21 years of age or older for the purposes of subsections (a)(2)(A) and (d) of this section, the alien's petition shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date issued upon receipt of the original petition.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    The provision thus first references the aged-out beneficiaries of family preference petitions, and then directs immigration officials to do something whose meaning this opinion will further consider-\n    <em>\n     i.e.,\n    </em>\n    \"automatically convert\" an alien's petition to an \"appropriate category.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) addressed the meaning of \u00a7 1153(h)(3) in\n    <em>\n     Matter of Wang,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2028\">\n     25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 28\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2009); its interpretation there is what we review in this case. Wang was the principal beneficiary of an F4 petition that his sister, a U.S. citizen, filed in 1992. At that time, Wang's daughter was 10 years old, and thus qualified as a derivative beneficiary. But Wang waited in line for a visa for more than a decade, and by the time his priority date finally came up, his daughter had turned 22 (even after applying \u00a7 1153(h)(1)'s age-reduction formula). Wang thus obtained a visa for himself, boarded a plane alone, and entered the United States as an LPR. He then filed a new preference petition on his daughter's behalf-this one under F2B, the category for LPRs' adult sons and daughters. USCIS approved that petition, with a priority date corresponding to the date of Wang's filing. Wang contended that under \u00a7 1153(h)(3), his daughter was instead entitled to \"retain the original priority date\" given to his sister's old F4 petition, because that petition could \"automatically be converted\" to the F2B category.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    The Board rejected that argument. It explained that \"the language of [\u00a7 1153(h)(3) ] does not expressly state which petitions qualify for automatic conversion and retention of priority dates.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2028\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2028\">\n     at 33\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Given that \"ambiguity,\" the BIA looked to the \"recognized meaning\" of \"the phrase 'automatic conversion' \" in immigration statutes and regulations-which it \"presume[d]\" Congress understood when enacting the CSPA.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2028\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2028\">\n     at 33-35\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . \"Historically,\" the BIA showed, that language applied only when a petition could move seamlessly from one family preference category to another-not when a new sponsor was needed to fit a beneficiary into a different category.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2028\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2028\">\n     at 35\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Some aged-\n    out aliens' petitions could accomplish that maneuver, because the alien had a qualifying relationship with the original sponsor, and continued to do so upon aging out; in that event, the Board held, \u00a7 1153(h)(3) ensured that the alien would retain his original priority date. See\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2028\">\n      id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2028\">\n     at 34-35\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . But the F4 petition filed by Wang's sister could not \"automatically be converted\" in that way because Wang's daughter never had a qualifying relationship with the sponsor: \"[N]o category exists for the niece of a United States citizen.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2028\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2028\">\n     at 35-36\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . That is why Wang himself had to file a new petition on his daughter's behalf once she aged out and could no longer ride on his sibling status. The Board saw no evidence that Congress meant \"to expand the use of the concept[ ] of automatic conversion\" to reach such a case.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2028\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2028\">\n     at 36\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . And the Board thought such an expansion unwarranted because it would allow aliens like Wang's daughter, who lacked any independent entitlement to a visa during the years her father spent standing on the F4 queue, to \"cut[ ] in line ahead of others awaiting visas in other preference categories.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2028\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2028\">\n     at 38\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    <strong>\n     C\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    The respondents in this case are similarly situated to Wang, and they seek the same relief. Each was once the principal beneficiary of either an F3 petition filed by a U.S. citizen parent or an F4 petition filed by a U.S. citizen sibling. Each also has a son or daughter who, on the date of filing, was under 21 and thus qualified as a derivative beneficiary of the petition. But as was true of Wang's daughter, the respondents' offspring had all turned 21 (even accounting for \u00a7 1153(h)(1)'s age adjustments) by the time visas became available. Accordingly, the respondents immigrated to the United States alone and, as new LPRs, filed F2B petitions for their sons and daughters. Each argued that under \u00a7 1153(h)(3), those petitions should get the same priority date as the original F3 and F4 petitions once had. USCIS instead gave the new F2B petitions current priority dates, meaning that the sons and daughters could not leapfrog over others in the F2B line.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    This case began as two separate suits, one joining many individual plaintiffs and the other certified as a class action. In each suit, the District Court deferred to the BIA's interpretation of \u00a7 1153(h)(3) in\n    <em>\n     Wang,\n    </em>\n    and accordingly granted summary judgment to the Government.

Its first half looks in one direction, toward the sweeping relief the respondents propose, which would reach every aged-out beneficiary of a family preference petition. But as the BIA recognized, and we will further explain, the section's second half looks another way, toward a remedy that can apply to only a subset of those beneficiaries-and one not including the respondents' offspring. The two faces of the statute do not easily cohere with each other: Read either most naturally, and the other appears to mean not what it says. That internal tension makes possible alternative reasonable constructions, bringing into correspondence in one way or another the section's different parts. And when that is so,\n    <em>\n     Chevron\n    </em>\n    dictates that a court defer to the agency's choice-here, to the Board's expert judgment about which interpretation fits best with, and makes most sense of, the statutory scheme.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Begin by reading the statute from the top-the part favoring the respondents. Section 1153(h)(3)'s first clause-\"If the age of an alien is determined under paragraph (1) to be 21 years of age or older for the purposes of subsections (a)(2)(A) and (d)\"-states a condition that every aged-out beneficiary of a preference petition satisfies. That is because all those beneficiaries have had their ages \"determined under paragraph (1)\" (and have come up wanting): Recall that the age formula of \u00a7 1153(h)(1) applies to each alien child who originally qualified (under \"subsections (a)(2)(A) and (d)\") as the principal beneficiary of an F2A petition or the derivative beneficiary of any family preference petition. On its own, then, \u00a7 1153(h)(3)'s opening clause encompasses the respondents' sons and daughters, along with every other once-young beneficiary of a family preference petition now on the wrong side of 21. If the next phrase said something like \"the alien shall be treated as though still a minor\" (much as the CSPA did to ensure U.S. citizens' children, qualifying as \"immediate relatives,\" would stay forever young, see\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2199 - 2200), all those aged-out beneficiaries would prevail in this case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    But read on, because \u00a7 1153(h)(3)'s second clause instead prescribes a remedy containing its own limitation on the eligible class of recipients. \"[T]he alien's petition,\" that part provides, \"shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date.\" That statement directs immigration officials to take the initial petition benefitting an alien child,\n    and now that he has turned 21, \"convert[ ]\" that same petition from a category for children to an \"appropriate category\" for adults (while letting him keep the old priority date). The \"conversion,\" in other words, is merely from one category to another; it does not entail any change in the petition, including its sponsor, let alone any new filing. And more, that category shift is to be \"automatic\"-that is, one involving no additional decisions, contingencies, or delays. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary 140 (2d ed. 2001) (defining \"automatic\" as \"having the capability of starting, operating, moving, etc., independently\"); The American Heritage Dictionary 122 (4th ed. 2000) (\"[a]cting or operating in a manner essentially independent of external influence\"). The operation described is, then, a mechanical cut-and-paste job-moving a petition, without any substantive alteration, from one (no-longer-appropriate, child-based) category to another (now-appropriate, adult) compartment. And so the aliens who may benefit from \u00a7 1153(h)(3)'s back half are only those for whom that procedure is possible. The clause offers relief not to every aged-out beneficiary, but just to those covered by petitions that can roll over, seamlessly and promptly, into a category for adult relatives.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    That understanding of \u00a7 1153(h)(3)'s \"automatic conversion\" language matches the exclusive way immigration law used the term when Congress enacted the CSPA. For many years before then (as today), a regulation entitled \"Automatic conversion of preference classification\" instructed immigration officials to change the preference category of a petition's principal beneficiary when either his or his sponsor's status changed in specified ways. See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.2\">\n     8 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 204.2\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (i)(1)-(3) (2002). For example, the regulation provided that when a U.S. citizen's child aged out, his \"immediate relative\" petition converted to an F1 petition, with his original priority date left intact. See \u00a7 204.2(i)(2). Similarly, when a U.S. citizen's adult son married, his original petition migrated from F1 to F3, see \u00a7 204.2(i)(1)(i); when, conversely, such a person divorced, his petition converted from F3 to F1, see \u00a7 204.2(i)(1)(iii); and when a minor child's LPR parent became a citizen, his F2A petition became an \"immediate relative\" petition, see \u00a7 204.2(i)(3)-all again with their original priority dates. Most notable here, what all of those authorized changes had in common was that they could occur without any change in the petitioner's identity, or otherwise in the petition's content. In each circumstance, the \"automatic conversion\" entailed nothing more than picking up the petition from one category and dropping it into another for which the alien now qualified.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fr10\" name=\"fr10\">\n      10\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Congress used the word \"conversion\" (even without the modifier \"automatic\") in\n    the identical way in two other sections of the CSPA. See\n    <em>\n     Law v. Siegel,\n    </em>\n    571 U.S. ----, ----,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3825872,12701998\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1188/\">\n     134 S.Ct. 1188\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1195,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12701998\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/415/\">\n     188 L.Ed.2d 146\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2014) (\"[W]ords repeated in different parts of the same statute generally have the same meaning\"). Section 2 refers to occasions on which, by virtue of the above-described regulation, a petition \"converted\" from F2A to the \"immediate relative\" category because of the sponsor parent's naturalization, or from the F3 to the F1 box because of the beneficiary's divorce.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201151\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1151\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (f)(2), (3). Then, in \u00a7 6, Congress authorized an additional conversion of the same nature: It directed that when an LPR parent-sponsor naturalizes, the petition he has filed for his adult son or daughter \"shall be converted,\" unless the beneficiary objects, from the F2B to the F1 compartment-again with the original priority date unchanged.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201154\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1154\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (k)(1)-(3). (That opt-out mechanism itself underscores the otherwise mechanical nature of the conversion.) Once again, in those cases, all that is involved is a recategorization-moving the same petition, filed by the same petitioner, from one preference classification to another, so as to reflect a change in either the alien's or his sponsor's status. In the rest of the CSPA, as in the prior immigration regulation, that is what \"conversion\" means.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    And if the term meant more than that in \u00a7 1153(h)(3), it would undermine the family preference system's core premise: that each immigrant must have a qualified sponsor. Consider the alternative addressed in\n    <em>\n     Wang\n    </em>\n    -if \"automatic conversion\" were also to encompass the substitution of a new petitioner for the old one, to make sure the aged-out alien's petition fits into a new preference category. In a case like\n    <em>\n     Wang,\n    </em>\n    recall, the original sponsor does not have a legally recognized relationship with the aged-out derivative beneficiary (they are aunt and niece); accordingly, the derivative's father-the old principal beneficiary-must be swapped in as the petitioner to enable his daughter to immigrate. But what if, at that point, the father is in no position to sponsor his daughter? Suppose he decided in the end not to immigrate, or failed to pass border inspection, or died in the meanwhile. Or suppose he entered the country, but cannot sponsor a relative's visa because he lacks adequate proof of parentage or committed a disqualifying crime. See \u00a7 1154(a)(1)(B)(i)(II);\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.2\">\n     8 CFR \u00a7 204.2\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d)(2);\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2197. Or suppose he does not want to-or simply cannot-undertake the significant financial obligations that the law imposes on someone petitioning for an alien's admission. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1183a(a)(1)(A), (f)(1)(D);\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2198. Immigration officials cannot assume away all those potential barriers to entry: That would run counter to the family preference system's insistence that a qualified and willing sponsor back every immigrant visa. See \u00a7\u00a7 1154(a)-(b). But neither can they easily, or perhaps at all, figure out whether such a sponsor exists unless he files and USCIS approves a new petition-the very thing \u00a7 1153(h)(3) says is not required.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Indeed, in cases like\n    <em>\n     Wang,\n    </em>\n    the problem is broader: Under the statute's most natural reading, a new qualified sponsor will hardly\n    <em>\n     ever\n    </em>\n    exist at the moment the petition is to be \"converted.\" Section 1153(h)(3), to be sure, does not explicitly identify that point in time. But \u00a7 1153(h)(1) specifies the date on which a derivative beneficiary is deemed to have either aged out or not: It is \"the date on which an immigrant visa number became available for the alien's parent.\" See \u00a7\u00a7 1153(h)(1)(A)-(B). Because that statutory aging out is the one and only thing that triggers automatic conversion for eligible aliens, the date of conversion is best viewed as the same. That reading, moreover,\n    comports with the \"automatic conversion\" regulation on which Congress drew in enacting the CSPA, see\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2204 - 2205: The rule authorizes conversions \"upon\" or \"as of the date\" of the relevant change in the alien's status (including turning 21)-regardless when USCIS may receive notice of the change.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.2\">\n     8 CFR \u00a7 204.2\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (i); but cf.\n    <em>\n     post,\n    </em>\n    at 2224 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting) (wrongly stating that under that rule conversion occurs upon the agency's receipt of proof of the change). But on that date, no new petitioner will be ready to step into the old one's shoes if such a substitution is needed to fit an aged-out beneficiary into a different category. The beneficiary's parent, on the day a \"visa number became available,\" cannot yet be an LPR or citizen; by definition, she has just become eligible to\n    <em>\n     apply\n    </em>\n    for a visa, and faces a wait of at least several months before she can sponsor an alien herself. Nor, except in a trivial number of cases, is any hitherto unidentified person likely to have a legally recognized relationship to the alien. So if an aged-out beneficiary has lost his qualifying connection to the original petitioner, no conversion to an \"appropriate category\" can take place at the requisite time. As long as immigration law demands some valid sponsor, \u00a7 1153(h)(3) cannot give such an alien the designated relief.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    On the above account-in which conversion entails a simple reslotting of an original petition into a now-appropriate category-\u00a7 1153(h)(3)'s back half provides a remedy to two groups of aged-out beneficiaries. First, any child who was the principal beneficiary of an F2A petition (filed by an LPR parent on his behalf) can take advantage of that clause after turning 21. He is, upon aging out, the adult son of the same LPR who sponsored him as a child; his petition can therefore be moved seamlessly-without the slightest alteration or delay-into the F2B category. Second, any child who was the derivative beneficiary of an F2A petition (filed by an LPR on his\n    <em>\n     spouse's\n    </em>\n    behalf) can similarly claim relief, provided that under the statute, he is not just the spouse's but also the petitioner's child.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fr11\" name=\"fr11\">\n      11\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    Such an alien is identically situated to the aged-out\n    <em>\n     principal\n    </em>\n    beneficiary of an F2A petition; indeed, for the price of another filing fee, he could just as easily have been named a principal himself. He too is now the adult son of the original LPR petitioner, and his petition can also be instantly relabeled an F2B petition, without any need to substitute a new sponsor or make other revisions. In each case, the alien had a qualifying relationship before he was 21 and retains it afterward; all that must be changed is the label affixed to his petition.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fr12\" name=\"fr12\">\n      12\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    In contrast, as the Board held in\n    <em>\n     Wang,\n    </em>\n    the aged-out derivative beneficiaries of the other family preference categories-like the sons and daughters of the respondents here-cannot qualify for \"automatic conversion.\" Recall that the respondents themselves were principal beneficiaries of F3 and F4 petitions; their children, when under 21, counted as derivatives, but lacked any qualifying preference relationship\n    of their own. The F3 derivatives were the petitioners' grandsons and granddaughters; the F4 derivatives their nephews and nieces; and none of those are relationships Congress has recognized as warranting a family preference. See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201153\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1153\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(3)-(4). Now that the respondents' children have turned 21, and they can no longer ride on their parents' coattails, that lack of independent eligibility makes a difference. For them, unlike for the F2A beneficiaries, it is impossible simply to slide the original petitions from a (no-longer-appropriate) child category to a (now-appropriate) adult one. To fit into a new category, those aged-out derivatives, like Wang's daughter, must have new sponsors-and for all the reasons already stated, that need means they cannot benefit from \"automatic conversion.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    All that said, we hold only that \u00a7 1153(h)(3) permits-not that it requires-the Board's decision to so distinguish among aged-out beneficiaries. That is because, as we explained earlier, the two halves of \u00a7 1153(h)(3) face in different directions. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2203. Section 1153(h)(3)'s first part-its conditional phrase-encompasses every aged-out beneficiary of a family preference petition, and thus points toward broad-based relief. But as just shown, \u00a7 1153(h)(3)'s second part-its remedial prescription-applies only to a narrower class of beneficiaries: those aliens who naturally qualify for (and so can be \"automatically converted\" to) a new preference classification when they age out. Were there an interpretation that gave each clause full effect, the Board would have been required to adopt it. But the ambiguity those ill-fitting clauses create instead left the Board with a choice-essentially of how to reconcile the statute's different commands. The Board, recognizing the need to make that call, opted to abide by the inherent limits of \u00a7 1153(h)(3)'s remedial clause, rather than go beyond those limits so as to match the sweep of the section's initial condition. On the Board's reasoned view, the only beneficiaries entitled to statutory relief are those capable of obtaining the remedy designated. When an agency thus resolves statutory tension, ordinary principles of administrative deference require us to defer. See\n    <em>\n     National Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573372\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/644/#p666\">\n     551 U.S. 644\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 666,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573372\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/644/#p666\">\n     127 S.Ct. 2518\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573372\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/644/#p666\">\n     168 L.Ed.2d 467\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2007) (When a statutory scheme contains \"a fundamental ambiguity\" arising from \"the differing mandates\" of two provisions, \"it is appropriate to look to the implementing agency's expert interpretation\" to determine which \"must give way\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    <strong>\n     III\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The respondents urge us to overturn the Board's judgment for three independent reasons. First, and principally, they take issue with the Board's-and now our-view of the limits associated with \"automatic conversion\": They argue that every aged-out beneficiary's petition\n    <em>\n     can\n    </em>\n    \"automatically be converted\" to an \"appropriate category,\" and that the two halves of \u00a7 1153(h)(3) are thus reconcilable. Second, the respondents contend that even if \"automatic conversion\" does not extend so far, \u00a7 1153(h)(3) separately entitles each such beneficiary to the benefit of his original petition's priority date. And third, they claim that the Board's way of resolving whatever ambiguity inheres in \u00a7 1153(h)(3) is arbitrary and capricious. The dissenting opinion reiterates the first two arguments, though with slight variation and in opposite order, while forgoing the third. See\n    <em>\n     post,\n    </em>\n    at 2221 - 2227 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.) (hereinafter the dissent). We find none of the contentions persuasive.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    <strong>\n     A\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    The respondents (and the dissent) initially aver that every aged-out beneficiary\n    (including their own sons and daughters) can \"automatically be converted\" to an \"appropriate\" immigration category, if only immigration officials try hard enough. The Government, in the respondents' view, can accomplish that feat by substituting new sponsors for old ones, and by \"managing the timing\" of every conversion to ensure such a new petitioner exists on the relevant date. Brief for Respondents 33. And because, the respondents say, it is thus possible to align the two halves of \u00a7 1153(h)(3)-even if through multiple administrative maneuvers-immigration officials are under an obligation to do so. We disagree, for reasons that should sound familiar: Several are the same as those we have just given for upholding the Board's interpretation. But still, we walk through the respondents' argument step-by-step, to show how far it departs from any ordinary understanding of \"automatic conversion.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    The first (and necessary) premise of that argument does not augur well for the remainder: It is the view that the \"automatic conversion\" procedure permits a change in the petitioner's identity. According to the respondents, the aged-out beneficiaries' parents, upon becoming LPRs, can be subbed in for the original sponsors (\n    <em>\n     i.e.,\n    </em>\n    the beneficiaries' grandparents, aunts, and uncles), and the petitions then converted to the F2B category. But as we have shown, the \"automatic conversion\" language-as most naturally read and as long used throughout immigration law-contemplates merely moving a petition into a new and valid category, not changing its most essential feature. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2203 - 2205. That alone defeats the respondents' position.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    And a further problem follows-this one concerning the date of automatic conversion. The respondents need that date to come at a time when the derivative beneficiaries' parents (the substitute petitioners) are already living in the United States as LPRs; otherwise, the petitions could not qualify for the F2B box. In an attempt to make that possible, the respondents propose that conversion be viewed as taking place when \"the derivative beneficiary's visa ... application is adjudicated.\" Brief for Respondents 29. But as we have (again) demonstrated, the statute is best read as establishing a different date: that \"on which an immigrant visa number became available for the alien's parent\"-when, by definition, the parent is not yet an LPR. \u00a7 1153(h)(1); see\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2205 - 2206. That is the moment when a derivative ages out, which is the single change conversion reflects. By contrast, the respondents' suggested date has no connection to that metamorphosis; the date of adjudication is merely when an immigration official later\n    <em>\n     discovers\n    </em>\n    that a child has turned 21. And that date is itself fortuitous, reflecting no more than when an immigration officer got around to reviewing a visa application: The possibility of conversion would thus depend on bureaucratic vagaries attending the visa process. So the respondents' mistaken view of the timing of conversion is another off-ramp from their argument.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fr13\" name=\"fr13\">\n      13\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Yet there is more-because even after substituting a new petitioner and delaying the conversion date in a way the statute does not contemplate, the respondents must propose yet further fixes to make \"automatic\" conversion work for their sons and daughters. The respondents' next problem is that even on the conversion date they propose, most of them (and other derivatives' parents) were not yet LPRs, and so could not possibly be sponsors. In the ordinary course, principal and derivative beneficiaries living abroad apply for their visas at the same time and go to the consulate together for back-to-back interviews. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2198. And even if the parent is approved first, that alone does not make her an LPR; she still must come to this country, demonstrate her continued eligibility, and pass an inspection. See\n    <em>\n     ibid.\n    </em>\n    Thus, the respondents must recommend changes to the visa process to get the timing to work-essentially, administrative juggling to hold off the derivative beneficiary's visa adjudication until his parent has become an LPR. In particular, they suggest that the consular official defer the derivative's interview, or that the official nominally \"reject the application\" and then instruct the derivative to \"reapply after the principal beneficiary immigrates.\" Brief for Respondents 30. But the need for that choreography (which, in any event, few if any of the respondents conformed to) renders the conversion process only less \"automatic,\" because now it requires special intervention, purposeful delay, and deviation from standard administrative practice. Conversion has become not a machine that would go of itself, but a process painstakingly managed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    And after all this fancy footwork, the respondents' scheme still cannot succeed, because however long a visa adjudication is postponed, a derivative's parent may never become able to sponsor a relative's visa-and immigration officials cannot practicably tell whether a given parent has done so. We have noted before the potential impediments to serving as a petitioner-including that a parent may not immigrate, may not qualify as a sponsor, or may not be able to provide the requisite financial support. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2205 - 2206. The respondents offer no way to deal with those many contingencies. Require the parent to submit a new petition? But the entire point of automatic conversion (as the respondents themselves agree) is to obviate the need for such a document. See Brief for Respondents 30, 42. Investigate\n    the parent's eligibility in some other way? But even were that possible (which we doubt) such an inquiry would not square with the essential idea of an automatic process. Disregard the possibility that no legal sponsor exists? But then visas would go, inevitably and not infrequently, to ineligible aliens. And so the workarounds have well and truly run out on the respondents' argument.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fr14\" name=\"fr14\">\n      14\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    That leaves us with the same statutory inconsistency with which we began. Having followed each step of the respondents' resourceful (if Rube Goldbergish) argument, we still see no way to apply the concept of automatic conversion to the respondents' children and others like them. And that means we continue to face a statute whose halves do not correspond to each other-giving rise to an ambiguity that calls for\n    <em>\n     Chevron\n    </em>\n    deference.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    <strong>\n     B\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    The respondents, however, have another idea for reconciling \u00a7 1153(h)(3)'s front and back parts (and this back-up claim becomes the dissent's principal argument). Recall that the section's remedial clause instructs that \"the alien's petition shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category\n    <em>\n     and the alien shall retain the original priority date issued upon receipt of the original petition\n    </em>\n    .\" The respondents (and the dissent) ask us to read the italicized language as conferring a benefit wholly independent of automatic conversion. On that view, aged-out derivatives, even though ineligible for conversion, could \"retain the[ir] original priority date[s]\" if their parents file a\n    <em>\n     new\n    </em>\n    petition (as the respondents in fact did here \"as a protective matter,\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 55). And then, everyone encompassed in \u00a7 1153(h)(3)'s first clause would get at least some form of relief (even if not both forms) from the section's second. For this argument, the respondents principally rely on the word \"and\": \"Where the word 'and' connects two\" phrases as in \u00a7 1153(h)(3)'s back half, the respondents contend, those terms \"operate independently.\" Brief for Respondents 39; see\n    <em>\n     post,\n    </em>\n    at 2221.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    But the conjunction \"and\" does not necessarily\n    <em>\n     disjoin\n    </em>\n    two phrases in the way the respondents say. In some sentences, no doubt, the respondents have a point. They use as their primary example: \"[I]f the boat takes on water, then you shall operate the bilge pump and you shall distribute life jackets.\" Brief for Respondents 39; see also\n    <em>\n     post,\n    </em>\n    at 2221 (offering further examples). We agree that \"you shall distribute life jackets\" functions in that sentence as an independent command. But we can come up with many paired dictates in which the second is conditional on the first. \"If the price is reasonable, buy two tickets\n    and save a receipt.\" \"If you have time this summer, read this book and give me a report.\" Or, shades of this case: \"If your cell-phone contract expires, buy a new phone and keep the old number.\"\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fr15\" name=\"fr15\">\n      15\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    In each case, the second command functions only once the first is accomplished. Whether \"and\" works in that way or in the respondents' depends, like many questions of usage, on the context. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Ltd. v. Novo Nordisk A/S,\n    </em>\n    566 U.S. ----, ----,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189372\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/399/\">\n     132 S.Ct. 1670\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , ----,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189372\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/399/\">\n     182 L.Ed.2d 678\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2012).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Here, we think, context compels the Board's view that the instructions work in tandem. The first phrase instructs immigration officials to convert a petition (when an \"appropriate category\" exists); the next clarifies that such a converted petition will retain the original priority date, rather than receive a new one corresponding to the date of conversion. That reading comports with the way retention figures in other statutory and regulatory provisions respecting \"conversions\"; there too, retention of a priority date is conditional on a conversion occurring. See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201154\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1154\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (k)(1)-(3);\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.2\">\n     8 CFR \u00a7 204.2\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (i);\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2204. The respondents wish to unhook the \"retention\" phrase from that mooring, and use it to explain what will attend a\n    <em>\n     different\n    </em>\n    event-that is, the filing of a new petition. But that is to make \"retention\" conditional on something the statute nowhere mentions-a highly improbable thing for Congress to have done. (If, once again, a teacher says to \"read this book and give me a report,\" no one would think he wants a report on some unidentified subject.) And indeed, the respondents' and dissent's own examples prove this point: In not a single one of their proffered sentences is the second command contingent on the occurrence of some additional, unstated event, as it would have to be under the respondents' construction of \u00a7 1153(h)(3); rather, each such command (\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    \"distribute life jackets\") flows directly from the stated condition (\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    \"if the boat takes on water\"). So by far the more natural understanding of \u00a7 1153(h)(3)'s text is that retention follows conversion, and nothing else.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    The respondents' contrary view would also engender unusual results, introducing uncertainty into the immigration system's operation and thus interfering with statutory goals. Were their theory correct, an aged-out alien could hold on to a priority date for years or even decades while waiting for a relative to file a new petition. Even if that filing happened, say, 20 years after the alien aged out, the alien could take out his priority-date token, and assert a right to spring to the front of any visa line. At that point, USCIS could well have\n    a hard time confirming the old priority date, in part because the names of derivative beneficiaries need not be listed on a visa petition. And the possibility of such leap-frogging from many years past would impede USCIS's publication of accurate waiting times. As far as we know, immigration law nowhere else allows an alien to keep in his pocket a priority date untethered to any existing valid petition. Without some clearer statement, we cannot conclude Congress intended here to create such a free-floating, open-ended entitlement to a defunct petition's priority date.

In their view, the Board has offered no valid reason, consistent with \"the purposes and concerns of the immigration laws,\" to treat their own sons and daughters less favorably than aliens who were principal and derivative beneficiaries of F2A petitions. Brief for Respondents 47. Indeed, the respondents suggest that the BIA, \"for its own unfathomable reasons, disapproves of Congress's decision to allow\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    aged-out\" aliens to get relief, and has thus \"limited [\u00a7 1153(h)(3) ] to as few derivative beneficiaries as possible.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2028\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2028\">\n     at 55\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    We cannot agree. At the least, the Board's interpretation has administrative simplicity to recommend it. Under that view, immigration authorities need only perform the kind of straightforward (\n    <em>\n     i.e.,\n    </em>\n    \"automatic\") conversion they have done for decades-moving a petition from one box to another to reflect a given status change like aging out. See\n    <em>\n     Wang,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2028\">\n     25 I. &amp; N. Dec., at 36\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The respondents, as we have shown, would transform conversion into a managed, multi-stage process, requiring immigration and consular officials around the world to sequence and delay every aged-out alien's visa adjudication until they are able to confirm that one of his parents had become a qualifying and willing F2B petitioner. And according to the Government's (incomplete) statistics, that would have to happen in, at a minimum, tens of thousands of cases every year. See Reply Brief 18, n. 13.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Still more important, the Board offered a cogent argument, reflecting statutory purposes, for distinguishing between aged-out beneficiaries of F2A petitions and the respondents' sons and daughters. See\n    <em>\n     Wang,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2028\">\n     25 I. &amp; N. Dec., at 38\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . As earlier\n    explained, the F2A beneficiaries have all had a qualifying relationship with an LPR for the entire period they have waited in line-\n    <em>\n     i.e.,\n    </em>\n    since their original priority dates. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2205 - 2206. That means that when immigration authorities convert their petitions, they will enter the F2B line at the same place as others who have had a comparable relationship for an equal time. The conversion thus fits with the immigration law's basic first-come-first-served rule. See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201153\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e);\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2197. By contrast, the derivative beneficiaries of F3 and F4 petitions, like the respondents' sons and daughters, lacked any qualifying relationship with a citizen or LPR during the period they waited in line. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2206 - 2207. They were, instead, the grandchildren, nieces, or nephews of citizens, and those relationships did not independently entitle them to visas. If such aliens received relief under \u00a7 1153(h)(3), they would jump over thousands of others in the F2B line who had a qualifying relationship with an LPR for a far longer time. That displacement would, the Board reasonably found, scramble the priority order Congress prescribed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    The argument to the contrary assumes that the respondents' sons and daughters should \"receive credit\" for all the time the respondents themselves stood in line. Brief for Respondents 50. But first, the time the respondents spent waiting for a visa may diverge substantially from the time their children did. Suppose, for example, that one of the respondents had stood in the F4 queue for 15 years, and with just 4 years to go, married someone with a 17-year-old son. Under the respondents' reading, that derivative beneficiary, after aging out, would get the full benefit of his new parent's wait, and so displace many thousands of aliens who (unlike him) had stood in an immigration queue for nearly two decades. And second, even when the derivative qualified as such for all the time his parent stood in line, his status throughout that period hinged on his being that parent's minor child. If his parent had obtained a visa before he aged out, he would have been eligible for a visa too, because the law does not demand that a prospective immigrant abandon a minor child. But if the parent had died while waiting for a visa, or had been found ineligible, or had decided not to immigrate after all, the derivative would have gotten nothing for the time spent in line. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2198 - 2199. Similarly, the Board could reasonably conclude, he should not receive credit for his parent's wait when he has become old enough to live independently. In the unavoidably zero-sum world of allocating a limited number of visas, the Board could decide that he belongs behind any alien who has had a lengthier stand-alone entitlement to immigrate.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    <strong>\n     IV\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    This is the kind of case\n    <em>\n     Chevron\n    </em>\n    was built for. Whatever Congress might have meant in enacting \u00a7 1153(h)(3), it failed to speak clearly.

And yet no one would describe the two clauses as being in tension.

Which aged-out children are entitled to retain their priority dates: derivative beneficiaries of visa petitions in all five family-preference categories, or derivative beneficiaries of petitions in only one category? The initial clause of\n    <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201153\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (h)(3) provides a clear answer: Aged-out children may retain their priority dates so long as they meet a single condition-they must be \"determined ... to be 21 years of age or older for purposes of\" derivative beneficiary status. Because all five categories of aged-out children satisfy this condition, all are entitled to relief.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    Notwithstanding this textual command, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) ruled that four of the five categories of aged-out children to whom \u00a7 1153(h)(3) unambiguously promises priority date retention, are, in fact, entitled to no relief at all. See\n    <em>\n     Matter of Wang,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2028\">\n     25 I. &amp; N.

In doing so, the Court does not identify any ambiguity in the dispositive initial clause of \u00a7 1153(h)(3). Indeed, it candidly admits that the clause mandates relief for \"every aged-out beneficiary of a family-preference petition\" in any of the five categories.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2207. The Court nevertheless holds that the BIA was free to ignore this unambiguous text on the ground that \u00a7 1153(h)(3) also offers aged-out derivative beneficiaries a type of relief-automatic conversion-that it thinks can apply only to one of the five categories. The Court thus perceives a conflict in the statute that, in its view, permits the BIA to override \u00a7 1153(h)(3)'s initial eligibility clause.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    In reaching this conclusion, the Court fails to follow a cardinal rule of statutory interpretation: When deciding whether Congress has \"specifically addressed the question at issue,\" thereby leaving no room for an agency to fill a statutory gap, courts must \"interpret the statute 'as a ... coherent regulatory scheme' and 'fit, if possible, all parts into [a] harmonious whole.' \"\n    <em>\n     FDA v.

Congress has spoken directly to the question in this case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    United States citizens and lawful permanent residents (LPRs) may petition for certain relatives who reside abroad (known as the \"principal beneficiaries\" of such petitions) to receive immigrant visas. Congress has defined five categories of eligible relatives-referred to as family-preference categories-with annual limits on the number of visas that may be issued within each category.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fr23\" name=\"fr23\">\n      1\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    Because the demand for visas\n    outstrips supply, the wait for a visa can often last many years. While a principal beneficiary waits, her place in line is determined based on her \"priority date,\" the date on which her petition was filed. See \u00a7 1153(e)(1);\n    <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.1\">\n     8 CFR \u00a7 204.1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b) (2014);\n    <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2042.53\">\n     22 CFR \u00a7 42.53\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a) (2013). Priority dates are therefore crucial-the earlier one's priority date, the sooner one's place will come up in line and a visa will be available. Significantly, when the wait ends and a principal beneficiary finally becomes eligible to apply for a visa,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201153\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d) enables the beneficiary's spouse and minor children (known as \"derivative beneficiaries\") to do so too.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    This case arises from a common problem: Given the lengthy period prospective immigrants must wait for a visa, a principal beneficiary's child-although younger than 21 when her parent's petition was initially filed-often will have turned 21 by the time the parent's priority date comes up in line. Such a child is said to have \"aged out\" of derivative beneficiary treatment under \u00a7 1153(d). By way of example, respondent Norma Uy was the principal beneficiary of an F4 family-preference petition filed by her U.S. citizen sister in February 1981. That petition listed Norma's daughter, Ruth, who was then two years old, as a derivative beneficiary. If Norma had reached the front of the visa line at any time before Ruth's 21st birthday, \u00a7 1153(d) would have enabled Ruth to accompany Norma to the United States. Unfortunately, it took more than two decades for Norma's priority date to become current, by which point Ruth was 23 and thus too old for derivative beneficiary status under \u00a7 1153(d). Norma therefore immigrated alone to the United States, where she filed a new F2B petition (for unmarried children of LPRs) on Ruth's behalf. Before \u00a7 1153(h)(3) was enacted, however, an immigrant in Ruth's position would have been unable to retain the February 1981 priority date from her original petition; the law would have instead required her to receive a new priority date all the way at the back of the F2B line.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    Congress responded to this problem by enacting \u00a7 1153(h)(3), a provision entitled \"[r]etention of priority date.\" It states:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    \"If the age of an alien is determined under [the formula specified in] paragraph (1)\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fr24\" name=\"fr24\">\n      2\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    to be 21 years of age or older for the purpos[e] of ...

The initial clause (call it the \"eligibility clause\") specifies who is eligible for relief. The concluding clause (call it the \"relief clause\") describes the two forms of relief to which eligible persons are entitled. As the title of the provision suggests, the main form of relief is the right of an aged-out derivative beneficiary to retain the priority date of her original petition. In Ruth Uy's case, such relief would mean the difference between resuming her wait near the front of the F2B line (which would allow her to receive a visa in short order) and being sent to the back of the line (where she would potentially have to wait an additional 27 years). Brief for Respondents 52.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    The question in this case is\n    <em>\n     which\n    </em>\n    aged-out beneficiaries of family-preference petitions are eligible for priority date retention:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    the aged-out beneficiaries of petitions in all five family-preference categories (which would include respondents' children, who were derivative beneficiaries of F3 and F4 petitions for adult children and adult siblings of U.S. citizens, respectively), or the aged-out beneficiaries of only F2A petitions for spouses and children of LPRs (the interpretation offered by the BIA)?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    Congress answered that question in \u00a7 1153(h)(3)'s eligibility clause, which specifies that relief is to be conferred on any immigrant who has been \"determined under [the formula specified in] paragraph (1) to be 21 years of age or older\" for the purpose of \u00a7 1153(d). As the plurality concedes, this clause \"states a condition that every aged-out beneficiary of a preference petition satisfies\"-that is, it makes eligible for relief aged-out children within each of the F1, F2A, F2B, F3, and F4 categories.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2203.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    Congress made this clear in two mutually reinforcing ways. First, by referring to the formula set forth in \"paragraph (1),\" the statute incorporates that paragraph's cross-reference to \u00a7 1153(h)(2). Section 1153(h)(2) in turn defines the set of covered petitions to include, \"with respect to an alien child who is a derivative beneficiary under [\u00a7 1153(d) ], a petition filed ... for classification of the alien's parent under [\u00a7 1153(a) ].\" And \u00a7 1153(a) encompasses all five family-preference categories. See \u00a7\u00a7 1153(a)(1)-(4). Second, \u00a7 1153(h)(3) promises relief to those who are found to be 21 \"for the purpos[e] of ... [\u00a7 1153](d),\" the provision governing derivative beneficiaries. And that provision also unambiguously covers all five family-preference categories. See \u00a7 1153(d) (a minor child is \"entitled to the same status\" as a parent who is the principal beneficiary of a petition filed under \u00a7 1153(a)); \u00a7 1153(a) (setting forth the five family-preference categories).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    In short, \u00a7 1153(h)(3)'s eligibility clause answers the precise question in this case: Aged-out beneficiaries within all five categories are entitled to relief. \"[T]he intent of Congress is clear,\" so \"that is the end of the matter.\"\n    <em>\n     Chevron,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/#p844\">\n     467 U.S., at 842\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/#p844\">\n     104 S.Ct. 2778\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    <strong>\n     II\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    <strong>\n     A\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    Because it concedes that \u00a7 1153(h)(3)'s eligibility clause unambiguously \"encompasses every aged-out beneficiary of a family-preference petition,\"\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2207, the plurality tries to fit this case into a special pocket of\n    <em>\n     Chevron\n    </em>\n    jurisprudence in which it says we must defer to an agency's decision to ignore a clear statutory command due to a conflict between that command and another statutory provision. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2203, 2207. Thus, unlike in the usual\n    <em>\n     Chevron\n    </em>\n    case, where ambiguity derives from the fact that the text does not speak with sufficient specificity to the question at issue, the plurality argues that this is a case in which ambiguity can only arise-if it is to arise at all-if Congress has spoken clearly on the issue in diametrically opposing ways.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fr25\" name=\"fr25\">\n      3\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    As the plurality\n    frames it, \u00a7 1153(h)(3)'s eligibility and relief clauses are \"Janus-faced,\" and that conflict \"makes possible alternative reasonable constructions.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2203.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    In rushing to find a conflict within the statute, the plurality neglects a fundamental tenet of statutory interpretation: We do not lightly presume that Congress has legislated in self-contradicting terms. See A. Scalia &amp; B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 180 (2012) (\"The provisions of a text should be interpreted in a way that renders them compatible, not contradictory.... [T]here can be no justification for needlessly rendering provisions in conflict if they can be interpreted harmoniously\"). That is especially true where, as here, the conflict that Congress supposedly created is not between two different statutes or even two separate provisions within a single statute, but between two clauses in the same sentence.

The plurality infers that limitation from two premises. First, it contends that no aged-out child may retain her priority date unless her petition is also eligible for automatic conversion. And second, it asserts that only aged-out F2A beneficiaries may receive automatic conversion. As a result, the plurality concludes, it was reasonable for the BIA to exclude aged-out children in the four other categories from receiving\n    <em>\n     both\n    </em>\n    automatic conversion and priority date retention, thereby rendering \u00a7 1153(h)(3)'s eligibility clause defunct.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    The plurality's conclusion is wrong because its premises are wrong. For one, \u00a7 1153(h)(3) is naturally read to confer priority date retention as an independent form of relief to all aged-out children, regardless of whether automatic conversion is separately available. And even if that were wrong, the plurality's supposition that only F2A beneficiaries can receive automatic conversion is incorrect on its own terms.

Moreover, the two \"shall\" commands operate on different subjects, further reinforcing that they prescribe distinct remedies: An aged-out \"alien's\n    <em>\n     petition\n    </em>\n    shall automatically be converted,\" but it is \"the alien\"\n    <em>\n     herself\n    </em>\n    who, in all events, \"shall retain\" her original priority date. \u00a7 1153(h)(3) (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    The plurality responds with a series of examples in which the word \"and\" is used to join two commands, one of which is-as the plurality asserts here-dependent on another.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2210 - 2211, and n. 15. But as the plurality recognizes,\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2210, that is hardly the only way the word can be used. For example: \"If today's baseball game is rained out, your ticket shall automatically be converted to a ticket for next Saturday's game, and you shall retain your free souvenir from today's game.\" Or: \"If you provide the DMV with proof of your new address, your voter registration shall automatically be converted to the correct polling location, and you shall receive in the mail an updated driver's license.\" It is plain in both of these examples that the two commands are distinct-the fan in the first example can keep her free souvenir even if she cannot attend next Saturday's game; the new resident will receive an updated driver's license even if she is ineligible to vote. What the plurality does not explain is why we should forgo the same understanding of \u00a7 1153(h)(3)'s relief clause when that would treat the statute as a coherent whole (and when the plurality's alternative interpretation would render the statute a walking self-contradiction within the span of a few words).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    With the text unavailing, the plurality turns to a policy argument. The plurality worries that if automatic conversion and priority date retention are independent benefits, aged-out beneficiaries will be able to \"hold on to a priority date for years ... while waiting for a relative to file a new\n    petition,\" which might hamper U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) operations.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2211 - 2212. But the plurality's fears of administrative inconvenience are belied by the fact that USCIS has administered priority date retention in exactly this manner for years, with no apparent problems. Well before \u00a7 1153(h)(3) was enacted, a regulation provided aged-out F2A derivative beneficiaries the ability to retain their priority dates without also providing automatic conversion. See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.2\">\n     8 CFR \u00a7 204.2\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(4) (permitting priority date retention after a \"separate petition\" is filed); 57 Fed.Reg. 41053, 41059 (1992) (adopting this provision).

Yet fatally absent from the plurality's discussion of context is any mention of the first clause of the very same provision, which, as the plurality admits, unambiguously confers relief upon all five categories of aged-out children.

The ordinary meaning of \"convert\" is \"to change (something) into a different form.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 444. Here, the statute specifies the form into which an aged-out child's petition shall be changed: another petition in the \"appropriate category.\" \u00a7 1153(h)(3). Tying the terms together, then, \"automatic conversion\" means changing an old petition into a new petition in an appropriate category upon the occurrence of some predicate event, without a further decision or contingency.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    All aged-out beneficiaries can have their petitions automatically converted under this definition. Perhaps most sensibly, all five categories of petitions may be converted to an appropriate category, without any further decision or contingency, upon a logical predicate event: when USCIS receives confirmation that an appropriate category exists. To see how this would work, recall the case of Norma Uy, and her daughter, Ruth. Norma was the principal beneficiary of an F4 petition filed by her U.S. citizen sister; Ruth was a derivative beneficiary of the same petition. Because Ruth had aged out of derivative beneficiary status prior to Norma's reaching the front of the visa line, Norma immigrated to the United States without Ruth. Once Norma became an LPR, however, she also became eligible to file a new petition on Ruth's behalf under the F2B category (unmarried adult children of LPRs), \u00a7 1153(a)(2)(B). Thus, once Norma provides confirmation of that eligibility to sponsor Ruth (\n    <em>\n     i.e.,\n    </em>\n    that she is an LPR, that Ruth is her daughter, and that she has not committed disqualifying criminal conduct, see\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2197), Ruth's original F4 petition can automatically be converted to an F2B petition, with no additional decision or contingency.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fr27\" name=\"fr27\">\n      5\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    Indeed, this is how USCIS already applies automatic conversion in other contexts. For example, when an LPR has filed an F2A petition on behalf of a spouse or child, and the LPR subsequently becomes a U.S. citizen, a provision entitled \"\n    <em>\n     [a]utomatic conversion of preference classification,\n    </em>\n    \"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.2\">\n     8 CFR \u00a7 204.2\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (i), permits the F2A petition to be automatically converted to an \"immediate relative\" petition, \u00a7 204.2(i)(3). See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2204. Significantly, the predicate event that triggers this conversion is the agency's receipt of proof that the petition's sponsor has become a U.S. citizen-proof, in other words, that there is an appropriate category into which the petition can be converted.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fr28\" name=\"fr28\">\n      6\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    Section 1153(h)(3)'s automatic conversion remedy can sensibly be administered in the same way.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    The plurality's contrary conclusion that automatic conversion is impossible for all but one category of family-preference petitions hinges on three basic misunderstandings. First, the plurality contends that automatic conversion is triggered not by confirmation of the existence of an appropriate category, but rather by a different predicate event: the moment when \" 'an immigrant visa number bec[omes] available for the alien's parent.' \"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2205. This is a curious argument, not least because nothing in \u00a7 1153(h)(3) suggests it. That provision simply makes automatic conversion available \"[i]f the age of an alien is determined\" to be \"be 21 years of age or older\" for purposes of \u00a7 1153(d). Section 1153(h)(3) thus states the condition that an immigrant must satisfy to be eligible for automatic conversion, but it nowhere commands when the conversion should occur. There is no reason why conversion cannot occur at the logical point just described: the moment when USCIS receives proof that an appropriate category exists.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-155\">\n    The plurality acknowledges that \u00a7 1153(h)(3) \"does not explicitly identify th[e] point in time\" at which a \"petition is to be 'converted.' \"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2205. It nevertheless suggests that the date when a conversion occurs \"is best viewed\" as the date when a visa became available for the aged-out child's parent.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2205. But Congress could not have intended conversion to occur at that point for a glaring reason: The date on which a visa becomes available for an aged-out child's parent occurs before the point at which the child is determined to have aged-out under \u00a7 1153(d)-the very requirement \u00a7 1153(h)(3) prescribes for the aged-out child to be eligible for automatic conversion in the first place. As the plurality explains,\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2198 - 2199, such age determinations occur when an immigration official reviews the child's derivative visa application, which invariably happens\n    <em>\n     after\n    </em>\n    a visa became available for the child's parent as the principal beneficiary. At best, then, the plurality's interpretation requires USCIS to convert petitions at a time when it does not know which petitions are eligible for conversion; at worst, it requires the automatic conversion of petitions benefiting immigrants who will never even qualify for such relief (\n    <em>\n     i.e.,\n    </em>\n    aged-out immigrants who, for any number of reasons,\n    never file a visa application and so are never determined by officials to be older than 21).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-156\">\n    Faced with this fact, the plurality falls back to the position that automatic conversion must merely be viewed as having occurred \"\n    <em>\n     as of\n    </em>\n    th[e] ... date\" when a parent's visa becomes available, although the actual \"assess[ment]\" of the conversion will necessarily occur at some future point in time.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2208, n. 13. That approach, however, introduces precisely the kind of \"additional decisions, contingencies, and delays\" that the plurality regards as inconsistent with the ordinary meaning of \"automatic,\"\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2203. For even under the plurality's view, automatic conversion cannot actually be \"assesse[d]\" until and unless the aged-out child decides to apply for a visa and officials assessing the child's application deem her to have aged out (events which may themselves be contingent on the child's parent first filing her own successful visa application, see\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2198). The far simpler approach is for conversion to occur automatically upon the most logical moment suggested by the statute: the moment when USCIS confirms that an \"appropriate category\" exists, \u00a7 1153(h)(3). Indeed, the plurality fails to explain why this cannot be the proper predicate; it simply dismisses such an approach as supported \"only\" by \"a single-minded resolve ... to grant relief to every possible aged-out beneficiary.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2208, n. 13. But that criticism is revealing: The \"single-minded resolve\" the plurality maligns is Congress' own, for it is Congress that expressly provided, in the eligibility clause, for aged-out beneficiaries in all five categories to be granted relief.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    The plurality's second argument is a corollary of its first. If automatic conversion must occur when a visa first becomes available for a parent, the plurality frets, that will mean an aged-out child will have her petition automatically converted before immigration officials can ascertain whether her parent is even qualified to sponsor her. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2205 - 2206. True enough, but that only confirms that it makes no sense to force USCIS to convert petitions so prematurely. The plurality's fears can all be averted by having automatic conversion occur, as with petitions sponsored by LPRs who later become U.S. citizens,\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2223 - 2224, when USCIS receives confirmation that conversion is appropriate.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fr29\" name=\"fr29\">\n      7\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    The plurality's final argument is that something about the term \"conversion\" precludes relief for all but the aged-out derivative beneficiaries of F2A petitions. The plurality accepts that \"conversion\" will\n    always require changing some aspects of a petition, including its preference category (\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    from F2A to F2B) and the identity of its principal beneficiary (\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    from an aged-out child's parent to the child). But the plurality asserts that a related kind of change is entirely off the table: a change to the identity of the petition's sponsor.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2203. If a converted petition requires a different sponsor than the original petition, the plurality suggests, then it cannot be \"converted\" at all.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    The plurality points to nothing in the plain meaning of \"conversion\" that supports this distinction. It instead argues that a \"conversion\" cannot entail a change to the identity of a petition's sponsor because that is \"the exclusive way immigration law used the term when Congress enacted the CSPA.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2204. But immigration law has long allowed petitions to be converted from one category to another in contexts where doing so requires changing the sponsor's identity. In 2006, for example, the Secretary of Homeland Security promulgated a regulatory provision entitled \"automatic conversion of preference classification,\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.2\">\n     8 CFR \u00a7 204.2\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (i)(1)(iv), which allows the automatic conversion of a petition filed by a U.S. citizen on behalf of her spouse to a widower petition if the citizen dies before the petition is approved. That conversion requires changing the sponsor from the citizen to the widower himself. The fact that the agency used the word \"conversion\" to refer to a process in which the petition's sponsor was changed, just a few years after\n    <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201153\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (h)(3) was enacted, strongly suggests that the term did not have the exclusive meaning that the plurality suggests. Similarly, \u00a7 1154(a)(1)(D)(i)(III), a provision enacted two years before \u00a7 1153(h)(3), see Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=114%20Stat.%201522\">\n     114 Stat. 1522\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , provides that a petition filed by a battered spouse on behalf of her child \"shall be considered\" a self-petition filed by the child herself if the child ages out-a conversion that obviously requires changing the identity of the sponsor from the battered spouse to the aged-out child. And \u00a7 1153(h)(4) confirms that such \"self-petitioners\" are entitled to \u00a7 1153(h)(3)'s automatic conversion remedy. The plurality never explains how it can be mandatory to \"convert\" the identity of the sponsors in these contexts yet impermissible to \"convert\" the sponsors of the petitions at issue here-an understanding that is especially implausible in light of Congress' command that such petitions \"shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category.\" \u00a7 1153(h)(3).\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fr30\" name=\"fr30\">\n      8\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    <strong>\n     III\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    The concurrence reaches the same result as the plurality does, but for a different reason. It begins by recognizing that \u00a7 1153(h)(3)'s eligibility clause \"states a condition\" that is satisfied by aged-out \"beneficiaries from any preference category.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2214 (ROBERTS, C.J., concurring in judgment). The concurrence thus acknowledges that the eligibility clause encompasses aged-out beneficiaries of family-preference petitions in the F1, F2A, F2B, F3, and F4 categories.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    The concurrence nonetheless concludes that the BIA was free to exclude F1, F2B, F3, and F4 beneficiaries from the clear scope of the eligibility clause because of a perceived ambiguity as to which beneficiaries can receive \"automatic conversion.\" See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2215 (\"Congress did not speak clearly to which petitions can 'automatically be converted' \"). In other words, the concurrence concludes that it was reasonable for the agency to ignore the clear text of the eligibility clause because the phrase \"automatic conversion\"\n    <em>\n     might\n    </em>\n    be read in a manner that would benefit F2A beneficiaries alone.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    This is an unusual way to interpret a statute. The concurrence identifies no case in which we have deferred to an agency's decision to use ambiguity in one portion of a statute as a license to ignore another statutory provision that is perfectly clear. To the contrary, \"[a] provision that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme ... because only one of the permissible meanings produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law.\"\n    <em>\n     United Sav.

And there is an easy way to give meaning to the eligibility clause: The clause identifies who is entitled to the benefits specified in the ensuing relief clause.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-165\">\n    The concurrence relies ultimately on an irrelevant hypothetical: \"If a student is determined to be enrolled at an accredited university, the student's cost of off-campus housing shall be deductible on her tax return.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2215. In this example, the concurrence points out, it is \"apparent ... that an enrolled student who lives on campus is not entitled to the deduction, even though the student falls within the conditional first clause.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20L.%20Ed.%20615\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    That is correct, but it says nothing about this case. For in the hypothetical, it is plain that the promised relief (a tax deduction for off-campus housing) cannot apply to the persons at issue (students who live on campus). Here, however, the relief promised in \u00a7 1153(h)(3) (priority date retention and automatic conversion)\n    <em>\n     can\n    </em>\n    be given to persons specified in the initial eligibility clause (aged-out children in all five family-preference categories). See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2221 - 2227. And once one recognizes that aged-out children in each category unambiguously covered by the eligibility clause can receive relief, the BIA's view that\n    <em>\n     no\n    </em>\n    children in four of those categories can ever receive\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    relief cannot be reasonable.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fr31\" name=\"fr31\">\n      9\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    Congress faced a difficult choice when it enacted \u00a7 1153(h)(3). Given the \"zero-sum world of allocating a limited number of visas,\"\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2213, Congress could have required aged-out children like Ruth Uy to lose their place in line and wait many additional years (or even decades) before being reunited with their parents, or it could have enabled such immigrants to retain their place in line-albeit at the cost of extending the wait for other immigrants by some shorter amount. Whatever one might think of the policy arguments on each side, however, this much is clear: Congress made a choice. The plurality's contrary view-that Congress actually delegated the choice to the BIA in a statute that unambiguously encompasses aged-out children in all five preference categories and commands that they \"shall retain the[ir] original priority date[s],\" \u00a7 1153(h)(3)-is untenable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    In the end, then, this case should have been resolved under a commonsense approach to statutory interpretation: Using traditional tools of statutory construction, agencies and courts should try to give effect to a statute's clear text before concluding that Congress has legislated in conflicting and unintelligible terms. Here, there are straightforward interpretations of \u00a7 1153(h)(3) that allow it to function as a coherent whole. Because the BIA and the Court ignore these interpretations and advance a construction that contravenes the language Congress wrote, I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"*\">\n    <p id=\"p-170\">\n     The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.

First, the dissent cites a statutory provision that does not use the word \"conversion\" at all, so can hardly attest to its meaning. See\n     <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201154\">\n      8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (a)(1)(D)(i)(III). And next, the dissent cites a regulation that post-dated the CSPA by years, and thus is equally irrelevant to what Congress intended. See 71 Fed.Reg. 35732, 35749 (2006) (adding\n     <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.2\">\n      8 CFR \u00a7 204.2\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (i)(1)(iv)). Moreover, both provisions relate to a\n     <em>\n      sui generis\n     </em>\n     circumstance in which a person can\n     <em>\n      self\n     </em>\n     -petition for a visa because her U.S. citizen or LPR relative either died or engaged in domestic abuse. In that situation, the alien's eligibility rests throughout on her connection to the deceased or abusive relative; no new party must ever come in, as one has to in a case like\n     <em>\n      Wang,\n     </em>\n     to salvage a no-longer-effective petition. See\n     <em>\n      infra,\n     </em>\n     at 2205 (addressing the problems that the substitution of a new petitioner raises).\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"11.\">\n    <p id=\"p-192\">\n     Given the statute's broad definition of \"child,\" the only F2A derivative beneficiaries who fall outside that proviso are stepchildren who were over the age of 18 when the petitioner married the spousal beneficiary. See \u00a7 1101(b)(1)(B). The Government represents that thousands of children are designated as F2A derivatives every year. See Reply Brief 18, n. 13.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"12.\">\n    <p id=\"p-193\">\n     It is, therefore, impossible to understand the dissent's statement that conversion of such a petition to an appropriate category requires \" 'substantive alteration' to [the] petition.\" See\n     <em>\n      post,\n     </em>\n     at 2226, n. 8 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.).\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"13.\">\n    <p id=\"p-194\">\n     Still, the respondents' view of the timing of conversion is better than the dissent's. As an initial matter, the dissent's objection to assessing conversion as of the date a visa becomes available hinges on an imaginary difficulty. That approach, the dissent complains, cannot be right because that date always \"occurs before the point at which the child is determined to have aged-out.\"\n     <em>\n      Post,\n     </em>\n     at 2224\n     <em>\n      .\n     </em>\n     Well, yes. The date a visa becomes available is, under the statute, the date an alien ages out (or not); and that status change of course occurs before an immigration official, reviewing a visa application, finds that it has done so. But what of it? When an official determines that an alien was no longer a child on the date a visa became available, he also assesses whether automatic conversion was available to the alien\n     <em>\n      as of\n     </em>\n     that prior date. In other words, here as elsewhere in immigration law, conversion occurs (or not) upon the date of the relevant status change-and no other. See\n     <em>\n      supra,\n     </em>\n     at 2205 - 2206. And once that is understood, the supposed difficulties the dissent throws up all melt away. At the time of the status change, F2A petitions can be converted without further contingencies, decisions, or delays, whereas no other petitions can. But cf.\n     <em>\n      post,\n     </em>\n     at 2224, 2225, n. 7 (countering, irrelevantly, that\n     <em>\n      after\n     </em>\n     an F2A petition is automatically converted, additional steps remain in the immigration process). And immigration officials later reviewing visa applications know that fact, and can treat the different classes of aged-out beneficiaries accordingly.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-195\">\n     Further, the dissent compounds its error by suggesting a baseless alternative date: \"the moment when USCIS receives proof,\" no matter how far in the future, that a new petitioner stands ready and willing to sponsor an aged-out beneficiary.\n     <em>\n      Post,\n     </em>\n     at 2224. Not even the respondents propose such a date, and for good reason. It has no grounding in the CSPA or in any regulatory practice, and it bears no connection to the timing of the status change (aging out) that triggers conversion (or even, as the respondents' date does, to the later determination of that change). The only thing appearing to support the dissent's date is a single-minded resolve, statutory text and administrative practice notwithstanding, to grant relief to every possible aged-out beneficiary.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"14.\">\n    <p id=\"p-196\">\n     Nor does the dissent offer any serious aid to the respondents. The dissent initially acknowledges that automatic conversion cannot involve \"additional decisions, contingencies, or delays.\"\n     <em>\n      Post,\n     </em>\n     at 2223. But no worries, the dissent continues: \"[O]nce [an alien's parent] provides confirmation of her eligibility to sponsor\" the aged-out alien, the original petition \"can automatically be converted to an F2B petition, with no additional decision or contingency\" or (presumably) delay.\n     <em>\n      Post,\n     </em>\n     at 2223. Think about that: Once every decision, contingency, and delay we have just described is over (and a parent has at long last turned out to be a viable sponsor), the dissent assures us that no further decisions, contingencies, and delays remain. Or, put differently, there are no contingencies after all the contingencies have been resolved; no decisions after all the decisions have been made; and no delay after all the delay has transpired. And as if that argument were not awkward enough, consider that it would make automatic conversion turn on the filing of a new document that shows the parent's eligibility to sponsor her aged-out son or daughter-the very thing, as all parties agree, that conversion is supposed to render unnecessary. See\n     <em>\n      supra,\n     </em>\n     at 2205, 2209.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"15.\">\n    <p id=\"p-197\">\n     The dissent appears to think that something helpful to its view follows from repeating the word \"shall\" and changing the subject of the commands. See\n     <em>\n      post,\n     </em>\n     at 2221 - 2222. But that is not so, as some further examples show. \"If you advance to the next round, my assistant shall schedule an interview and you shall come in to answer questions.\" \"If the plane is low on fuel, the tanks shall be refilled and the pilot shall fly the route as scheduled.\" In these sentences, as in our prior ones, the second command is conditional on the first; all that differs is that these sentences are (much like statutes) more formal and stilted.

Far from authorizing an open-ended, free-floating entitlement, that now-superseded regulation allowed an alien to keep his priority date only if he (unlike the respondents' offspring) had a qualifying relationship with the initial petitioner-that is, only if he fell within the group that the BIA in\n     <em>\n      Wang\n     </em>\n     thought entitled to relief.

Yet the plurality's approach does the same thing, because even on its account, some \"decisions, contingencies, or delays\" must occur before conversion can actually be assessed by immigration officials (\n     <em>\n      i.e.,\n     </em>\n     a parent's visa must become available, the child must apply for a visa, and immigration officials must deem her to have aged out, see\n     <em>\n      supra,\n     </em>\n     at 2224). So the only question is whether the \"conversion\" should be considered to occur after all \"decisions, contingencies, or delays\" are in the past such that there is an appropriate category for conversion, or after only some. The former understanding would allow the unambiguous language of the eligibility clause to be carried into effect; the latter would preclude relief for four categories of derivative beneficiaries. In support of its restrictive interpretation, the plurality offers only the argument that converting a petition upon proof of an appropriate category would require the \"filing of a new document ... that shows the parent's eligibility to sponsor her aged-out [child].\"\n     <em>\n      Ante,\n     </em>\n     at 2210, n. 14.

See\n     <em>\n      supra,\n     </em>\n     at 2218 - 2219. A proper analogy would therefore be a provision that says the following: \"If a student is determined to be enrolled at an accredited junior college, community college, or 4-year college, the student's room and board shall be tax-deductible and the student shall receive financial aid.\" Is there any permissible reading of this provision under which, although expressly covered in the eligibility clause, all junior and community college students are categorically forbidden to receive\n     <em>\n      both\n     </em>\n     the tax deduction and financial aid? Of course not. And that would be true even if the term \"room and board\" were ambiguous and thus open to an interpretation under which only 4-year students could receive the tax deduction. Likewise here, where F1, F2B, F3, and F4 derivative beneficiaries may not be categorically excluded from relief because they are indisputably covered by \u00a7 1153(h)(3)'s eligibility clause and able to receive the relief described in the relief clause.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-216\">\n     * * *\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
