By reporting that she had been run off the road by a specific vehicle, the caller necessarily claimed an eyewitness basis of knowledge. The apparently short time between the reported incident and the 911 call suggests that the caller had little time to fabricate the report. And a reasonable officer could conclude that a false tipster would think twice before using the 911 system, which has several technological and regulatory features that safeguard against making false reports with immunity.

We hold that the stop complied with the Fourth Amendment because, under the totality of the circumstances, the officer had reasonable suspicion that the driver was intoxicated.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    <strong>\n     I\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    On August 23, 2008, a Mendocino County 911 dispatch team for the California Highway Patrol (CHP) received a call from another CHP dispatcher in neighboring Humboldt County. The Humboldt County dispatcher relayed a tip from a 911 caller, which the Mendocino County team recorded as follows: \" 'Showing southbound Highway 1 at mile marker 88, Silver Ford 150 pickup. Plate of 8-David-94925.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    Ran the reporting party off the roadway and was last seen approximately five [minutes] ago.' \" App. 36a. The Mendocino County team then broadcast that information to CHP officers at 3:47 p.m.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    A CHP officer heading northbound toward the reported vehicle responded to the broadcast. At 4:00 p.m., the officer passed the truck near mile marker 69. At about 4:05 p.m., after making a U-turn, he pulled the truck over. A second officer, who had separately responded to the broadcast, also arrived on the scene. As the two officers approached the truck, they smelled marijuana. A search of the truck bed revealed 30 pounds of marijuana. The officers arrested the driver, petitioner Lorenzo Prado Navarette, and the passenger, petitioner Jos\u00e9 Prado Navarette.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    Petitioners moved to suppress the evidence, arguing that the traffic stop violated the Fourth Amendment because the officer lacked reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.

The court reasoned that the content of the tip indicated that it came from an eyewitness victim of reckless driving, and that the officer's corroboration of the truck's description, location, and direction established that the tip was reliable enough to justify a traffic stop.\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at *7. Finally, the court concluded that the caller reported driving that was sufficiently dangerous to merit an investigative stop without waiting for the officer to observe additional reckless driving himself.\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at *9.

Police confirmed the truck's location near mile marker 69 (roughly 19 highway miles south of the location reported in the 911 call) at 4:00 p.m. (roughly 18 minutes after the 911 call). That timeline of events suggests that the caller reported the incident soon after she was run off the road. That sort of contemporaneous report has long been treated as especially reliable. In evidence law, we generally credit the proposition that statements about an event and made soon after perceiving that event are especially trustworthy because \"substantial contemporaneity of event and statement negate the likelihood of deliberate or conscious misrepresentation.\" Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule Evid. 803(1), 28 U.S.C.App., p. 371 (describing the rationale for the hearsay exception for \"present sense impression[s]\"). A similar rationale applies to a \"statement relating to a startling event\"-such as getting run off the road-\"made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement that it caused.\" Fed. Rule Evid. 803(2) (hearsay exception for \"excited utterances\"). Unsurprisingly, 911 calls that would otherwise be inadmissible hearsay have often been admitted on those grounds. See D. Binder, Hearsay Handbook \u00a7 8.1, pp. 257-259 (4th ed. 2013-2014) (citing cases admitting 911 calls as present sense impressions);\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508406\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/266/\">\n      id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 9.1, at 274-275 (911 calls admitted as excited utterances). There was no indication that the tip in\n    <em>\n     J. L.\n    </em>\n    (or even in\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    ) was contemporaneous with the observation of criminal activity or made under the stress of excitement caused by a startling event, but those considerations weigh in favor of the caller's veracity here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Another indicator of veracity is the caller's use of the 911 emergency system. See Brief for Respondent 40-41, 44; Brief for United States as\n    <em>\n     Amicus Curiae\n    </em>\n    16-18. A 911 call has some features that allow for identifying and tracing callers, and thus provide some safeguards against making false reports with immunity. See\n    <em>\n     J. L.,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508406\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/266/\">\n      supra,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508406\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/266/\">\n     at 276\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508406\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/266/\">\n     120 S.Ct. 1375\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (KENNEDY, J., concurring). As this case illustrates,\n    see n. 1,\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    911 calls can be recorded, which provides victims with an opportunity to identify the false tipster's voice and subject him to prosecution, see,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Cal.Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 653x (West 2010) (makes \"telephon[ing] the 911 emergency line with the intent to annoy or harass\" punishable by imprisonment and fine); see also \u00a7 148.3 (2014 West Cum. Supp.) (prohibits falsely reporting \"that an 'emergency' exists\"); \u00a7 148.5 (prohibits falsely reporting \"that a felony or misdemeanor has been committed\"). The 911 system also permits law enforcement to verify important information about the caller. In 1998, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) began to require cellular carriers to relay the caller's phone number to 911 dispatchers.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2020.18\">\n     47 CFR \u00a7 20.18\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d)(1) (2013) (FCC's \"Phase I enhanced 911 services\" requirements). Beginning in 2001, carriers have been required to identify the caller's geographic location with increasing specificity. \u00a7\u00a7 20.18(e)-(h) (\"Phase II enhanced 911 service\" requirements). And although callers may ordinarily block call recipients from obtaining their identifying information, FCC regulations exempt 911 calls from that privilege. \u00a7\u00a7 64.1601(b), (d)(4)(ii) ( \"911 emergency services\" exemption from rule that, when a caller so requests, \"a carrier may not reveal that caller's number or name\"). None of this is to suggest that tips in 911 calls are\n    <em>\n     per se\n    </em>\n    reliable. Given the foregoing technological and regulatory developments, however, a reasonable officer could conclude that a false tipster would think twice before using such a system. The caller's use of the 911 system is therefore one of the relevant circumstances that, taken together, justified the officer's reliance on the information reported in the 911 call.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    <strong>\n     C\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Even a reliable tip will justify an investigative stop only if it creates reasonable suspicion that \"criminal activity may be afoot.\"\n    <em>\n     Terry,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/#p21\">\n     392 U.S., at 30\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/#p21\">\n     88 S.Ct. 1868\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Indeed, the accumulated experience of thousands of officers suggests that these sorts of erratic behaviors are strongly correlated with drunk driving. See Nat. Highway Traffic Safety Admin., The Visual Detection of DWI Motorists 4-5 (Mar. 2010), online at http:// nhtsa. gov/ staticfiles/ nti/ pdf/ 808677. pdf (as visited Apr. 18, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). Of course, not all traffic infractions imply intoxication. Unconfirmed reports of driving without a seatbelt or slightly over the speed limit, for example, are so tenuously connected to drunk driving that a stop on those grounds alone would be constitutionally suspect. But a reliable tip alleging the dangerous behaviors discussed above generally would justify a traffic stop on suspicion of drunk driving.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    The 911 caller in this case reported more than a minor traffic infraction and more than a conclusory allegation of drunk or reckless driving. Instead, she alleged a specific and dangerous result of the driver's conduct: running another car off the highway. That conduct bears too great a resemblance to paradigmatic manifestations of drunk driving to be dismissed as an isolated example of recklessness. Running another vehicle off the road suggests lane-positioning problems, decreased vigilance, impaired judgment, or some combination of those recognized drunk driving cues. See Visual Detection of DWI Motorists 4-5. And the experience of many officers suggests that a driver who almost strikes a vehicle or another object-the exact scenario that ordinarily causes \"running [another vehicle] off the roadway\"-is likely intoxicated. See\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n    ., at 5, 8. As a result, we cannot say that the officer acted unreasonably under these circumstances in stopping a driver whose alleged conduct was a significant indicator of drunk driving.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Petitioners' attempts to second-guess the officer's reasonable suspicion of drunk driving are unavailing.

Here the Court makes a big deal of the fact that the tipster was dead right about the fact that a silver Ford F-150 truck (license plate 8D94925) was traveling south on Highway 1 somewhere near mile marker 88. But everyone in the world who saw the car would have that knowledge, and anyone who wanted the car stopped would have to provide that information. Unlike the situation in\n    <em>\n     White,\n    </em>\n    that generally available knowledge in no way makes it plausible that the tipster saw the car run someone off the road.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The Court says,\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1689, that \"[b]y reporting that she had been run off the road by a specific vehicle ... the caller necessarily claimed eyewitness knowledge.\" So what? The issue is not how she claimed to know, but whether what she claimed to know was true. The claim to \"eyewitness knowledge\" of being run off the road supports\n    <em>\n     not at all\n    </em>\n    its veracity; nor does the amazing, mystifying prediction (so far short of what existed in\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    ) that the petitioners' truck\n    <em>\n     would be heading south on Highway 1\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    The Court finds \"reason to think\" that the informant \"was telling the truth\" in the fact that police observation confirmed that the truck had been driving near the spot at which, and at the approximate time at which, the tipster alleged she had been run off the road.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1689. According to the Court, the statement therefore qualifies as a \" 'present sense impression' \" or \" 'excited utterance,' \" kinds of hearsay that the law deems categorically admissible given their low likelihood of reflecting \" 'deliberate or conscious misrepresentation.' \"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122945\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/325/#p330\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (quoting Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule Evid. 803(1), 28 U.S.C.App., p. 371). So, the Court says, we can fairly suppose that the accusation was true.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    No, we cannot. To begin with, it is questionable whether either the \"present\n    sense impression\" or the \"excited utterance\" exception to the hearsay rule applies here. The classic \"present sense impression\" is the recounting of an event that is occurring before the declarant's eyes, as the declarant is speaking (\"I am watching the Hindenburg explode!\"). See 2 K. Broun, McCormick on Evidence 362 (7th ed. 2013) (hereinafter McCormick). And the classic \"excited utterance\" is a statement elicited, almost involuntarily, by the shock of what the declarant is immediately witnessing (\"My God, those people will be killed!\"). See\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122945\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/325/#p330\">\n      id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122945\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/325/#p330\">\n     at 368-369\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . It is the immediacy that gives the statement some credibility; the declarant has not had time to dissemble or embellish. There is no such immediacy here. The declarant had time to observe the license number of the offending vehicle, 8D94925 (a difficult task if she was forced off the road and the vehicle was speeding away), to bring her car to a halt, to copy down the observed license number (presumably), and (if she was using her own cell phone) to dial a call to the police from the stopped car. Plenty of time to dissemble or embellish.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Moreover, even assuming that less than true immediacy will suffice for these hearsay exceptions to apply, the tipster's statement would run into additional barriers to admissibility and acceptance. According to the very Advisory Committee's Notes from which the Court quotes, cases addressing an unidentified declarant's present sense impression \"indicate hesitancy in upholding the statement alone as sufficient\" proof of the reported event. 28 U.S.C.App., at 371; see also 7 M. Graham, Handbook of Federal Evidence 19-20 (7th ed.2012). For excited utterances as well, the \"knotty theoretical\" question of statement-alone admissibility persists-seemingly even when the declarant is known. 2 McCormick 368. \"Some courts ... have taken the position that an excited utterance is admissible only if other proof is presented which supports a finding of fact that the exciting event did occur. The issue has not yet been resolved under the Federal Rules.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122945\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/325/#p330\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122945\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/325/#p330\">\n     at 367-368\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (footnote omitted). It is even unsettled whether excited utterances of an unknown declarant are\n    <em>\n     ever\n    </em>\n    admissible. A leading treatise reports that \"the courts have been reluctant to admit such statements, principally because of uncertainty that foundational requirements, including the impact of the event on the declarant, have been satisfied.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122945\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/325/#p330\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122945\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/325/#p330\">\n     at 372\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In sum, it is unlikely that the law of evidence would deem the mystery caller in this case \"especially trustworthy,\"\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1689.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Finally, and least tenably, the Court says that another \"indicator of veracity\" is the anonymous tipster's mere \"use of the 911 emergency system,\"\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1689.

But assuming the Court is right about the ease of identifying 911 callers, it proves absolutely nothing in the present case unless the anonymous caller was\n    <em>\n     aware\n    </em>\n    of that fact. \"It is the tipster's\n    <em>\n     belief\n    </em>\n    in anonymity, not its\n    <em>\n     reality,\n    </em>\n    that will control his behavior.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 10 (emphasis added). There is no reason to believe that your average anonymous 911 tipster is aware that 911 callers are readily identifiable.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fr4\" name=\"fr4\">\n      2\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    <strong>\n     II\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    All that has been said up to now assumes that the anonymous caller made, at least in effect, an accusation of drunken driving. But in fact she did not. She said that the petitioners' truck \" '[r]an [me] off the roadway.' \" App. 36a. That neither asserts that the driver was drunk nor even raises the\n    <em>\n     likelihood\n    </em>\n    that the driver was drunk. The most it conveys is that the truck did some apparently nontypical thing that forced the tipster off the roadway, whether partly or fully, temporarily or permanently. Who really knows what (if anything) happened? The truck might have swerved to avoid an animal, a pothole, or a jaywalking pedestrian.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    But let us assume the worst of the many possibilities: that it was a careless, reckless, or even intentional maneuver that forced the tipster off the road. Lorenzo might have been distracted by his use of a hands-free cell phone, see Strayer, Drews, &amp; Crouch, A Comparison of the Cell Phone Driver and the Drunk Driver, 48 Human Factors 381, 388 (2006), or distracted by an intense sports argument with Jose, see D. Strayer et al., AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, Measuring Cognitive Distraction in the Automobile 28 (June 2013), online at https:// www. aaafoundation. org/ sites/ default/ files/ Measuring Cognitive Distractions. pdf as visited Apr. 17, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). Or, indeed, he might have intentionally forced the tipster off the road because of some personal animus, or hostility to her \"Make Love, Not War\" bumper sticker. I fail to see how reasonable suspicion of a\n    <em>\n     discrete instance\n    </em>\n    of irregular or hazardous driving generates a reasonable suspicion of\n    <em>\n     ongoing\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     intoxicated driving\n    </em>\n    . What proportion of the hundreds of thousands-perhaps millions-of careless, reckless, or intentional traffic violations committed each day is attributable to drunken drivers? I say 0.1 percent. I have no basis for that except my own guesswork. But unless the Court has some basis in reality to believe that the proportion is many orders of magnitude above that-say 1 in 10 or at least 1 in 20-it has no grounds for its unsupported assertion that the tipster's report in this case gave rise to a\n    <em>\n     reasonable suspicion\n    </em>\n    of drunken driving.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Bear in mind that that is the only basis for the stop that has been asserted in this litigation.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fr5\" name=\"fr5\">\n      3\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    The stop required suspicion of an ongoing crime, not merely suspicion of having run someone off the road earlier. And driving while being a careless or reckless person, unlike driving while being a drunk person, is not an ongoing crime. In other words, in order to stop the petitioners the officers here not only had to assume without basis the accuracy of the anonymous accusation but also had to posit an unlikely reason (drunkenness) for the accused behavior.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    In sum, at the moment the police spotted the truck, it was more than merely \"\n    <em>\n     possib[le]\n    </em>\n    \" that the petitioners were not committing an ongoing traffic crime.\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Not only, it turns out, did the police have no good reason\n    <em>\n     at first\n    </em>\n    to believe that Lorenzo was driving drunk, they had very good reason\n    <em>\n     at last\n    </em>\n    to know that he was not. The Court concludes that the tip, plus confirmation of the truck's location, produced reasonable suspicion that the truck not only had been\n    <em>\n     but still was\n    </em>\n    barreling dangerously and drunkenly down Highway 1.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1690 - 1692. In fact, alas, it was not, and the officers knew it. They followed the truck for five minutes, presumably to see if it was being operated recklessly. And\n    <em>\n     that\n    </em>\n    was good police work. While the anonymous tip was not enough to support a stop for drunken driving under\n    <em>\n     Terry v. Ohio,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/#p21\">\n     392 U.S. 1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/#p21\">\n     88 S.Ct. 1868\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/#p21\">\n     20 L.Ed.2d 889\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1968), it was surely enough to counsel observation of the truck to see if it was driven by a drunken driver. But the pesky little detail left out of the Court's reasonable-suspicion equation is that, for the five minutes that the truck was being followed (five minutes is a\n    <em>\n     long\n    </em>\n    time), Lorenzo's driving was irreproachable. Had the officers witnessed the petitioners violate a single traffic law, they would have had cause to stop the truck,\n    <em>\n     Whren v. United States,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11746960\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/806/#p810\">\n     517 U.S. 806\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 810,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11746960\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/806/#p810\">\n     116 S.Ct. 1769\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11746960\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/806/#p810\">\n     135 L.Ed.2d 89\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1996), and this case would not be before us. And not only was the driving\n    <em>\n     irreproachable,\n    </em>\n    but the State offers no evidence to suggest that the petitioners even did anything\n    <em>\n     suspicious,\n    </em>\n    such as suddenly slowing down, pulling off to the side of the road, or turning somewhere to see whether they were being followed. Cf.\n    <em>\n     Arvizu,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108176\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/266/#p277\">\n      supra,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108176\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/266/#p277\">\n     at 270-271, 277\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108176\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/266/#p277\">\n     122 S.Ct. 744\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (concluding that an officer's suspicion of criminality was enhanced when the driver, upon seeing that he was being followed, \"slowed dramatically,\" \"appeared stiff,\" and \"seemed to be trying to pretend\" that the patrol car was not there). Consequently, the tip's suggestion of ongoing drunken driving (if it could be deemed to suggest that) not only went uncorroborated; it was affirmatively undermined.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    A hypothetical variation on the facts of this case illustrates the point. Suppose an anonymous tipster reports that, while following near mile marker 88 a silver Ford F-150, license plate 8D949925, traveling southbound on Highway 1, she saw in the truck's open cab several five-foot-tall stacks of what was unmistakably baled cannabis. Two minutes later, a highway patrolman spots the truck exactly where the tip suggested it would be, begins following it, but sees nothing in the truck's cab. It is not enough to say that the officer's observation merely failed to corroborate the tipster's accusation. It is more precise to say that the officer's observation\n    <em>\n     discredited\n    </em>\n    the informant's accusation: The crime was supposedly occurring (and would continue to occur) in plain view, but the police saw nothing. Similarly, here, the crime supposedly suggested by the tip was ongoing intoxicated driving, the hallmarks of which are many, readily identifiable, and difficult to conceal. That the officers witnessed nary a minor traffic violation nor any other \"sound indici [um] of drunk driving,\"\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1690, strongly suggests that the suspected crime was\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    occurring after all. The tip's implication of continuing criminality, already weak, grew even weaker.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Resisting this line of reasoning, the Court curiously asserts that, since drunk drivers who see marked squad cars in\n    their rearview mirrors may evade detection simply by driving \"more careful[ly],\" the \"absence of additional suspicious conduct\" is \"hardly surprising\" and thus largely irrelevant.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1691 - 1692. Whether a drunk driver drives drunkenly, the Court seems to think, is up to him. That is not how I understand the influence of alcohol. I subscribe to the more traditional view that the dangers of intoxicated driving are the intoxicant's impairing effects on the body-effects that no mere act of the will can resist. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    A. Dasgupta, The Science of Drinking: How Alcohol Affects Your Body and Mind 39 (explaining that the physiological effect of a blood alcohol content between 0.08 and 0.109, for example, is \"sever[e] impair[ment]\" of \"[b]alance, speech, hearing, and reaction time,\" as well as one's general \"ability to drive a motor vehicle\"). Consistent with this view, I take it as a fundamental premise of our intoxicated-driving laws that a driver soused enough to swerve once can be expected to swerve again-and soon. If he does not, and if the only evidence of his first episode of irregular driving is a mere inference from an uncorroborated, vague, and nameless tip, then the Fourth Amendment requires that he be left alone.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    * * *\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    The Court's opinion serves up a freedom-destroying cocktail consisting of two parts patent falsity: (1) that anonymous 911 reports of traffic violations are reliable so long as they correctly identify a car and its location, and (2) that a single instance of careless or reckless driving necessarily supports a reasonable suspicion of drunkenness. All the malevolent 911 caller need do is assert a traffic violation, and the targeted car will be stopped, forcibly if necessary, by the police. If the driver turns out not to be drunk (which will almost always be the case), the caller need fear no consequences, even if 911 knows his identity. After all, he never alleged drunkenness, but merely called in a traffic violation-and on that point his word is as good as his victim's.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Drunken driving is a serious matter, but so is the loss of our freedom to come and go as we please without police interference. To prevent and detect murder we do not allow searches without probable cause or targeted\n    <em>\n     Terry\n    </em>\n    stops without reasonable suspicion. We should not do so for drunken driving either. After today's opinion all of us on the road, and not just drug dealers, are at risk of having our freedom of movement curtailed on suspicion of drunkenness, based upon a phone tip, true or false, of a single instance of careless driving.
