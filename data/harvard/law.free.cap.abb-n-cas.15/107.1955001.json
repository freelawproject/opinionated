In Croft <em>v. </em>Williams, 88 <em>N. Y. </em>384, this very point is decided. Mary E. Williams, by her will appointed two executors, Croft, who was the plaintiff, and her husband, John Williams. The action was for a settlement of the accounts of the executors. The evidence showed the payment of certain sums of money to Croft, and the delivery of the sums so received by Croft to Williams. Williams misappropriated the moneys so paid to him. The court says (page 387): \u201cThe two sums of $8,008 and $636.12, charged to the executor, were admitted to have been received by him. As he accounted for them in no other manner than by delivering them to his co-executor, by whom they were misappropriated, he established no right to be credited with them in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>account.\u201d In Langford <em>v. </em>Gascoyne, 11 Vesey, 333, Lord Eldon held two executors jointly responsible for assets consisting of gold in a bag delivered to one of them and by him immediately handed to the other, by whom it was squandered. We also refer to Ames <em>v. </em>Armstrong, 106 <em>Mass. </em>15, 18; Mesick <em>v. </em>Mesick, 7 <em>Barb. </em>124 ; Edmonds <em>v. </em>Crenshaw, 14 Peters, 169 ; Clark <em>v. </em>Clark, 8 Paige, 152. See especially, <em>Herrick &amp; Doxsee's Probate Law and </em>Practice, 420. The presumption is that all the executors have received the estate and are liable for its proper application (McKim v. Aulbach, 130 <em>Mass. </em>481; S. C., 2 <em>Am. Pro. Rep. </em>252). Executors cannot release each other from responsibility (Matter of Black, 1 Tucker, 145). The Referee erred in allowing to the plaintiff credit for $959, paid to Andrews to redeem the Butchers\u2019 &amp; Drovers\u2019 bankstock. \u201cIf a certificate of stock expressed in the name of \u2018A. B., trustee,\u2019 is by him pledged to secure his own debt, the pledgee is by the terms of the certificate put on inquiry as to the character and limitations of the trust, and if he accepts the pledge without inquiring he does so at his peril\u201d (Shaw <em>v. </em>Spencer, 100 <em>Mass. </em>382; Jaudon <em>v. </em>National City Bank, 8 <em>Blatchf. </em>430). The declarations of the trustees both of whom have since died are not admissible (Elwood <em>v. </em>Deifendorf, 5 <em>Barb. </em>407). The declarations of a deceased witness not made under oath are inadmissible (Gray <em>v. </em>Goodrich, 7 <em>Johns. </em>95; Spatz <em>v. </em>Lyons, 55 <em>Barb. </em>476 ; Dewey <em>v. </em>Goodenough, 56 <em>Barb. </em>54).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b134-5\"><em>Amasa A. </em>Redfield, for plaintiff, respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AA95\">The innocent executor had no possession as such (3 <em>Williams on Executors </em>[6th Am. Ed.], 1927). Croft <em>v. </em>Williams (88 <em>N. Y. </em>384), is not in point. The rule as to joint liability does not apply where the possession is surrendered for a good reason (Bacon v. Bacon, <em>5 Vesey, </em>331; Matter of Brown, 1 <em>Dall. </em>311; Earle <em>v. </em>Earle, 93 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number><em>N. Y. </em>104). Andrews was a <em>bona fide </em>pledgee (Smith <em>v. </em>Ayer, 101 <em>U. S. </em>327). The evidence of the declarations of deceased witnesses against interest are admissible (1 <em>Whart. on Ev. </em>[2nd ed.] \u00a7 226).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-5\"><em>E. Ellery </em>Anderson, for children of Eleanor McGeary, contended.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVx\">The property affected by the provision in question is personal property; therefore, the persons intended by the words \u201c child or children of the one so dying\u201d must be limited to those who answer the description at the time of distribution. The case of Delaney <em>v. </em>McCormack (88 <em>N. Y. </em>174), is exactly in point. See, further, Brown <em>v. </em>Nicholson, 8 <em>Hun, </em>464; Moore <em>v. </em>Littel, 41 <em>N. Y. 87 </em>; Smith <em>v. </em>Edwards, 88 <em>Id. </em>102, 103 ; Palmer <em>v. </em>Horn, 84 <em>Id. </em>516 ; Warner <em>v. </em>Durant, 76 <em>Id. </em>136; Smith <em>v. </em>Scholtz, 68 <em>Id. </em>41.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-6\"><em>Frederick S. Wait, </em>for the grandchildren of Eleanor McGeary, one of the . sisters, contended that they were entitled to their parent\u2019s share.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5QZ\">The law favors a construction which will not tend to the disinheriting of heirs unless the intention to do so is clearly expressed (Scott <em>v. </em>Guernsey, 48 <em>N. Y. </em>120 ; Low <em>v. </em>Harmony, 72 Id. 408). In Matter of Brown, 93 <em>Id. </em>299, Rapallo, J., said: \u201cIf, however, this language is capable of any construction which would permit the issue of the deceased son to participate in the remainder limited upon his mother\u2019s life estate, that construction should, on well settled principles, be adopted in preference to one which should exclude them.\u201d The estate in remainder vested under the terms of the will in Eleanor McGeary and in Jane Dugan on the testator\u2019s death, with a contingent estate in their descendants which vested as to Ellen McGeary\u2019s share upon her death. It was held in Livingston <em>v. </em>Greene, 52 <em>N. Y. </em>118, followed in Embury <em>v. </em>Sheldon, 2 <em>Abb. N. C. </em>414 ; S. C., 68 <em>N. Y. </em>227, that the words \u201cafter \u201d and \u201cupon the death of his wife,\u201d and like words, do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>not make a contingency, bnt merely indicate when the remainder shall take effect in possession\u2014the commencement of the enjoyment of the estate. Hence Eleanor McGeary and Jane Dugan had a vested estate. See Drake v. Lawrence, 19 <em>Hun, </em>115; Ackerman v. Gorton, 6 <em>Id. </em>301; Moore v. Lyons, 25 <em>Wend. </em>119; Bedell v. Guyon, 12 <em>Hun, </em>396; McKinstry v. Sanders, 2 <em>Supm. Ct. (T. &amp; C.) </em>194, especially Stevenson v. Lesley, 70 <em>N. Y. </em>515. Rapallo, J., says: \u201cAnd where the terms of a bequest import a gift, and also a direction to pay at a subsequent time, the legacy vests mid will not lapse by the death of the legatee before the time for payment has expired, but will pass to his personal representatives \u201d (Manice v. Manice, 43 <em>N. Y. </em>369). This is approvingly quoted in Smith v. Edwards, 88 <em>N. Y. </em>105. The \u201c child or children\u201d referred to in the will were those living at the testator\u2019s death, and included William McGeary, and <em>Ms </em>children are entitled to his share.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-5\">We claim that the \u201cchildren,\u201d including William McGeary, acquired rights upon the death of the testator ; that they had an estate or interest; that <em>Ms </em>death is the d te that governs in determining who were intended by the term children. Merriam v. Simonds, 121 <em>Mass. </em>198; Moore v. Lyons, 25 <em>Wend. </em>119 ; Yeaton v. Roberts, 28 <em>N. H. </em>459; Tucker v. Bishop, 16 <em>N. Y. </em>404 ; Especially Stevenson v. Lesley, 70 N. <em>Y. </em>515. And that the children living at that time were the ones intended, subject to let in after born issue. Any other construction would be strained, harsh and unnatural. To cut off the children of William McGeary would be enforcing \u201c snvivorship \u201d without finding that word in the will; it would be running counter to the rule of construction that the courts will favor that interpretation which accords with the statutes of descent and distribution, and would be supplying, by implication, words not iound in the instrument. See Stevenson v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Lesley, 70 <em>N. Y. 515. </em>The issue of deceased children took in Teed <em>v. </em>Morton, 60 <em>N. Y. </em>502, a case which, though not entirely in point, favors our views. See also Williams <em>v. </em>Conrad, 30 <em>Barb. </em>530. In Ballard <em>v. </em>Connors, 10 <em>Rich. Eq. </em>389, the testator\u2019s direction was to divide after sale \u201camong my surviving children,\u201d and it was held that they should be ascertained at the testator\u2019s'death, and not at the time of division. Again, in Moore <em>v. </em>Lyons, 25 <em>Wend. </em>119, the devise was of real estate to one for life, after his death to three others, or the survivor or survivors of them. It was held that the remaindermen took vested interests at the death of the testator, and consequently, though at the death of the life tenant but one remainderman survived, he took only one-third. The words of survivor-ship refer to the death of the testator and not to the death of the life tenant. In Long <em>v. </em>Labor, 8 <em>Pa. St. </em>231, the fund was to be divided \u201camong my children who shall be living at the time of such distribution, and in case any of them should be deceased, their heirs to receive in equal pairts such share as their parents would be entitled to receive were they living.\u201d The issue of a child who died before the date of the will were held entitled to participate. The word \u201cchildren\u201d is often used in the sense of \u201cissue.\u201d See Haldeman <em>v. </em>Haldeman, 40 <em>Pa. St. </em>29 ; 3 <em>Jarman on </em>Wills, <em>(R. &amp; T.) </em>194; 2 <em>Ibid. </em>695, or of \u201cdescendants.\u201d 2 <em>Jarman on Wills, ch. </em>30. Stevenson <em>v. </em>Lesley, 70 <em>N. Y. </em>512, seems also decisive in our favor. Asa general rule a will of personalty speaks as of the time of testator\u2019s death (Tucker <em>v. </em>Bishop, 16 <em>N. Y. </em>404). The interest of Wm. McCreary was capable of descending to these children (Hennessy <em>v. </em>Patterson, 85 <em>N. Y. </em>99; Lawrence <em>v. </em>Bayard, 7 <em>Paige </em>76). See Drake <em>v. </em>Lawrence, 19 <em>Hun, </em>114.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-5\">It is conceded that the words \u201cchild or children \u201d are usually taken in their ordinary sense, unless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>intention of the testator, as gathered from the whole instrument, plainly shows a different purpose (Mowatt <em>v. </em>Carow, 7 <em>Paige, </em>328 ; Sherman <em>v. </em>Sherman, 3 <em>Barb. </em>387; Lawrence <em>v. </em>Hebbard, 1 <em>Bradf. </em>255 ; Hone <em>v. </em>Van Schaick, 3 <em>N. Y. </em>540 ; Guernsey v. Guernsey, 36 <em>Id. </em>272; Feit <em>v. </em>Vanatta, 21 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>84; Magaw <em>v. </em>Field, 48 <em>N. Y. </em>668; Palmer <em>v. </em>Horn, 84 <em>Id. </em>516; Wylie <em>v. </em>Lockwood, 86 <em>Id. </em>291). Yet cases are not uncommon in which the word children has been construed to mean \u201c issue,\u201d \u201c descendants \u201d or \u201cgrandchildren.\u201d We do not, however, ask for any unnatural construction. We ask to have this word construed as meaning \u201c children living at the testator\u2019s death\u201d or \u201cdescendants.\u201d We direct special attention to the case of Prowitt <em>v. </em>Rodman in our court of appeals, 37 <em>N. Y. </em>42, where the language of the will gave the property to Mrs. P. during her life, and after her death \u201c to such children as should be living at the time of her death.\u201d This was held to include grandchildren. Kingsland <em>v. </em>Leonard (65 <em>How. Pr. </em>7), seems to be in point. A. died in 1844, leaving two sons and two daughters. Residuary estate was left to his son B., but in case he died without lawful issue, \u201c to my remaining children, share and share alike.\u201d The other son died in 1859, leaving four children\u2014the plaintiffs in the action. B,, the residuary devisee, died in 1881. It was held that the plaintiffs took their father\u2019s third interest. Here the decedent stands for William Dougherty, the residuary devisee for Mrs. Wright (Dougherty), the son who died in 1859, for Eleanor McGeary,and the successful plaintiffs for the grandchildren whom 1 represent. Compare Bowne <em>v. </em>Underhill, 6 <em>Supm. Ct. {T. &amp; C.) </em>344. Tier <em>v. </em>Pennell, 1 <em>Edw. Ch. </em>354, may possibly be cited against me, but it has no bearing on this case. There the grandchild was very properly excluded, for the language was that the property should go to the child or children A. should leave at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>the time of her decease. There is no such language in our will. So in Palmer <em>v. </em>Horn, 84 N. <em>Y. </em>518, the estate was to be divided among those \u201cliving at my death.\u201d Smith v. Scholtz, 68 N. <em>Y. </em>41, and Moore v. Littell, 41 <em>Id. </em>66, and other cases cited are not authorities against the grandchildren. The word \u201cheir\u201d is used. See the distinction in Livingston <em>v. </em>Greene, 52 N. <em>Y </em>123. Delaney <em>v. </em>McCormack, 88 <em>Id. </em>174, is not in point against the rights of the grandchildren to share. In that case there was no gift to the \u201c next of kin only a direction to create a fund in the future in the event of certain prescribed contingencies. The very substance of the gift was to come into existence in the future. Furthermore, searching for next of kin at the testator\u2019s death would have in that case included a party w'ho was manifestly excluded. Beebe <em>v. </em>Estabrook, 79 N. <em>Y. </em>246, furnishes an analogy. The word children in the statute of distribution in reference to advancements was held to mean all the descendants of the intestate entitled to share in his estate. Kent says, \u201c children as well as issue may stand in a collective sense for grandchildren when the justice or reason of the case requires it\u201d (4 <em>Kent's Com. </em>419 ; Dickinson <em>v. </em>Lee, 4 <em>Watts [Pa.] </em>82; Royle <em>v. </em>Hamilton, 4 <em>Ves. </em>437; Wyth <em>v. </em>Blackman, 1 <em>Yes. Sr. </em>196).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b139-5\">Davis, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ajt\">The plaintiff as executor of his deceased wife, brings this action for an accounting in respect of the estate of one William Dougherty, her former husband, of which estate she was by his last will, an executrix and one of the trustees. William Dougherty died in 1863, leaving a last will and testament, which was subsequently admitted to probate, in and by which he gave, devised and bequeathed to his widow absolutely, his residence in the city of New York and his furniture and other property therein \u201cexcept such stocks and bonds as might be in said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>house\u201d at his decease. The will then proceeds as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-5\">\u201cI do also, and in addition to the above provision made in favor of my said wife, Mary Jane Dougherty, give and bequeath unto my executors, hereinafter named, all the rest, residue and' remainder of my estate, property and effects of every nature, kind and description wheresoever situated, upon the following trusts, that is to say: In trust to invest the same as soon after my decease as practicable, and to keep the same invested in bond and mortgage or in bank or insurance stocks, or in stocks,, bonds or other securities of the State of New York or of the United States,with power to change and vary such or any part of such investment from time to time, as my said executors may deem best, and to receive and pay over the income and interest to be realized therefrom to my said wife, Mary Jane Dougherty, during her-natural life ; and after the decease of my said wife, to pay said principal moneys so invested as above provided, to my two beloved sisters, Eleanor McGeary and Jane Dugan, in equal shares and proportions. And in case either or both my said sisters shall have died before the decease of my said wife, then and in such case the child or children of the one so dying to take and be entitled to the share and portion his, her or their mother would have been entitled to had such mother survived my said wife.\u201d .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">\u2018 Both of the sisters named in this provision of the will were living at the time of the death of the testator. At that time Eleanor McGeary had then living five children, to wit, Hugh, Francis, Patrick, John and William McGeary. William died in March, 1873, leaving eight children. Eleanor McGeary died in March, 1877. John'McGeary died after his mother, but before the death of Mrs. Dougherty, the life tenant, who died in 1882. John left three children him surviving.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>The question presented and in issue between the defendants in the action is whether the children of William and the children of John respectively, are each entitled to a share of the estate ; or whether Hugh, Francis and Patrick McCreary are alone entitled under the provisions of the will. The referee held, and the judgment entered upon his report declares, that the children of John and William are entitled to take, under the will, the interest that would have belonged to their fathers respectively had they been living at the death of the life tenant</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">We are of opinion that this conclusion of the learned referee is correct. By the provisions of the will, a life estate in the trust fund was vested in the widow of the testator, with remainder over to the two sisters named therein. The estate in remainder vested in the sisters respectively as an estate <em>in present\u00ed </em>to come into possession upon the death of the life tenant. On the death of Mrs. McCreary, the estate so vested in her became vested in her surviving children and in the children of her deceased son William. The subsequent death of John McCreary carried his interest in the estate of his three children. We think the intention of the testator that the estate should so vest and take the direction thus indicated was manifest by the provisions of the will, and the construction given by the learned referee is upheld by authority. His construction, to use the language of Andrews, J. in Stevens <em>v. </em>Leslie (70 <em>N. Y. </em>215), \u201c prevents the disinheritance of the issue of remainder-men who may happen to die before the termination of the precedent estate, a consequence which cannot be supposed, in the absence of express words, to have been intended by the testator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">In the matter of the estate of Brown (29 <em>Hun, </em>412), a similar question was presented and it was held that a vested remainder in the child of a daughter, enured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>to the benefit of his child under the several authorities cited. The case was affirmed by the court of appeals (93 N. <em>Y. </em>299) in which it was laid down as the rule, that where the language of the will is capable of any construction that will permit the issue of a deceased child to participate in the remainder limited upon his parent\u2019s life, that construction should, on settled principles, be adopted in preference to one which would exclude them. And this is the principle established in Scott v. Guernsey (48 N. <em>Y. </em>120); Low <em>v. </em>Hamony (72 N. <em>Y. </em>408) and Hennessy <em>v. </em>Patterson (85 N. <em>Y. </em>98). We see no reason to doubt that the referee has properly applied it in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The other questions in this case arise upon the accounting. They relate to the refusal of the referee to charge the estate of Mrs. Wright with $5,000 of U. S. bonds which Oscar Spence, her co-executor and trustee under the will of William Dougherty, had appropriated to his own use and lost. By the will, Mrs. Dougherty and Oscar Spence, a nephew of the testator were made (to use the testator\u2019s language) \u201c executors and trustees under this my last will and testament.\u201d They both qualified and letters testamentary were issued to them. Shortly afterwards and before any trust or executorial acts had been performed the executrix and executor with their counsel and with the appraisers appointed by the Surrogate, met at the then late residence of the testator to make an inven-1 tory. For that purpose Mrs. Dougherty brought out from an inner room a box of securities which were then inventoried and appraised. After the inventory and appraisement were complete Oscar Spence, the executor, took possession of the box containing the securities and carried it from the house. The executrix did not afterward see them or have any custody of any part of them until January, 1872, when, Spence having failed in business, she called on him for the secur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>ities and learned that some of them had been misappropriated by him. In a few days she succeeded in obtaining the box from Spence, and then ascertained that he had long previously sold the U. S. treasury notes and bond, and appropriated the proceeds to his own use, and had pledged 100 shares of Butchers\u2019 &amp; Drovers\u2019 bankstock to one Andrews' for a loan of money amounting to $959. The referee found upon the evidence that Mrs. Dougherty was not, under the circumstances, chargeable as executrix or trustee, with the value of the lost treasury notes and bond. Our examination of the evidence in the case satisfies us that this conclusion was correct. Of those securities Mrs. Dougherty (afterwards Mrs. \" Wright) never received the control or possession as executrix or trustee. They were, it seems, in fact, in the house of the testator at the time of his decease and were expressly excepted in the devise or bequest to her. The bare fact that the unopened box remained there until the time when it was brought forward and delivered to the appraisers for their action, is not enough to charge the widow, who rightfully possessed the house, with actual possession as executrix or trustee of the property contained in the box. Nor does the evidence justify the conclusion that she did anything in the nature of delivering the property to her co-executor Spence such as would charge her with responsibility for his subsequent acts. He took the same into his custody, doubtless in her presence, but in the exercise of his legal right, and the most that can be said upon the evidence is that she did not object or refuse to permit him to take such possession. So far therefore as those securities are concerned, we think the' referee disposed rightfully of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The question in respect to the 100 shares of Butchers\u2019 &amp; Drovers\u2019 bankstock is a little more embarrassing, The certificate of those shares was also in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>box and taken by Spence precisely as were the treasury notes and bond. But the case shows that he afterwards wrongfully pledged the certificate to one Andrews for loans of money amounting to $959. When Mrs. Dougherty (or Wright) discovered this fact, .Spence had become insolvent. The pledgee of the property refused to surrender it and claimed to be the holder of it in good faith on the advancement of the money loaned, and after some negotiation she seems to have been advised to the effect, that her rights were perhaps doubtful and at any rate could not be vindicated except by a lawsuit. She thereupon, for the purpose of securing the possession of the certificate, paid to Andrews the amount of the loan, to wit, $959 ; and her executor on this accounting brings in the certificate as an asset and claims to be allowed the sum which the executrix paid to redeem it. It appears that Spence transferred it to Andrews in his character as executor for he signs the transfer \u201cOscar Spence, Executor.\u201d The stock all the while stood in the name of the testator Dougherty. There is not much donbt but that these facts were sufficient notice to Andrews of the true nature of the transaction, but it does not appear that he knew the money was not borrowed for the benefit of the estate. It was undoubtedly borrowed in fact, for the private use of Spence ; and it is a serious question whether it was not the duty of the executrix instead of redeeming the stock, to have prosecuted for its recovery. But this course would have been accompanied with very considerable expense and delay, and as the 100 shares of bankstock were of very much larger value than the amount for which they were pledged, it was probably a wise discretion to redeem, rather than to litigate. In view of all the facts we are not disposed to disturb the disposition made by the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">There are several questions arising in the course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>the trial upon exceptions to evidence. But as this was an equitable case, and we are able to see that it should have been disposed of without the objectionable evidence, precisely as it has been by the learned referee, we think it no violation of any equitable or legal principle to hold that the admission of such evidence, even if erroneous, should not have the effect to reverse the judgment. So far as relates to the statements made and documents executed by Spence, those may well be treated as part of the <em>res </em>gestee, inasmuch as they took place in the progress of the efforts to recover possession of the assets. It was the duty of the executrix to inquire into their disposition by him, and in the discharge of that duty his statements as to what had become of them and where, and how the possession of those not totally lost could be secured, should not be treated, we think, as mere hearsay evidence. What the-executrix said to her own counsel touching the same subjects was probably not properly admissible. But we cannot see that it could rightfully have affected the result to such an extent as to demand a new trial. If stricken wholly from the case, the result should be the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs of the respective parties out of the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Daniels and Beady, JJ., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Note.\u2014In the foregoing case, it was not perhaps necessary to pass upon or even to point out a distinction which in another case might be material, namely, between taking under the will and taking as successors of one who'took under the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">The will created a trust for the'widow\u2019s life, and gave the principal to be divided on her death between testator\u2019s sisters, and if either or both of the sisters should pre-decease the wife, the child or children of the one so dying to take the portion their mother would have taken had she survived the widow. And it was <em>held, </em>that on the death of a sister before the widow, leaving children surviving, followed by the death (also before the widow) of one of such children leaving children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>surviving her and also surviving the widow, the latter children took the share their parent would have taken had they survived t\u00dce widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">But the clause in the will is obscurely drawn, and it may serve a useful purpose to analyze the obscurities.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">1. There is an absolute gift of a share of the principal to each sister, and a limitation over to her child1 or children in case she should die before the widow. This leaves it a question, what would have been the result if. a sister had died leaving no children surviving the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">It was clear, however, that children surviving the widow took <em>under the </em>will, not as next of kin of the sister, their mother. Further it is determined by this case that children of the deceased sister, surviving the testator and not surviving the widow, took also under the will, and not as next of kin of their mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">The language of the opinion seems to favor the view that the intention of the testator was that grandchildren of a deceased child should take the interest the child would have taken. And in this view the grandchildren take as legatees under the will. The same result might be reached by holding that the estate of the child, vested in interest under the will, was not divested' or terminated by the death of that child, but passed to her children as her next of kin. In this view such grandchildren would not take as legatees of the testator, but as successors of a legatee. The importance of this distinction would appear if there were creditors of the deceased child of a sister, in which case her grandchildren\u2019s portion could not \u2019be touched if the children took under the will, but might be if they took under the deceased child of their mother:\u2014or if they were illegitimate children of a sister\u2019s daughter, in which case they could not take, on the theory that they were legatees, but might, on the theory that they succeeded by statute to their mother\u2019s interest;\u2014or if the child of the deceased sister was indebted to the estate, in which case the executors could stop their share so far as necessary to pay their parent\u2019s debt if they took as the successors under the statute, but could not if they took as legatees under- the will. Moreover, if they took as next of kin of their parent as above indicated, on the theory that he had a vested interest which would pass on his death to his next of kin, payment and distribution to them must be made through his executor or administrator; while if they took as legatees under the will, payment might be made direct to them by testator\u2019s trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">- For recent cases illustrating this obscure but important distinction, see Leggett <em>v. </em>Leggett, 24 <em>Hun, </em>333, 336; Tillman <em>v. </em>Sullivan, 63 <em>How.
