His last will and testament was admitted to probate July 10, 1878, and the defendant was appointed executor and trustee under said will, and he qualified as such. The testator devised to his widow, the plaintiff, the possession and the use of the premises known as number <em>42 </em>Lansing street, in the city of Utica, for and during the period of her natural life, and also, viz.:\u2014\u201cThe net annual income and interest of all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, real, personal and mixed, after paying therefrom the annual taxes, insurance and necessary repairs, for and during the term of her natural life, or as long as she should remain my widow and unmarried\u2014the same to be in lieu of dower, and of all and any other claim or claims on my estate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-9\">The deceased left two other parcels of real estate, and subsequently to July 10,1878, the defendant leased the real estate, and collected the rents therefrom down to April 1, 1882, and then disposed of all the real estate except the homestead on Lansing street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-10\">Defendant paid all the debts, liabilities, funeral expenses and the expenses of settling the estate, including executor\u2019s commissions, and paid to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>plaintiff the sum of $39 ; and there remained in his hands, April 1, 1882, $2,048.92.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-5\">He had received, prior to December, 1882, by way of rents for the real estate, $1,923.67.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AjH\">We think that the referee\u2019s finding that a demand was made on December 1, 1882, of the defendant in behalf of the plaintiff, was warranted by the evidence given upon the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Mr. Dunmore testified affirmatively that he made the demand personally of the defendant, and that the defendant refused to make any payment to the plaintiff for or on account of the trust estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Johnson as a witness admitted that he held a conversation in December, 1882, with Mr. Dunmore, and that Mr. Dunmore claimed that the plaintiff was entitled to interest on all the money in his hands from the time he was appointed executor. He denies, however, that Mr. Dunmore made any demand for any money in any way, shape or manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">It was for the referee to determine upon the conflict between these witnesses whether or not the demand was established. We are not prepared to say that his findings are against the truth of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">This action was brought to recover the income of the trust property which came to the hands of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">We think this court has jurisdiction of such an action, and that the jurisdiction of the surrogate in respect to such a legacy is not exclusive. Section 1819 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that a person entitled to a legacy may maintain an action against the executor who refused to pay over after the expiration of one year from the granting of letters testamentary.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>It was held in Lewis <em>v. </em>Maloney, 12 <em>Hun, </em>207, viz.: ee The supreme court has concurrent jurisdiction with the surrogate in enforcing the payment of legacies.\u201d Such jurisdiction has been maintained for a long period of time anterior to the adoption of the section to which we have referred <em>(Willard' s Equity </em>Jur. [Potter\u2019s edition], 88 ; Seymour <em>v. </em>Seymour, 4 <em>Johns. Ch. </em>409 ; Spelman <em>v. </em>Terry, 74 <em>N. Y. </em>448).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">We think there is no force in the suggestion that the plaintiff could not recover because the proper parties were not before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">This legacy given to the widow in lieu of dower, does not abate as other legacies, and other residuary legatees are not necessary parties (Scofield <em>v. </em>Adams, 12 <em>Hun, </em>366).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Besides, there was no defect of parties alleged as a defense in the answer; and whatever objection the defendant might have had in that regard was waived <em>(Code Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 488, 498, 499). We think the decree entered July 2, 1882, was not a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery of her legacy. Section 2742 of the Code of Civil Procedure declares upon what facts a surrogate\u2019s decree should be conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">We think the account rendered by the defendant to the surrogate was his account as executor and not as testamentary trustee. In July, 1881, the debts of the testator had not been paid, and there had been no demonstration that there would have been a surplus after the debts were paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">It does not appear that the plaintiff\u2019s right to the legacy which she seeks to recover in this action was or could have been litigated in the proceedings before the surrogate to settle the executor\u2019s accounts. We therefore conclude that the surrogate\u2019s decree was not a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s .right of recovery in this action (Fulton <em>v. </em>Whitney, 66 <em>N. Y. </em>557; Marcellus <em>v. </em>Countryman, 65 <em>Barb. </em>201). We think it was com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>petent to show by parol what questions were included in the hearing before the surrogate (Briggs v. Wells, <em>12 Barb. </em>567 ; Agan v. Hey, <em>30 Hun, </em>591; 4 <em>N. Y. </em>75).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">We think the plaintiff was.entitled.to her rents and profits and the income of the testator\u2019s estate remaining after the payment of the funeral expenses, expenses of administration and the debts, though the precise sum was not ascertained until a period subsequent to the probate of the will (Cooke v. Meeker, 36 <em>N. Y. 15; </em>Pierce v. Chamberlain; 41 <em>How. Pr. </em>501). Under this ruling, the finding of the referee of the amount due to the plaintiff is sufficiently favorable to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">We are of the opinion that the referee committed no error as to costs of which the defendant can successfully complain. Where a trustee obtains funds belonging to the <em>cestui que trust, </em>he should be ready and willing to pay and apply .the same according to the-direction and the intent of the founder of the trust, without delay (Eberhardt v. Schuster, 6 <em>Abb. N. C. </em>141).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The defendant has prosecuted this appeal for the purpose of relieving himself of personal liability, and as he has been unsuccessful, we are of the opinion that the costs of this appeal should be charged upon the appellant personally <em>(Code Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7 3246; Butler v. B. &amp; A. R. R. Co., 24 <em>Hun, </em>99).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">Judgment affirmed with costs against the appellant personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">\u2022 Boat\u00eddmae\" J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b502-10\">Follett, J.[Dissenting.]</author>\n<p id=\"A-3\">The supreme and surrogate\u2019s courts have concurrent jurisdiction to compel the defendant to pay the plaintiff the amount to which she is entitled under the will; but the court which first acquires jurisdiction has exclusive jurisdiction (Lewis v. Maloney, 12 <em>Hun, </em>207). As to all rents received prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>to the accounting before the surrogate, that court ac- \u25a0 quired jurisdiction, before which court the parties litigated their claims, and are bound by its decree until reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The referee held that, the plaintiff was entitled to recover the rents received prior to and embraced within the decree of the surrogate\u2019s court, which was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Apart from the decree of the surrogate\u2019s court being a bar to the recovery of the rents received prior to its entry, the plaintiff, at most, was only entitled to recover the income of the clear residue ($2,048.92) from the death of the testator, May 3, 1878, to February 14, 1883, the date of commencement of the action (Williamson <em>v. </em>Williamson, 6 Paige, 298 ; <em>Williams on Executors </em>[6 Am. ed.] 1488-1492, and cases there cited).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The will provides, first, for the payment of debts, then specifically devises No. 42 Lansing street, and then gives the next annual income of the rest, residue and remainder of his estate to his widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Residue means what is left after paying the debts, devises and legacies (Phelps <em>v. </em>Robbins, 40 <em>Conn. </em>250 ; 2 <em>Williams on Ex'rs. </em>[6 Am. ed.] 1563-1564 ; 2 <em>Abb. Law Dict. </em>422 ; <em>Wharton's Law Dict. </em>[6 ed.] 843).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">Under the decision of the referee, the plaintiff recovers the income upon the residue from the death of the testator, and upon the debts, or upon the amount required to pay the debts, and more. It was not shown that defendant received, or could have received, income over and above expenses equal to the legal rate of interest on the residue ; yet the sum awarded exceeds the sum which the residue could have earned at six per cent, from the death of the testator to the commencement of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">The referee gave the plaintiff costs out of the estate and refused the defendant costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">The prevailing opinion on this appeal charges the defendant personally with the costs of this action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>\u00abNo objection has been raised to the defendant\u2019s account, or to a single item in it. His administration of the trust has been wise and economical. No part ef the estate has been used for the payment of counsel or doubtful expenses. He submitted the claims of the widow to the surrogate\u2019s court, without the aid of counsel, making no contention, and has strictly followed its decree. To charge a trustee with costs under such circumstances, because an appellate court takes a different view from a court of concurrent jurisdiction of a doubtful question of law, is imposing too severe responsibilities upon trustees. It is, in effect, saying that they must know at their peril how the appellate court will decide the mooted question.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">This action not being for the recovery of the income upon the residue, and no demand having been made upon that theory, the judgment should be reversed and the complaint dismissed, with costs against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
