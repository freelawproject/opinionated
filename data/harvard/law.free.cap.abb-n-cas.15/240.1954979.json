The plaintiff appealed to the general term from said judgment; he also made a case containing exceptions, upon which a motion was made at special term for a new trial, which was denied, and he appealed from the order denying such motion to the general term. On the appeal the general term reversed the order and judgment and granted a new trial, costs to abide the event. In the special term order, denying a new trial, there was no direction as to costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-11\">On the second trial plaintiff recovered, and included in his bill of costs $20 before argument and $40 for argument on the appeal at general term, and also like sums before and for argument, on the motion for a new trial at special term. The latter items ($20 and $40) the clerk, on motion of defendant, struck out, and the plaintiff made this motion for a new taxation.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b264-12\"><em>Groo &amp; </em>Wiggins,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2o\">for the motion, claimed that under Code Civ.
