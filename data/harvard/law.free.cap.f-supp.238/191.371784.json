Your decision finds that certain movements covered by the aforementioned entry which are now marked \u2018unadjusted\u2019 have been adjusted to two positions and must be so marked to comply with the requirements of paragraph 367 of the Tariff Act of 1930. We claim that the said movements have not been adjusted to position and are in fact unadjusted and that the marking thereon as \u2018unadjusted\u2019 is a complete and proper marking in conformity with the requirements of said paragraph 367 of said Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-23\">\u201c2. The corrections which were made after assembly of the movements covered by the aforementioned entry, as set forth in the information furnished pursuant to Treasury Decision 54286, are not such as would make said movements adjusted to two positions and said movements are in fact \u2018unadjusted\u2019. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Imported watch movements manufactured and corrected in substantially the same manner as the said movements and marked \u2018unadjusted\u2019 were, from the enactment of said Tariff Act of 1930 until the promulgation of Treasury Decision 54286, uniformly classified and assessed by you as \u2018unadjusted\u2019 for duty purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-2\">\u201c3.

In any event, under said paragraph 367 the determination to mark a watch movement either with number and class of adjustments or the word \u2018unadjusted\u2019 is within the sole discretion of the manufacturer or producer of such movement, and additional duties for \u2018adjustments\u2019, if any, are to be levied on the basis of the markings on such movement as determined by the manufacturer or producer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-4\">\u201c5. Insofar as your decision that said movements are adjusted to two (2) positions rests on Treasury Desion 54286, said Treasury Decision is not authorized by, and is in conflict with said paragraph 367 and, therefore, is invalid, illegal, null and void.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">\u201c6.

That process results solely in making the instrument run faster or slower to the same extent in each and every position and does not result in any modification of any difference between rates in the individual positions. Any operation which results in making the instrument run faster or slower to a different extent in any tested or observed position than in any other tested or observed position, or results in a modification of any difference between rates in the individual positions, goes beyond the process of timing and regulation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-4\">\u201cIn order to facilitate the determination of whether imported watch movements or other mechanisms, devices, or instruments provided for in paragraph 367(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, have been specially manipulated after assembly to produce an adjustment or adjustments within the meaning of paragraphs 367(a) and 367(b) of the act and T.D. 50277(3), certain information is required. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">* -* * * \u25a0*\u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">\u201cIn order to provide sufficient time to comply with these requirements this amendment shall become effective after 180 days after publication in the weekly Treasury Decisions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">It may be noted here that with each shipment a certificate was attached to the invoice by the manufacturer in Switzerland to meet the requirements of said T.D. 54286.

Graef, Inc., and one of the movements, No. 10377486, covered by protest 62/1793, in the name of Longines-Wittnauer Co., Inc., are, in fact, unadjusted within the meaning of paragraph 367(b) (j).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">Plaintiffs introduced the testimony of the seven witnesses described below.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">M. Fred Cartoun, chairman of the Board of Longines-Wittnauer Watch Co., Inc., New York City, importer and dealer in watch movements and watches, has been associated with the Longines-Wittnauer Watch Co., Inc., since 1936 in an executive capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">Jean Robert Graef, president of Jean R. Graef, Inc., importer of the Girard-Perregaux watches; educated in Switzerland; a graduate of the Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland, as a mechanical and electrical engineer; entered the watch business in the United States in 1925 and, since that time, has been chief executive of his company, which is engaged in the importation of Swiss watches and movements and their sale in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-14\">Henry B. Fried, an instructor of watchmaking for the City of New York, at the George Westinghouse Vocational &amp; Technical High School in Brooklyn. At the age of\" 11, started training by his father; was later apprenticed and employed by watch importers and, for a while, engaged in his own business of watch repairing; technical adviser to the Watch Dealers Association; also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>technical director to the American Watchmakers Institute and horological editor for the Jewelers Circular Keystone, the largest trade publication in the United States; has served as consultant to the Federal Trade Commission and several of the largest watch companies in the United States, and is a certified master watchmaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Julian Lazrus, an executive of the Benrus Watch Company, Inc., manufacturer and distributor of watches, watch-cases, and watch movements in Switzerland and in the Virgin Islands; his company has several factories in Switzerland for the production of watch movements which are imported and distributed in the United States. Lazrus visits these plants twice a year for a period of about 8 weeks to observe the production of their merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Hugues Vaucher, technical director of the Balance Wheel factories in Bienne, Switzerland, manufacturer and dealer in balance wheels for most of the Swiss watch manufacturers, having sold \u201clast 5rear 35,000,000 balance wheels\u201d which is enough to supply more than three-quarters of all the watches made in Switzerland. In 1949, he came to America to work with the Hamilton Watch Co., Lancaster, Pa., and later with the United States Time Corp. at Little Rock, Ark. In 1953, he returned to the balance wheel factories in Bienne, Switzerland, as technical director.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Marc Edouard Nardin, vice director and chief engineer in the research and development section of Longines, in Switzerland, being highly trained in the horological field. From 1947 to 1950, this witness was with the Patek Philippe Co. in Geneva, Switzerland, designing Patek Philippe watches, said to be among the highest in grade and quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">James O\u2019Shaughnessy, shop superintendent of the Longines-Wittnauer Watch Co. in New York, with 40 years\u2019 experience in the watch industry, served his apprenticeship in Ireland in a jewelry store, came to the United States in 1926 and worked for about 8 years as a watchmaker in one store and for 10 years in another. For about 5 years, was chief instructor in the Taus School of Watchmaking and, in 1953, became superintendent at the Longines-Wittnauer plant where he has about 40 watchmakers under his direct supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">The following six witnesses were introduced by the defendant:</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">Ernest W. Drescher, mechanical engineer and manager of the quality control section of consumer products with the Bulova Watch Co.; formerly with the Hamilton Watch Co., where he spent 1 year in student training, 3 years in the mechanical department, about 17 years in watch-movement design, becoming familiar with all phases of watchmaking, and the balance of the time in quality control.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">Harold L. Rapp, advertising manager of Bulova International; having joined that firm in 1941 as a journeyman in the assembly departments; later, spent some time in the manufacturing departments; for about 7 years, was manager of a watch importing concern, known as the Wyler Watch Co.; returned to Bulova as editor of a publication, known as \u201cThe Watch Repair Digest\u201d; later, became sales manager of the Eterna Watch Co.; again x-eturned to Bulova.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">Arthur B. Sinkler, president and chairman of the board, Hamilton Watch Co., Lancaster, Pa., engaged in the manufacture and sale of jewel lever watches. In additioix to the factory at Lancaster, his. company owns and operates assembly plants in Switzerland and in the Virgin Islands, and in Tokyo. His experience with Hamilton began in 1935, when he was trained in its assembly departments and engaged in what is known as position adjusting. After several years\u2019 experience in various departments of the company, he became executive vice president in 1953 and president of the company in 1954, the position he now holds.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-13\">Richard W. Slaugh, manager of foreign technical service of the Hamilton Watch Co., which he joined in 1919 as an erx*and boy; later, transferred to the service department, whex-e he repaired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>watches as a pieceworker until 1935; then became supervisor of inspection of purchase material and supervisor in several manufacturing departments until in 1938 he was transferred to the research department; in 1947, succeeded Mr. Sinkler as foreman in charge of assembly research, and, in 1948, was appointed head watchmaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">Max J. Schwartz, technical director of the Bulova Watch Co.; started learning watchmaking trade as a boy with his father in 1920; in 1925, went into the jewelry and watchmaking business for himself; in 1944, accepted an invitation from the Bulova Watch Co. to take a job as head instructor of a new watchmaking school. After several years as an instructor, he went on lecture tours for the Bulova Watch Co., giving instruction on various technical subjects in the watchmaking field, including adjustments.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Horace A. Bowman, employed by the National Bureau of Standards, Washington, D. C., in 1946, as a physicist in the time section in the capacity of assistant to the chief of the section, which was engaged in the testing of timing equipment; assistant chief of the mass and volume section for the past year and a half.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">It is observed that three of defendant\u2019s witnesses were associated with the Hamilton Watch Co. and two others were in the employ of Bulova Watch Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">It would be difficult to present in a case of this kind a more representative group of knowledgeable witnesses embracing manufacturers, importers, dealers, technicians, and executives, with lifelong experience in the vast watch industry both in the United States and in Switzerland.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">The testimonial record is voluminous, some 700 pages, and a detailed analysis of it would unduly expand the framework of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">Various exhibits were received in evidence on behalf of the parties hereto, but rather than a detailed listing of said exhibits, reference to them will be made in the course of the decision, if necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">Plaintiffs approach the case from the following three major premises:</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">1. The subject watch movements were properly marked \u201cunadjusted\u201d because they are, in fact, \u201cunadjusted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">2. Paragraph 367 leaves to the manufacturer the determination whether a watch movement should be marked \u201cunadjusted\u201d rather than with a particular number and class of adjustments.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-13\">3. The collector\u2019s decision is in direct conflict with 27 years of settled customs practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-14\">With the use of the certificates attached to the invoices to which the protests relate (said certificates being required by T.D. 54286, supra), plaintiff\u2019s witnesses were interrogated in detail concerning the commercial significance of the work that had been performed on the various movements.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-15\">The witnesses were positive in their statements that the manipulation of the movements shown by the certificates was nothing more than repairs or correctional processes to eliminate manufacturing defects and could not in any proper sense be regarded as amounting to adjustments to position.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-16\">As a matter of fact, plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses could find no substantial difference between the movements now in controversy and those conceded by defendant to be unadjusted, namely, the Graef movements and one of the Longines movements. Plaintiffs have established that the meaning of the term \u201cadjusted to position\u201d has the same significance in Switzerland as it has in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-17\">According to plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses the concept of \u201cadjustment to position\u201d connotes a skillfully manipulated movement to produce a watch of high quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-18\">Certain criteria recognized by the trade in determining \u201cposition adjustment\u201d are:</p>\n<p id=\"b269-19\">First, a period of testing requiring the timing of a movement for a minimum of 24 hours in each of the positions to which a movement is being adjusted.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Secondly, there are types of tolerances which must be satisfied. In other words, it is important that a movement should be made to perform with a high degree of accuracy in each position and be consistent from day to day, with the result that it performs within a tolerance of 10 or 15 seconds of perfect time in 24 hours. Obviously, it requires much greater skill to manipulate a watch movement, as above indicated, than to acquire a normal factory tolerance of 45 seconds. (Note T.D. 54286.)</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Thirdly, a trade consideration, upon which plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses were agreed, was that testing in five or six positions is desirable in position adjustment, although some stated that a movement might be considered adjusted if it were tested in three positions. The witnesses were positive, however, that the movements in controversy, which had been subjected to a two-position test only, could not be regarded as \u201cadjusted to position.\u201d Even some of defendant\u2019s witnesses agreed that adjustment to position may be accomplished by the skillful work expended on a movement, as above indicated. Nevertheless, they contended that a movement may be adjusted without such elaborate treatment. Not only does the process of adjustment to position require the exercise of great skill, it is also an expensive one. One witness testified that the cost of position adjustment by his company exceeds the cost of the movement itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Inasmuch as the record discloses that the articles in issue do not measure up to the foregoing criteria necessary for watch movements to be considered as adjusted to position, and since the manipulation of the movements indicated in the certificates attached to the invoices, in conformity with T.D. 54286, has been shown by the evidence to be the repairing of manufacturing defects to bring the movements up to the minimum required by the manufacturers\u2019 specifications, the record herein supports the position of plaintiffs that the instant watch movements are, in fact, unadjusted, as marked.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Although T.D. 54286 states that \u201cno change should be made\u201d in T.D. 50277 (3), supra, plaintiffs contend with force and with much show of reason that T.D. 54286 seeks to imprint a definition of the phrase \u201cposition adjustment\u201d inconsistent with the trade understanding of those words, as explained above.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">The evidence in this case is to the effect that watch movements of the kind under consideration, throughout the life of the Tariff Act of 1930 until the effective date of T.D. 54286, had been marked \u201cunadjusted\u201d and assessed with duty accordingly. It is to be noted that T.D. 50277, supra, had no material effect upon the classification of said watch movements.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">There is testimony from the chief executive of the Longines-Wittnauer Watch Co., Inc., that, during the period from 1930 to 1957, his firm imported some ten million movements which were classified and assessed with duty as \u201cunadjusted\u201d movements.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">The president of the Benrus Watch Company, Inc., testified that his company had imported between ten and fifteen million movements during that period, classified as unadjusted. Jean R. Graef testified that every movement imported' by him from Switzerland during that period was marked \u201cunadjusted,\u201d and duties were levied accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">It is significant that the issuance of T.D. 50277(3) resulted in no change in the manner of marking imported movements as \u201cunadjusted.\u201d And, although T.D. 54286 purported to be merely a clarification of T.D. 50277, nevertheless, it, in substance, placed a construction upon the meaning of the word \u201cunadjusted\u201d so at variance with its previously known interpretation and application by importers and classifying officers to definitely create a change in administrative practice in the classification and assessment of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">Further indication of a change of practice is suggested in the concluding paragraph of T.D. 54286, which reads\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-12\">\u201cIn order to provide sufficient time to comply with these require-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number><em>meats </em>this amendment shall <em>become </em>effective after 180 days after publication in the weekly Treasury Decisions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Since the issuance of T.D. 54286, the records of this court disclose that importations of watch movements have been marked \u201cadjusted\u201d to avoid nondelivery by the collector of customs, and scores of protests (other than the four here under consideration) have been filed seeking to recover the additional duty imposed by reason of the marking. In said protests, one of the reasons for objecting to the collector\u2019s action is set forth as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">\u201cThat the said movements were marked to indicate two (2) position adjustments solely because of the provisions of the said Treasury Decision (T.D. 54286), and that prior to the promulgation thereof imported watch movements, manufactured or produced in substantially the same manner as the instant movements, were marked \u2018unadjusted\u2019 and were uniformly so classified and assessed by you for duty purposes since the enactment of the said Tariff Act of 1930.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">For many years, it has been a settled rule of statutory construction that a long-continued customs practice applies with peculiar force to the interpretation of customs laws. United States v. W. N. Proctor &amp; Co., 1 Cir., 145 F. 126 (1906). In the course of its opinion in that case, the court observed\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-8\">\u201c* * * There is a long and well-known series of decisions by the Supreme Court, holding that a settled practice of the Treasury Department under the circumstances before us, where originally there might have been a doubt, affords a rule of statutory construction of the highest authority. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">United States v. Boyle Mfg. Co., Inc., 31 CCPA 1, C.A.D. 240, is authority for the position \u201cThat a finding may be based upon inferences drawn from established facts is well established.\u201d (Citing 32A C.J.S. Evidence \u00a7 1042.) In our opinion, the inference may clearly be drawn from the evidence here presented that a long-continued unbroken administrative practice was terminated by the promulgation of T.D. 54286.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">On the effect of long-established practice, our appellate court stated, in the case of United States v. Electrolux Corporation, 46 CCPA 143, C.A.D. 718\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-12\">\u201cIt is our opinion that in view of the long established practice of classifying the instant merchandise [finished electrical floor polishers], and goods closely akin to it, under the electrical articles paragraph 353, as shown by the foregoing history, such classification should not have been disturbed, and should not now be disturbed, in the absence of compelling reasons and therefore that the judgment below must be affirmed unless appellant makes a very clear showing of error. The period of consistent classification here is nearly as long as that involved in United States v. H. Bayersdorfer &amp; Co., 16 Ct.Cust.App. 43, T.D. 42717, wherein our predecessor court said, referring to a change made by department order after 17 years,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-13\">\u201cSuch a long-continued administrative classification of the merchandise should not be disturbed at this late day. Importers have a right to rely on long-continued administrative practice and if any change is to be made it should be made by Congress * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-14\">Note, also, United States v. D. H. Grant &amp; Co., Inc., 47 CCPA 20, CAD 723, cited by plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-15\">Applying the reasoning of the authorities above cited to the facts adduced herein, we agree with plaintiffs that the 27 years\u2019 practice of permitting entry as unadjusted watch movements, such as those here in issue, timed in two positions, with a tolerance of 45 seconds or less, and the manipulation of said movements constituting nothing more than repairs or correctional processes to elimin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>ate manufacturing defects, .\u201cshould not now be disturbed, in the absence of compelling reasons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\">Careful research fails to reveal any litigation in this court testing the application of the words \u201cadjusted\u201d and \u201cunadjusted\u201d during or prior to the Tariff Act of 1930, other than the present proceedings \u2014 with the exception of United States v. Gruen Watch Co., 23 CCPA 183, T.D. 48029 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">The Gruen case differed factually from the present one. The watch movements in that case, in their original condition as imported, had been adjusted to position and were so marked. Subsequently, however, the movements had been returned to Switzerland for repair and while being repaired the adjustments were destroyed. It appears that whereas the movements were not readjusted, the original markings remained on the plates. The importer contended that so long as the movements were no longer adjusted, duty should not be assessed according to the marking. The court of appeals rejected this argument stating\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">\u201cWe see no escape from the position that if the involved watch movements had been imported, as distinguished from returned, and had been subject to the duties imposed by said paragraph 367(a), the collector would have been compelled to add a duty of $1 for each adjustment according to the marking, and it would have been wholly immaterial whether the movements had been in fact adjusted. The statute required him to assess duty against the watch movements, if imported, \u2018in accordance with the marking.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Plaintiffs contend that the quoted language supports their contention that paragraph 367 leaves to the manufacturer the determination whether a watch movement should be marked \u201cunadjusted\u201d rather than with a particular number and class of adjustments.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">We do not attach the same depth of meaning and significance to the Gruen case as do the plaintiffs. The factual differences between that case and the instant one do not, in our opinion, give to the Gruen case the compelling effect assigned to it by plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">We have carefully scrutinized the record before us and all relevant surrounding circumstances, and we find the weight of competent evidence tips the scales in favor of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the contested movements were properly marked \u201cunadjusted\u201d within the contemplation of paragraph 367(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">The protests are sustained, and judgment will issue directing the collector of customs to permit delivery of the subject movements and liquidate the entries in accordance with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b266-20\"> Additional duty of $1 was reduced to 50 cents by the Swiss Trade Agreement, 69 Treas.
