C. 258A commenced in the Third District Court of Eastern Middlesex wherein the petitioner seeks to recover- compensation as a victim of a violent crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-14\">The Attorney General filed his. report neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>admitting nor denying the claim pending investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">The trial judge found for the petitioner in the amount of $7,900.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\u00a7 2 of Chapter 258A gives jurisdiction of such petitions to the District Courts and the right of review by the Appellate Division is granted by G.L. C.231, \u00a7108 as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\"><em>At the </em>trial' <em>there was] evidence tending to show that </em>on September 25,- 1971 while employed as a construction worker at $162.00 per week, the petitioner\" was a victim of an assault and battery, reported to the police within 48 hours; that the petitioner was treated at: a hospital for a broken nose, facial knife wounds, a compound fracture of' the left elbow, and neck and spine bruises; As a result \u00f3f the injuries sustained the petitioner was disabled for 115 weeks, amounting.-to lost wages of $18,-630.00. The evidence further indicates that all medical bills were paid by an insurance program. and- that the petitioner received- $10,-630.00 from Workmen\u2019s Compensation Insurance,. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">At the close of the evidence and before final argument, the respondent filed five requests for rulings, only the fourth and fifth requests are material, to wit:</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">\u201c4. Chapter 258A of the General' Laws provides for compensation to victims of violent crimes not to exceed $10,- ; 000*00 which -is to ,.be reduced by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>amount of any payment received as a result of the injury under insurance programs or from public funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">5. The evidence requires a finding for the respondent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The trial judge denied both requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s argument is that $10,-000.00 is the maximum recoverable under G.L. C.258A and any payments received under insurance programs shall be deducted from that $10,000.00 figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Here, the claimant received from insurance programs $10,630.00 and payment of all his medical bills. Therefore, the Commonwealth argues the petitioner having received an amount from insurance exceeding $10,000.00, is not entitled to an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">In <em>Gurley et al </em>v. Commonwealth,-Mass. -<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Supreme Judicial Court decided that \u201cthe \u2018actual loss sustained\u2019 is determined by deducting the benefits received as a result of the injury from the total loss sustained by the petitioner.\u201d \u201e .</p>\n<p id=\"b42-11\">Therefore, in the instant case, the total loss sustained being greater than the benefits received by $8,000.00, the trial judge was correct in awarding the claimant the $8,000.00 less the statutory deduction of $100.00,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or an award of $7,900.00.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"b43-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>George K.
