After some work had been done and the trees had not been cleared away, the plaintiff asked the defendant if he could hire some men to clear away the trees and brush that had been chopped down, so that he could get through and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>work further into the woodland; that the defendant assented thereto, the plaintiff hired three men to clear away the trees and brush chopped down by the plaintiff hiinself; that he had paid the three men the sum of $805.20; that the plaintiff had paid out the sum of $65.62 for repairs made from time to time to the chain saw as it broke down; that he had bought gasoline for the sum of $35.00 for the operation of the chain saw; that he -paid $30.00 for gasoline used in burning brush; that he had used 9 bags of calcium valued at $28.35 in the work. The last item was agreed to by the defendant; \u25a0 that the defendant had paid the sum of $500.00 but had refused to pay any more; that the plaintiff had \u2022 cleared an area of about 30,000 square feet of brush land in pursuance of the work. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">The defendant testified that he and the plaintiff agreed on a $500.00 figure for which the plaintiff was to clear a strip 30 feet wide and 500 feet long, including a dog leg and that the plaintiff was to maintain the saw.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">The court found the following facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">\u201cI find that the plaintiff and defendant orally agreed that the defendant would pay the plaintiff the sum of $500.00 for cutting trees and did so, and in addition to pay the sum of $28.35 for calcium.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">The plaintiff duly filed a number of requests for rulings, only two of which I fe\u00e9l are pertinent to this opinion, namely Rulings 9 and 10.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b29-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>A.
