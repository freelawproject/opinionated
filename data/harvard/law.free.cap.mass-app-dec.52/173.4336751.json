The declaration is in a single count where plaintiff alleges while lawfully on defendant\u2019s premises on June 2, 1969' he was caused to fall due to a defective condition of some stairs and suffered personal injury. In specification plaintiff alleges the defective condition was a foreign substance. Defendant\u2019s answer contained the defenses of general denial, contributory negligence, assumption of the risk, Statute of Limitations and that the negligence, if any, was caused by a person for whose conduct the defendant was not responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">At the trial there was evidence tending to show that: Plaintiff was a meat inspector. The inspection office was on the second floor of a building in the new market at 115-116 New-market Square, Boston. In the same building the defendant- ran its meat-cutting business along with other companies. Defendant\u2019s business was on two floors with a stairway running between the first and second floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The meat-cutting room is on the first floor; on the second floor is an office for transaction of business and a toilet and employees\u2019 locker room. Access to defendant\u2019s cutting room could be gained from outside the building or passing through from the next door, Waltham Beef, or from a 2nd floor corridor. Plaintiff is one of the meat .inspectors that have access <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>to defendant\u2019s premises for inspection and grading of meat.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">On the day in question at about 8:30 a.m., the plaintiff approached defendant\u2019s premises from the 2nd floor corridor. He went through the locker room inspecting it for sanitation and started down the stairs controlled by the defendant. He went down 6 stairs when his right foot slipped, he grabbed the handrail, and turned his right ankle. He had not seen anything on the stairs prior to his slip. After his slip he saw a piece of fat on the edge of the stair where his right foot had slipped about 2 inches in diameter. It was grayish in color. He went next door to Waltham Beef and then reported the incident to an employee of defendant and to his own supervisor. As a result of the slip, plaintiff lost time from work and had x-rays and medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">At the close of the evidence and before final argument, the defendant made the following three requests for rulings:</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">\u201c1. The evidence does not warrant a finding for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">\u201c2. The evidence warrants a finding for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">\u201c3. The evidence does not warrant a finding that the defendant, his agents, servants or employees were negligent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">The court denied defendant\u2019s requests for rul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>ings numbered <em>#1 </em>and #3 and found for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The defendant claiming to be aggrieved by the court\u2019s denial of its Bequests for Bulings of Law numbered #1 and <em>#3 </em>duly claimed a report to the Appellate Division for review and determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">A careful examination of the evidence reported leads us to conclude that this matter is controlled by the decision in the recent Supreme Judicial Court case of <em>Oliveri </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, </em>1973 Adv. Sh. 319 (see cases cited therein), which was decided subsequent to the decision of the trial justice in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">:In the case at bar, there is no evidence which would warrant a finding or inference that the defendant, its agent or employee was responsible for the presence of the foreign substance ,on the steps in question. Nor was there any evidence which would warrant a finding that the defendant\u2019s agents, or employees knew or were in a position to know about the presence of the foreign, substance. Nor was there any evidence warranting a finding or inference that from the appearance and description of the foreign substance, a sufficient period of time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>had elapsed so that the defendant, its agents and/or employees should have known of its presence.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b183-7\">Michael A.
