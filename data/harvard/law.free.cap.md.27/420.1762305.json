Ch. Dec., </em>283. By virtue of the Act of 1853, ch. 245, all property acquired by the Avife by devise, &amp;c., is protected frotn the debts of the husband, and she is invested Avith the powers of a <em>feme sole, </em>as to property so devised ; no trustee is required to protect it. <em>Unger and Wife vs. Price, </em>9 <em>Md. Rep., </em>552.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-5\">Sarah Leister the Avife, acquired this property under these laws. In the sale of the lands she was entitled under the equities secured by these laws to have the <em>status </em>of the <em>proceeds </em>fixed; so that being to her sole and separate use, her right Avould be recognized wherever the English law prevailed, and specially recognized in this State Avhere property within its limits is in controversy. Besides, by equity jurisprudence the Avife\u2019s equity is always protected and settlement made. Where the aid of Courts of equity is required by the husband to get his wife\u2019s property, he must make suitable provision for her. The wdfe\u2019s equity, as it is called, attaches to her personal property; it attaches whenever the property is within the jurisdiction of the Court, into Avhosesoever hands it may have come, or in whatever manner it may have been transferred. 1 <em>Greenleaf, </em>11<em>th Edition, </em>486, 487 ; 10 <em>Marsh., &amp;c., Bode vs. Regman, </em>217 ; 8 <em>Ad. &amp; El., S.

The first prayer of the appellee submits the proposition that the decree was not binding on him, and it was granted. We maintain that the decree constituted a perfect right in the wife, as against any creditor or assignee. The claim by either to this property is through the husband and in no other way, and as against them or either of them the wife could be protected. It is a decree in rare, affecting the condition of the property and its future relations, and fixing its status, and everywhere binding. Decrees and proceedings in Chancery are equally admissible as a record at law, to show rare <em>ipsam </em>though between strangers. <em>Key vs. Dent, Adm. of Wood, </em>14 <em>Md.

The principle is well established as to a foreign judgment or decree in <em>rem. </em>If the matter in controversy he land, or other immovable property or movable property the judgment pronounced <em>in the forum rei sitce </em>is held to he of universal obligation, as to\u00b0all the matters of right and title, decided by it. Whatever the Court settles as to the right or title, or whatever disposition it makes of the property by sale, revendication, transfer, or other act will he held valid in any other country, where the same question comes directly or indirectly in judgment before any other foreign tribunal. <em>Story on Conflict of Laws, secs. </em>532, 545, 551, 591, 592, 597 ; 1 <em>Greenleaf\u2019s Evidence, secs. </em>541, 542, 543.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-6\">If this he so, is it not conclusive upon this case ? Besides, is not this in the nature of a contract, and does it not carry with it into every foreign jurisdiction the iaw of the contract ? This property was sold with the assent of the wife, and with the express understanding that it was to he to her sole use, free from the power of the creditors-of her husband. The decree was made in conformity to the evidence. Her right was perfect under the laws.of England, to the free and undisturbed enjoyment of her real estate. In compelling her to sell she was not to be damnified and deprived of her property, for, in fact, if the law he as urged by the appellee, it is nothing less than a confiscation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>of it. It is maintained that the arrangement made in respect to and embodied in the form of law, and in the verity and solemnity of a decree or judgment of a Court of competent jurisdiction, clothes and carries with it the world over, all the force and obligation of the <em>lex loci contractus, </em>and it must have the same validity, interpretation and obligatory force in every other country which it has in the country where it was made. 2 <em>Kent, </em>458.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-5\">If this be so, how can the appellee, especially in our Courts and in the State where he lives, and where the property is situate, undertake to appropriate it to his use, as a creditor of Nicholas Leister. Property to the sole and separate use of the wife is recognized wherever the English-law prevails, to be free and disencumbered from any right of the husband or of his creditors, and in whatever condition it may be found. The attaching creditor here is the moving party, he must show credits in the hand of the garnishee, belonging to Nicholas Leister, and no other person. He is restricted to this ; if funds should be found in his hands, in any other capacity or for any other use than that of his own absolute right and property, they are not liable to be appropriated by his creditors. The wife is not the moving party ; she is not a party to the record, it is not proper that she should be, her legal standing in the Court as a party pressing her rights, is not in issue and cannot therefore involve any question as to her legal operative rights, but the action is against her husband and for his debt, and to <em>subject his property </em>to the <em>payment </em>of it; they must show it to be <em>his. property </em>which they seek to apply. And when doing this they cannot <em>tahe hers </em>secured to her by the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-6\">Are the laws of our own State to be utterly disregarded, when both the attaching creditor and the property is within the State, and subject to the laws of the State ? The law of our own State must govern. A citizen cannot disregard it and depend upon the law of any other State. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>The property is here ; it is to be attached by a creditor in defiance of our law. It cannot be \u2014 our law must prevail. <em>Gardner vs. Lewis, </em>7 <em>Gill, </em>895 ; <em>Davis vs. Jacquin, </em>5 <em>H. &amp; J., 108 ; Houston vs. Nowland, </em>7 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>480 ; <em>Dakin vs. Pomeroy &amp; Crafts, </em>9 <em>Gill, </em>1 <em>; Casilly and Wife et al., vs. Meyer et al., </em>4 <em>Md.

Rep., </em>75 ; <em>Trasher vs. Everhart, </em>3 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>242.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-5\">The Act of 1853 is explicit; it says, the property real and personal, belonging to a woman at the time of her marriage, &amp;c., shall be protected from the debts of the husband, and not in <em>any way liable </em>for the payment <em>thereof. </em>Is this law to be observed in Maryland? The property is here. The law does not say where the woman may reside. It is the property within our jurisdiction that is exempt. It is not a question of the residence of a married woman; a wife is obliged to go with her husband ; the husband\u2019s residence is her residence. And thus owning property in Maryland, and under the law protected, she is obliged to reside with her husband ; she leaves possibly her property behind with a view to its protection, and yet by the position assumed by the appellee, the moment she leaves, the protection to her property is gone. This cannot be \u2014 the property is here. The process of our Court must be used to get it as in this case \u2014 and by the forms of our laws they must abide. They ask for the law to get it, and the law says it cannot be got, for by the law there is no right or power to get it. The law says <em>it is not liable </em>and no legal process can reach it. So that in all aspects of this cause, we conceive there is error in the judgment below. <em>Flowers vs. Foreman, </em>23 <em>How., </em>133 ; <em>Newell vs. Hayden, </em>8 <em>Clarke, (Iowa,) </em>143 <em>; Runyon vs. Groshon, </em>1 <em>Beasley, (N.

That the property in question having been acquired since the parties have been domiciled in the State of Illinois, the laws of that State govern as to all the rights and liabilities appertaining thereto, notwithstanding the property may be found here ; and the law of this State can only be appealed to in order to determine whether such property be movable or immovable. <em>Newcomer vs. </em>Orem, 2 <em>Md.

All the prayers of the appellant however, except the sixth, \u00e1re vicious, because they submit questions of law, exclusively for- the determination of the Court, to the jury; and it - is well settled that a judgment will not be <em>reversed </em>on account of the refusal by the Court below to grant a prayer which submits a question of law to the jury. <em>Cecil Bank vs. Barry, Garnishee of Herr, </em>20 <em>Md. Rep., </em>297.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-5\">And the Act of 1862, ch. 154, does not change this rule; for while, under that act, the Court would not <em>reverse </em>a judgment, because of the <em>granting </em>of a prayer submitting a question of law to the jury, it does not follow, (indeed the reason of the thing forbids it,) that the Court would reverse - because of the <em>refusal to grant an erroneous prayer, </em>the effect of which is to transfer the functions of the judge to the jury ; the object of the act being to prevent reversals upon grounds not taken in the Court below. And in order to raise a question of the appellee\u2019s right to recover on the sixth prayer of the appellant, the truth of all the evidence given on the part of the appellee, and all that on the part of the appellant that is in favor of the -appellee, as also all facts reasonably deducible therefrom, are to be taken as conceded, as this prayer is in the nature of a demurrer to the whole evidence. <em>McElderry vs. Flannagan, </em>1 <em>Har. &amp; Gill, </em>308, 320 ; <em>Franklin &amp; Armfield vs. Long, </em>7 <em>Gill &amp; John., </em>407.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b446-6\">Crain, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ATk\">delivered the opinion of this Court. .</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">The attachment in this case was issued by the appellee to affect the proceeds of sale of the real estate of the wife, to pay the debt of the husband. The facts as presented in the record are, that Nicholas Leister and wife were citizens of this State until August, 1854, when they removed to Illinois, where they resided' when this attachment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>issued. Before removing from the State Leister became indebted to the appellee, who has always resided in \"Washington county, Maryland. The fund in controversy was derived from the sale of -the real estate of Mary Gehr, the mother of Sarah Leister, the wife of Nicholas.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Mary Gehr died in 1855, leaving real estate in Washington county, and by her last will and testament devised a child\u2019s share of said estate to Sarah, the wife of Nicholas. In January, 1856, a bill was filed in the Circuit Court for Washington County against Leister and wife and the other devisees, for the sale of thereal estate for partition. The bill was answered by Leister and wife. In their answer Sarah, the wife of Nicholas, claimed her portion of the estate as her sole and separate estate, free from the debts of her husband, and insisted that the same should not be divested from her by a sale thereof. Nicholas, the husband, disclaimed all right, title or interest at law or in equity to any portion of the estate of Mary Gehr, by virtue of his marriage with the said Sarah or otherwise. A decree was passed in the cause on th'e 12th of August, 1856, for the sale of the property, and in the decree it was provided that the proportion of the proceeds of the sale of the property, allotted to Sarah, should be deemed her separate estate, for her sole and separate use and benefit, free from any claim or control of her husband or his creditors. After the sale of the property the amount of the proceeds due Sarah was credited to her sole and separate use, and paid over to the appellant as her attorney, when it was attached by the appellee to pay the debt of her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">At the trial of the cause two bills of exception were taken by the appellant; the first to the admissibility of evidence, and the second upon the granting of the plaintiff\u2019s and the rejection of the defendant\u2019s prayers. To arrive at a proper solution of the questions to be determined by this appeal, we must ascertain the rights of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Sarah, the wife, under the will of her mother and the proceedings and decree of the Court, and whether the proceeds of the estate audited to her and received by Mr. Smith, as her attorney, were liable to be attached in our Courts for the payment of the husband\u2019s debt. In 1841, the legislature recognizing the just and equitable right of the wife to the enjoyment of her real estate, passed a law to protect the real estate of the wife from the debts of the husband. This legislation in favor of the wife against the creditors of the husband so favorably impressed itself upon the public mind, that by the 38th Section of the 3d Article of the Constitution of 1851, the legislature was required to pass laws necessary to protect the property of the wife from the debts of the husband during her life, and for securing the same to. her issue after her death. The legislature acknowledging the wisdom of this provision in obedience to the mandate of the Constitution, enacted the law of 1853, Chapter 245. That act provides that <em>all </em>the property of the wife acquired or received, after her marriage, by purchase, gift, grant, devise, bequest, or in a .course of distribution, shall be protected from the debts of the husband, and not in any way be liable for the payment thereof. And to effect the objects of the law, the wife was given the benefit of all such remedies for her relief and security as then existed, or should be devised in the Courts of law or equity, without the necessity of the interposition of a trustee. The object contemplated by this law is too clear for doubt; by its enactment the legislature intended to give full protection and security to the property of the wife against the creditors of the husband, as previous to its enactment the cases of <em>Peacock vs. Pembroke and Clarke, </em>4 <em>Md. Rep., </em>280, <em>and Turton\u2019s Ex\u2019rs vs. Turton, </em>6 <em>Md. Rep., </em>375, had been decided by this Court, and in each case the property was adjudged <em>to </em>be the husband\u2019s and subject to the payment of his debts. This act, soon after its passage, received a judicial inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>pretation in the case of <em>Unger &amp; Wife vs. </em>Price, 9 <em>Md. Rep., </em>552. In that case, Mrs. Unger had sold her potential right of dower, and invested the money in personal property, and it was held by this Court to be exempted from the debts of the husband. The case of Mrs. Leister is equally strong, and comes within the principle settled in <em>Unger and Wife vs. Price. </em>She was the devisee of real estate, and with the consent of her husband the proceeds of sale of the property under the decree of a Court of Equity were held to her sole and separate use, so audited to her and paid over to the appellant. But the appellee insists, that the proceedings and decree were not admissible evidence against him, because they were <em>res inter alios acta. </em>We admit, as a general rule, that judgments and decrees are evidence binding only between parties and privies. But there are many exceptions to this rule, and we are of opinion that this case forms one of the exceptions and comes within the principle settled by this Court in the case of <em>Key vs. </em>Dent, 14 <em>Md. Rep., </em>98. The record was introduced in this case to show how the fund was derived, and that the conversion from realty into personalty was not to prejudice the rights of the wife. Eor that purpose, according to the decision in <em>Key vs. Dent </em>and the authorities relied on by Justice Eccleston, who delivered the opinion of the Court, the record was evidence. <em>Head\u2019s Rep\u2019s. vs. McDonald, </em>7 <em>Monroe, </em>207 ; 4 <em>Phillips on Evidence, </em>920, 921, 977, <em>(Ed. of </em>1843.) The record was confirmatory of the answers of the garnishee and proof that the decree was had as there set forth. It was a decree of a Court of competent jurisdiction, which in the exercise of its powers as a Court of Chancery settled the property to the sole and separate use of Mrs. Leister. And although we find this right of the wife to her property, protected in this State hy public policy, by statute and by a decree of a Court of Equity, yet it was earnestly contended by the learned counsel for the appellee, that a creditor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>husband had a right to attach this fund in our Courts of justice for the debt of the husband, as by the laws of Illinois, where the husband and wife resided, the husband was entitled to all the personal property of the wife, and that by virtue of this law of the domicil the fund was vested in' the husband. And he claimed this right to divest the wife of her property by the law of the domicil, on the ground of comity. In this case we cannot sanction such a right, for it has been decided that comity is overruled by positive law, and that it is only in the silence of any particular rule, affirming, denying or restraining the operation of foreign laws, that. Courts of justice presume a tacit adoption of them by their own government. <em>Gardner vs. Lewis, </em>7 <em>Gill, </em>395. It is certainly competent for any State to adopt laws to protect its own property as well as to regulate it, and <em>\u201c </em>no State will suffer the laws of another to interfere with her own, and in the conflict of laws, when it must often be a matter of doubt, which shall prevail, the Court which decides, will prefer the laws of its own country to that of the stranger.\u201d <em>Story\u2019s Conflict of Laws, section </em>28. The Courts of our State have perfect jurisdiction over all personal property as well as real within its limits, belonging to the wife, and they have a right to protect both from the debts of the husband. If therefore our legislative enactment in regard to the property of the wife and the laws of Illinois conflict, it cannot be made a question in our own Courts which shall prevail. <em>\u201c </em>Where there is no constitutional barrier, we are bound to observe and enforce the statutory provisions of our own State.\u201d <em>Davis vs. Jacquin, </em>5 <em>Harris &amp; Johnson, </em>109 ; <em>Gardner vs. Lewis, </em>7 <em>Gill, </em>395.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">As this fund by our laws is held by the appellant for the sole and separate use of Mrs. Leister, a creditor of the husband seeking a remedy against him in our Courts must be governed and regulated by our laws ; for Justice Story says \u201c a person suing in this country must take the law as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>lie finds it, and wherever a remedy is sought, it must be administered according to the <em>lex fori; </em>and such a judgment is to be given, as the law of the State where the suit is brought, authorizes.\u201d <em>Story\u2019s Conflict of </em>Laws, secs. 571, 572. And in this Court in the case of <em>Wilson &amp; Co. vs. Carson &amp; Co., </em>12 <em>Md. Rep., </em>75, Le Grand, Chief Justice, says, <em>\u201c </em>The recognition of the laws of another State, in the administration of justice in this, is not a right <em>stricti juris ; </em>it depends entirely on comity, and in extending it, Courts are always careful to see that the statutes of their own State are not infringed to the injury of their own citizens.\u201d</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b451-9\">(Decided 15th July, 1867.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">We think these authorities decisive of the question, and that the. appellant has a right to rely in a Court of law upon the title of Mrs. Leister to the fund in controversy. Her right had not been divested by her own act or by operation of law, and the fund in his hands was not liable to be attached by the creditor of the husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The views which we have .expressed of the legal propositions governing this case are conclusive upon the right of the plaintiff to recover, and it is unnecessary to examine the first bill of exceptions, to ascertain whether the evi-. dence offered by the defendant of the laws of Illinois touching the rights of husband and wife were admissible or not. It follows from what we have said, that the instructions given by the Court at the instance of the plaintiff and contained in the second bill of exceptions were erroneous. The prayers asked by the defendant\u2019s counsel embrace in our opinion the true theory of the law of the case and ought to have been granted. For th,ese reasons we reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed without procedendo.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
