It is admitted that John has a legal title by the patent for all of \u201c Ryefield \u201d that lies outside of the lines of \u201c Trouble.\u201d But the State has no title to \u201cTrouble,\u201d and could grant none to John Ruby. The State cannot grant what has previously passed from it. It cannot give a title which it has not. <em>Tolson\u2019s Lessee vs. Lanham, </em>2 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>174; <em>Hoye vs. Swan\u2019s Lessee, </em>5 <em>Md.

A grant must be of something in <em>esse </em>at the time. <em>Hall vs. Gittings\u2019 Lessee, </em>2 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>112 ; <em>Casey\u2019s Lessee vs. Inloes et al., </em>1 <em>Gill, </em>430.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-6\">The assignee of a lease by the proprietary had a resurvey of a tract, including the <em>leased land, </em>and assigned his <em>plat and certificate to N, </em>who assigned to <em>0, </em>who obtained a patent for it. <em>This did not destroy the leasehold interest. Bradford vs. McComas, </em>3 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>444.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-7\">There is nothing in this case to destroy Thomas Ruby\u2019s legal title to \u201cTrouble.\u201d. How can the destruction of his legal title be worked out? He did not surrender it to the State. The assignment of the certificate does not profess to transfer anything to the <em>State. </em>Besides, a surrender can only be made of a less estate to one who had a greater. The State had no interest at all in \u201c Trouble.\u201d It could not be the surrenderee. See 2 <em>Co. Lit., </em>551, <em>margin ; </em>2 <em>Lomax Digest, </em>103, <em>&amp;c.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-8\">Neither did the assignment of the certificate convey the <em>legal title </em>to John Ruby, the assignee. The Acts of Assembly provide the mode of conveying the legal title to lands. Such a paper as this assignment cannot accomplish it. See <em>Acts </em>1715, <em>ch. </em>44, <em>sec. </em>8 ; 1766, <em>ch. </em>14, <em>sec. </em>2 ; the substance of which is in the Code of Public General Laws, Article 24, section 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-10\">Eminent Domain has nothing to with this case, that is a right to take private property for public use on compensation to the owner, and is exercised only by the Legislature. This is not a case of that sort. <em>The Tidewater Canal Co. vs. Archer, </em>9 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>483 ; 2 <em>American Railroad Cases, </em>503, 145, 86.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-11\">Admit that the Legislature could pass an Act to destroy Thomas Ruby\u2019s fee in \u201cTrouble,\u201d and give it to John <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Ruby, <em>on </em>request, can <em>the Land Office do it? </em>Clearly not. It is concluded then that Thomas Ruby never .has been divested of the legal title to \u201c Trouble.\u201d The assignment did not surrender it to the State, nor transfer it to John Ruby. The patent to John Ruby could only grant what the State had to give ; <em>Cujus est, ejus est dare. </em>Then John Ruby has not the legal title to \u201cTrouble,\u201d and the defendant should have a verdict for that part of \u201c Ryefield \u201d which \u201c Trouble\u201d covers, and the prayer of the plaintiff is not law, and should not have been granted.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b165-5\"><em>J. II. Gordon </em>and <em>Thomas Perry, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-6\">The Court below granted the plaintiff\u2019s prayer, to which the defendant excepted, and the correctness of that ruling is now the only question to be decided by this Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-7\">The plaintiff had his patent for the whole tract issued to him on the 20th March, 1851, under the assignment dated 3d March, 1851. This certainly conveyed a good title as against Thomas Ruby. The patent to John Ruby was issued by order of the Chancellor, who was Judge of the Land Office, and who had full power to decree. 1 <em>Dorsey\u2019s Laws, </em>254 ; <em>Act of </em>1789, <em>ch. </em>35, <em>sec. </em>4 <em>; Landholder\u2019s Ast., </em>307, 493, 494, 495, 310, 311, <em>sec. </em>6 ; <em>Cook\u2019s Lessee vs. Carroll, </em>6 <em>Md. Rep., </em>104 ; <em>Cunningham vs. Browning, </em>1 <em>Bland., </em>304, 315.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-8\">The composition being paid, the State held the legal title in trust for the party entitled in equity, which was John Ruby, under the assignment. The certificate and assignment being returned to the Land Office by John Ruby, he stood before the Chancellor as the party having the equitable title, praying a conveyance by the State as trustee of the legal title, with the consent of the assignor, and the patent granted by order of the Chancellor is good. The assignment, and patent issued on it, operate as an estoppel of Thomas Ruby. 2 <em>Greenleaf\u2019s Cruise, </em>611, <em>top paging; Sayles vs. Smith, </em>12 <em>Wend., </em>57 ; <em>McClellan </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number><em>and Wife vs. Kennedy et al., </em>8 <em>Md.

The assignment by Thomas Ruby operates as a surrender to the State, which enabled it to grant the title to the whole to JohnRuby. <em>Landholder\u2019s Ast., </em>81, 86, 87, 88, 89 <em>and </em>152 ; 2 <em>Greenleaf\u2019s Cruise, </em>412, 413, 414 ; <em>Commonwealth vs. Dudley, </em>10 <em>Mass., </em>404 ; <em>Holbrook vs. Tirrell, </em>9 <em>Pick., </em>105 ; <em>Maxwell\u2019s Lessee vs. Lloyd, </em>1 <em>H. &amp; McH., </em>212 ; <em>Hammond vs. Norris, </em>2 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>133.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b166-9\">Crain, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AK\">delivered the opinion of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">The record in this case presents for our consideration the correctness of a single instruction given by the Circuit Court at the instance of the plaintiff, the present appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">Thomas Ruby being seized in fee of a tract of land called \u201c Trouble,\u201d lying and being in Allegany County, containing ninety-six acres, on the 20th of April, 1846, procured from the Land Office a special warrant to resurvey it, with leave to add anj vacant land thereto contiguous, and to reduce the whole into one entire tract. In virtue of this warrant, Benjamin Brown, the surveyor of Allegany County, on the third day of June, 1846, \u2022returned his certificate to the Land Office, certifying that he had carefully surveyed for Thomas Ruby, the tract of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>land called \u201cTrouble,\u201d and found it to contain 96\u00a7 acres, to which he had added one piece of contiguous vacancy containing 37| acres, and reduced the whole into one tract containing 133-J acres, to be held by the name of \u201c Rye-field.\u201d After this certificate was made, Thomas Ruby, under his hand and seal, on the 3d day of March, 1851, transferred, assigned and made over to John Ruby, the appellee, all his right, title, interest and estate in and to the land mentioned in said certificate, and desired a patent to be issued for the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">This assignment operated to give John Ruby an equitable estate in all the real estate included in the certificate. This assig\u2019nment on the certificate being returned to the Land Office by John Ruby, he stood before the Chancellor as the party having the equitable title, praying a conveyance by the State, as trustee of the legal title, with the consent of the assignor. As a patent was granted to him, we must assume that it was done in accordance with well established rules and regulations of the Land Office, of which Courts of justice will take notice; for, considering it as a Court of record, Chancellor Bland says, \u201cit has, like all Courts of common law or equity of that description, the power to regulate its own practice and proceeding, which regulations become the law of the Court, and of the case also so far as they apply.\u201d 1 Bland, 315 ; <em>2 H. &amp; </em>J., 151 ; <em>Landholder\u2019s Assistant, </em>434, <em>442, </em>461. Having issued from a Court of competent jurisdiction, it is conclusive of all the facts stated in it, and cannot be reviewed collaterally. As soon as the patent issued, John Ruby, the grantee, was invested with a fee simple estate in all the estate mentioned in it. 1 <em>H. &amp; McH., </em>93. Having thus obtained a fee simple in all the estate included in the certificate on which the patent issued, called \u201cRyefield,\u201d he obtained by the patent the original tract called \u201c Trouble,\u201d the assignment of Thomas Ruby having operated as a surrender to the State of all his title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>to \u201cTrouble,\u201d which, enabled the State to grant a fee simple title in the whole to John Ruby by the name of \u201c Ryefield.\u201d <em>Landholder\u2019s Assistant, </em>81, 86, 87, 88, 89 ; 152, 2 <em>Greenleaf\u2019s Cruise, </em>411, 413, 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">There is no pretence that any fraud was practised by John Ruby in obtaining the assignment of the certificate or procuring the patent to be issued to him. Had any fraud been practised, a Court of Equity would have been the appropriate forum where full and adequate relief could have been had. <em>Cook\u2019s Lessee vs. Carroll, </em>6 <em>Md. Rep., </em>105, and the authorities there referred to. The law thus enunciated we desire to be understood as applying to Thomas Ruby and those claiming under him, subsequent to the assignment and the grant of the patent, being of opinion that the assignment and other proceedings in the Land Office constituted notice to all parties who became subsequently interested.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">We are also of opinion, that by these proceedings Thomas Ruby was estopped from denying the right of John Ruby to the land called \u201cTrouble,\u201d as effectively as if he had executed a deed for it. The assignment operated as an estoppel in <em>pais, </em>and as much importance and efficacy should be attached to it, as if it were a matter of record. He cannot be permitted to deny it, as the doctrine of estoppel in <em>pais </em>stands upon the broad ground of public policy and good faith, and is interposed to prevent injustice, and guard against fraud. Having acknowledged that the real estate was transferred for a valuable consideration, a Court of justice will not permit him to repudiate his admissions and attempt to defeat the title of the party who acted upon the faith of them, for in conscience and honest dealing he ought not to be permitted to do so. See <em>Alexander vs. Walter et al., Lessee, </em>8 <em>Gill, </em>247 ; <em>McClellan and Wife vs. Kennedy and others, </em>8 <em>Md. Rep., </em>230; <em>McClellan vs. Kennedy, </em>3 <em>Md. Chan. Dec., </em>234 ; <em>Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, </em>642-\u20193. It is admitted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>estoppels only bind parties and privies and not strangers, and in this case we only design to apply the principle to Tilomas Ruby and those claiming under him.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b169-7\">(Decided 31st May, 1867.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The appellant, by his defence, claims to defeat the appellee by relying on a lease from Thomas Ruby to him for \u201cTrouble,\u201d dated 30th of March, 1861, and a deed from Thomas Ruby to James Ruby for \u201c Trouble,\u201d dated 13th of June, 1861. Both of which were executed ten years after the patent for \u201cRyefield\u201d was issued to the appellee, and in our opinion cannot he invoked for any such purpose. The appellant and James Ruby are as much estopped to deny the title of the appellee to \u201c Rye-field,\u201d as Thomas Ruby, under whom they claim. The patent had been issued for more than ten years before the lease and deed were executed, on which the appellant relies, and was notice to him and the whole world that the title was in the appellee. We therefore concur with the Judge of the Circuit Court in his instruction to the jury, and affirm the judgment with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
