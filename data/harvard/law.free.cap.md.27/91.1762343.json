Maulshy, </em>for the appellant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-7\">1st. The object of the suit on the part of the appellees was to recover bach the sum of $420, paid by them to the appellant on account of his interest in a crop of wheat growing on land of which he was tenant, and sold by him to them on the 31st May, 1864, for $840. The ground on which this recovery is sought, is a failure of consideration, for which the $420 was paid; the said wheat having been afterwards sold by the sheriff, under a distress for rent, claimed to be due and owing from the appellant to Ool. Kunkel. In order to make out a failure of consideration entitling them to recover back the $420 paid in cash, it was requisite to show that the claim for rent under which the distress was levied, was equal to the whole $840, or at least exceeded the amount of the note given for the balance. If it were less than the amount of the note, then, by the express terms of their contract, it was to be deducted from the amount of <em>that note. </em>But they have not shown any thing of the kind. They have merely shown that a distress warrant.was levied on the wheat for rent in arrear to Kunkel, and that the wheat was sold thereunder on the 11th of July, 1864. They have not shown what amount of rent was in arrear, nor for what price the wheat was sold. Under their coutract it was their duty to have paid the rent in arrear if less than the. amount of the.note, and then have deducted the same from the note. To make out a case of total <em>failure of consideration, </em>so as to-enable them to recover back the whole $420 cash payment, they should have proved that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>the rent in arrear was $840, or that the <em>wheat sold for that sum. Parsons on Cont., </em>385, 386.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-5\">2d. The appellant at the time of sale undoubtedly had <em>an int&amp;t'esi </em>in the wheat crop, which he could sell, though that interest may hare been subject to the claim of the landlord for rent. The plaintiffs purchased with their eyes open, and in the contract made express provision for the contingency of such a claim being asserted. They bought what the appellant had a <em>clear right to sell, </em>and the fact that they paid too high a price for it in the absence of fraud, is no ground for relief either in equity or at law, and certainly does not malte out a case of total failure of consideration. <em>Parsons on Cont., </em>341, 342.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-6\">3d. But the fact that any distress warrant Avas ever issued, and any sale ever made thereunder, has not been established in this case by any legal and competent 'evidence. The warrant to distrain, and the account are both required by the Statute to be in writing, and in the absence of proof that they have been lost or destroyed, parol proof of them is entirely inadmissible. The Court beloAV Avas therefore Avrong in its rulings in the 3d, 4th, 5th and 6th exceptions. <em>Code Pub. Gen. Laws, Art. </em>53, <em>secs. </em>8, 9 ; <em>Starkie on Evidence, (Sharswood Ed.,) </em>581.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-7\">4th. The ruling in the 1th exception, excluding evidence that no rent Avas due from the appellant to Kunkel, either at the time the appellees purchased the wheat from the appellant, or at the time the same was sold by the sheriff under the alleged distraint for rent, Avas erroneous. There Avas no proof as to the amount of rent claimed, or of the amount for Avhich it Avas sold by the sheriff, and it Avas proved <em>that the' appellees themselves </em>became purchasers of the wheat at the sheriff\u2019s sale. Now evidence that no rent was at that time due, Avas clearly admissible to shoAv collusion betAveen the landlord and the appellees to deprive the appellant of the benefit of liis sale, and if this could be established, surely the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>appellees could not be allowed to take advantage of their own wrong, in order to make out a failure of consideration of their own contract with the appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-5\">5th. The whole effort on the part of the appellees was to make out a <em>sale </em>under a \u201cdistress warrant\u201d for rent in arrear due to the landlord:- \u2014 in other words, to make out a failure of consideration by showing eviction under a paramount title. Now the Code of Pub. Gen. Laws, Art. 53, Sec. 16, declares, that every distress for rent made contrary to the provisions of that Article, and every sale made under and by virtue of such distress, shall be <em>absolutely illegal and void. </em>The appellees surely could not set up an <em>illegal </em>or <em>void sale </em>to make out their case of eviction by paramount title, and consequently, a failure of consideration for their contract. To make out their case they must prove a distress levied, and a sale thereunder in pursuance of the provisions of the Code. This they have utterly failed to do, for :\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-6\">1st.

It was not therefore made <em>after </em>five days from the making of the distress and <em>notice.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-10\">4th. The sale was not made by the proper party. The sheriff was not acting in this matter as <em>sheriff, </em>so as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>authorise his deputy to act for him, hut simply as <em>bailiff </em>of the landlord. The landlord could have authorised any other party to levy the distress. The sheriff was acting hy virtue of a special delegation of authority, which he could not delegate to any one else.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b119-5\"><em>Grayson Eichelberger </em>for the appellees :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-6\">In the sale of personal property there is an implied warranty of title, and where the consideration'fails, the vendee may recover of the vendor, on the implied warranty, any purchase money he may have paid the vendor. <em>Mockbee\u2019s Adm\u2019r vs. Gardner, </em>2 <em>H. &amp; G., </em>176 ; <em>Story on Contracts, sec. </em>833 ; <em>Story on Sales, sec. </em>367 ; <em>Parsons on Contracts, </em>458, <em>n ; Defreeze vs. Trumper, </em>1 <em>Johns.

Kunkel. The appellant had heen. tenant of Kunkel, and claimed to be entitled to the growing crop, subject to the claim of the landlord for rent, which we infer was payable in kind, though the terms of the tenancy are not distinctly proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">The whole price agreed on for the appellants\u2019 interest or share was $840, of which $420 was paid in cash, and for the residue the following note or contract was given :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\">\u201c$420.00. Frederick County, May 81st, 1864.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-9\">\u201cNinety days after date, we or either of us promise to pay to Charles E.

Jacob M.

B arrice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-12\">In July, 1864, after the wheat had been reaped by the appellees, and while it remained in the field, the appellees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>allege that it was seized and sold hy the bailiff of Kunkel under a distress for rent in arrear, due by the appellant. Exception was taken to the character of the evidence offered to prove the distress and the proceedings thereunder, which will be noticed hereafter; assuming, however, for the present, that the seizure and sale under the distress were proved by competent evidence, we shall first consider whether the two prayers of the appellees ought to have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The plaintiffs state the ground of their action to be a breach of the implied warranty of title of the vendor, and the consequent failure of consideration for which the money was paid, and they seek to recover back the purchase money so paid. Accordingly, the hypothesis of their first prayer is that if they purchased in May, 1864, from the defendant, his interest in the crop of wheat, and paid him $420 as part of the purchase money; and after-wards, in July, 1864, the interest of the defendant in the crop was seized hy the landlord for rent in arrear due by the defendant; that this constitutes a breach of the implied warranty of title, and shows a failure of the consideration for which the money was paid, which entitles the plaintiffs to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">By the second prayer the measure of damages is declared to be the sum of money originally paid, in part of the price, with interest from the time of payment. It is perfectly manifest that this theory of the case cannot be supported consistently with well established rules of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">It by no means follows that because the property sold in May, was afterwards, in July, seized and sold under a distress for rent due by the defendant, the implied warranty of title was broken. The breach of that warranty depends upon the title of the vendor at the time of sale, and not upon matters arising subsequently. The prayer does not state, nor is there any evidence to show that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>rent, or any part of it, for which the distress was levied, was due and' in arrear at the time of the sale. If it became due afterwards, then there existed at the time of the sale nothing to impair the right of the defendant to sell his interest; and a seizure and sale by the landlord afterwards for rent in arrear subsequently becoming due, does not in any sense constitute a breach of the implied warranty of title, for which the vendees could recover in an action on the warranty. See <em>Giese vs. Thomas, </em>7 <em>H. &amp; </em>J., 459 <em>; Buckey vs. </em>Snouffer, 10 <em>Md. Rep., </em>149. The ground of such action is always an eviction by one having a superior title to the vendor, or some lien existing at the time of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">In the excellent treatise of the late Professor Bell \u201c on the Contract \u00f3f Sale of Goods and Merchandise,\u201d 50 Law Lib. 50, (95 marg.) the law is clearly and concisely stated thus:</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\u201cThe seller is hound to protect the buyer from all evictions arising from circumstances anterior to the sale, of which the cause or the germ existed at the time of the sale; as debts chargeable on the thing sold, revenue duties to which the goods are liable, or such defects in the seller\u2019s title as form a <em>labes realis.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">If rent were actually due and in arrear at the time of the sale in this case, and the property sold was afterwards lawfully seized and taken by the landlord to pay such rent, then the appellant would be liable on his implied warranty of title'; this was decided in <em>Dunlop vs. Earl of Dalhousie, </em>in Scotland, in 1828, affirmed by the House of Lords, 4 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>420. Though that decision was under the Scottish Law, we are of opinion that the same principle must be recognized in Maryland, as it is within the general rule above cited. - The rights of the landlord to distrain existing at the time of the sale, would constitute a liability in the nature of a lien upon the property, although as settled in Buckey <em>vs. </em>Snouffer, not an actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>or consummate lien, yet an inchoate claim or right which might afterwards he enforced; and therefore a <em>labes realis </em>against which the purchasers would be entitled to protection under the implied warranty, and in this aspect of the case the measure of damages would be as stated in the appellees\u2019 second prayer. But as we have said, the appellees\u2019 first prayer does not state that the rent for which the property was seized was due and in arrear at the time of the sale, and was therefore erroneously If it became due afterwards, the seizure and sale by the landlord did not constitute a breach of warranty for which the appellees would be entitled to recover upon the warranty ; although if these facts were established by legal and competent evidence, the present suit might be, maintained on other grounds; not for a breach of the implied warranty of title, but for money paid, laid out and expended by the plaintiffs for the use of the defendant. It is very clear that if the property of the appellees were lawfully seized and taken to pay the appellant\u2019s debt, they would be entitled to maintain this' action, without reference to the fact whether the property had been purchased from the appellant or not; and in such case the measure of damages would be the value of the property so taken, with interest thereon, or the amount which they were compelled to pay in order to emancipate it from the lawful claim of the landlord, with interest from the time of payment. In this case, however, the damages to be recovered, whether brought within the warranty or otherwise, would be diminish\u00e9d by first deducting the sum or balance of the purchase money secured by the note, if the same remain unpaid, which by the terms of the contract is first to be applied to such a demand. The law is well settled that a party may maintain an action for money paid for another who is a stranger to him, provided such payment be compulsory; that is, when it is paid for the purpose of \u201c emancipating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>the person or property from an actual and existing duress imposed upon it.\u201d In <em>Mayor, &amp;c., of Baltimore vs. Lefferman, 4 Gill, 425, </em>the doctrine on this subject is fully considered and the cases collected. See also <em>Dorsey vs. Smith, 7 H. &amp; J., </em>366 <em>; Turner vs. Egerton, </em>1 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>430. Under the rulings in those cases we are of opinion that the appellees would be entitled to recover in this action upon the facts stated in their first prayer, if established by legal and competent evidence; and that the measure of damages would be as we have before stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Having made these general observations on the law governing this action, we shall proceed to notice the questions presented by the bills of exceptions so far as they are material to the decision of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The first and second exceptions are not material, as the written paper therein referred to was afterwards produced, and contains nothing to show that the evidence of the witness Harding was inadmissible. The ruling of the Circuit Court as stated in these exceptions is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The 3d, 4th, 5th and 6th exceptions all relate to the .evidence offered by the appellees to prove the seizure and sale under the distress, and the objection is taken that the same could not be proved by parol.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">In the opinion of this Court, this objection .to the evidence is well' taken. Whether the appellees claim.under the implied warranty, or seek to recover for money paid. in satisfaction of the appellant\u2019s debt, it is essential for them to establish the fact of a lawful seizure under the distress; and the only legal evidence of this are the. papers showing the proceedings in conformity with the requirements of the Code: parol testimony is inadmissible for this purpose, without laying a proper foundation to justify the introduction of secondary proof. See <em>Giese vs. Thomas, 7 H. &amp; J., </em>459 ; <em>Sanderson\u2019s Ex\u2019rs vs. Marks, </em>1 <em>H. &amp; G., </em>252; <em>McKee\u2019s Adm\u2019rs vs. McKee\u2019s Adm\u2019rs. </em>16 <em>Md., </em>516.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Here the ground of the action is that the appellees were deprived of the property purchased, hy a party having a lawful right to seize it, upon a claim or lien existing at the time of the purchase; or that they were compelled, in order to emancipate their property from a legal claim thereon against the appellant, to pay a sum of money to such claimant; in either case the <em>onus </em>is on them to show that such claim existed and was enforced according to law. The mere fact of the seizure and sale by the landlord is not sufficient; being made under color of a distress for rent in arrear, in which the proceedings are required to be in writing, and in conformity with law; it cannot be proved by parol.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">For the same reason the proof offered by the appellant in the 7th exception, that there was no rent in arrear at the time of the alleged distress, was competent and ought to have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The same question is presented by the appellant\u2019s prayer in the eighth exception, and his 1st, 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 3th and 10th prayers in the ninth exception, and the Court below erred in rejecting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The eleventh prayer raises the question of the power of the deputy sheriff, acting under the sheriff\u2019s authority, to make sale of property seized by the sheriff under a distress warrant to him directed. On this point we think the appellant\u2019s counsel are in error. Though a distress for rent is a remedy by the act of the party, and' a landlord may constitute any person as his bailiff to make it ; yet where he causes the warrant to be directed to the sheriff, that officer may execute the warrant by his deputy, whose acts must be regarded as those of the sheriff himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">The general observations we have already made with regard to the principles governing this action, renders it unnecessary to express an opinion upon the other prayers of the appellant.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b126-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>(Decided 24th May, 1867.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">We have said that the appellees failed to adduce competent and sufficient proof to entitle them to recover in either aspect of the case; but as that proof may be supplied upon a new trial, and thus the other questions raised by these prayers may become material-, we deem it proper to state the opinion of this Court thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">1st. It would not be necessary for the plaintiffs to rescind or offer to rescind the contract, in order to enable them to recover, provided there existed no other objection to their suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">2d. The existence of the contract, evidenced by the note given-by, the appellees to secure the balance of the purchase money, whereby they are expressly entitled to retain, out of such balance, any loss they may incur by reason of any person claiming the property purchased, constitutes in itself no defence to this action, except so far as the question of damages is concerned. The said balance, if it remain unpaid, being first applicable in reduction of the plaintiffs' demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and procedendo ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
