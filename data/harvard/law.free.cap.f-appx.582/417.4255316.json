He also alleged that his property was lost or stolen. Madrigal consented to proceed before the magistrate judge, who held a hearing pursuant to <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985). The magistrate judge dismissed the complaint with prejudice for failure to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>\u00a7 1915A(b)(l). Our review is de novo. <em>See Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 733-34 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Although this court construes the briefs of pro se litigants liberally, an appellant\u2019s brief must contain an argument on the issues that are raised so that this court may know what action of the district court is complained of. <em>Al-Ra\u2019id v. Ingle, </em>69 F.3d 28, 31 (5th Cir.1995). Conclusory statements of the type found in Madrigal\u2019s brief are insufficient, even for a pro se appellant. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. 5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). This dismissal counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), and Madrigal is warned that if he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g); <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
