We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Rodriguez contends that the district court erred at sentencing by denying him a minor role adjustment and failing to grant safety valve. Rodriguez asserts that the sentence imposed was procedurally flawed and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">The district court properly considered the particular facts regarding this particular defendant and did not clearly err by determining that Rodriguez was not eligible for the minor role adjustment. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Castro, </em>641 F.3d 1189, 1193 (9th Cir.2011). Since Rodriguez repeatedly refused to answer questions related to his co-conspirators in the proffer, the district court did not clearly err in determining that Rodriguez did not meet his burden to show his eligibility for safety valve relief. <em>See United States v. Mejia-Pimental, </em>477 F.3d 1100, 1105 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">The district court correctly calculated the guideline range to be 210 to 262 months. The 150-month sentence imposed by the district court was not procedurally flawed or substantively unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 991-994 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b715-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
