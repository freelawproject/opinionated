R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b731-10\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">Ted Allen Kohr appeals from the eight-month term of imprisonment and the 24-month term of supervised release imposed upon revocation of supervised release. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-12\">Kohr contends that the district court procedurally erred by (1) failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) factors and failing adequately to explain the sentence imposed; (2) improperly considering the seriousness of the offense; and (3) improperly considering Kohr\u2019s need for rehabilitation. Because Kohr did not object to the sentence before the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Valencia-Barragan, </em>608 F.3d 1103, 1108 (9th Cir.2010). The record reflects that the district court considered the section 3583(e) sentencing factors and adequately explained the sentence imposed. It further reflects that the district court took proper account of the seriousness of</p>\n<p id=\"b731-17\">Kohr\u2019s conduct and did not impose sentence primarily on this basis. <em>See United States v. Simtob, </em>485 F.3d 1058, 1062-63 (9th Cir.2007). Finally, even if the district court plainly erred by considering Kohr\u2019s need for substance abuse treatment when it imposed his sentence, <em>see United States v. Grant, </em>664 F.3d 276, 279-82 (9th Cir. 2011), he has not shown a reasonable probability that he would have received a different sentence if the district court had not considered rehabilitation. <em>See United States v. Dallman, </em>533 F.3d 755, 762 (9th Cir .2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-18\">Kohr also contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing Kohr\u2019s sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The custodial sentence at the bottom of the Guidelines range and the 24-month term of supervised release are substantively reasonable in light of the section 3583(e) sentencing factors and the totality of the circumstances. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b731-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b731-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
