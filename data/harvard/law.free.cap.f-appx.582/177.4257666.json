He appeals, asserting that the upward variance sentence was unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-26\">Boddie contends that the sentence imposed was unreasonable because the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>trict court failed to consider letters submitted at sentencing evidencing his family-support. This court reviews a sentence for procedural and substantive reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The same standard applies whether the sentence is \u201cinside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>United States v. Riverar-Santana, </em>668 F.3d 95, 100-01 (4th Cir.) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 274, 184 L.Ed.2d 162 (2012). In reviewing a variance, the appellate court must give due deference to the sentencing court\u2019s decision because it \u201chas flexibility in fashioning a sentence outside of the Guidelines range,\u201d and need only \u201cset forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that it has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis\u201d for its decision. <em>United States v. Diosdado-Star, </em>630 F.3d 359, 364, 366 (4th Cir.2011) (citing <em>Gall, 552 </em>U.S. at 56, 128 S.Ct. 586); <em>see also United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 328 (4th Cir.2009) (sentencing court \u201cmust make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented\u201d) (citation and emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The district court properly computed the applicable Guidelines range as 70 to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court acknowledged that it read and considered the letters submitted by Boddie. The court also appropriately considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2012) factors in light of Boddie\u2019s individual characteristics and history. Noting Boddie\u2019s lengthy criminal history and his lack of respect for the law, the court determined that, based on the need to impose just punishment, the need for deterrence, and the serious nature of Boddie\u2019s criminal history, an upward variance to 96 months was appropriate. We conclude that the district court adequately explained the reasons for the sentence imposed and that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the 96-month sentence. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 41, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>Diosdado-Star, </em>630 F.3d at 364, 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Accordingly, we affirm Boddie\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
