We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">The district court denied Sargent\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction and dismissed Sargent\u2019s complaint on two alternative grounds: first, that the district court was required to abstain from exercising jurisdiction under <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971); and second, that the defendants were entitled to immunity from all of Sargent\u2019s claims. On appeal, Sargent challenges only the first of these determinations and fails to raise any meaningful argument addressing the defendants\u2019 immunity to suit. \u201cWe regard as waived any challenges ... to adverse decisions that are undiscussed.\u201d <em>Lore v. City of Syracuse, </em>670 F.3d 127, 149 (2d Cir.2012); <em>see also Jackler v. Byrne, </em>658 F.3d 225, 233 (2d Cir.2011) (\u201c[The plaintiffs] brief on appeal contains no argument that any ruling other than the dismissal of his First Amendment retaliation claims was incorrect, and we thus regard all of his other claims as abandoned.\u201d). Accordingly, we find that Sargent has abandoned his claim that the district court erred in finding his action barred by the defendants\u2019 immunity, and we may affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint on this ground alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">Nonetheless, we also find that the district court correctly concluded that immunity bars Sargent\u2019s claims against the defendants here. The Eleventh Amendment bars suits by private persons against state governments unless the state waives its sovereign immunity or Congress abrogates it by appropriate legislation. <em>See Virginia Office for Prot. &amp; Advocacy v. Stewart, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1632, 1638, 179 L.Ed.2d 675 (2011). State sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment extends to actions against the state\u2019s agencies and instrumentalities, <em>see Regents of the Univ. of California v. Doe, </em>519 U.S. 425, 429, 117 S.Ct. 900, 137 L.Ed.2d 55 (1997), and \u201capplies to a suit seeking an injunction,\u201d <em>Cory v. White, </em>457 U.S. 85, 91, 102 S.Ct. 2325, 72 L.Ed.2d 694 (1982). Here, the district court correctly found that the Judicial Branch of the State of Connecticut, one of the defendants in this action, is a department of the state and thus shares in its sovereign immunity. <em>See </em>Conn. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 51-la. Moreover, there is no indication that the state has waived its immunity, and it is well established that Congress did not abrogate state sovereign immunity in enacting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, under which all of Sargent\u2019s claims were brought. <em>See Quern v. Jordan, </em>440 U.S. 332, 345, 99 S.Ct. 1139, 59 L.Ed.2d 358 (1979). Therefore, the district court correctly found that the Eleventh Amendment bars Sargent\u2019s suit against the Judicial Branch of the State of Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>With respect to Judge Emons, the other defendant in these proceedings, the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996 amended section 1983 to provide \u201cthat in any action brought against a judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such officer\u2019s judicial capacity, injunctive relief shall not be granted unless a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable.\u201d Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996, \u00a7 309(c), Pub.L. No. 104-317, 110 Stat. 3847, 3853 (1996) (amending 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983). Claims for injunctive relief under section 1983 against judges acting in their official capacity are therefore barred by absolute judicial immunity as long as declaratory relief remains available, the judge did not exceed her jurisdiction, and the plaintiff does not allege that a declaratory judgment was violated. <em>See Montero v. Travis, </em>171 F.3d 757, 761 (2d Cir.1999) (per curiam). Here, Sargent sued Judge Emons solely in her judicial capacity in adjudicating Sargent\u2019s custody dispute. And, as the district court found, Sargent has not alleged that Judge Emons acted in violation of any declaratory decree or in excess of her jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Conn. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 46b-56(a) (granting continuing jurisdiction to the Connecticut Superior Court over custody matters). Nor has Sargent claimed that declaratory relief is unavailable. The district court therefore correctly found that Sargent\u2019s injunctive claims against Judge Emons under section 1983 are barred by the doctrine of judicial immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court was correct in finding that immunity bars Sargent\u2019s claims, a finding that required denial of Sargent\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction and dismissal of this action, and so we need not reach the question of whether abstention was required on the facts of this case. We have considered Sargent\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the reasons stated herein, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
