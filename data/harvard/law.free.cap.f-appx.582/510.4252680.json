Navarro now appeals her sentence. We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo, and its factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 202-03 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-21\">Navarro\u2019s first issue concerns the calculation of her base offense level (BOL) under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). She does not dispute the finding that she was responsible for 1,786.05 grams of a mixture or substance containing methamphetamine, a quantity that would result in a BOL of 34. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(3). Finding that a quantity of drugs seized from Navarro\u2019s sole supplier had an average purity rate of 92.2%, however, the district court used that purity rate to determine that the drug mixture attributable to Navarro contained more than 1.5 kilograms of actual methamphetamine and to assign Navarro a BOL of 38. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l). Given the evidence that the drug mixture attributable to Navarro and the drug mixture that was analyzed for purity all came from the same, sole source, a finding that the drugs attributable to Navarro also had an average purity rate of 92.2% is plausible and, thus, not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>666 F.3d 944, 947 (5th Cir.2012). Additionally, nothing in the record suggests that the drugs attributable to Navarro had an average purity rate of less than 80%. Even assuming a purity rate of only 80%, the district court did not err in applying a BOL of 38 in this case. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>666 F.3d at 947; <em>United States v. Sherrod, </em>964 F.2d 1501, 1508 (5th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>1992); \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l); \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l), Notes (B) &amp; (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">We turn next to Navarro\u2019s argument that the district court erred in applying a two-level enhancement under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(12) for maintaining a premises for the purpose of manufacturing or distributing a controlled substance. Testimony from a law enforcement officer at sentencing and the unrebutted facts in the PSR and its addenda support the district court\u2019s finding that Navarro and her on- and-off boyfriend moved from hotel to hotel, selling methamphetamine from the rooms in which they stayed. It also supports the finding that Navarro used a residence in Fort Worth, Texas, to run her drug-trafficking business. Navarro offers no legal support for her conclusional argument that a premises must be specifically identified as a prerequisite to its use for the application of a \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(12) enhancement. Navarro has not shown that the district court\u2019s factual findings were clearly erroneous or that it erred in applying \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(12) in this case. <em>See Alaniz, </em>726 F.3d at 618; \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(12) &amp; comment.
