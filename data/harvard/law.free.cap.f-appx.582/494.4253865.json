Young\u2019s opening brief contains no cognizable issues for review and attaches irrelevant exhibits from outside the record. His reply brief likewise fails to address, in a comprehensible manner, the basis for the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint. Based on our review of the record, the district court did not err. We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the district court. Young\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b522-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
