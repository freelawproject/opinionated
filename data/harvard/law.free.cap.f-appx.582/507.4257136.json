He argues that the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines when it determined that his prior conviction for lewd acts with a child under the age of 14 under CalPenal Code Ann. \u00a7 288(a) was a crime of violence within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). As Francisco concedes, because he raised no objection in the district court on the basis of the legal arguments he now presents on appeal, our review is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Chavez-Hernandez, </em>671 F.3d 494, 497 (5th Cir.2012). To demonstrate plain error, Francisco must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423,173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>As Francisco acknowledges, in <em>United States v. </em>Rodriguez, 711 F.3d 541, 562 n. 28 (5th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 512, 187 L.Ed.2d 365 (2013), we rejected the argument that any minimum age differential is required for an offense to qualify as sexual abuse of a minor. He nevertheless preserves for possible further review his claim that, whereas \u00a7 288(a) requires no age differential between the victim and the perpetrator, the generic meaning of sexual abuse of a minor requires at least a four-year age differential.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The primary contention raised by Francisco, which he does not concede is foreclosed, is that \u00a7 288(a) has been interpreted to punish otherwise innocent or innocuous acts and non-abusive consensual conduct. Consistent with the plain-meaning approach we adopted in <em>Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d at 552, Francisco has not shown clear or obvious error in the district court\u2019s determination that his conviction was for the enumerated offense of sexual abuse of a minor and, accordingly, a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423; \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. 1(b)(iii)); <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 274-75 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b535-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
