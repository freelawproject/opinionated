In his civil rights complaint, Norman asserted that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA) had, prior to his criminal conviction, determined that a separate \u201cfactual sufficiency\u201d review was no longer necessary in criminal appeals, despite the fact that the state constitution and the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure authorized such a review as distinct from legal sufficiency. Norman requested an injunction ordering the TCCA to use the proper legal definition of \u201cfactual sufficiency,\u201d an order requiring the TCCA and state appellate courts to review all criminal cases filed since the change in the definition, a permanent injunction preventing the TCCA and state appellate courts from redefining standard terms, and a permanent injunction requiring courts to apply the same factual sufficiency analysis in criminal cases that is provided in civil proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">On appeal, Norman contends that the district court erred in concluding that he lacked standing to challenge the state courts\u2019 failure to conduct a factual sufficiency review. The court did not deny relief on this basis; it instead concluded that the defendants were protected by judicial immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Norman also argues that the district court erred in relying on such immunity because he sought only injunctive relief. He is correct that judicial immunity does not bar claims for injunctive or declaratory relief in \u00a7 1983 actions. <em>See Holloway v. Walker, </em>765 F.2d 517, 525 (5th Cir.1985). However, we \u201cmay affirm on any grounds supported by the record.\u201d <em>McGruder v. Will, </em>204 F.3d 220, 222 (5th Cir.2000) (citations omitted). To the extent that Norman seeks to have us review the state courts\u2019 failure to conduct a factual sufficiency analysis in his own appeal and order such an analysis to occur, his claims are barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine because he is seeking review of a state-court judgment. <em>See Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005); <em>District of Columbia Ct. of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923). Additionally, Norman\u2019s disagreement with the state courts\u2019 interpretation of state law is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Simi Inv. Co. v. Harris County, Tex., </em>236 F.3d 240, 247 (5th Cir.2000). To the extent that Norman is asserting that the state courts\u2019 refusal to consider a factual sufficiency claim deprives him of access to the courts, he is not entitled to relief because he has not shown that he was unable to file a necessary legal document. <em>See Brewer v. Wilkinson, </em>3 F.3d 816, 821 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-13\">The district court dismissed Norman\u2019s complaint without providing him with an opportunity to amend. Generally, the court should provide a pro se plaintiff with an opportunity to amend before dismissing the case. <em>Brewster v. Dretke, </em>587 F.3d 764, 767-68 (5th Cir.2009). However, such an opportunity is not necessary if the plaintiff has pleaded his \u201c \u2018best case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Norman has not shown that any attempt to amend his complaint would have result<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>ed in a nonfrivolous \u00a7 1983 claim. <em>See Exxon Mobil, </em>544 U.S. at 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517; <em>Simi Inv. Co., </em>236 F.3d at 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Because Norman has not shown that his civil rights claim has an arguable legal basis, it is frivolous. <em>See Martin v. Scott, </em>156 F.3d 578, 580 (5th Cir.1998). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b459-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
