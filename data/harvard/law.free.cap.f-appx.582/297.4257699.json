Proceeding with the parties\u2019 consent pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c), the magistrate judge (MJ) granted Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and dismissed Nottingham\u2019s complaint without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-23\">We review a summary judgment ruling de novo, using the same standard employed by the district court. <em>Carnaby v. City of Houston, </em>636 F.3d 183, 187 (5th Cir.2011). Pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), \u201cprisoners must properly exhaust \u2018such administrative remedies as are available\u2019 prior to filing a section 1983 action concerning prison conditions.\u201d <em>Dillon v. Rogers, </em>596 F.3d 260, 265 (5th Cir.2010) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a)). When a defendant asserts the affirmative defense of exhaustion, the district court should rule on this issue before allowing the case to proceed to the merits. <em>Id. </em>at 272-73. In making this ruling, the district court may act as the factfinder and resolve disputed facts concerning exhaustion without the partic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>ipation of a jury. <em>Id. </em>We review the district court\u2019s ruling on exhaustion de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Id. </em>at 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Failure to exhaust administrative remedies is an affirmative defense that can be waived if not asserted by the defendant. <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 216, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007); <em>Carbe v. Lappin, </em>492 F.3d 325, 328 (5th Cir.2007). The MJ correctly concluded that Defendants did not waive the defense because they raised it at a pragmatically sufficient time and Nottingham was not prejudiced in his ability to respond. <em>See Vanhoy v. United States, </em>514 F.3d 447, 450-51 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The MJ was permitted to resolve the disputed factual issues regarding exhaustion without the participation of a jury. <em>See Dillon, </em>596 F.3d at 272-73. The MJ found that that Nottingham did not file or attempt to file any grievances as he stated in his original complaint. This finding was plausible in light of the timing and contradictory nature of Nottingham\u2019s later assertions that he did file grievances as well as Defendants\u2019 evidence setting forth the grievance procedure at the Wheeler County Jail and Nottingham\u2019s knowledge of and failure to avail himself of this procedure. Therefore, the MJ\u2019s finding that Nottingham did not exhaust his administrative remedies was not clearly erroneous. <em>See id. </em>at 272-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">As to his remaining arguments, Nottingham offers only unsupported assertions regarding the availability of administrative remedies once he was transferred to another jail. The \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d of his case, which he asserts necessitated his transfer from the Wheeler County Jail to a facility that could house a disabled pretrial detainee, do not excuse his failure to exhaust. <em>See Dillon, </em>596 F.3d at 270. The MJ did not err by dismissing Nottingham\u2019s complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b325-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
