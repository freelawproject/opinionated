Roy appeals his convictions and sentences. He challenges his convictions, and seeks a new trial, on the ground that the District Court should have granted his motion for a mistrial because the prosecutor, in opening statement, and a government witness commented on his <em>post-Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>silence, in violation of <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976). Roy challenges his sentences on the ground that, in calculating his total offense level pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual [hereinafter U.S.S.G.] \u00a7 3C1.1, the District Court erred in imposing a two-level obstruction of justice enhancement. Having carefully considered Roy\u2019s arguments, we affirm his convictions and sentences. We address first the motion-for-mistrial issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-13\">Immediately before the trial began, the court met with counsel for the parties in its conference room to go over some of the Government\u2019s exhibits, most of which defense counsel stipulated were admissible. When the court inquired whether there were any \u201cparticular problems on the horizon,\u201d the prosecutor said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-14\">[PROSECUTOR]: No, no, sir. The only thing I would somewhat bring your attention to, my understanding is at this point the Defendant does expect \u2014 or is expected to testify. He does have two prior convictions, two prior felony convictions from 1986. One is for kidnapping and one is for an assault. He was released from prison on those convictions in about 2006. I do not plan to bring them in as 404(b), but I just want to make the Court aware of them, should he open the door when he takes the stand for impeachment purposes of his prior convictions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-15\">The court then said, \u201c[b]ut if he testifies, it\u2019s \u2014 you know, that\u2019s \u2014 .\u201d And, in response, defense counsel said, \u201che\u2019s fair game.\u201d After the court repeated the words \u201cfair game,\u201d defense counsel volunteered, \u201c[a]nd he may change his mind during the trial, Judge, I mean, you just never know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>During the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement, she stated, in part, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AG6\">And when he\u2019s done and when he\u2019s sitting in a room with Sergeant Daffin and he\u2019s confronted about why he\u2019s been arrested and he\u2019s told what the charge is, he gets caught in several lies. He says, \u201cChild? What child? I wasn\u2019t coming over here to meet with a child. I was coming over here to meet with a 30-year-old woman.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-5\">You\u2019ll see in the evidence Jaz and Alex mentioned Jaz\u2019s age on multiple occasions, and at one point the Defendant himself recognizes her age.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-6\">He also \u2014 when Sergeant Daffin tells him, \u201cNo, no, she wasn\u2019t 30, she was a child,\u201d he said, \u201cOh, oh, wait, wait, well, I couldn\u2019t really hear. We were having some phone troubles.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-7\">And when Sergeant Daffin says, \u201cUh-Uh, that\u2019s not going to cut it, Mr. Roy, I\u2019ve listened to those phone calls and they\u2019re clear as day\u201d \u2014 and you\u2019re going to hear them, and they are clear as day \u2014 at that point Mr. Roy hangs his head and says, \u201cI don\u2019t want to make a statement anymore. I\u2019m done.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">Defense counsel objected on the ground that the prosecutor had improperly commented on his right to remain silent, but he requested neither a mistrial nor a cautionary instruction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">Roy argues that the Constitution \u2014 specifically, the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause \u2014 required the court to grant a mistrial. Generally, we review issues of constitutional law <em>de novo. United States v. O\u2019Keefe, </em>461 F.3d 1338, 1346 (11th Cir. 2006). We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s refusal to grant a mistrial based on a comment regarding the defendant\u2019s right to remain silent. <em>United States v. Reeves, </em>742 F.3d 487, 504 (11th Cir.2014). Abuse-of-discretion review grants the district court a range of choice. We will not find an abuse even if we would have ruled to the contrary, so long as the district court did not commit a clear error in judgment. <em>United States v. Drury, </em>396 F.3d 1303, 1315 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-15\">In <em>Doyle, </em>the Supreme Court held that the use of a defendant\u2019s silence at the time of his arrest for impeachment purposes violates due process because <em>Miranda </em>warnings carry an implicit assurance that silence will carry no penalty. <em>See Reeves, </em>742 F.3d at 504. Specifically, the prosecutor cannot comment on the defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence to impeach exculpatory testimony on the ground that the defendant did not explain his conduct at the time of his arrest. <em>United States v. Dodd, </em>111 F.3d 867, 869 (11th Cir.1997). However, a \u201csingle comment alone\u201d does not necessarily constitute a <em>Doyle </em>violation where the Government does not attempt to use the improper comment to impeach the defendant. <em>United States v. Stubbs, </em>944 F.2d 828, 835 (11th Cir.1991). Moreover, where a defendant testifies in contradiction with his post-arrest statement, the prosecutor is entitled to challenge the defendant with that statement and to elicit for the jury whether the defendant terminated that statement. <em>Lofton v. Wainwright, </em>620 F.2d 74, 77-78 (5th Cir.1980) (habeas context).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number><em>Doyle </em>errors are reviewed for harmless error. <em>O\u2019Keefe, </em>461 F.3d at 1346. A <em>Doyle </em>violation is harmless where the error has \u201cno substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>See Reeves, </em>742 F.3d at 504 (quotation marks omitted). Such an error may be especially harmless where, as here, the prosecutor makes no further attempt to discuss the defendant having exercised his right to remain silent. <em>Id. </em>The court\u2019s use of a curative jury instruction and the weight of the evidence of guilt may also render a <em>Doyle </em>error harmless. <em>United States v. Suggs, </em>755 F.2d 1538, 1541 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">We find that the prosecutor technically erred under <em>Doyle. </em>Both her opening statement and the interviewing officer\u2019s testimony made reference to the fact that the post-arrest interview stopped due to Roy\u2019s conduct, and both references were made before he testified. The opening statement in particular was against the spirit of <em>Doyle, </em>since, as the Government points out, Roy stopped talking immediately following an allegation that his phone calls with an undercover officer had been recorded. The opening thus implied that Roy\u2019s silence was a tacit admission of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">However, the <em>Doyle </em>error was harmless. The first reason that the error was harmless is that there was overwhelming evidence of Roy\u2019s guilt. Police recorded all of Roy\u2019s telephone and e-mail communications with \u201cJaz,\u201d the persona assumed by an undercover officer. Those communications included Roy\u2019s repeated requests for pictures of \u201cJaz,\u201d who he had been told was \u201calmost fourteen,\u201d from the neck down, and explicit telephone conversations, in which Roy discussed what sex acts he wanted to engage in with \u201cJaz.\u201d Further, when arrested, Roy had condoms, Viagra, handcuffs, and a set of cards depicting sexual positions in his truck. The error was also harmless because the prosecutor made no further mention of Roy\u2019s silence, and the court instructed the jury both that the lawyers\u2019 statements should not be considered evidence and that it should not draw any inference of guilt from Roy\u2019s failure to talk with police.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Foley, </em>508 F.3d 627, 632 (11th Cir.2007). We review for clear error the findings of fact supporting the court\u2019s application of a particular guideline, including the obstruction of justice enhancement guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>627 F.3d 839, 845 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">The Guidelines provide for a two-level enhancement where a defendant \u201cwillfully obstructed or impeded ... the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction\u201d and where the obstructive conduct related to the offense of conviction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. Perjury involves deliberately false testimony concerning a material matter, not false testimony caused by confusion or mistake. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n. 4(B)); <em>see also Williams, </em>627 F.3d at 845.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">To ensure that it does not impose an obstruction enhancement reflexively after the defendant has testified and has been found guilty, a district court must find the facts necessary to establish the elements of perjury. <em>United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 96-97, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 1118, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993). At sentencing, after the court finds that the defendant committed perjury, if the defendant believes that the findings of fact on which it has found perjury are inadequate, he must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>say so; otherwise, he cannot argue on appeal that the findings were inadequate. <em>United States v. Gregg, </em>179 F.3d 1312, 1317 (11th Cir.1999). Roy failed to request that the court make more detailed findings in support of its finding of perjury; his challenge to the enhancement \u2014 on the ground that the fact findings supporting it were inadequate \u2014 fails. <em>See Gregg, </em>179 F.3d at 1317.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Nevertheless, Roy preserved for appeal the argument that the court erred in imposing the obstruction of justice enhancement. We find no error. Roy raised a Good Samaritan defense and testified that he had no intention of having sex with a child. His testimony was belied by evidence that, over the telephone, after having learned that \u201cJaz\u201d was a child, he discussed whether she would partake in specific sex acts with him. He told her that he \u201cwant[ed] to do it a lot.\u201d He also testified that the condoms in his truck were not his. But he told \u201cJaz\u201d that he had \u201cstuff to be safe with\u201d to prevent her from getting pregnant. In sum, we find no error in the court\u2019s application of the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b864-10\">. <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b865-10\">. Defense counsel moved for a mistrial after Sergeant Jason Daffin testified in the prosecution's case in chief. Regarding the post-arrest interrogation of Roy, Daffin said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-11\">There was one thing I brought up. When he was talking about meeting a 30-year-old female, I basically advised him it didn\u2019t make sense for him to be asking a 30-year-old female to send nude photographs from the neck down, at which time he dropped his head and that ceased the conversation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_4V\">The court denied counsel's motion and, instead, gave the jury an appropriate curative instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
