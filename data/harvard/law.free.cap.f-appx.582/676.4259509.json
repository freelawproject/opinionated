We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-24\">Carter was not deprived of a property interest when his position at the Los Angeles County Office of Public Safety (\u201cOPS\u201d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>was eliminated for economic reasons. Neither the L.A. County Civil Service Rules (the \u201cCivil Service Rules\u201d) nor the Public Safety Officers\u2019 Procedural Bill of Rights Act, Cal. Gov.Code \u00a7 3300 <em>et seq. </em>(the \u201cBill of Rights Act\u201d), gave Carter a property interest in continuing his employment after the L.A. County Board of Supervisors voted to eliminate OPS. <em>See Am. Fed\u2019n of State Emps. v. County of Los Angeles, </em>146 Cal.App.3d 879, 194 Cal.Rptr. 540, 546 (1983). As for the Bill of Rights Act, layoffs are not included within its definition of \u201cpunitive action,\u201d <em>see </em>Cal. Gov.Code \u00a7 3303, and other provisions of California law \u201cstrongly suggest that the right to an administrative appeal [against punitive action under the Act] does not apply where police officers are laid off as part of a mass reduction in personnel due, for example, to budgetary constraints.\u201d <em>White v. County of Sacramento, </em>31 Cal.3d 676, 183 Cal.Rptr. 520, 646 P.2d 191, 195 n. 4 (1982). Moreover, even if Carter did have a property interest in his status as a permanent employee at OPS, the Board of Supervisors\u2019 legislative decision to eliminate OPS provided Carter with all the process he was due. <em>See Rea v. Matteucci, </em>121 F.3d 483, 485 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Carter similarly did not have a protected property interest in his continued employment at the Los Angeles Sheriffs Department (\u201cLASD\u201d). Carter was a probationary employee at LASD, and \u201c[u]nder California law, a probationary civil service employee ordinarily has no property interest in continued public employment and may be dismissed without a hearing or judicially cognizable good cause.\u201d <em>McGraw v. City of Huntington Beach, </em>882 F.2d 384, 389 (9th Cir.1989) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Although \u201ceven a probationary employee could have a reasonable expectation of continued employment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 390 (internal quotation marks omitted), Carter identifies no state law that provides a restriction on a probationer\u2019s discharge. The hearing and appeals provisions of the Bill of Rights Act, by their terms, apply only to officers that have completed their probationary period. <em>See </em>Cal. Gov.Code \u00a7 3304(b). This language concerning the probationary period was added by the state legislature in a 1998 amendment to the Bill of Rights Act, <em>see Guinn v. County of San Bernardino, </em>184 Cal.App.4th 941, 109 Cal.Rptr.3d 667, 674 (2010), and thus Carter\u2019s reliance on cases predating this amendment is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">Carter\u2019s claim that his termination deprived him of a liberty interest presents a closer question. A liberty interest may also be infringed where an individual\u2019s dismissal \u201ceffectively precludes future work in the individual\u2019s chosen profession.\u201d <em>Braswell v. Shoreline Fire Dep\u2019t, </em>622 F.3d 1099, 1102-03 (9th Cir.2010); <em>see also Portman v. County of Santa Clara, </em>995 F.2d 898, 908 (9th Cir.1993). As the district court noted, Carter\u2019s opposition to summary judgment below rested on the \u201cbare conclusion \u2014 unsupported by law or fact \u2014 that the discharge in this case \u2018would ... be fatally preclusive to his ability to obtain peace officer employment.\u2019 \u201d (ER 6.) This conclusion was correct. As factual support for his argument that his \u201creputation has been damaged in the law enforcement community to the point that he has been unable to secure any work in this profession,\u201d Carter cites only to his own conclusory assertions at his deposition and in his declaration. And although Carter stated in his deposition that despite his best efforts to secure employment, he has been unable to get any job interviews, he also conceded that he has not made any effort to secure a job in law enforcement. (ER 310-312.)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>Where a plaintiff fails to present evidence that he is actually precluded from future employment in his chosen profession, summary judgment is appropriate. <em>See Merritt v. Mackey, </em>827 F.2d 1368, 1373 (9th Cir.1987); <em>Bollow v. Fed. Reserve Bank of San Francisco, </em>650 F.2d 1093, 1101 (9th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">We have considered Carter\u2019s remaining arguments and find them meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b704-25\"> The Honorable Brian M.
