Hartmann, a prisoner seeking redress under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for purported abridgements of his constitutional rights while in custody, appeals the District Court\u2019s March 12, 2013, order granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants. For the following reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">On May 24, 2006, Hartmann, a resident of the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center in Smyrna, Delaware, filed a pro se lawsuit, under \u00a7 1983, against myriad present and former state officeholders, prison officials, and contractors providing medical care to prisoners.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> All but three of Hartmann\u2019s claims concerning purported violations of his constitutional rights while in custody were dismissed as insufficiently pled. By the summary judgment stage, only three defendants \u2014 Vaughn\u2019s warden, Thomas Carroll; deputy warden, David Pierce; and an employee of the contractor responsible for Vaughn inmates\u2019 healthcare, Ihoma Chuks<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2014 remained.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-14\">The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Carroll, Pierce, and Chuks on June 28, 2010, because there was insufficient evidence that \u201cthe defendants had any personal involvement in the alleged constitutional violations.\u201d We reversed the District Court\u2019s decision and remanded for the District Court to assess Hartmann\u2019s competence under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(c) and to determine whether counsel or a guardian ad litem should be appointed on his behalf. <em>See Powell v. Symons, </em>680 F.3d 301, 310 (3d Cir.2012). On remand, the District Court determined that Hartmann was neither incompetent, for purposes of Rule 17(c), nor entitled to the appointment of counsel. Thereafter, the District Court again granted the defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion. In appealing the District Court\u2019s latter grant of summary judgment, Hartmann seeks review of the District Court\u2019s Rule 17(c) analysis and denial of counsel.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">We review for abuse of discretion a lower court\u2019s decision to appoint counsel on behalf of a pro se civil litigant as well as its assessment of the litigant\u2019s competence, under Rule 17(c), and concomitant appointment or denial of a guardian ad litem. <em>See Powell, </em>680 F.3d at 306 (citing <em>Montgomery v. Pinchak, </em>294 F.3d 492, 498 (3d Cir.2002) (appointment of counsel); <em>Gardner ex rel. Gardner v. Parson, </em>874 F.2d 131,140 (3d Cir.1989) (Rule 17(c))).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The District Court did not abuse its discretion in finding Hartmann competent under Rule 17(c) (and therefore declining to appoint a guardian ad litem), or in declining to appoint counsel. Unlike in <em>Powell, </em>680 F.3d at 308, where we held that the trial court\u2019s failure to appoint a representative or counsel in the face of an incapacity claim \u201cso amply supported in the record\u201d constituted abuse of discretion, here we are presented with no factual basis on which Hartmann\u2019s claims may succeed. While we acknowledge it is often helpful for pro se litigants to enjoy the assistance of counsel, our case law does not command as much when such appointment would prove an exercise in futility. <em>See Tabron v. Grace, </em>6 F.3d 147, 155 (3d Cir.1993) (\u201c[Bjefore the court is justified in exercising its discretion in favor of appointment, it must first appear that the claim has some merit in fact and law.\u201d) (quoting <em>Maclin v. Freake, </em>650 F.2d 885, 887 (7th Cir.1981) (per curiam)) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">Here, the District Court proceeded to a multi-factorial evaluation of Hartmann\u2019s counsel request merely because \u201csome issues survived dismissal and discovery is complete.\u201d But our precedent demands a more rigorous threshold inquiry. A trial court contemplating appointment of a representative or counsel in a civil case must first find \u201cthat the plaintiffs claim has arguable merit <em>in fact and law.\u201d Tabron, </em>6 F.3d at 155 (emphasis added); <em>see also Powell, </em>680 F.3d at 308 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">Hartmann\u2019s claims are devoid of any factual or legal basis. In the entire course of this long-running litigation, Hartmann has cited but one factual nexus linking the defendants and the purported abridgement of Hartmann\u2019s constitutional rights: his own submission of grievances to Carroll and Pierce after the alleged occurrence of the complained-of deprivations, evidence plainly insufficient to establish a \u00a7 1983 defendant\u2019s personal involvement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Otherwise, Hartmann\u2019s claims are predicated solely on the operation of <em>respondeat superior </em>and fail to allege the defendants\u2019 \u201cpersonal involvement in the alleged wrongs,\u201d as required. <em>See Rode v. Dellarciprete, </em>845 F.2d 1195, 1207 (3d Cir.1988). Accordingly, Hartmann has failed to establish that his claims have \u201carguable merit in fact and law,\u201d without which even the most competent counsel would be hard-pressed to accomplish a non-frivolous representation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of counsel and of a guardian ad litem, and will affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary-judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b140-8\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b140-9\">. We express our appreciation to counsel Michael S. Doluisio and Karen C. Daly, of Dechert LLP, who undertook Hartmann's appellate representation pro bono, and to law student Tiantong Wen, who argued very proficiently on Hartmann's behalf.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b140-10\">. Hartmann also named as defendants the unidentified \"Director of State Public Libraries\u201d and the Delaware Center for Justice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b140-11\">. Chuks\u2019 forename is alternatively spelled \"Ihuoma\u201d in certain filings, but for consistency\u2019s sake, we adopt the spelling which appears in the case caption and each of the District Court orders at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b140-12\">. Notwithstanding Hartmann\u2019s failure to mention explicitly in his Notice of Appeal the District Court's August 2012 order finding Hartmann competent and denying counsel, we maintain jurisdiction over Hartmann's appeal. \u201cNotices of appeal, especially those filed pro se, are liberally construed, and we can exercise jurisdiction over orders not specified in a notice of appeal if \u2018(1) there is a connection between the specified and unspecified orders; (2) the intention to appeal the unspecified order is apparent; and (3) the opposing party is not prejudiced and has a full opportunity to brief the issues.' \" <em>Powell, </em>680 F.3d at 306 n. 2 (quoting <em>Sulima v. Tobyhanna Army Depot, </em>602 F.3d 177, 184 (3d Cir.2010) (quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-16\">As in <em>Powell, </em>those requirements are clearly met here. Not only did Hartmann continually address the District Court's competence finding throughout summary judgment briefing, but in its order granting summary judgment, the District Court itself referred to Hartmann\u2019s \"contention] that he is not capable and competent to do this legal case.\u201d Hartmann's requests for a mental health eval<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>uation and evidentiary hearing, made <em>after </em>the District Court\u2019s August 2012 order adjudging Hartmann competent and denying him counsel, further evince Hartmann\u2019s intent to appeal that order. Moreover, the defendants are not prejudiced by our exercise of appellate jurisdiction and have had a full opportunity to brief the issues related to the August 2012 order, especially in light of our order entered September 6, 2013, directing counsel to address \"whether the District Court abused or acted within its discretion in determining that [Hartmann] is competent under Rule 17(c) ... without holding a hearing or otherwise.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b141-12\">. As to Chuks, Hartmann has provided no evidence of personal involvement whatsoever.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b141-13\">. Insofar as our affirmance rests on grounds different. from those on which the District Court relied, we reiterate our prerogative to do so. <em>See, e.g., In re Mushroom Transp. Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>382 F.3d 325, 344 (3d Cir.2004); <em>Kabakjian v. United States, </em>267 F.3d 208, 213 (3d Cir. 2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
