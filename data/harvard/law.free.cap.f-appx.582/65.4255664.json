Nov. 7, 2012), <em>aff'g </em>No. A099 928 254 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Feb. 17, 2011). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-22\">We review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA \u201cfor the sake of completeness.\u201d <em>See Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam). The applicable standards of review are well established. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4); <em>see also Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009). We conclude that the agency erred by declining to conduct a CAT analysis based on its predicate determination that Dolma had not established her Chinese citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-23\">The agency erred in denying Dolma\u2019s application for deferral of removal under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>CAT because she \u201cha[d] not satisfactorily-established that she is a citizen of China\u201d in order to meet \u201cthe burden of proof.\u201d C.A.R. 5 (citing <em>Dhoumo v. B.I.A., </em>416 F.3d 172, 174) (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam)). Unlike in cases of asylum eligibility, \u201c[a]n applicant\u2019s nationality ... is not a threshold issue in determining eligibility for withholding of removal and CAT relief.\u201d <em>Urgen v. Holder, </em>768 F.3d 269, 273 n. 1 (2d Cir.2014); <em>cf. Dhoumo, </em>416 F.3d at 174 (holding that \u201cpetitioner\u2019s nationality, or lack of nationality, is a threshold question in determining his eligibility for asylum\u201d). The agency erred in treating it as such. Therefore, on remand, the agency must conduct an analysis of whether Dolma has established that it is more likely than not that she would be tortured in the proposed country of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">On remand, the agency is also instructed to make an explicit determination with respect to Dolma\u2019s country of nationality and citizenship. The agency ordered Dolma removed to China, and alternatively to Nepal, without first determining whether she was a citizen or national of either country. But, where, as here, an alien does not designate a country of removal, \u201can explicit determination with respect to a petitioner\u2019s country of nationality or citizenship is necessary to ensure compliance with the mandatory, consecutive removal commands of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(2).\u201d <em>Urgen, </em>768 F.3d at 273. The agency\u2019s failure to decide petitioner\u2019s country of nationality or citizenship not only violated this requirement, but also would undermine its CAT analysis where CAT relief depends on the likelihood that the applicant \u201cwould be tortured if removed to the <em>proposed country of removal.\u201d </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (emphasis added). Because neither the IJ nor the BIA resolved Dolma\u2019s country of nationality or citizenship, it is unclear whether she may be removed to China or Nepal, and by extension what country will be relevant to the agency\u2019s CAT analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED, and the case REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
