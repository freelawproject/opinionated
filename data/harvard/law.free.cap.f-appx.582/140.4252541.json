Sandoval\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), concluding that there are no meritorious issues for appeal but questioning whether the district court (1) erroneously withheld a one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>and (2) failed to adequately explain its sentence. Sandoval has filed a pro se supplemental brief arguing that the district court improperly calculated the drug weight attributable to him and that his counsel was ineffective. The Government has declined to file a response brief. Following a careful review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">We review criminal sentences for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In so doing, we \u201cmust first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error,\u201d such as improperly calculating the advisory Sentencing Guidelines range, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence. <em>Id. </em>If a sentence is procedurally reasonable, we then examine its substantive reasonableness, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Mendoza-Mendoza, </em>597 F.3d 212, 216 (4th Cir.2010). If the sentence is within the Guidelines range, we presume on appeal that the sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>United States v. Strieper, </em>666 F.3d 288, 295 (4th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">First, counsel questions the district court\u2019s decision to withhold the additional one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 3E1.1(b). We review this decision for clear error. <em>United States v. Dugger, </em>485 F.3d 236, 239 (4th Cir.2007). To merit this reduction, the defendant must establish by a preponderance of the evidence \u201cthat he has clearly recognized and affirmatively accepted personal responsibility for his criminal conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. McKenzie-Gude, </em>671 F.3d 452, 463 (4th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). A defendant who falsely denies relevant conduct acts in a manner inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. n. 1. Because the sentencing court is in the best position to evaluate a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, we afford great deference to the district court\u2019s determination. <em>Dugger, </em>485 F.3d at 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">Although Sandoval pleaded guilty, the district court determined that his testimony during sentencing that he was accountable for only one kilogram of cocaine amounted to at least falsely denying relevant conduct. Given our deference to the district court\u2019s determination, we cannot conclude that it clearly erred in denying the additional reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">Counsel next questions whether the district court adequately explained its rationale for the chosen sentence. In sentencing, the district court must consider the statutory factors and \u201cmake an individualized assessment based on the facts presented.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586. While the \u201cindividualized assessment need not be elaborate or lengthy, ... it must provide a rationale tailored to the particular case at hand and adequate to permit meaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 330 (4th Cir.2009). The district court here explained its consideration of each sentencing factor in determining Sandoval\u2019s sentence. The court balanced the serious nature of the offense and Sandoval\u2019s continued disrespect for the law with his need for education and training and the nature of his prior criminal convictions. The court considered Sandoval\u2019s motion for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>downward variance, and, while it denied the motion, it noted that the nature of his criminal history warranted a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines. We thus conclude that Sandoval\u2019s sentence is both procedurally and substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Finally, Sandoval argues that his counsel was ineffective. To prove a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show (1) \u201cthat counsel\u2019s performance was deficient,\u201d and (2) \u201cthat the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). We may address a claim of ineffective assistance on direct appeal only if the lawyer\u2019s ineffectiveness conclusively appears on the record. <em>United States v. Baldovinos, </em>434 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.2006). We have thoroughly reviewed the record and conclude that Sandoval has failed to demonstrate that ineffective assistance of counsel conclusively appears on the record. We therefore decline to address this argument on direct appeal, without prejudice to Sandoval\u2019s right to raise this issue in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. We have examined Sandoval\u2019s other pro se issue and conclude that it lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Sandoval\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Sandoval, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Sandoval requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Sandoval.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the material before this court and argument will not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
