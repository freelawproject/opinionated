He contends that his 1997 state conviction for crack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>cocaine possession was wrongly used to increase his criminal history score because the state offense was part of the federal offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The state offense could properly be treated as criminal history if the criminal conduct was \u201cnot part of the instant offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(1); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 4A1.1(a), (d), &amp; comment, (n. 4). The critical inquiry is whether the prior conduct is \u201crelevant conduct\u201d as defined by \u00a7 1B1.3 of the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Yerena-Magana, </em>478 F.3d 683, 687-88 (5th Cir.2007); <em>see United States v. Thomas, </em>973 F.2d 1152, 1158 (5th Cir.1992). Relevant conduct includes conduct that was \u201cpart of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2); <em>see United States v. Benns, </em>740 F.3d 370, 373 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">We review the district court\u2019s factual finding of relevant conduct for clear error. <em>See United States v. Wall, </em>180 F.3d 641, 644 (5th Cir.1999). \u201cA factual finding is not clearly erroneous as long as it is plausible in light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v. Rhine, </em>583 F.3d 878, 885 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Although Alfred\u2019s state offense occurred within the alleged dates of the federal conspiracy, the state offense was not relevant conduct because it occurred prior to Alfred\u2019s <em>actual participation </em>in the federal conspiracy. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.3, comment. (n. 2(B)) (\u201cA defendant\u2019s relevant conduct does not include the conduct of members of a conspiracy prior to the defendant\u2019s joining the conspiracy, even if the defendant knows of that conduct.\u201d). In addition, the state offense involved an accomplice who was not part of the federal conspiracy, and the state offense involved crack cocaine while Alfred\u2019s federal sentence was based only on powder cocaine. The district court\u2019s finding that the state offense was not part of the federal offense was at least plausible and thus not clearly erroneous. <em>See Rhine, </em>583 F.3d at 885; <em>Wall, </em>180 F.3d at 644-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b552-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
