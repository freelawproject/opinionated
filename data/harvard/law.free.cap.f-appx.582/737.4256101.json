We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Toguchi v. Chung, </em>391 F.3d 1051, 1056 (9th Cir.2004), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>The district court properly granted summary judgment on Hamilton\u2019s claims against defendants Rhoads and Chu because Hamilton failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether they consciously disregarded a serious risk to his health by trying to manage his degenerative disc disease and chronic pain due to spinal injuries, instead of transferring him to a medical facility. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 845, 847, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (a prison official acts with deliberate indifference if \u201che knows that inmates face a substantial risk of serious harm and disregards that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it\u201d); <em>Toguchi, </em>391 F.3d at 1058 (prisoner\u2019s difference of opinion with physician regarding course of treatment is not sufficient; rather, to show deliberate indifference, prisoner must establish that the chosen course of treatment \u201cwas medically unacceptable under the circumstances\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 249-50, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) (party opposing summary judgment may not rest on conclusory assertions, but must come forward with significantly probative evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Hamilton\u2019s claims against defendants Larico and Shytle because Hamilton failed to raise a triable dispute as to whether they had any personal knowledge of or involvement in the alleged constitutional violation. <em>See Starr v. Baca, </em>652 F.3d 1202, 1207 (9th Cir.2011) (\u201c[A] plaintiff may state a claim against a supervisor for deliberate indifference based upon the supervisor\u2019s knowledge of and acquiescence in unconstitutional conduct by his or her subordinates.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Hamilton\u2019s contentions that the district court allegedly failed to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the moving party and made improper credibility determinations are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b765-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
