Because the MSPB correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction over Ms. Havrilla\u2019s appeal, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-26\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b909-27\">' Ms. Havrilla filed an application with OPM requesting that it convert her early retirement from her position at the U.S. Department of Justice into a disability retirement. OPM issued its initial decision informing Ms. Havrilla that her application for disability retirement was incomplete and lacked the necessary medical evidence and required supporting documentation for OPM to make a determination on her claim. OPM noted the missing forms in its decision and enclosed copies of the missing forms for Ms. Havrilla to complete. Ms. Havrilla requested reconsideration of OPM\u2019s initial decision and indicated that she would send additional information about her disability and requested an additional thirty calendar days to do so. Despite affording Ms. Havrilla additional time to submit the necessary medical and administrative documentation, OPM claimed that it did not receive any additional evidence required to process the disability application. OPM issued its reconsideration decision sustaining its original decision and dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>missing Ms. Havrilla\u2019s disability retirement application.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Ms. Havrilla timely appealed OPM\u2019s decision to the MSPB. In her appeal Ms. Havrilla alleged that she sent OPM additional documentation to support her application for disability retirement. Shortly after Ms. Havrilla filed her appeal, OPM decided to rescind its reconsideration decision and grant Ms. Havrilla disability benefits and thus filed a motion before the MSPB requesting that it dismiss Ms. Havrilla\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. According to OPM, it reviewed all the medical evidence Ms. Havrilla submitted and determined that she submitted sufficient documentation to establish her entitlement to disability retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">The administrative judge (AJ) issued an Initial Decision granting OPM\u2019s motion and dismissing Ms. Havrilla\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The AJ determined that OPM\u2019s rescission of its reconsideration decision divested the MSPB of jurisdiction over the appeal. The Initial Decision became the MSPB\u2019s Final Decision because a petition for review was not filed in the matter. Ms. Havrilla appeals. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">Whether the MSPB has jurisdiction to adjudicate an appeal is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. Forest v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>47 F.3d 409, 410 (Fed.Cir. 1995). The appellant bears the burden of establishing the MSPB\u2019s jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Kahn v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>528 F.3d 1336, 1341 (Fed. Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">We find that the MSPB properly dismissed Ms. Havrilla\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The MSPB\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to those matters over which it has been specifically granted jurisdiction by a law, rule, or regulation. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(a); <em>Prewitt v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>133 F.3d 885, 886 (Fed.Cir.1998). A final decision of OPM \u201caffecting the rights or interests of an individual or of the United States\u201d is a jurisdictional prerequisite to a MSPB appeal involving a claim under the civil service retirement statutes. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8347(d), 8461(e); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 831.110, 841.308. Absent an OPM final or reconsideration decision, the MSPB lacks jurisdiction to review an appellant\u2019s retirement claims. As such, where the OPM has rescinded its decision, as it did in this case, the rescission divests the MSPB of its jurisdiction. <em>See, e.g., Keira v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>396 Fed.Appx. 703, 704 (Fed.Cir.2010). While there is a recognized exception to this rule, it only applies in cases where it is evident that OPM does not intend to issue another final decision. <em>See id. </em>at 704-05. Ms. Havrilla\u2019s appeal is not such a case. Here, OPM indicated that upon receipt of the Initial Decision, it would \u201cforward the case file to the appropriate office to determine the monetary benefit payable.\u201d J.A. 20. While OPM has not yet processed Mr. Havrilla\u2019s disability benefits, we do not find that OPM\u2019s delay in granting those benefits suggests that OPM does not intend to grant them. Under these circumstances, the MSPB properly dismissed Ms. Havrilla\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-11\">Ms. Havrilla argues that the MSPB erred by dismissing her appeal for lack of jurisdiction without deciding whether OPM should be required to waive her obligation to repay a separation incentive that she received upon her early retirement. We disagree. At the time of Ms. Havrilla\u2019s appeal to the MSPB, OPM had made no determination regarding waiver of her separation incentive. As such, there was no final decision from OPM regarding waiver of the separation incentive and thus the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>MSPB did not have jurisdiction over this question. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8347(d), 8461(e); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 831.110, 841.308. The sole issue before the MSPB was whether OPM improperly denied Ms. Havrilla\u2019s application for disability retirement benefits and, as a result, the MSPB was divested of its jurisdiction when OPM rescinded its decision to deny Ms. Havrilla\u2019s application for those benefits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">Because the MSPB correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction over Ms. Havrilla\u2019s appeal, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b911-18\">. Ms. Havrilla also contends that she never received OPM\u2019s motion to dismiss her appeal despite the certificate of service showing it was mailed to her; and therefore, never had an opportunity to respond. This does not change our analysis. Even if Ms. Havrilla never received OPM's motion, she was not harmed by this error in service. OPM rescinded its reconsideration decision, and any opposition by Ms. Havrilla would not have changed the fact that the Board no longer had jurisdiction over her appeal. <em>Keira, </em>396 Fed.Appx. at 704.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
