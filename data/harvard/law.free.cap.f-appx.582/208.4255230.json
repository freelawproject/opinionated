We have reviewed the administrative record and the Board\u2019s order and find no abuse of discretion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2014). We accordingly deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In re: Gao </em>(BIA Sept. 30, 2013). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-15\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
