After careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b816-12\">A. Byrd\u2019s Employment at Old National Station, May 2004 to March 2005</p>\n<p id=\"b816-13\">From May 2004 until March 16, 2005, Plaintiff Byrd worked at the U.S. Postal Service\u2019s (\u201cUSPS\u201d) Old National Station (\u201cOld National\u201d) as a Sales Service and Distribution Clerk. As set forth more fully later, during this ten-month period, Plaintiff Byrd claims that a female coworker religiously harassed Byrd by speaking with her about various religious matters, including the Bible, God, and church. Byrd also claims that some of her male co-workers harassed her based on her sex by referring to her using terms such as \u201cbaby\u201d and \u201csugar.\u201d After Byrd posted a note asking that she be referred to by her name, Byrd became the butt of her co-workers\u2019 teasing.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-20\">B. Byrd\u2019s Disability Leave</p>\n<p id=\"b816-21\">On March 16, 2005, Byrd went on leave with pay due to, among other things, high blood pressure and anxiety. In August 2005, the Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Worker\u2019s Compensation Programs (\u201cOWCP\u201d) approved Byrd\u2019s claim for disability benefits based on her diagnosis of major depressive disorder. On January 24, 2007, the OWCP suspended Byrd\u2019s benefits for her failure to report to three medical examination appointments, as directed by the OWCP.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-22\">On March 7, 2007, Robin Watson, Byrd\u2019s supervisor at Old National, sent a letter to Byrd directing her to return to duty on her next scheduled workday or to provide Watson with acceptable documentation in compliance with the USPS policy for her absence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Watson sent the letter because Byrd had been absent from work since January 2007, when OWCP suspended her benefits, and Byrd had not informed USPS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>of the reason for her continued failure to appear for work. Watson\u2019s letter informed Byrd that her failure to comply would result in her absence being charged to absence without official leave and removal from USPS.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">C. Byrd\u2019s Termination</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">On March 26, 2007, Watson sent another letter to Byrd, instructing her to report to Old National on April 10 for an investigative interview about her inability to work, but Byrd failed to appear for the interview. Accordingly, on May 10, 2007, Watson issued a notice, informing Byrd that she would be separated from USPS effective June 15, 2007, based on (1) her continuous absence from work and (2) her failure to provide information as to why she was not at work or cooperate with Watson\u2019s attempts to obtain that information. Despite the May 2007 notice of separation, USPS did not formally terminate Byrd\u2019s employment until July 17, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">D. Byrd\u2019s Lawsuit</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">On January 21, 2011, Byrd brought this lawsuit against the Postmaster in the district court. Byrd raised state law tort claims and hostile work environment claims based on religious and sexual harassment under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">Upon the Postmaster\u2019s motion, the district court dismissed Byrd\u2019s state law tort claims because they sought redress for discrimination in her federal employment, and the exclusive remedy for such discrimination was Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">In July 2012, the district court consolidated Byrd\u2019s case with another lawsuit she filed, raising a disability discrimination claim under the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, based on the termination of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-13\">The Postmaster moved for summary judgment as to Byrd\u2019s remaining claims of disability discrimination and hostile work environment. After extensive discovery, the district court granted the Postmaster\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-14\">Byrd timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-15\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b817-16\">At the outset, several of Byrd\u2019s claims wholly lack merit and warrant little discussion. First, the district court did not err in dismissing Byrd\u2019s tort claims, whether arising under state law or the Federal Tort Claims Act, because Title VII provides the exclusive remedy for Byrd\u2019s discrimination claims arising out of federal employment. <em>See Mays v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>122 F.3d, 43, 45 n. 2 (11th Cir.1997) (citing <em>Brown v. Gen. Servs. Admin., </em>425 U.S. 820, 835, 96 S.Ct. 1961, 1969, 48 L.Ed.2d 402 (1976)). Second, the district court also did not err in dismissing Byrd\u2019s claim under \u201c5 U.S.C. \u00a7 81\u201d because, as noted by the district court, no such statute exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-17\">Third, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment on Byrd\u2019s Rehabilitation Act claim because, even assuming Byrd made out a prima facie case of disability discrimination, she did not rebut the Postmaster\u2019s proffered reasons for issuing the May 2007 separation notice \u2014 that Byrd (1) had not been at work since the OWCP suspended her benefits on January 24, 2007 and (2) had failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>provide information as to why she was not at work or cooperate with Supervisor Watson\u2019s attempts to obtain that information. <em>See Cleveland v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., </em>369 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir.2004) (discussing the plaintiffs ultimate burden of showing that the employer\u2019s proffered reasons for the adverse employment decision was a pretext for disability discrimination under the American with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d)); <em>see also Sutton v. Lader, </em>185 F.3d 1203, 1207 n. 5 (11th Cir.1999) (stating that \u201cthe standard for determining liability under the Rehabilitation Act is the same as that under the ADA\u201d). Indeed, Byrd concedes that USPS did not issue the notice because of any disability, but rather discharged her based on her failure to provide a medical justification for her absence and as a disciplinary action for failing to comply with Supervisor Watson\u2019s directives.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Fourth, Byrd raises numerous arguments regarding the district court\u2019s management of Byrd\u2019s case during discovery and prior to summary judgment, but has not shown reversible error with respect to any of these issues. The record also does not support Byrd\u2019s contention that the district court was biased against her as a <em>pro se </em>litigant.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Byrd\u2019s hostile work environment claims, however, warrant a fuller discussion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We first review the principles governing hostile work environment claims and then address Byrd\u2019s arguments claims of religious and sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">A. Hostile Work Environment Legal Principles</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">A Title VII hostile work environment claim is established upon proof that \u201cthe workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult, that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim\u2019s employment and create an abusive working environment.\u201d <em>Gowski v. Peake, </em>682 F.3d 1299, 1311 (11th Cir.2012) (quotation marks omitted). The plaintiff must show that: (1) she belongs to a protected group; (2) she has been subjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment was based on a protected characteristic, such as religion or sex; (4) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of employment and create a discriminatorily abusive working environment; and (5) the employer is responsible for such an environment. <em>See Reeves v. C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc., </em>594 F.3d 798, 808 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc); <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">It is a \u201cbedrock principle that not all objectionable conduct or language amounts to discrimination under Title VII.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 809. Therefore, only conduct that is \u201cbased on\u201d a protected category, such as religion or gender, may be considered in a hostile work environment analysis. <em>Gupta v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, </em>212 F.3d 571, 583-84 (11th Cir.2000), <em>overruled on other grounds by Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006). As we have stated, \u201c[ijnnocuous statements or conduct, or boorish ones\u201d unrelated to a protected ground are not counted. <em>Id. </em>at 583. Title VII does not enact a \u201cgeneral civility code\u201d and does not make actionable ordinary workplace tribulations. <em>Cotton v. Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc., </em>434 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>1227, 1284 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">The fourth element of the hostile work environment test \u2014 whether the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive \u2014 contains both a subjective and objective component. <em>Reeves, </em>594 F.3d at 809. The employee must \u201csubjectively perceive\u201d the harassment as severe or pervasive enough to change the terms or conditions of' employment, and this perception must be objectively reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 808-09 (quotation marks omitted). In evaluating the objective component, we consider the allegedly discriminatory conduct\u2019s \u201cfrequency; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee\u2019s work performance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and ellipses omitted). The harassment\u2019s objective severity or pervasiveness \u201cshould be judged from the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiffs position, considering all the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 809 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">B. Religious Harassment Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">Byrd\u2019s religiously-based hostile work environment claim is based on the conduct of one of Byrd\u2019s former co-workers, Kay Dexter, who is a fervent Christian.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While at work, Dexter sung religious songs, quoted religious scripture, and preached. Dexter often spoke to her co-workers about the Bible. As Byrd acknowledges, Old National allowed Dexter to engage in this behavior before Byrd began working at Old National, and Dexter\u2019s \u201cstandard topic of conversation\u201d with anyone at Old National was religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">Dexter also conversed with Byrd about religion, asking how often Byrd went to church and whether she read the Bible. Byrd told Dexter that Byrd was \u201cnondenominational\u201d and that her \u201creligious beliefs allow [her] to let everyone practice what they choose to practice.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Over a six-month period, from October 2004 until Byrd went on leave, Dexter referred to Byrd as the devil and Satan an unspecified number of times. On one occasion, Dexter told Byrd she would go to Hell because he did not believe in Jesus.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-13\">We assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that Dexter\u2019s complained \u2014 of conduct was based on the protected category of religion. Nevertheless, we conclude that Dexter\u2019s conduct \u2014 consisting of Dexter\u2019s (1) singing of religious songs, quoting religious scripture, preaching, and speaking about Church and the Bible; (2) referring to Byrd as the devil and Satan an unspecified number of times over a six-month period; and (3) informing Byrd that she would go to Hell for not believing in Jesus on one occasion \u2014 did not create a hostile work environment. Even considering these incidents cumulatively, a jury could not reasonably find that this conduct was sufficiently severe and pervasive to be objectively hostile and abusive, and thus, this conduct does not satisfy the fourth element of a hostile work environment claim. Accordingly, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment on Byrd\u2019s religiously-based hostile work environment claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>C. Sexual Harassment Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Byrd claims that she was subject to a hostile work environment based on her coworkers\u2019 use of terms of endearment and then teasing her after she asked them to stop using such terms. Over a six-month period, different male co-workers referred to Byrd using terms such as \u201cbaby, sugar, darling, honey,\u201d \u201cshorty or shawty,\u201d \u201cmy dawg,\u201d and \u201cmy nigger\u201d when they asked her out on dates on unspecified occasions. In both her affidavit and deposition, she referred to these names as \u201cterms of endearment.\u201d During this same period, two different male coworkers also touched her arm, held her hand, and rubbed her fingers an unspecified number of times when they came to pick up mail from her.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">As a result, Byrd wrote and posted a note in her work area stating that she did not wish to be addressed by those terms or touched. Instead, Byrd wished to be referred to as \u201cMs. Michelle Byrd.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After she posted the note, her male and female co-workers began to \u201cmake jokes in [Byrd\u2019s] presence\u201d about the note and \u201chug and kiss and rub and grind and do all of those things\u201d to mock Byrd. Byrd\u2019s coworkers would use terms like \u201cBaby\u201d in her presence, and once, she heard a male employee refer to another male employee as \u201cred dog sugar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">After Byrd complained, in October 2004, an Old National supervisor held a meeting on, and played a film about, sexual harassment. Afterward, the touching of Byrd \u201cbasically ended\u201d and Byrd\u2019s male coworkers stopped asking her out on dates. However, Byrd\u2019s co-workers continued to \u201cteas[e]\u201d Byrd for writing the \u201cterms of endearment\u201d note by \u201cmaking jokes about being addressed a certain way or hugging\u201d in front of Byrd.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">Byrd also complained that her co-workers generally engaged in hostile conduct towards her, as demonstrated by the following incidents: (1) a female employee screaming and slinging mail at Byrd and not allowing Byrd to use the employee\u2019s pen; (2) another female employee withholding mail from Byrd and screaming at Byrd about the handling of mail; (3) a male employee attempting to humiliate Byrd with his \u201csmart remarks\u201d concerning her work; (4) a male employee, named Dexter Brown, writing \u201cbid out Brown please\u201d on Byrd\u2019s \u201cterms of endearment\u201d note; and (5) unnamed employees asking Byrd to process the mail in a way that violated postal procedure and that could have resulted in Byrd being disciplined or terminated. Byrd also complained of (1) employees repeating a movie line about calling the \u201cpo-po\u201d and not being afraid of the \u201cpo-po,\u201d which the movie character said while carrying a gun, and (2) a fellow employee stating that it was \u201ctime for a killing\u201d since it was \u201cgetting close to Memorial Day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b820-10\">Most of the complained-of harassment was not based on Byrd\u2019s sex and, thus, does not satisfy the third element of a hostile work environment claim. As Byrd admits, her male and female coworkers used \u201cterms of endearment\u201d to refer to each other and hugged and touched one another in front of Byrd because she was the \u201cthe running joke\u201d and was \u201cbeing mocked.\u201d <em>See Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 U.S. 775, 788, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 2283, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998) (stating that \u201c \u2018simple teasing,\u2019 offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious)\u201d will not amount to a hostile work environment (citation omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>ted)). Much of the harsh treatment Byrd received in the course of processing mail was due to her co-workers\u2019 personal animosity towards her, not because of her sex. <em>See also Succar v. Dade Cnty. School Bd., </em>229 F.3d 1343, 1345 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201cTitle VII prohibits discrimination; it is not a shield against harsh treatment at the work place. Personal animosity is not the equivalent of sex discrimination. The plaintiff cannot turn a personal feud into a sex discrimination case.\u201d (quotation marks and ellipses omitted)). While much of Byrd\u2019s co-workers\u2019 behavior was boorish, unprofessional, and unfriendly, it was not harassment based on Byrd\u2019s sex. <em>See Gupta, </em>212 F.3d at 583.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The pre-October 2004 conduct by several of Byrd\u2019s male co-workers, however, even if based on Byrd\u2019s sex, was not sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to alter the conditions of Bryd\u2019s employment and create an abusive working environment. This conduct consisted of: (1) male co-workers asking her out on dates and using \u201cterms of endearment\u201d to refer to her; and (2) two male co-workers touching her on the arm and hand. This conduct occurred for a period of six months at an unspecified frequency and stopped after Old National showed a video on sexual harassment. The different terms by which male employees called Byrd were not severe, humiliating, or physically threatening, as Byrd herself admitted that they were \u201cterms of endearment.\u201d Furthermore, the evidence does not show that this conduct unreasonably interfered with her work performance. Considering all of the circumstances, we conclude that a jury could not reasonably find that the conduct of these male co-workers was sufficiently severe and pervasive to be objectively hostile and abusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Byrd\u2019s state law tort claims and grant of summary judgment in favor of the Postmaster on Byrd\u2019s disability discrimination and hostile work environment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-14\">. On March 23, 2007, Dr. Monique Gray, Byrd\u2019s psychologist, sent a letter to Watson stating that Byrd continued to be under Dr. Gray's care for an unspecified condition, that Byrd had been unable to return to work since March 17, 2005, and that Byrd had \u201cnever been released to return to duty.\u201d The letter provided no additional details. Byrd does not argue that this letter constituted acceptable documentation under the USPS policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b817-11\">. Byrd\u2019s complaint also asserted several other claims, including a retaliation claim against the Postmaster and state and federal claims against Tammie J. Philbrick and Christopher Benosky. Byrd has abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s disposition of these claims by not raising them in her initial brief on appeal. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (providing that issues that a <em>pro se </em>appellant failed to raise in his initial brief are abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b818-8\">.
