His conviction was affirmed on direct appeal in September 2013. In March 2014, Montelongo moved pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1867 and 1868 to inspect grand and petit jury selection records. The district court denied the motion, and Montelongo now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">According to Montelongo, \u00a7 1867(f) and \u00a7 1868 afford him the right to inspect the jury selection records, and the district court thus erred in denying his motion. He contends that he must inspect those records to determine whether he can find support for a potential claim that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to move to dismiss his indictment because the grand jury was biased or prejudiced. According to Montelongo, Mexicans were not fairly represented in his jury pool.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">The court affirms the district court\u2019s denial of Montelongo\u2019s motion under \u00a7 1867(f) because it was filed almost six months after Montelongo\u2019s conviction was affirmed on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Hawkins, </em>566 F.2d 1006, 1013-14 (5th Cir.1978). The relief Montelongo seeks is not appropriately brought in a posttrial motion. <em>See id. </em>at 1013-14 &amp; n. 13. Moreover, \u00a7 1867 will not serve \u201cas a \u2018fishing expedition\u2019 ... to uncover possible grounds for additional claims.\u201d <em>United States v. Bearden, </em>659 F.2d 590, 597 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-14\">The court also affirms the district court\u2019s denial of Montelongo\u2019s motion under \u00a7 1868. Montelongo moved the court for <em>copies </em>of jury records and papers. <em>See </em>R. 314 (stating that Montelongo \u201c[sought] to inspect a copy of the master jury selection wheel and records\u201d). The district court explained that while defendant had a right to inspect jury records and papers under \u00a7 1868, the statute \u201cincludes no provision for copying those materials.\u201d Thus the court held that \u201c[u]nless defendant is able physically to appear at the place where the records and papers are maintained in order to inspect them, section 1868 affords him no relief.\u201d The district court\u2019s order was correct because \u00a7 1868 merely requires a court clerk to make jury records and papers available to the public and does not impose a duty on the court, a court clerk, or any other public official to copy and distribute such documents. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1868; <em>cf. id. </em>\u00a7 1867(f) (providing that parties filing specified motion \u201cshall be allowed to inspect, reproduce, and copy [jury] records or papers\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-15\">In his motion for reconsideration, Montelongo asked the court under \u00a7 1868 to permit a family member to inspect the jury records and papers or to pay for copies. The court denied Montelongo\u2019s motion without specifically addressing this request. The court did not err in denying the motion for reconsideration because Montelongo\u2019s representatives, as members of the \u201cpublic,\u201d do not need a court order to inspect jury records and papers so long as they do so \u201cfor the purpose of determin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>ing the validity of the selection of any jury.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1868.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">In the event a court clerk denies a request by Montelongo\u2019s family member to inspect jury records and papers for the purpose specified in \u00a7 1868, this opinion does not prevent that family member from petitioning the district court to inspect the records under \u00a7 1868. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>243 F.Supp.2d 868, 872 &amp; n. 3 (C.D.Ill.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b433-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
