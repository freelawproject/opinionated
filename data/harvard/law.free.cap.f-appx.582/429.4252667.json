California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Trevino has filed a response. The record is not sufficiently developed to allow us to make a fair evaluation of Trevino\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel; we therefore decline to consider the claim without prejudice to its being raised on collateral review. <em>See United States v. Isgar, </em>739 F.3d 829, 841 (5th Cir.2014), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(June 4, 2014) (No. 13-10484). Trevino\u2019s motion to withdraw a previously filed brief and to substitute a brief is construed as a motion to file a supplemental response to counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>motion, and it is GRANTED. To the extent that Trevino requests leave to proceed pro se, the request is DENIED as untimely. <em>See United States v. Wagner, </em>158 F.3d 901, 902-03 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Trevino\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b458-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
