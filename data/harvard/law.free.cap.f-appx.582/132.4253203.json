For the foregoing reasons, we will deny the petition for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-30\">In January 2013, Rouse filed a complaint in the District Court, seeking to relitigate several employment discrimination cases that he had brought in Pennsylvania state court against his former employer, II-VI Incorporated. The District Court granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss, and subsequently denied Rouse\u2019s timely motion for reconsideration and his motion for the recusal of Judge Schwab. Rouse then filed in this Court a document which was treated as both a mandamus petition and as an appeal. We denied the mandamus petition because Rouse did not provide any reason to question Judge Schwab\u2019s impartiality, and we summarily affirmed the District Court\u2019s judgment, agreeing that Rouse\u2019s claims were foreclosed by claim and issue preclusion, prohibited by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, barred by judicial immunity, or untimely under the applicable statute of limitations. <em>In re Rouse, </em>C.A. No. 18-4233 (order entered June 10, 2014). In July and August 2014, Rouse filed motions seeking to reopen the District Court proceedings. The District Court denied those motions. Meanwhile, Rouse filed the present mandamus petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy. <em>See In re Diet Drugs Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>418 F.3d 372, 378 (3d Cir.2005). To obtain mandamus relief, a petitioner must show that \u201c(1) no other adequate means exist to attain the relief he desires, (2) the party\u2019s right to issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable, and (3) the writ is appropriate under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Hollingsworth v. Perry, </em>558 U.S. 183, 190, 130 S.Ct. 705, 175 L.Ed.2d 657 (2010) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Cheney v. United States Dist. Court for D.C., </em>542 U.S. 367, 380-81, 124 S.Ct. 2576, 159 L.Ed.2d 459 (2004)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Mandamus is available \u201cto confine an inferior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or to compel it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to do so.\u201d <em>Roche v. Evaporated Milk Ass\u2019n., </em>319 U.S. 21, 26, 63 S.Ct. 938, 87 L.Ed. 1185 (1943). Accordingly, our mandamus authority includes the power to order a District Court to recuse in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455. <em>See In re Antar, </em>71 F.3d 97, 101 (3d Cir.1995); <em>see also Alexander v. Primerica Holdings, Inc., </em>10 F.3d 155, 163 (3d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Under \u00a7 455(a), \u201cany justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d Because the purpose of this provision is \u201cto promote public confidence in the integrity of the judicial process,\u201d it is not necessary for Rouse to show that Judge Schwab was actually biased. <em>See Clemmons v. Wolfe, </em>377 F.3d 322, 325 (3d Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., </em>486 U.S. 847, 860, 108 S.Ct. 2194, 100 L.Ed.2d 855 (1988)). The test for recusal under \u00a7 455(a) is whether a reasonable person who is aware of all of the facts might reasonably question a judge\u2019s impartiality. <em>In re Kensington Int\u2019l Ltd., </em>368 F.3d 289, 302 (3d Cir.2004). Adverse rulings alone generally do not constitute a sufficient basis for holding that a judge\u2019s impartiality is in doubt. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Rouse argues that Judge Schwab \u201cusurpfed] ... judicial power,\u201d displayed a \u201cpre-conceived deep-seated ... antago<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>nism\u201d towards his claims, and \u201cteamed up with [the Magistrate Judge] and decided how they were going to rig this action against\u201d him. In support of these assertions, Rouse relies only on adverse rulings made by Judge Schwab.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For instance, Rouse alleges that Judge Schwab \u201csignalled] preferential treatment to the Defendants and deep seated bias and prejudice against Plaintiff\u2019 by \u201cprematurely]\u201d granting the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He also contends that \u201cJudge Schwab has time and time again admitted on the record that the rationale for dismissal of Petitioner\u2019s Complaint does not emanate from anything pleaded but, instead, from undefined \u2018threshold issues\u2019 not related to Plaintiffs averments.\u201d Rouse further asserts that Judge Schwab, because of \u201cclear bias and prejudice!,] \u25a0 \u2022 \u2022 failed to apply, follow and render [a] decision according to established rules of court and controlling precedent.\u201d Because these allegations pertain solely to Rouse\u2019s \u201cdispleasure with legal rulings,\u201d they fail to set forth a reasonable basis for questioning Judge Schwab\u2019s impartiality. <em>Securacomm Consulting, Inc. v. Securacom Inc., </em>224 F.3d 273, 278 (3d Cir.2000). Accordingly, we will deny the mandamus petition. As noted above in footnote 1, we deny Rouse\u2019s \u201cMotion for Clarification.\u201d We also deny his Motion for \u201cextension of time to file a notice of appeal or ... a Stay pending clarification ... and disposition by a merit panel.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b160-31\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b161-6\">. Rouse has filed a \"Motion for Clarification\u201d whether his \"submission is better suited as a mandamus petition or as an appeal.\u201d To the extent that Rouse seeks to have his mandamus petition treated as a notice of appeal, we deny the \u201cMotion for Clarification.\u201d See <em>Madden v. Myers, </em>102 F.3d 74, 79 (3d Cir. 1996) (holding that mandamus is not a substitute for an appeal). We note that Rouse has recently filed an appeal from the District Court orders denying his attempts to reopen the case. <em>Rouse v. II-VI Inc., </em>C.A. No. 14-4038. Therefore, we will not address the arguments raised in Rouse's mandamus petition which challenge those District Court rulings which are the subject of that appeal. The respondents' motion for summary affirmance is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b162-5\">. To the extent that these allegations are identical to those rejected in Rouse's prior mandamus petition, we may not consider them. <em>See In re City of Philadelphia Litig., </em>158 F.3d 711, 718 (3d Cir.1998) (stating that the law of the case doctrine precludes review of those legal issues that the Court in a prior appeal actually decided).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b162-17\">. In particular, Rouse complains that Judge Schwab sought to \u201cspare the Defendants from embarrassment\u201d by entering a dispositive order before the expiration of the defendants' time to respond to Rouse\u2019s objections to the Magistrate Judge' Report and Recommendation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
