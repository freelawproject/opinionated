(\u201cSprint\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s opinion and order denying its motion to vacate the Arbitrator\u2019s Partial Final Award pursuant to \u00a7 10(a)(4) of the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We presume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-23\">We affirm substantially for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s careful opinion. Contrary to Sprint\u2019s argument on appeal, the Arbitrator did not exceed her authority by making any ruling as to \u201cwhat actions Emilio can or cannot take in a judicial forum.\u201d Sprint Br. 3. As we have already decided, the parties \u201cclearly and unmistakably\u201d committed gateway questions of arbitrability to the Arbitrator. <em>Emilio v. Sprint Spectrum L.P., </em>508 Fed.Appx. 3, 5-6 (2d Cir.2013). The Arbitrator simply ruled that Sprint could not be compelled to proceed with class arbitration under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Stolt-Nielsen S.A. v. AnimalFeeds Int\u2019l Corp., </em>559 U.S. 662, 130 S.Ct. 1758, 176 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>L.Ed.2d 605 (2010), and Emilio could not be compelled to proceed with bilateral arbitration under Kansas law, which the arbitration agreement stated would govern. The Arbitrator did nothing more than construe the parties\u2019 contract in order to decide the questions of arbitrability that the parties submitted to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Whether or not we agree with the Arbitrator\u2019s construction of the contract or of the Kansas law by which it is governed, the parties bargained for the Arbitrator\u2019s construction, not ours. \u201cOnly if the arbitrator acts outside the scope of h[er] contractually delegated authority \u2014 issuing an award that simply reflects h[er] own notions of economic justice rather than drawing its essence from the contract \u2014 may a court overturn h[er] determination.\u201d <em>Oxford Health Plans LLC v. Sutter, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2064, 2068, 186 L.Ed.2d 113 (2013) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). Sprint argues that the Arbitrator\u2019s conclusion that, in effect, the dispute is not arbitrable, either as a class or individual action, <em>must </em>come from outside the contract because the contract provides for arbitration. Despite its superficial appeal, that argument is nothing more than a disagreement with the Arbitrator\u2019s analysis. Correct or not, that analysis proceeds entirely from within the terms of the agreement and the law chosen by the parties to govern it. \u201cIf the arbitrator has provided even a barely colorable justification for his or her interpretation of the contract, the award must stand.\u201d <em>Westerbeke Corp. v. Daihatsu Motor Co., </em>304 F.3d 200, 222 (2d Cir.2002). To say the very least, that minimal standard is met here.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">Nor do we find that the Arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law. To find a manifest disregard of law under our precedents,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a court must consider \u201cfirst, whether the governing law alleged to have been ignored by the arbitrator[ ] was well defined, explicit, and clearly applicable, and, second, whether the arbitrator knew about the existence of a clearly governing legal principle but decided to ignore it or pay no attention to it.\u201d <em>Jock v. Sterling Jewelers Inc., </em>646 F.3d 113, 121 n. 1 (2d Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). Sprint\u2019s reliance on <em>AT &amp; T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 1740, 179 L.Ed.2d 742 (2011), decided <em>after </em>the Partial Final Award, is self-defeating: the Arbitrator could not have ignored governing law that did not yet exist when she issued her decision. The district court ably addressed Sprint\u2019s alternative arguments that the Arbitrator manifestly disregarded pr <em>e-Concepcion </em>law and misconstrued the Kansas Consumer Protection Act. The Arbitrator\u2019s rulings, even if incorrect, were not so \u201c \u2018beyond and different from mere error in the law\u2019 \u201d as to constitute a manifest disregard of clearly applicable, controlling law. <em>Jock, </em>646 F.3d at 121 n. 1, quoting <em>Westerbeke, </em>304 F.3d at 208.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>We have considered Sprint\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-16\">. This is our third foray into this case and Sprint's second attempt to have us intervene in the arbitration. <em>See Emilio v. Sprint Spectrum L.P., </em>508 Fed.Appx. 3 (2d Cir.2013); <em>Emilio v. Sprint Spectrum, L.P., </em>315 Fed.Appx. 322 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b92-7\">. We assume, as we have in the past, that these precedents remain good law despite the Supreme Court's reservation of whether \"manifest disregard\u201d is a valid reason to vacate an arbitration award. <em>See Schwartz v. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., </em>665 F.3d 444, 452 (2d Cir.2011); <em>Jock v. Sterling Jewelers Inc., </em>646 F.3d 113, 121 (2d Cir.2011); <em>T.Co Metals, LLC v. Dempsey Pipe &amp; Supply, Inc., </em>592 F.3d 329, 340 (2d Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b92-12\">. We need not, and therefore do not, express any view on whether a similar decision by an arbitrator today, whose attention has been called to <em>Concepcion, </em>would be defensible. We note only that <em>Concepcion </em>changes the legal landscape, and gives considerable force to the argument that the FAA\u2019s broad preemption of state laws invalidating class arbitration waivers would apply to the Kansas statute at issue here. <em>See Concepcion, </em>131 S.Ct. at 1751-53. The Arbitrator\u2019s Partial Final Award in this case issued during the interlude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>between the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Stolt-Nielsen </em>and <em>Concepcion. </em>The Arbitrator\u2019s failure to anticipate <em>Concepcion </em>cannot constitute manifest disregard of the law applicable at the time she decided the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
