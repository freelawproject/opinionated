A defendant may withdraw his plea before sentencing if he establishes \u201ca fair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal.\u201d FED. R. CRIM. P. 11(d)(2)(B). Seven factors are relevant to the determination: (1) whether the defendant asserts his innocence, (2) whether the Government will be prejudiced, (3) whether the defendant delayed filing the motion, (4) whether withdrawal will \u201csubstantially inconvenience\u201d the court, (5) whether the defendant had \u201cclose assistance\u201d of counsel, (6) whether the plea was knowing and voluntary, and (7) whether withdrawing the plea will waste judicial resources. <em>United States v. Carr, </em>740 F.2d 339, 343-44 (5th Cir.1984). We review the district court\u2019s decision for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. McKnight, </em>570 F.3d 641, 645 (5th Cir.2009). The \u201ccourt abuses its discretion if it bases its decision on an error of law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-22\">Steele challenges his guilty plea principally by relying on claims that he did not understand the plea agreement or the plea hearing, that his attorney coerced him to plead guilty, and that he is innocent. The district court rejected his testimony regarding these claims as not credible and found that the evidence of his guilt was \u201coverwhelming.\u201d The court \u201carticulated the appropriate standard\u201d under <em>Carr </em>and \u201ccarefully applied this standard to the facts.\u201d <em>United States v. Bounds, </em>943 F.2d 541, 543 (5th Cir.1991). As in <em>Bounds, </em>Steele relies on \u201cconclusory allegations that are clearly refuted by the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We find no abuse of discretion, as he has not shown that the district court denied the motion based on an error of law or a clearly erroneous factual finding. <em>See McKnight, </em>570 F.3d at 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-23\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b481-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
