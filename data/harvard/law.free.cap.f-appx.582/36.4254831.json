June 13, 2013), <em>aff'g </em>No. A087 448 209 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City July 18, 2012). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-18\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions \u201cfor the sake of completeness.\u201d <em>Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008) (quotation marks and citations omitted). The applicable standards of review are well established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-19\">Chen applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief based, in part, on his claim that he fears persecution because he has had more than one child in violation of China\u2019s population control program. For largely the same reasons as this Court set forth in <em>Jian Hui Shao, </em>546 F.3d 138, we find no error in the agency\u2019s determination that Chen failed to demonstrate his eligibility for relief on that ground. <em>See id. </em>at 158-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-20\">We also find no error in the agency\u2019s determination that Chen failed to demonstrate his eligibility for relief based on his religion. The evidence Chen submitted did not demonstrate that Chinese authori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>ties are aware of, or likely to become aware of, his religious practice. <em>See Hongsheng Leng v. Mukasey, </em>528 F.3d 135, 143 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">For the foregoing reasons, this petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
