Goodrich, who the bankruptcy court appointed as general counsel for the bankruptcy trustee. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d). We review independently the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision without deference to the district court\u2019s determinations. <em>Leichty v. Neary (In re Strand), </em>375 F.3d 854, 857 (9th Cir.2004). We review de novo the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusions of law and for clear error its factual findings. <em>Id. </em>We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">Contrary to Sui\u2019s contentions, the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction over the removed state law claims against Goodrich because they concerned the administration of the bankruptcy estate. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b) (bankruptcy courts may hear and determine \u201ccore proceedings,\u201d which includes matters concerning the administration of the estate); <em>Harris v. Wittman (In re Harris), </em>590 F.3d 730, 736-739 (9th Cir.2009) (bankruptcy court had subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate debtor\u2019s state law claim against the trustee and trustee\u2019s counsel concerning the administration of the estate).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-14\">The bankruptcy court properly determined that Goodrich was entitled to quasi-judicial immunity for the acts alleged in the complaint. <em>See In re Harris, </em>590 F.3d at 742 (bankruptcy trustees and court-approved attorneys for the trustee are entitled to broad immunity from suit for actions within the scope of their authority and pursuant to court order). Because we affirm dismissal on this ground, we do not reach the other issues that Sui raises on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-15\">Sui\u2019s motion to strike portions of Goodrich\u2019s excerpts of record is granted in part. The Clerk shall strike Exhibit 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b749-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
