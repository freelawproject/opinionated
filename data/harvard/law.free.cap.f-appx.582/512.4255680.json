City of Houston, </em>636 F.3d 183, 187 (5th Cir.2011). Summary judgment is appropriate where the \u201cmovant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). In conducting our review, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party; however, \u201cconclusional allegations, unsupported assertions, or presentation of only a scintilla of evidence\u201d are insufficient. <em>McFaul v. Valenzuela, </em>684 F.3d 564, 571 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-23\">In his brief to this court, Johnson provides only a conclusory statement that he \u201cexhausted all available means,\u201d yet he presents no argument challenging the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>termination that he did not exhaust his claim that the defendants failed to protect him from assault. Likewise, he does not challenge the determination that his retaliation claim lacked merit. Johnson thus abandons these issues by failing to adequately brief them. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">With respect to his individual-capacity claims, Johnson first argues that the defendants violated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment because he has been confined to a single-person cell for 23 hours per day, which he describes as total isolation, since August 2011. He contends that the conditions of his confinement have exacerbated his mental illnesses and caused him serious psychological and physical pain. Assuming Johnson can show a sufficiently serious deprivation, he also must show that prison officials acted with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to his health or safety. <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). <em>Farmer\u2019s </em>subjective prong requires that a prisoner demonstrate that the prison official was \u201caware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exist[ed],\u201d that the officer in fact drew such an inference, and that the officer nevertheless disregarded the risk. <em>Id. </em>at 837,114 S.Ct. 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Johnson does not point to any competent evidence that Executive Director Brad Livingston, Director Rick Thaler, or Senior Warden Richard Herrera knew of the conditions about which he complains or that they deliberately disregarded an excessive risk to human health or safety. <em>See id </em>at 837, 843, 114 S.Ct. 1970. Further, Johnson\u2019s claim regarding the conditions in administrative segregation is largely premised on the defendants\u2019 alleged use of isolation on an inmate, such as himself, with \u201cserious mental illness.\u201d However, he fails to explain how this risk was, as he claims, obvious to any of the defendants when the record demonstrates that Johnson was diagnosed only with post-traumatic stress disorder for which he was prescribed medication. The standard required to succeed on a deliberate-indifference claim is \u201cextremely high,\u201d and Johnson has not met it here. <em>See Domino v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">In Johnson\u2019s second issue, he maintains that he is \u201ctotally incapacitated\u201d in the administrative segregation unit and that prison officials violated his constitutional rights by denying him access to adequate mental health care. However, Johnson\u2019s assertions that he has been denied access to mental health care and that he suffers from chronic mental illness, severe paranoia, psychosis, and suicidal thoughts are rebutted by his mental health records. <em>Gobert v. Caldwell, </em>463 F.3d 339, 346 n. 24 (5th Cir.2006). Johnson\u2019s claim essentially amounts to a disagreement with the mental health care he has been provided. Such disagreement does not constitute deliberate indifference to his medical needs. <em>Id. </em>at 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">As to his official-capacity claims, Johnson vaguely refers to \u201cunconstitutional and unlawful policies and practices\u201d regarding his mental illnesses. He also maintains that the defendants have \u201ctacitly accepted ... a code of silence\u201d encouraging abuse on prisoners. These assertions, which are conclusory and without factual support, are insufficient to defeat summary judgment. <em>See McFaul, </em>684 F.3d at 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">Johnson also contends that the district court erred in denying his request for injunctive relief. This contention fails because he did not establish success on the merits. <em>See VRC LLC v. City of Dallas, </em>460 F.3d 607, 611 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Finally, Johnson challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for the appointment of counsel. However, no exceptional circumstances exist as he has demonstrated an ability to litigate and his case is not complex. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982). Accordingly, the denial of the motion for appointment of counsel was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Baranowski v. Hart, </em>486 F.3d 112, 126 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Johnson, defendants Livingston, Thaler, and Herrera were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a). Johnson\u2019s motion for the appointment of appellate counsel and his motion for an injunction pending appeal are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">AFFIRMED; MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b540-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
