Mr. Rayford, however, asserts that the Board\u2019s decision was mailed to an incorrect address and that he did not receive it until August 2013. The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans Court) received Mr. Rayford\u2019s notice of appeal on October 22, 2013, and on April 1, 2014, the Veterans Court dismissed his appeal as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-11\">In the interest of judicial economy, the court grants the Secretary\u2019s motion to remand for the Veterans Court to consider, in the first instance, whether the deadline for filing the notice of appeal in this case should be equitably tolled in light of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Checo v. Shinseki, </em>748 F.3d 1373 (Fed.Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-12\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b904-13\">It Is Ordered That:</p>\n<p id=\"b904-14\">(1) The motion is granted. This case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-15\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
