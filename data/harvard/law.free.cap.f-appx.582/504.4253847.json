He argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not adjust his offense level downward pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. He also argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-23\">To the extent that Lippmann-Avilez is challenging the district court\u2019s refusal to downwardly depart from the recommended guidelines range, we do not have jurisdiction to review that decision. <em>See United States v. Barrera-Saucedo, </em>385 F.3d 533, 535 (5th Cir.2004). Moreover, although Lippmann-Avilez contends that he preserved his challenge to the lack of a \u00a7 3B1.2 minor role adjustment in his \u201cMotion for Downward Departure,\u201d that argument was expressly waived during his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>sentencing hearing. <em>See United States v. Arviso-Mata, </em>442 F.3d 382, 384 (5th Cir. 2006). His argument fails, however, even under the plain error standard of review as we have previously rejected the argument that a \u00a7 3B1.2 adjustment is warranted if the defendant was a courier who was forced into transporting drugs. <em>See United States v. Silvar-De Hoyos, </em>702 F.3d 843, 846-47 (5th Cir.2012). Further, because Lippmann-Avilez\u2019s sentence was based solely upon the amount of heroin that he possessed and intended to distribute in the United States, \u00a7 3B1.2 does not require a reduction to the base offense level even though his activity in a larger conspiracy may have been minor. <em>See United States v. Atando, </em>60 F.3d 196, 198-99 (5th Cir.1995). Lippmann-Avilez has shown no error, plain or otherwise, in the calculation of his guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">With regard to substantive reasonableness, Lippmann-Avilez contends that the district court failed to adequately consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, his history and characteristics, and a sentence below the recommended guidelines range. Lippmann-Avilez has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b532-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
