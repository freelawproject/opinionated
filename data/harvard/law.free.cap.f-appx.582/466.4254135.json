In this appeal, Bohannon argues that the district court erred by denying her oral motion for judgment of acquittal, in which she argued that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>the Government had failed to prove that the stolen items had value.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal de novo. <em>United States v. Girod, </em>646 F.3d 304, 313 (5th Cir.2011); FED. R. CRIM. P. 29(a). \u201cThe jury\u2019s verdict will be affirmed if a reasonable trier of fact could conclude from the evidence that the elements of the offense were established beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Girod, </em>646 F.3d at 313 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cJuries are free to use their common sense and apply common knowledge, observation, and experience gained in the ordinary affairs of life when giving effect to the inferences that may reasonably be drawn from the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Flores-Chapa, </em>48 F.3d 156, 161 (5th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Our review of the record shows that the evidence adduced at trial was sufficient for a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that Bohannon stole a \u201cthing of value\u201d belonging to the United States government. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641. Additionally, the jurors were \u201cfree to use their common sense and apply common knowledge, observation, and experience gained in the ordinary affairs of life when\u201d to infer that the purloined medications had value. <em>See Flores-Chapa, </em>48 F.3d at 161. Bohannon\u2019s claim that her motion for judgment of acquittal should have been granted is unavailing. Equally unavailing is her argument that the district court erroneously imposed a $100 special assessment, as the amended judgment reflects a $ 25 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b494-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
