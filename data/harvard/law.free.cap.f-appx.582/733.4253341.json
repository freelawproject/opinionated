We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo both a dismissal for failure to state a claim, <em>Hebbe v. Pliler, </em>627 F.3d 338, 341 (9th Cir.2010), and a dismissal based on the doctrine of res judicata, <em>Stewart v. U.S. Bancorp, </em>297 F.3d 953, 956 (9th Cir.2002). We review for an abuse of discretion an award of attorney\u2019s fees, and review de novo the underlying legal analysis. <em>Tutor-Saliba Corp. v. City of Hailey, </em>452 F.3d 1055, 1059-60 (9th Cir.2006). We affirm as to the judgment, but reverse and remand as to the award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">In No. 12-56935, the district court properly dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claims arising from the towing of their van and the alleged falsely reported debt against Yang that arose before the state court litigation filed on March 15, 2010, because those claims were based on the same primary right asserted in prior state court actions. <em>See Manufactured Home Cmtys., Inc. v. City of San Jose, </em>420 F.3d 1022, 1031 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201cTo determine the preclusive effect of a state court judgment federal courts look to state law____ California\u2019s res judicata doctrine is based on a primary rights theory.\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>In re Estate of Dito, </em>198 Cal.App.4th 791, 130 Cal.Rptr.3d 279, 286 (2011) (\u201cUnder the doctrine of res judicata, all claims based on the same cause of action must be decided in a single suit; if not brought initially, they may not be raised at a later date.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>see also Clark v. Yosemite Cmty. Coll. Disk, </em>785 F.2d 781, 789 (9th Cir.1986) (\u201cThe doctrine of res judicata extends only to the facts and conditions as they existed at the time the judgment was rendered, and to the legal rights and relations of the parties as fixed by the facts determined in the judgment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">To the extent that plaintiffs\u2019 claim under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d) was not precluded, the district court properly dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 FCRA claim because plaintiffs cannot bring a private action under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s-2(a) and plaintiffs failed to allege facts sufficient to show that they notified a consumer reporting agency about the dispute under \u00a7 1681s-2(b). <em>See Gorman v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, LLP, </em>584 F.3d 1147, 1154 (9th Cir.2009) (under the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s-2(a) does not create a private right of action and the duties under \u00a7 1681s-2(b) arise only after the furnisher of financial information receives notice of the consumer\u2019s dispute from a credit reporting agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-13\">Plaintiffs\u2019 contentions concerning the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine and dismissal without leave to amend are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-14\">In No. 13-56181, the Magistrate Judge based the award of attorney\u2019s fees on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>fee provision in the homeowners association\u2019s Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (\u201cCC &amp; R\u2019s\u201d). That fee provision provides for attorney\u2019s fees for the prevailing party in an action initiated to enforce any provisions of the governing document. The Magistrate Judge alternatively relied on former California Civil Code \u00a7 1354(c), now codified at \u00a7 5975(c), which provides for attorney\u2019s fees for the prevailing party \u201c[i]n an action to enforce the governing documents\u201d of a common interest development. However, plaintiffs\u2019 action is not properly- construed as an action seeking to enforce the CC &amp; R\u2019s, but instead one seeking redress for alleged civil rights violations. <em>See Chee v. Amanda Goldt Prop. Mgmt., </em>143 Cal.App.4th 1360, 50 Cal.Rptr.3d 40, 56-57 (2006) (explaining that the \u201crelevant question\u201d to entitlement of fees \u201cis whether the action is to enforce the rights and obligations of the parties under ... the CC &amp; R\u2019s\u201d); <em>cf. Gil v. Mansano, </em>121 Cal.App.4th 739, 17 Cal.Rptr.3d 420, 424-25 (2004) (explaining that \u201cactions to enforce\u201d is narrow statutory language). Accordingly, the Magistrate Judge erred by awarding attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Appeal No. 12-56935: AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Appeal No. 13-56181: REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b762-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
