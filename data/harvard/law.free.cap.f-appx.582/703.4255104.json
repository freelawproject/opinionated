R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b732-9\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">Mat\u00edas Lopez-Fernandez appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment and challenges the 30-month sentence imposed following his jury-trial conviction for reentry of a removed alien, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-11\">Lopez-Fernandez contends that the district court procedurally erred at sentencing and violated his due process rights by relying on an improper factor, namely, the desire to deter other defendants from exercising their Sixth Amendment right to trial. We review for plain error, <em>see United States v. Vanderwerfhorst, </em>576 F.3d 929, 934-35 (9th Cir.2009), and find none. The record belies Lopez-Fernandez\u2019s contention that the district court sought to deter other defendants from exercising their Sixth Amendment rights, but rather reflects the court\u2019s concern with deterring false testimony. <em>See generally United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 96, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993) (\u201c[A] defendant\u2019s right to testify does not include a right to commit perjury.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-16\">Lopez-Fernandez also contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. We review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The above-Guidelines sentence is substantively reasonable in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and the totality of the circumstances, including Lopez-Fernandez\u2019s criminal history and the need for deterrence and to protect the public. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b732-17\">Finally, we decline to consider Lopez-Fernandez\u2019s argument regarding the district court\u2019s alleged bias and antagonism toward him. <em>See United States v. Kama, </em>394 F.3d 1236, 1238 (9th Cir.2005) (issues not raised in opening brief are generally waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b732-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
