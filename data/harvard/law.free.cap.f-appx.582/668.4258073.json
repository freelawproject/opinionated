We grant Prevost\u2019s motion to expand the record. For the following reasons, we conclude that the district court did not commit plain procedural error, <em>see United States v. Troyer, </em>677 F.3d 356, 358-59 (8th Cir.2012) (review for plain error when defendant did not object at sentencing), and that the sentence is substantively reasonable, <em>see United States v. Heath, </em>624 F.3d 884, 886-87 (8th Cir.2010) (abuse-of-discretion standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-28\">Prevost argues it was procedural error for the district court to vary from the Sentencing Guidelines range based on factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), before departing based on substantial assistance under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Kl.l(a)(l). Without deciding whether there was error, we conclude that Prevost has not shown prejudice because nothing in the record suggests that, but for the alleged error, his sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>would have been different. <em>See United States v. Ault, </em>598 F.3d 1039, 1042 (8th Cir.2010). We find no merit to any suggestion that the district court did not consider the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6), because the district court specifically stated it had considered this factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Prevost also contends the district court erred in determining an appropriate departure under section 5K1.1, because the court believed it was bound to defer to the government\u2019s evaluation of the quality of Prevost\u2019s assistance, and because it limited the extent of the reduction based on considerations not related to his assistance. Again, the district court\u2019s statements at sentencing show these contentions are wrong. As to Prevost\u2019s complaint that the district court considered information in an in camera letter from the government, which he did not personally see, we find no violation of Fed.R.Crim.P. 32 because Prevost\u2019s attorney received the letter. <em>See New York v. Hill, </em>528 U.S. 110, 115, 120 S.Ct. 659,145 L.Ed.2d 560 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Finally, Prevost argues that the disparity between his sentence and that of co-defendant David Harrold was unwarranted. With regard to the variances from the Guidelines range \u2014 which were identical for Prevost and Harrold \u2014 Prevost identifies no error in the district court\u2019s consideration of the section 3553(a) factors as applied to him. <em>See United States v. Borromeo, </em>657 F.3d 754, 756 (8th Cir.2011). The remaining disparity is attributable to the district court\u2019s decision as to the appropriate departure for each defendant, based on his substantial assistance, and the extent of a section 5K1.1 departure is not reviewable. <em>See United States v. Dalton, </em>478 F.3d 879, 881 (8th Cir.2007); <em>see also United States v. Womack, </em>985 F.2d 395, 400 (8th Cir.1993). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b696-20\">.
