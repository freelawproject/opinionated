The parties are familiar with the claims in dispute, which arise from changes in the control of Mboho, USA, an entity related to Mboho Nigeria. The district court dismissed Appellants\u2019 case on the basis of res judicata and Appellants\u2019 lack of standing to sue. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-20\">The court\u2019s res judicata rationale is incorrect because the Texas state court suit was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. In Texas, however, a \u201cdismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction does not preclude a party from litigating the merits of the same cause of action in a court of competent jurisdiction[.]\u201d <em>Butler v. Cont\u2019l Airlines, Inc., </em>116 S.W.3d 286, 287 (Tex. App.2003). Federal courts \u201cmust give to a state-court judgment the same preclusive effect as would be given that judgment under the law of the state in which the judgment was rendered.\u201d <em>Migra v. Warren City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., </em>465 U.S. 75, 81, 104 S.Ct. 892, 896, 79 L.Ed.2d 56 (1984). Consequently, the later federal suit was not barred by the state court\u2019s jurisdictional dismissal order.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-21\">The court\u2019s lack of standing and lack of authority rulings do not account for the evidence in the record. Mboho Nigeria, a foreign entity, is not foreclosed from suing defendants in the United States in federal court simply because it is not registered to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>do business here. Further, Appellant Ekwo is listed in Mboho Nigeria\u2019s- corporate profile as Secretary of Mboho, USA, ROA.3006, was appointed as Mboho, Nigeria\u2019s High Commissioner to USA/Canada, ROA.3440, and received a letter authorizing him to institute legal action on behalf of Mboho, Nigeria, ROA.3619. Appellees have not challenged any of these facts, nor have they challenged that Appellants Ekwo and Isong (Appellant Ekpene is apparently deceased) have authority to represent Mboho USA. The district court thus erred in rejecting Appellants\u2019 standing and authority to sue.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion, however, in denying Appellants\u2019 abusively excessive, repetitious, and burdensome discovery requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">It is not clear whether the district court also found dismissal appropriate based on its statement that Appellants\u2019 marks and logos were not registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Lack of registration does not, however, necessarily bar such claims, where a work was first published in a country, like Nigeria, that adheres to the Berne Convention. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1126 (2012); <em>Pepe (U.K.) Ltd. v. Ocean View Factory Outlet Corp., </em>770 F.Supp. 754, 761 (D.P.R.1991). Moreover, the district court failed to provide Appellants with any opportunity to respond before voicing this concern. <em>Carroll v. Fort James Corp., </em>470 F.3d 1171, 1177 (5th Cir.2006) (\u201cdistrict courts should not dismiss claims <em>sua sponte </em>without prior notice and opportunity to respond\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Finally, because we must reverse and remand, there is no ground for issuing sanctions against Appellants for a frivolous appeal, and Appellees\u2019 motion is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">The judgment of the district court is REVERSED and REMANDED for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b577-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
