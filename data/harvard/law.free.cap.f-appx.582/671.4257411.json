We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-17\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s order affirming the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u2019s\u201d) denial of Social Security benefits, and we must independently determine whether the ALJ\u2019s decision is free from legal error and supported by substantial evidence. <em>Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1279 (9th Cir.1996). \u201cIf the evidence can support either affirming or reversing the ALJ\u2019s conclusion, we may not substitute our judgment for that of the ALJ.\u201d <em>Robbins v. Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>466 F.3d 880, 882 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-21\">First, Simon contends that the ALJ erred by giving little weight to the assessments of treating physicians Drs. Hanish, Malanga, and Grout and primarily relying on the opinion of examining physician Dr. Patel. \u201cBecause treating physicians are employed to cure and thus have a greater opportunity to know and observe the patient as an individual, their opinions are given greater weight than the opinions of other physicians.\u201d <em>Smolen, </em>80 F.3d at 1285. But if a treating physician\u2019s opinion is controverted, an ALJ can reject it by providing specific, legitimate reasons for doing so that are based on substantial evidence in the record. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b699-22\">Here, the ALJ sufficiently detailed his reasons for rejecting the opinions of Drs. Hanish, Malanga, and Grout. As to Dr. Hanish, the ALJ correctly noted that \u201cthe claimant\u2019s performance on mental status exams was inconsistent with [Dr. Hanish\u2019s] assessment of serious or greater limitations in mental functioning, and because her assessment is inconsistent with the greater objective record.\u201d The ALJ correctly stated that Dr. Malanga\u2019s opinion was \u201cinconsistent] with the greater objective record, particularly regarding upper extremity functioning and the inability to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>perform at least light work activity.\u201d As to Dr. Grout, whose opinion was very cursory, the ALJ concluded that it was inconsistent with the greater objective record. <em>See Batson v. Comm\u2019r of the Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>359 F.3d 1190, 1195 (9th Cir.2004) (rejecting a treating physician opinion that was \u201cconclusory, brief, and unsupported by the record as a whole\u201d). The ALJ properly relied on the opinion of examining psychiatrist Dr. Patel, whose opinion was consistent with medical notes from Simon\u2019s treating physicians at the Mayo Clinic. Furthermore, the ALJ did not commit reversible error by relying on the opinions from the state agency examiners. <em>Burch v. Barnhart, </em>400 F.3d 676, 679 (9th Cir. 2005) (\u201cA decision of the ALJ will not be reversed for errors that are harmless.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">Second, Simon contends that the ALJ improperly discredited his symptom testimony. When objective medical evidence establishes that the claimant suffers from an impairment that could reasonably produce the symptoms complained of, \u201can adverse credibility finding must be based on clear and convincing reasons\u201d unless there is affirmative evidence of malingering. <em>Carmickle v. Comm\u2019r, Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>533 F.3d 1155, 1160 (9th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and quoting source omitted). Here, the ALJ provided clear and convincing reasons to support his conclusion that the \u201cintensity, persistence and limiting effects\u201d of Simon\u2019s symptom testimony did not comport with the record. <em>See Stubbs-Danielson v. Astrue, </em>539 F.3d 1169, 1175 (9th Cir.2008) (quoting the ALJ decision in Stubbs-Danielson). The ALJ noted that Simon\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with the medical evidence showing improvement and with Simon\u2019s daily activities that included regular golfing and socializing with friends. The ALJ also noted that Simon \u201chad a disincentive to work\u201d given that he was currently receiving long-term disability payments and risked losing them if he began working.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b699-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
