The Government moves to dismiss Flores-Martinez\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction. For the following reasons, we grant the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">The Department of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings against Flores-Martinez in November 2010 on the grounds that he was unlawfully present in the United States. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). Flores-Martinez conceded that he was removable, and he applied to the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l). The IJ denied Flores-Martinez\u2019s application for cancellation of removal, finding that Flores-Martinez failed to establish one of the requirements for relief \u2014 that his removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a spouse, parent or child who is a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). The IJ granted Flores-Martinez\u2019s request to voluntarily depart, rather than be removed at the Government\u2019s expense. On June 24, 2014, the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirmed, without opinion, the result of the IJ\u2019s decision. This court\u2019s docket reflects that Flores-Martinez filed his petition for review on July 25, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-13\">The Government argues that we lack jurisdiction to hear Flores-Martinez\u2019s petition for review on two independent grounds: first, because the petition is untimely, and second, because it seeks review of a discretionary decision. In his response, Flores-Martinez does not address either argument and cites inapposite law.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-14\">A petition for review \u201cmust be filed not later than 30 days after the date of the final order of removal.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). That deadline is mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). A removal order allowing for a period for voluntary departure is a \u201cfinal order of removal.\u201d <em>Vidal v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 250, 253 (5th Cir.2007). An order of removal becomes \u201cfinal\u201d when the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s finding of removability or when the time for appealing the IJ\u2019s decision has expired. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(47)(B). The 30-day period therefore began on June 24, 2014, when the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision denying relief and allowing for voluntary departure. <em>See Karimian-Kaklaki v. INS, </em>997 F.2d 108, 112 (5th Cir.1993). Because Flores-Martinez filed his petition for review 31 days after the BIA issued its decision, the petition is untimely, and we lack jurisdiction to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-15\">Flores-Martinez\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction..</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b518-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
