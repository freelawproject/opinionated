We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo both a denial of a motion to remand, <em>Sparta Surgical Corp. v. Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Sec. Dealers, Inc., </em>159 F.3d 1209,1211 (9th Cir.1998), and a dismissal on the basis of the doctrine of res judicata, <em>Stewart v. U.S. Bancorp, </em>297 F.3d 953, 956 (9th Cir. 2002). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-20\">The district court properly denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion to remand because plaintiffs\u2019 FDCPA claim gave the court federal jurisdiction over the entire action, including state law claims arising out of the same loan transaction and foreclosure proceedings. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367 (allowing discretionary exercise of jurisdiction over state law claims related to federal cause of action); <em>Sparta Surgical Corp., </em>159 F.3d at 1211-13 (action is properly removed where existence of federal jurisdiction is clear from the face of the complaint, and party may not compel remand by trying to eliminate the federal question upon which removal was based); <em>Swanson v. S. Or. Credit Serv., Inc., </em>869 F.2d 1222, 1224 (9th Cir.1988) (per curiam) (district court has jurisdiction over FDCPA claim under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-21\">The district court properly dismissed the action as precluded by the doctrine of res judicata because plaintiffs alleged nearly identical claims arising out of the same loan transaction and related foreclosure proceedings against the same defendants in two prior actions in which there were final judgments on the merits. <em>See Stewart, </em>297 F.3d at 956-57 (setting forth elements of the doctrine of res judicata, and noting that it bars subsequent litigation of both claims that were raised and those that could have been raised in the prior action); <em>Owens v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan, </em>244 F.3d 708, 714 (9th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>2001) (unless otherwise specified, dismissal of an action for failure to prosecute operates as an adjudication on the merits for purposes of applying the doctrine of res judicata).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying leave to amend because amendment would have been futile. <em>See Serra v. Lappin, </em>600 F.3d 1191, 1200 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Because we affirm dismissal on the basis of the doctrine of res judicata, we do not consider plaintiffs\u2019 regarding the alleged merits of their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 contentions that dismissal of the action was in violation of public policy, that the district court improperly looked beyond the pleadings or failed to give proper consideration to their motion \u2022 to remand, and that they were improperly denied the opportunity to conduct discovery, are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">Because plaintiffs did not file a reply brief, defendants\u2019 request to file a surreply, set forth in their answering brief, is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b726-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
