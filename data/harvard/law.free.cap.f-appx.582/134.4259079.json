We will affirm. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4 (2008); 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">Dandar instituted this action by submitting a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to the District Court along with a motion for leave to proceed IFP. The filing fee for the habeas petition is $5.00. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1914(a). A Magistrate Judge denied the IFP motion because Dandar\u2019s prison account statement showed that he had sufficient funds to pay the fee. Dandar filed a motion for reconsideration, captioned, \u201cMotion as to Whether Denial of In Forma Pauperis was Constitutional.\u201d The District Court, apparently construing the motion as an appeal from the Magistrate Judge\u2019s order, denied Dandar\u2019s motion. Dandar timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">The denial of a motion for leave to proceed IFP is final and appealable, and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See Redmond v. Gill, </em>352 F.3d 801, 803 (3d Cir.2003).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review the denial of leave to proceed IFP for abuse of discretion. <em>See Jones v. Zimmerman, </em>752 F.2d 76, 78 (3d Cir.1985). \u201cIn this circuit, leave to proceed [IFP] is based on a showing of indigence.\u201d <em>Deutsch v. United States, </em>67 F.3d 1080, 1084 n. 5 (3d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-16\">The District Court did not abuse its discretion in requiring Dandar to pay the $5.00 filing fee. Dandar had a balance of over $1000 at the time he submitted his IFP application to the District Court. His account balance never fell below $100 in the six months prior to the filing. Thus, requiring Dandar to pay the $5.00 filing fee did not impermissibly \u201c \u2018force [him] to abandon what may be a meritorious claim in order to spare himself complete destitution.\u2019\u201d <em>Jones, </em>752 F.2d at 79 (quoting <em>Adkins v. DuPont Co., </em>335 U.S. 331, 340, 69 S.Ct. 85, 93 L.Ed. 43 (1948), and holding that District Court abused its discretion in requiring prisoner to pay $5.00 fee from an account balance of only $17.39).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-17\">Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. Our ruling is without prejudice to Dandar\u2019s right to refile his habeas petition with the $5.00 filing fee or resubmit it with another motion for leave to proceed IFP, as his circumstances may warrant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b163-12\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-13\">. We have not decided whether a certificate of appealability is necessary to appeal the District Court's denial of leave to proceed IFP in a habeas proceeding. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). To the extent that a certificate of appealability might be required, we deny it for the reasons discussed herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b163-20\">. We granted Dandar leave to proceed IFP on appeal, but our action is not inconsistent with the denial of his IFP motion at the District Court level because the $505.00 fee for filing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>a notice of appeal is far higher than the $5.00 fee for filing a habeas petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
