Sept. 11, 2012), <em>aff'g </em>No. A089 253 000 (Immig.Ct. Oct. 7, 2010). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the decision of the IJ as supplemented and modified by the BIA. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (\u201c[T]he administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be <em>compelled </em>to conclude to the contrary....\u201d (emphasis supplied)); <em>see also Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">For applications, such as Dervishaj\u2019s, governed by the amendments made to the Immigration and Nationality Act by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, \u201c[cjonsidering the totality of .the circumstances,\u201d base a credibility finding on the applicant\u2019s \u201cdemeanor, candor, or responsiveness,\u201d the plausibility of his account, and inconsistencies in his statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 1231(b)(3)(C); <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008). We will defer \u201cto an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make\u201d such a ruling. <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-14\">Here, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was based upon five perceived inconsistencies within Dervishaj\u2019s testimony and between his testimony and the documentary evidence. These inconsistencies related to: (1) the identity of his father\u2019s assailants during the 2007 incident; (2) the identity and motive of the individuals who attacked Dervishaj and his family in January 2006; (3) the date his family home was bombed in 2006; (4) how and with whom Dervishaj was traveling during a March 2004 incident; and (5) the date of an attack on his father in 2007.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-15\">Based upon our review, the IJ\u2019s determinations regarding the second and third inconsistencies were premised upon clear misunderstandings or misstatements of the record. As to the second alleged inconsistency, the accounts given by Dervishaj and his father were not identical, but they were consistent. Specifically, Dervishaj\u2019s identification of the assailants by their uniforms and emblems as members of the \u201cNational Albanian Army\u201d was not contradicted by his father\u2019s statement that the individuals were wearing masks and were thus unknown to him. As to the third alleged inconsistency, the Government conceded at oral argument that the IJ\u2019s description of the evidence supporting this incident rested upon a misstatement of the record. Dervishaj\u2019s testimony was that an explosion occurred at his family home on November 28, 2006 \u2014 the IJ, in turn, cited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Exhibit SDD as evidence that the incident took place on October 28, 2006. In fact, however, that exhibit confirmed the date of the blast was November 28, 2006.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">These errors warrant remand of this petition to the BIA with instructions to remand to the IJ to reassess Dervishaj\u2019s credibility. As we have previously stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-5\">Where the adverse credibility determination supporting denial of relief from removal is a product of some agency findings infected by legal error and others that are not, our decision to uphold the agency decision or to remand for further proceedings depends on how confidently we can predict that the agency would reach the same decision absent the errors that were made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-6\"><em>Shunfu Li v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 141, 150 (2d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, because we cannot predict with confidence that the IJ would, after excising the erroneous portions of his previous decision, reach the same conclusion regarding Dervishaj\u2019s credibility, it is necessary that we vacate the BIA\u2019s decision with instructions that the IJ undertake a reassessment of Dervishaj\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the BIA\u2019s decision is VACATED and the petition is REMANDED to the BIA with instructions to remand to the IJ. We do not, of course, express any view as to Dervishaj\u2019s ultimate credibility. On remand, the IJ will be permitted to assess Dervishaj\u2019s credibility based on any remaining inconsistencies considered in light of the full and accurate record.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b59-10\">. Because the BIA discounted the first alleged inconsistency as a basis for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, we do not consider that inconsistency in our analysis. <em>See Xue Hong Yang, </em>426 F.3d at 522.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b60-8\">. This leaves the fourth and fifth alleged inconsistencies. The fourth alleged inconsistency concerns how and with whom Dervishaj was traveling during the attack in March 2004. The fifth alleged inconsistency concerns the date his father was attacked in 2007 \u2014 Dervishaj testified that the attack occurred on October 18, 2007, while a letter from Dervishaj\u2019s father states that the attack occurred on November 18, 2007. On remand, the IJ is responsible for assessing the plausibility of Dervishaj\u2019s explanations regarding each of these inconsistencies.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
