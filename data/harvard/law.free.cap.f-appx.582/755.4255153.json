R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b783-23\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-24\">Innospan Corporation and its CEO, Hong-Seok Kim appeal the district court\u2019s Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) dismissal of Innospan\u2019s complaint asserting trademark infringement and related claims (the \u201cDismissal Order\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Innospan contends that the district court abused its discretion in entering the Dismissal Order. Innospan also contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying leave to file a motion for reconsideration of the magistrate judge\u2019s orders imposing discovery sanctions (the \u201cSanctions Order\u201d) and ordering Innospan to pay certain attorney\u2019s fees resulting from its discovery violations (the \u201cFees Order\u201d). Finally, Innospan contends that the magistrate judge improperly rejected its own motion for discovery sanctions (the \u201cDiscovery Order\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-25\">The Dismissal Order was not an abuse of discretion. The district court made specific findings concerning the relevant factors \u2014 the public\u2019s interest in resolution of the litigation, the court\u2019s need to manage its docket, the prejudice Innospan\u2019s discovery violations caused defendants, the policy that cases should be resolved on the merits, and the availability of less drastic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>alternatives-before concluding that Innospan\u2019s ongoing refusal to comply with court orders justified dismissal. <em>See Pagtalunan v. Galaza, </em>291 F.3d 639, 642-43 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Yourish v. Cal. Amplifier, </em>191 F.3d 983, 990-92 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Nor did the district court abuse its discretion in declining to reconsider the Sanctions Order and the Fees Order. Innospan failed to file timely objections to the Sanctions Order and has therefore forfeited the same on appeal. <em>See Simpson v. Lear Astronics Corp., </em>77 F.3d 1170, 1174-75 (9th Cir.1996). The Fees Order similarly reflects a reasoned exercise of discretion. The magistrate appropriately calculated the lodestar rate for defendants\u2019 requested attorney\u2019s fees in an order that included a reduction in the total fees amount and reductions to account for block billing and excessive work. <em>See Lahiri v. Universal Music and Video Distrib. Corp., </em>606 F.3d 1216, 1222-23 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Finally, even assuming that Discovery Order was material to the judgment, <em>see Nat\u2019l Am. Ins. Co. of Calif. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s London, </em>93 F.3d 529, 540 (9th Cir.1996), Innospan again failed to file timely objections to the magistrate\u2019s order, and therefore forfeited the same on appeal. <em>See Simpson, </em>77 F.3d at 1174-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b783-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
