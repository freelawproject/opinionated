He contends that the district court erred in failing to award him an additional one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b) because the government is not permitted to withhold a motion for such reduction based on a defendant\u2019s refusal to waive his appellate rights. The Government concedes error.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Amendment 775 to the Commentary to United States Sentencing Guidelines, which became effective November 1, 2013, provides that the Government should not withhold the additional one-level reduction under \u00a7 3E1.1(b) based on interests not identified in the guideline, such as whether the defendant agrees to waive the right to appeal. United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual, Supp. to Appendix C, </em>Amendment 775, at 43-46 (Nov. 1, 2013). In <em>United States v. Villegas Palacios, </em>756 F.3d 325, 326 (5th Cir.2014), we applied Amendment 775 to a case on direct appeal in which the error was preserved and the Government conceded error.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">In light of the amendment to \u00a7 3El.l\u2019s Commentary, the holding in <em>Villegas Palacios, </em>and the Government\u2019s concession of error in the instant case, the district court\u2019s refusal to award Hernandez-Acosta the additional one-level for acceptance of responsibility was error. <em>See id. </em>Additionally, a review of the record shows that the error was not harmless. <em>See United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752-53 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">Accordingly, Hernandez-Acosta\u2019s sentence is VACATED and the case is REMANDED to the district court for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b516-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
