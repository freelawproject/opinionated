Bryant alleged that Dasilva, a New York State Trooper, unlawfully searched Bryant\u2019s car without a warrant after stopping him on the highway for driving without a seatbelt and then arresting him on an outstanding bench warrant. The district court granted Dasilva\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that undisputed facts showed that Dasilva\u2019s search was a valid inventory search, and thus fell within a well-established exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history of the case, and issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-16\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>resolving all ambiguities and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <em>See Wrobel v. Cnty. of Erie, </em>692 F.3d 22, 27 (2d Cir.2012). Summary judgment is appropriate only where \u201cthe movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-17\">Bryant raises two arguments on this appeal. First, he argues that in <em>Arizona v. Gant, </em>556 U.S. 332, 129 S.Ct. 1710, 173 L.Ed.2d 485 (2009), the Supreme Court implicitly abrogated the inventory search exception to the warrant requirement as applied to vehicle searches conducted contemporaneously with an arrest. <em>Gant </em>concerned the exception for searches conducted incident to an arrest, and held that a vehicle search falls within that exception \u201conly if the arrestee is within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search or it is reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 351, 129 S.Ct. 1710. While this holding narrowed law enforcement\u2019s ability to search the vehicle of an arrestee under the search-incident-to-arrest exception, <em>see id. </em>at 341-42, 129 S.Ct. 1710, the Court in <em>Gant </em>did not mention, let alone purport to limit or eliminate, the separate exception for inventory searches. To the contrary, <em>Gant </em>expressly holds that where the requirements of the search-incident-to-arrest exception are not met, \u201ca search of an arrestee\u2019s vehicle will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>be unreasonable <em>unless police obtain a warrant or show that another exception to the warrant requirement applies.\u201d Id. </em>at 351, 129 S.Ct. 1710 (emphasis added). Accordingly, there is no basis to conclude that <em>Gant </em>somehow abrogated the inventory search exception and overruled the longstanding precedents that have recognized and elaborated upon it. <em>See, e.g., Colorado v. Bertine, </em>479 U.S. 367, 107 S.Ct. 738, 93 L.Ed.2d 739 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Second, Bryant argues that certain factual inconsistencies precluded the district court from concluding on summary judgment that Dasilva\u2019s search constituted a valid inventory search. Because Bryant failed to raise this argument before the district court, we will not consider it on appeal. <em>See In re Nortel Networks Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>539 F.3d 129, 132 (2d Cir.2008) (\u201c[I]t is a well-established general rule that an appellate court will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d (alteration in original)) (quoting <em>Bogle-Assegai v. Connecticut, </em>470 F.3d 498, 504 (2d Cir.2006)). While we have discretion to consider forfeited issues \u201cwhere necessary to avoid a manifest injustice,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 133, the arguments Bryant now presses were available to him below, and he has provided no explanation for his failure to raise them. <em>See id. </em>(\u201c[T]he circumstances normally do not militate in favor of an exercise of discretion to address ... new arguments on appeal where those arguments were available to the [parties] below and they proffer no reason for their failure to raise the arguments below.\u201d (omission and second set of brackets in original) (quoting <em>Bogle-Assegai, </em>470 F.3d at 504 (internal quotation marks omitted))).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">We have considered all of the plaintiff-appellant\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
