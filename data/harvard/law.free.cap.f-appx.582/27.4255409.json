Martino\u2019s complaint brought a hybrid claim under the Labor Management Relations Act (\u201cLMRA\u201d) against his former employer, Metro North Commuter Railroad Company, and against his former union, Association of Commuter Rail Employees (\u201cACRE\u201d), and ACRE chairman Michael F. Doyle in his representative capacity, for breach of the collective bargaining agreement and breach of the union\u2019s duty of fair representation, respectively. Martino, a locomotive engineer, also unsuccessfully sought to vacate the arbitration award issued by a special adjustment board as part of a disciplinary action stemming from multiple failures to perform certain brake tests required by federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>regulation and <em>by </em>Metro North. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">We review the dismissal on a motion for judgment on the pleadings under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(c) by the same <em>de novo </em>standard applicable to dismissals under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>Kalyanaram v. Am. Ass\u2019n of Univ. Professors at the N.Y. Inst. of Tech., </em>742 F.3d 42, 46 (2d Cir.2014). In order to survive a motion for judgment on the pleadings, a complaint \u201cmust contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bank of N.Y. v. First Millennium, Inc., </em>607 F.3d 905, 922 (2d Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). We must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. <em>Johnson v. Rowley, </em>569 F.3d 40, 43 (2d Cir.2009). We review the denial of a motion for reconsideration for \u201cabuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Analytical Surveys, Inc. v. Tonga Partners, L.P., </em>684 F.3d 36, 52 (2d Cir.2012). <em>See generally In re Sims, </em>534 F.3d 117, 132 (2d Cir.2008) (explaining the term of art \u201cabuse of discretion,\u201d which includes errors of law and clearly erroneous assessments of the evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Martino\u2019s hybrid claim<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> contains two elements: \u201c(1) that the employer breached a collective bargaining agreement and (2) that the union breached its duty of fair representation vis-a-vis the union members.\u201d <em>White v. White Rose Food, </em>237 F.3d 174, 178 (2d Cir.2001) (citing <em>DelCostello v. Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters, </em>462 U.S. 151, 164-65, 103 S.Ct. 2281, 76 L.Ed.2d 476 (1983)). The claim of a breach of the union\u2019s duty of fair representation itself requires two elements: (1) conduct by the union toward a member that is \u201carbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith,\u201d <em>Marquez v. Screen Actors Guild, Inc., </em>525 U.S. 33, 44, 119 S.Ct. 292, 142 L.Ed.2d 242 (1998) (citation omitted), and (2) a \u201ccausal connection between the union\u2019s wrongful conduct and [plaintiffs] injuries.\u201d <em>Spellacy v. Airline Pilots Ass\u2019n-Int\u2019l, </em>156 F.3d 120, 126 (2d Cir.1998). A finding of arbitrary conduct is appropriate only if \u201cthe union\u2019s behavior is so far outside a \u2018wide range of reasonableness\u2019 as to be irrational.\u201d <em>Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n, Int\u2019l v. O\u2019Neill, </em>499 U.S. 65, 67, 111 S.Ct. 1127, 113 L.Ed.2d 51 (1991) (quoting <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Huffman, </em>345 U.S. 330, 338, 73 S.Ct. 681, 97 L.Ed. 1048 (1953)). A finding of \u201cbad faith requires a showing of fraudulent, deceitful or dishonest action.\u201d <em>White, </em>237 F.3d at 179 (brackets omitted) (quoting <em>Sim v. N.Y. Mailers\u2019 Union No. 6, </em>166 F.3d 465, 472 (2d Cir.1999)). Our review of an alleged breach of the union\u2019s duty of fair representation is \u201chighly deferential, recognizing the wide latitude that negotiators need for the effective performance of their bargaining responsibilities.\u201d <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>499 U.S. at 78, 111 S.Ct. 1127.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">In his complaint, Martino alleged the following five purported breaches by the union: (1) failure to object to prior disciplinary history cited in Metro North\u2019s brief, (2) failure to advance the \u201ccrucial\u201d argument that Metro North\u2019s offer of reinstatement, which Martino declined, should be considered an admission that the discharge was not supported by just cause, (3) failure to present certain witnesses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>including a Federal Railroad Administration Inspector and an expert on Metro North Rules, (4) failure to inform the arbitrators of the pending parallel appeal before the Locomotive Engineer Review Board (\u201cLERB\u201d), and (5) failure to \u201cprogress\u201d three previous disciplinary incidents dating from 1997, 1998 and 2000 through the full appeals process. Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 16-17, 20-25, 30; Appellant\u2019s Br. at 22-24; Appellee ACRE and Doyle\u2019s Br. at 20-21. Martino contends that these actions constitute breaches of his union\u2019s duty of fair representation, and consequently that the district court erred in dismissing his hybrid claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">For essentially the reasons stated by the District Court, we conclude that Martino has failed to plead a plausible claim of breach of the union\u2019s duty of fair representation. Even when considered in the light most favorable to plaintiff, Martino has failed to show union conduct that is arbitrary or in bad faith. At most, his allegations support an inference of tactical error or negligence, neither of which amounts to a breach of the duty of fair representation. <em>See Vaughn v. Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n, Int\u2019l, </em>604 F.3d 703, 709 (2d Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Barr v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>868 F.2d 36, 43 (2d Cir.1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Plaintiffs second claim to support vacatur of the arbitral award confirming his termination was also properly dismissed. Pursuant to the Railway Labor Act (\u201cRLA\u201d), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 153, First (q), an arbitral award may be set aside only (1) \u201cfor failure of the division to comply with the requirements of this chapter,\u201d (2) \u201cfor failure of the order to conform, or confine itself, to matters within the scope of the division\u2019s jurisdiction, or\u201d (3) \u201cfor fraud or corruption by a member of the division making the order.\u201d Precedent in this Circuit adds as a fourth basis for vacatur due process violations. <em>Shafii v. PLC British Airways, </em>22 F.3d 59, 63-64 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">As plaintiff acknowledges, the scope of judicial review of a labor board\u2019s arbitral decision is \u201camong the narrowest known to the law.\u201d <em>Union Pac. R.R. Co. v. Sheehan, </em>439 U.S. 89, 91, 99 S.Ct. 399, 58 L.Ed.2d 354 (1978). <em>See also </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 26. Inasmuch as the case at bar constitutes a \u201cminor dispute\u201d regarding employee discipline and discharge, the Supreme Court \u201ctime and again has emphasized and reemphasized that Congress intended minor grievances of railroad workers to be decided finally by the Railroad Adjustment Board.\u201d <em>United Transp. Union v. Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp., </em>588 F.3d 805, 810 (2d Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Gunther v. San Diego &amp; Ariz. E. Ry. Co., </em>382 U.S. 257, 263, 86 S.Ct. 368, 15 L.Ed.2d 308 (1965)). \u201c[Wjhere fraud is not an issue we ask only whether the arbitrators did the job they were told to do \u2014 not whether they did it well, or correctly, or reasonably, but simply whether they did it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>CSX Transp., Inc. v. United Transp. Union, </em>950 F.2d 872, 877 (2d Cir.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">Both below and on appeal, Martino\u2019s arguments primarily express his dissatisfaction with the prudence and judgment of the arbitral award, which is outside our scope of review. He exhumes many of the same facts alleged to be breaches of the union\u2019s duty of fair representation and then attempts unsuccessfully to fit them into the framework applicable to his vacatur claim. For instance, Martino alleges that the omission of the fact of the unrelated LERB appeal constituted a failure to comply with RLA procedural requirements; that the arbitrator\u2019s purported consideration of his prior disciplinary history (an allegation unsubstantiated by the record or by the arbitrator\u2019s report) constituted fraud; and that the arbitral board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>exceeded its jurisdiction by issuing a \u201cwholly baseless\u201d award. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 27-38; Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 36-37. Martino further contends that he suffered due process violations because the board did not create a transcript of its proceedings, and because plaintiff was unable to call certain witnesses for reasons unspecified and unattributed to the board itself. Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 36; Appellant\u2019s Br. at 31-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">The district court already considered these arguments and found that they failed to establish any of the grounds required to set aside the arbitrator\u2019s award. <em>Martino v. Metro North Commuter R.R. Co., et at., </em>No. 3:10-cv-1816(JBA), 2013 WL 3208548, at *8-10 (D.Conn. Jun. 24, 2013). Especially in light of the high threshold for vacatur of arbitral awards, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Martino\u2019s motion for reconsideration, which essentially attempted to relitigate issues already resolved. <em>See Shrader v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>70 F.3d 255, 257 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">We have considered all of the arguments raised by plaintiff on appeal and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the District Court\u2019s June 24, 2013 judgment and January 2, 2014 order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b56-6\">. Not at issue here, but mentioned in passing by Appellee Metro North, is whether Martino\u2019s hybrid claim was improperly brought under the LMRA, given that the parties are subject instead to the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151 <em>et seq. See </em>Appellee's Br. at 9 n. 5. Because, as Metro North acknowledges, hybrid actions are available pursuant to the Railway Labor Act, we need not decide this question here. <em>See West v. Conrail, </em>481 U.S. 35, 36, 107 S.Ct. 1538, 95 L.Ed.2d 32 (1987) (recognizing hybrid suit against an employer, union, and union representative under the Railway Labor Act).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
