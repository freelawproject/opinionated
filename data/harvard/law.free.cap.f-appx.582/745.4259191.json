We \u201creverse only if the ALJ\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole or if the ALJ applied the wrong legal standard.\u201d <em>Molina v. Astrue, </em>674 F.3d 1104, 1110 (9th Cir.2012). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-23\">Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. The ALJ offered \u201cspecific, clear and convincing reasons\u201d for rejecting Sherman\u2019s testimony about his limitations and pain to the extent that his testimony conflicted with the residual functional capacity as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>sessment. <em>Molina, </em>674 F.Bd at 1112 (internal quotation marks omitted). First, the ALJ noted Sherman\u2019s sporadic work history before he filed for disability and the fact that his job rehabilitation services case worker closed his file for failure to cooperate and participate in job searching. <em>See Thomas v. Barnhart, </em>278 F.3d 947, 959 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">Second, the ALJ relied on physicians\u2019 observations that Sherman exhibited \u201cself-limiting behaviors\u201d and had \u201cpoor credibility.\u201d Dr. Hurd, an examining physician, reported that Sherman \u201crefused to do many of the exam maneuvers\u201d and \u201cused less than actual effort.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(holding that a claimant\u2019s failure \u201cto give maximum or consistent effort during two physical capacity evaluations\u201d supported the ALJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding). He also observed Sherman perform multiple tasks that were inconsistent with his alleged limitations. <em>See Carmickle v. Comm\u2019r Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>533 F.3d 1155, 1161 (9th Cir. 2008) (\u201cContradiction with the medical record is a sufficient basis for rejecting the claimant\u2019s subjective testimony.\u201d). Dr. Hurd\u2019s findings were consistent with other physicians\u2019 observations. Dr. Goodell, a treating physician, said that Sherman\u2019s \u201cinability to cooperate/participate\u201d and \u201cunwillingness to participate in a physical exam\u201d prevented her from testing his physical abilities. Sherman refused to bear weight during the exam. When Dr. Goodell left the room, however, he was able to climb up on the exam table to take a nap. Similarly, Dr. Mozer, an examining psychologist, described Sherman as \u201cevasive\u201d and commented on his failure to give a \u201cvalid effort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Third, the ALJ reasonably concluded that Sherman\u2019s medical conditions did not limit his daily activities to the extent that he claimed. No doctor placed any restrictions on Sherman\u2019s activities. <em>See Burch v. Barnhart, </em>400 F.3d 676, 681 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201cAlthough lack of medical evidence cannot form the sole basis for discounting pain testimony, it is a factor that the ALJ can consider in his credibility analysis.\u201d). Further, the ALJ found that Sherman\u2019s daily marijuana use contributed to his lack of activity. Dr. Mozer opined that Sherman had \u201cvery marginal motivation\u201d and is \u201cbasically doing what he wants to do (sit around and smoke pot).\u201d The ALJ\u2019s conclusion that marijuana use can impact daily activities, social functioning, and concentration is reasonable, so we must accept it. <em>See Tommasetti v. Astrue, </em>533 F.3d 1035, 1040 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">To the extent that the ALJ might have erred in relying on Sherman\u2019s failure to get back surgery when he did not have money or insurance, <em>see Orn v. Astrue, </em>495 F.3d 625, 638 (9th Cir.2007), any error was harmless in light of the ALJ\u2019s other findings that provide substantial evidence for the adverse credibility determination. <em>See Carmickle, </em>533 F.3d at 1162.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">Sherman argues that the ALJ rejected the opinions of his treating physicians. We disagree. The ALJ considered the opinions of Dr. Verby, Dr. Quenemon, Dr. Goodell, and Dr. Draper, and their opinions are consistent with the ALJ\u2019s finding that Sherman has severe degenerative disc and joint disease in his back and osteoarthritis in his hands. The ALJ\u2019s written decision was not required to discuss every piece of evidence. <em>Howard v. Barnhart, </em>341 F.3d 1006, 1012 (9th Cir. 2003). Sherman challenges the residual functional capacity assessment, but he has not shown how it is inconsistent with any physician\u2019s opinion. No physician placed any restrictions on Sherman\u2019s activities or diagnosed any physical impairments beyond those found by the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>We also reject Sherman\u2019s claim that the ALJ ignored the opinions of mental health care providers that he was depressed. After considering the evidence that Sherman claims was ignored, the ALJ ruled that Sherman\u2019s alleged depression is \u201ceither not medically determinable, due to the lack of a formal diagnosis, or is non-severe.\u201d The ALJ\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence. Sherman was never diagnosed with depression. Dr. Mozer said that depression was \u201cquestionable\u201d and he ruled it out of consideration by finding that if Sherman does have depression it is \u201cmild,\u201d \u201ccertainly not limiting,\u201d and \u201ca natural consequence of an empty lifestyle.\u201d Likewise, Dr. Martin, a non-examining physician, testified that there was not much support in the record for depressive disorder. Sherman\u2019s depression was not assessed by any other acceptable medical source. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1513(a). The ALJ gave a \u201cgermane\u201d reason, <em>Molina, </em>674 F.3d at 1111, for rejecting Sherman\u2019s other source evidence, noting that the therapist who assessed his global functioning assessment score did not diagnose depression. For the same reason, the ALJ properly discounted Sherman\u2019s answers to mental health questionnaires.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Because the ALJ did not completely rule out the possibility that Sherman has mild depression, we assume without deciding that he was required to consider it in assessing Sherman\u2019s residual functional capacity. \u201cThe ALJ is required to consider all of the limitations imposed by the claimant\u2019s impairments, even those that are not severe.\u201d <em>Carmickle, </em>533 F.3d at 1164. In this case, however, Sherman has not shown that his alleged depression resulted in any functional limitations that the ALJ failed to consider. <em>See Burch, </em>400 F.3d at 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Finally, we reject Sherman\u2019s claim that the ALJ ignored the findings of Dr. McFarland, a state agency reviewing psychologist, and Dr. Mozer that he has difficulties maintaining concentration, persistence, and pace as a result of his anti-personality disorder. Sherman is correct that the residual functional capacity assessment does not specifically mention limitations in concentration, persistence, and pace. This omission, however, does not constitute reversible error. We held in <em>Stubbs-Danielson v. Astrue, </em>that a residual functional capacity assessment \u201cadequately captures\u201d a claimant\u2019s limitations in concentration, persistence, and pace as long as the assessment is \u201cconsistent with restrictions identified in the medical testimony,\u201d 539 F.3d 1169, 1174 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Here, the ALJ, like the one in <em>Stubbs-Danielson, </em>adopted the only \u201cconcrete restrictions\u201d identified by Sherman\u2019s physicians. <em>See id. </em>Both Dr. McFarland and Dr. Mozer concluded that Sherman is capable of unskilled work, despite his functional limitations. Dr. McFarland said that Sherman \u201cwould do best at work that does not require dealing with the public or working closely with others\u201d but he is able to \u201cunderstand, carry out and remember simple instructions,\u201d and \u201crespond appropriately to supervision, coworkers and work situations.\u201d The ALJ gave Dr. McFarland\u2019s opinion \u201csignificant weight\u201d and noted that the residual functional capacity assessment is consistent with her findings. We agree. The assessment includes routine unskilled jobs with occasional to frequent new learning and excludes jobs that require constant dealing with the public, large groups of people, distracting situations, constant critical supervision, high constant focus requirements, and high constant stress requirements. To the extent that the ALJ might have erred by also including semi-skilled jobs, this error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>was harmless because the ALJ found that Sherman is capable of performing unskilled jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy. <em>See Molina, </em>674 F.3d at 1115 (\u201c[A]n ALJ\u2019s error is harmless where it is inconsequential to the ultimate nondisability determination.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">The ALJ gave the vocational expert a hypothetical based on the residual functional capacity assessment. For the reasons discussed above, we conclude that the hypothetical properly included all of Sherman\u2019s limitations that are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Bayliss v. Barnhart, </em>427 F.3d 1211, 1217-18 (9th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b775-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b775-24\">. We order that the excerpts of record, filed under seal, be unsealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b778-6\">BERZON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Asg\">Dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s finding that claimant Robert Sherman lacks credibility. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">1. Contrary to the ALJ\u2019s assessment, Sherman\u2019s sporadic work history before his 2009 filing date is entirely consistent with his testimony. Sherman\u2019s back injury occurred in 1992. Although he attempted to keep working after the injury, his back problems worsened in 1998, when he re-injured himself in a car accident. When Sherman protectively filed in 2009, he alleged a disability onset date of 1998. He amended that date because he did not have the medical records to prove his case that far back. But treatment notes from 2001 and 2004 do indicate that Sherman was in serious pain from back problems during this time, and that when he did work, he \u201cexacerbated his injury in the low[er] back.\u201d Thus, Sherman\u2019s sporadic work history before his filing date does not show that factors other than his disability prevented him from working, and is in fact consistent with his account of his back injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-11\">2. The second reason the panel gives in support of the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination is Sherman\u2019s lack of cooperation with state vocational rehabilitation services. The record does not support such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-12\">The Montana Vocational Rehabilitation Program (\u201cMontana Vocational\u201d) reports as a whole confirms Sherman\u2019s alleged limitations and illustrates that it was his disability that prevented him from finding work. Those records show that Sherman thought he could do short-term, but not long-term driving, as long as lifting was not required. The vocational school \u201conly had ... long term over the road stuff,\u201d and short-run jobs not involving lifting were not available for inexperienced drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-13\">Sherman did receive his Commercial Driver\u2019s License, and tried some driving jobs, but they turned out to require lifting as much as 70 pounds, which he could not handle. At a meeting with Sherman, Montana Vocational recognized that the agency had been \u201cunsuccessful in finding a driving job for Robert that does not involve heavy lifting and labor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-14\">Only after these failures did Sherman invite Montana Vocational to close his case. In doing so, he explained that he did it because \u201cmy back\u2019s not in the best of shape right now, and I kinda need to wait until a few months from now;\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t really work 3-5 hours and I can\u2019t really put in a 5-day work week either.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-15\">In short, the vocational program reports support rather than disprove Sherman\u2019s recurring back pain and physical inability to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>3. Sherman\u2019s failure to have back surgery was also an inappropriate ground for rejecting Sherman\u2019s testimony. \u201c[I]f a claimant complains about disabling pain but fails to seek treatment, or fails to follow prescribed treatment, for the pain, an ALJ may use such failure as a basis for finding the complaint unjustified or exaggerated.\u201d Or<em>n v. Astrue, </em>495 F.3d 625, 638 (9th Cir.2007). But there are four problems with the ALJ\u2019s doing so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">First, there is no clear prescription during the period at issue that Sherman should follow through with back surgery. Second, there are indications, in two doctors\u2019 reports, that Sherman did not have back surgery when it was previously recommended because he could not afford it, and that he remained interested in doing so if he could obtain funding for it. \u201c[Disability benefits may not be denied because of the claimant\u2019s failure to obtain treatment he cannot obtain for lack of funds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gamble v. Chater, </em>68 F.3d 319, 321 (9th Cir.1995)); <em>see Regennitter v. Commissioner of the Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>166 F.3d 1294, 1297 (9th Cir.1999). Third, in light of that fact that Sherman has consistently sought treatment for his back pain, his hesitancy to have a major surgery cannot cast doubt on his claim. \u201cIt is common knowledge that spinal surgery is often dangerous and entails much pain and suffering.\u201d <em>Schena v. Secretary of Health &amp; Hum. Servs., </em>635 F.2d 15, 20 (1st Cir.1980) (reversing Secretary\u2019s decision that claimant\u2019s rejection of spinal surgery barred him from disability benefits \u201c[gjiven the uncertain (and sometimes adverse) consequences of spinal surgery\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). While Social Security regulations require claimants to follow \u201ctreatment prescribed by [a] physician\u201d to receive benefits, the same regulations make clear that if the claimant has \u201ca good reason\u201d for not following the prescribed treatment, rejection of treatment -will not be held against the claimant. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.930(a) &amp; (b); <em>see Molina v. Astrue, </em>674 F.3d 1104, 1114 (9th Cir.2012); SSR 96-7p, 1996 WL 374186 (July 2, 1996). The regulations further specify that an example of \u201ca good reason for not following treatment\u201d is that \u201c[t]he treatment because of its enormity (e.g., open heart surgery) ... is very risky for you.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.930(c)(4). Finally, Sherman did purse several treatments for his back pain other than surgery (epidurals, pain medication, physical therapy).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">In short, the fact that Sherman has not yet had spinal surgery can have no bearing on his credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">4. The ALJ also cited the lack of limitations placed on Sherman by his treating physicians, and his physicians\u2019 recommendation of exercise. However, Sherman suffers from obesity and hypertension. So the exercise recommendation is to be expected, and does not indicate ability to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">Moreover, examination of the medical reports reveal a recognition that pain might well limit Sherman\u2019s ability to engage in the recommended treatment, as the reports also include recommendations for rest and pain management, rather than uniform recommendations of exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">5. Dr. Hurd\u2019s statement that, in his view, Sherman overplayed his limitations and had \u201cpoor credibility as an examinee\u201d was based on Dr. Hurd\u2019s observations of Sherman\u2019s behavior during the consultative exam. The ALJ was entitled to consider Dr. Hurd\u2019s view in assessing Sherman\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">However, Dr. Hurd\u2019s evaluation was equivocal and stated only his \u201cintuitive feeling\u201d that Sherman had a greater ability than he showcased. Moreover, Dr. Hurd was a consulting examiner, so his opinion is entitled to less weight than the opinions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>of treating physicians. <em>See Holohan v. Massanari, </em>246 F.3d 1195, 1202 (9th Cir. 2001); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(c). Not a single treating physician suggested that Sherman was malingering or inventing pain. If they had, one would think they would not have prescribed him serious pain medication and considered him a candidate for spinal surgery. My colleagues in the majority refer to reports from Drs. Goodell and Mozer. But Dr. Goodell cited Sherman\u2019s <em>\u201cinability </em>to cooperate/participate,\u201d (emphasis added), and Dr. Mozer was a consulting psychologist, who did not evaluate Sherman\u2019s physical disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Furthermore, the ALJ himself does not attribute significant weight to Dr. Hurd\u2019s finding, stating only that Dr. Hurd\u2019s assessment \u201cdoes not enhance the claimant\u2019s credibility,\u201d and does not cite to either Dr. Goodell\u2019s or Dr. Mozer\u2019s reports as supporting the credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Finally, the ALJ rejected Sherman\u2019s narration of his limited daily activities as evidence of his disability, because his account was not objectively verifiable, and because his limited daily activities could have been attributed to his marijuana dependence. These remaining considerations do not constitute substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination, and so the ALJ\u2019s reliance on these considerations does not make the aforementioned errors harmless. <em>See Carmickle v. Commissioner Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>533 F.3d 1155, 1162 (9th Cir.2008) (error is harmless if \u201cALJ\u2019s remaining reasoning and ultimate credibility determination were adequately supported by substantial evidence in the record\u201d (emphasis omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">Had the ALJ credited Sherman\u2019s testimony as true, he would have been obliged to include Sherman\u2019s testimony as to his limitations in determining Sherman\u2019s residual functioning capacity, including Sherman\u2019s testimony that he has to lie down to two or three times a day, throughout the day, for up to an hour or two at a time to take the pressure off his back. According to the vocational expert\u2019s evidence at the ALJ hearing, including this limitation in the residual functioning capacity results in a finding that Sherman was disabled. Therefore, I would remand to the agency for calculation and an award of benefits. <em>Lingenfelter v. Astrue, </em>504 F.3d 1028, 1041 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">For all these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
