We deny a certif\u00edcate of appealability (COA) and dismiss this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">Mr. Wardell was convicted by a jury in 2005 of several tax-fraud offenses and subsequently sentenced to ninety-six months\u2019 imprisonment. This court affirmed his conviction and sentence on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Wardell, </em>218 Fed.Appx. 695 (10th Cir.2007). He then filed in district court a \u00a7 2255 motion in which he raised numerous claims of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel. The district court denied relief in a lengthy, well-reasoned order that examined each of Mr. Wardell\u2019s fourteen claims of error. While Mr. Warden\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of \u00a7 2255 relief was pending in this court, he filed a Rule 60(b)(6) motion in district court to set aside the court\u2019s order denying \u00a7 2255 relief. This court upheld the district court\u2019s denial of \u00a7 2255 relief to Mr. Wardell and denied his request for a COA. <em>United States v. Wardell, </em>564 Fed.Appx. 418 (10th Cir.2014). Shortly thereafter, the district court dismissed Mr. Wardell\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6) motion for lack of jurisdiction on the grounds that he was attempting to assert unauthorized second or successive \u00a7 2255 claims without having obtained authorization from this court to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">Mr. Wardell now requests a COA from this court. <em>See United States v. Harper, </em>545 F.3d 1230, 1233 (10th Cir.2008) (\u201c[T]he district court\u2019s dismissal of an unauthorized \u00a7 2255 motion is a \u2018final order in a proceeding under section 2255\u2019 such that [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 2253 requires petitioner to obtain a COA before he or she may appeal.\u201d). To obtain a COA, Mr. Wardell must show both \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). This court must determine whether Mr. Wardell\u2019s post-conviction motion should be treated as a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, and therefore subject to the authorization requirements of \u00a7 2255(h). It is subject to the authorization requirements of a second or successive petition if it in substance or effect asserts or reasserts a federal basis for relief from the petitioner\u2019s underlying conviction. <em>See Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 531-32, 538, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005); <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>465 F.3d 1145, 1147 (10th Cir.2006). But authorization under \u00a7 2255(h) is not required \u201cwhen a Rule 60(b) motion attacks, not the substance of the federal court\u2019s resolution of a claim on the merits, but some defect in the integrity of the federal habeas proceedings.\u201d <em>Gonzalez, </em>545 U.S. at 532, 125 S.Ct. 2641.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-11\">It is beyond cavil that the district court\u2019s determination that Mr. Wardell\u2019s Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>60(b)(6) motion should be viewed as a \u00a7 2255 motion was correct. First, Mr. Wardell\u2019s motion was devoted primarily to re-arguing the issues he raised in his \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Spitznas v. Boone, </em>464 F.3d 1213, 1216 (10th Cir.2006). Second, his allegations of government misconduct or fraud were not linked to the integrity of the \u00a7 2255 proceeding itself, but instead attacked the integrity of the underlying trial. And last, his request to present newly discovered evidence was not the proper subject of a Rule 60(b) motion \u201cbecause [it] assert[ed] or reasserted] a federal basis for relief from the underlying conviction.\u201d <em>Spitznas, </em>464 F.3d at 1216.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Mr. Wardell\u2019s application for a COA is denied and this matter is dismissed. We also deny Mr. Wardell\u2019s motion to proceed on appeal without prepayment of costs or fees because he has failed to advance \u201ca reasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues raised on appeal.\u201d <em>DeBardeleben v. Quinlan, </em>937 F.2d 502, 505 (10th Cir.1991).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b813-8\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
