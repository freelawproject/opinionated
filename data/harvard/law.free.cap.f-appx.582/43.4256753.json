LaCertosa also moves to strike portions of appellees\u2019 briefs contesting allegations of RICO predicate acts by pro se appellee Paul Bedford. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint for lack of standing.\u201d Se<em>levan v. N.Y. Thruway Auth., </em>584 F.3d 82, 88 (2d Cir.2009). For the purposes of such review, we \u201caceept[ ] as true all material allegations in the complaint and constru[e] the complaint in favor of the complaining party.\u201d <em>Fuentes v. Bd. of Educ. of City of N.Y., </em>540 F.3d 145, 148 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-13\">Upon such review, we conclude that LaCertosa lacks standing substantially for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s thorough memorandum and order. <em>See LaCertosa v. Blackman Plumbing Supply Co., et al., </em>No. 10-cv-1984, 2013 WL 3728803 (E.D.N.Y. July 12, 2013). LaCertosa\u2019s before the district court when given the opportunity to brief the issue of his standing. <em>See Baker v. Dorfman, </em>239 F.3d 415, 423 (2d Cir.2000). Moreover, we conclude that the special duty exception is inapplicable, as LaCertosa alleges no \u201cinjury that is separate and distinct from the injury sustained by the corporation.\u201d <em>Manson v. Stacescu, </em>11 F.3d 1127, 1131 (2d Cir.1993).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-14\">Lastly, LaCertosa\u2019s motion to strike is denied as moot because we conclude that the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of standing was proper, and we therefore do not need to address whether the complaint adequately alleged RICO predicates.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-15\">We have considered all of LaCertosa\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED and LaCertosa\u2019s motion to strike is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b72-10\">. LaCertosa argues that his complaint should be accorded the liberal construction given to pro se pleadings, even though he was represented by counsel when the complaint was filed, because, he asserts, the complaint was actually drafted by himself and his non-lawyer son. We need not address this contention because we reach the same conclusion even according his complaint such a liberal reading.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b72-18\">. We also note that, as the complaint alleges that predicate acts committed by Bedford were in furtherance of an enterprise of which the appellees were a part, it was entirely appropriate for appellees to contest the sufficiency of these allegations in their briefs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
