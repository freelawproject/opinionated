(\u201cAppellees\u201d). On February 24, 2014, the district court (Oetken, <em>J.) </em>granted Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint. We review the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss <em>de novo. Fahs Constr. Grp., Inc. v. Gray, </em>725 F.3d 289, 290 (2d Cir.2013) (per curiam). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the ease, and with the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">Appellants\u2019 complaint asserted three claims against Appellees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Each claim relates to Appellees\u2019 alleged violation of New York General Business Law (\u201cGBL\u201d) \u00a7 396-z, which regulates rental car companies. In Count I of the complaint, Appellants sought, <em>inter alia, </em>a declaratory judgment that certain vehicle damage charges debited by Appellees are void pursuant to GBL \u00a7 396-z, along with injunctive relief barring the collection of such charges in the future, and damages equal to all amounts obtained by Appellees for such charges. Count II of the complaint alleges that Appellees engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of GBL \u00a7 349 by representing to consumers that they are liable for such damages even though GBL \u00a7 396-z provides that they are not liable for such damages, by representing to credit card issuers that charges related to such damages were authorized, and by selling waivers to waive such damage charges even though the charges are not valid. Count III of the complaint alleges that Appellees committed common law fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-12\">Appellants have failed to state a claim because GBL \u00a7 396-z does not provide a private right of action, and each of Appellants\u2019 claims relies solely on the fact that Appellees allegedly violated GBL \u00a7 396-z.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellants\u2019 claim for declaratory and injunctive relief is squarely barred by the decisions of the New York Appellate Division, First Department, in <em>Han v. Hertz Corp., </em>12 A.D.3d 195, 784 N.Y.S.2d 106 (2004), and <em>Goldberg v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co., </em>14 A.D.3d 417, 789 N.Y.S.2d 114 (2005), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Rhodes v. Herz, </em>84 A.D.3d 1, 920 N.Y.S.2d 11 (2011). In <em>Han, </em>plaintiffs sought a declaration that defendants\u2019 rental car contracts were void for failure to abide by the requirements of GBL \u00a7 396-z and restitution for monies paid under those contracts. 784 N.Y.S.2d at 107. There, the Appellate Division held that plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred because GBL \u00a7 396-z does not provide for a private right of action. <em>Id. </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>court stated that \u201c[s]ince no private right of action exists [under GBL \u00a7 396-z], the claims for money had and received and unjust enrichment were properly dismissed as an effort to circumvent the legislative preclusion of private lawsuits.\u201d <em>Id. Goldberg </em>similarly involved quasi-eontractual claims for restitution which were dismissed \u201cas an effort to circumvent the legislative preclusion of private lawsuits for violation of [GBL \u00a7 396-z].\u201d 789 N.Y.S.2d at 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Appellants now attempt to distinguish <em>Han </em>and <em>Goldberg </em>on the basis that in those cases plaintiffs sought to void entire rental contracts, whereas Appellants seek only to invalidate the portions of Zipcar\u2019s membership contract that violate GBL \u00a7 396-z. Appellants argue that the plaintiffs in <em>Han </em>and <em>Goldberg </em>needed a separate private right of action beyond the declaratory relief that they sought because, unlike Appellants, those plaintiffs would not have been entitled to restitution if only the provisions of their rental agreements that violated GBL \u00a7 396-z were declared to be void. Appellants\u2019 argument ignores the explicit holdings of <em>Han </em>and <em>Goldberg. Han </em>and <em>Goldberg </em>held that plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred not because declaratory relief would be insufficient to permit them to obtain restitution or because GBL \u00a7 396-z did not provide them a basis for voiding plaintiffs\u2019 rental agreements, but rather because plaintiffs\u2019 claims relied solely on a violation of GBL \u00a7 396-z, which does not provide for a private right of action. <em>Han, </em>784 N.Y.S.2d at 107; <em>Goldberg, </em>789 N.Y.S.2d at 115. \u201cAs a federal court applying state law,\u201d we are obliged to follow <em>Han </em>and <em>Goldberg </em>because there is no \u201ccontrary New York authority\u201d and no \u201cother persuasive data establishes] that the highest court of the state would decide otherwise.\u201d <em>Broder v. Cablevision Sys. Corp., </em>418 F.3d 187, 199-200 (2d Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Appellants\u2019 claims alleging violations of GBL \u00a7 349 and common law fraud are barred because they merely repackage Appellants\u2019 GBL \u00a7 396-z claim. The Court of Appeals of New York held in <em>Schlessinger v. Valspar Corp., </em>21 N.Y.3d 166, 969 N.Y.S.2d 416, 991 N.E.2d 190, 193-94 (2013), that a plaintiff could not allege a violation of GBL \u00a7 349 where the alleged violation was premised solely on the fact that the alleged conduct violated another statute for which the plaintiff did not have a private right of action. This holding bars Appellants\u2019 claim under GBL \u00a7 349 because Appellants also have not alleged facts that if found to be true would demonstrate a free-standing GBL \u00a7 349 violation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellants\u2019 claim for common law fraud is also barred because it likewise cannot stand on its own absent the alleged violations of GBL \u00a7 396-z. <em>See Assured Guar. (U.K.) Ltd. v. J.P. Morgan Inv. Mgmt. Inc., </em>18 N.Y.3d 341, 939 N.Y.S.2d 274, 962 N.E.2d 765, 770 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">We have reviewed Appellants\u2019 remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b47-9\">. A fourth claim, which alleged a violation of the Truth in Lending Act, applied only to a different defendant not subject to this appeal, Citibank, N.A. Appellants voluntarily dismissed their claims against Citibank, N.A. on January 30, 2014.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b47-10\">. In addition to arguing that the judgment of the district court should be affirmed because Appellants failed to state a claim, Appellees alternatively argue that the judgment should be affirmed on the ground that GBL \u00a7 396-z does not apply to them. We need not reach this alternative argument. Appellees have filed a motion to file a sur-reply brief pertaining to it, which we dismiss as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b48-6\">. Appellants now attempt to argue that they have a free-standing claim under GBL \u00a7 349 because Zipcar\u2019s membership contract does not clearly provide Appellees with authorization to debit Zipcar members\u2019 credit cards for damage fees. This argument is belied, however, by the language of the membership contract, which is attached as an exhibit to Appellants\u2019 complaint and clearly authorizes Zipcar to debit such charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
