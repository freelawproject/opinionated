Dec. 14, 2012), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 087 443 584 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 4, 2011). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">Under the circumstances of this case, ' where the BIA \u201cadopts the decision of the IJ and merely supplements the IJ\u2019s decision,\u201d we review the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA. <em>Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009). We review the factual findings of the BIA and IJ for substantial evidence and uphold the findings if they are supported by \u201creasonable, substantial, and probative evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104,116 (2d Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Because Song filed her asylum application in 2008, the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231 (2005), applies. Under the Act, the agency may base a credibility finding on, <em>inter alia, </em>the applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of the applicant\u2019s account, and inconsistencies in the applicant\u2019s statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). \u2018We defer therefore to an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">The adverse credibility determination in this case is not supported by the totality of the circumstances. The IJ reported that Respondent asked Song a \u201cvery simple question\u201d on cross examination: \u201c[I]s not it true that you left China in 2007 and returned\u201d? R. 74. He stated that Song\u2019s response was an \u201cextremely emphatic ... no,\u201d but that she \u201cquickly retracted\u201d her response when confronted with a question about whether she had gone to Malaysia in 2007 and then returned to China. <em>Id. </em>The IJ identified this as an inconsistency and stated that it constituted \u201ca huge negative against the respondent.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">This finding failed to consider Song\u2019s response in context. Shortly before being asked about returning to China, Song had testified that she had her husband retrieve medical records from a Chinese hospital instead of going herself because \u201c[e]ver since I came to the United States, I never go back, I don\u2019t want to go back.\u201d R. 102. She was then asked \u201cyou left China in 2007 and returned, right,\u201d and responded using the same language: \u201cNo. Ever since I came to the United States ... I couldn\u2019t go back.\u201d R. 103. This suggests that Song understood the question to ask if she had ever returned to China <em>since arriving in the United States. </em>When Song explained that this was her mistaken understanding of the question, the government attorney misquoted his earlier question as specifically asking \u201cif [Song] went to Malaysia and returned to China.\u201d R. 105. The IJ rejected Song\u2019s explanation that she was \u201cnervous\u201d and \u201cdid not hear clearly.\u201d R. 106. Although the IJ is not required to credit even plausible explanations, <em>see Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80 (2d Cir.2005), the IJ\u2019s apparent failure to consider the colloquy in context \u2014 particularly Song\u2019s reference to the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>States after her \u201cemphatic ... no\u201d \u2014 -was error. <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167. Further, Song listed the trip to Malaysia and return to China in her asylum application and provided documentation of the trip, but the IJ never considered this production in deciding that Song\u2019s inconsistency supported a negative credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The IJ also found Song not credible because she \u201cexhibited a very poor demeanor.\u201d R. 73. At her hearing, Song testified that she underwent a forced abortion in China. The IJ reported that Song \u201cput on an expression of great seriousness and stared at the Court\u201d when asked where the forced abortion was performed. At other times, she \u201cgrew very emotional\u201d when asked about the abortion, \u201cwas perturbed frequently,\u201d and often \u201cwiden[ed]\u201d her eyes while testifying. <em>Id. </em>The IJ found these actions \u201ccontrived.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although we extend \u201cparticular deference\u201d to an IJ\u2019s assessment of an applicant\u2019s demeanor, <em>Jin Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 104, 113 (2d Cir.2005), we can be \u201cmore confident\u201d in our review of a credibility determination when the IJ\u2019s assessment of demeanor is supported by \u201cspecific examples of inconsistent testimony.\u201d <em>Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 109 (2d Cir.2006). In light of our foregoing decision that the IJ erred by finding Song\u2019s statements inconsistent, we do not believe the IJ\u2019s assessment of her demean- or in this ease is sufficient to support an adverse credibility determination. Song testified about her surprise pregnancy, a graphic and painful forced abortion, and the loss of her job as a consequence of her unauthorized pregnancy. Under such circumstances, it is unsurprising that a truthful witness might become highly emotional and respond to questions about the event with great seriousness. <em>See Juan Chen v. Holder, </em>658 F.3d 246, 252 (2d Cir.2011) (per curiam) (noting that a \u201cnonchalant[ ]\u201d description of a forced abortion could support a finding that a petitioner failed to sustain her burden of proof on an asylum claim). The IJ was in the best position to assess Song\u2019s demeanor, and we do not dispute his observation that her testimony appeared \u201ccontrived.\u201d But in this case that determination alone is not enough to support an adverse credibility determination. <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Finally, the IJ and BIA relied on a lack of corroboration as a basis for the adverse credibility determination. Because credible testimony may, by itself, be sufficient to support an application for asylum, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii), \u201ca failure to corroborate cannot, without more, support an adverse credibility determination.\u201d <em>Liu v. Holder, </em>575 F.3d 193, 198 n. 5 (2d Cir.2009). Here, the IJ gave little to no weight to Song\u2019s corroborating documentary evidence, but did not find this evidence to be inconsistent with Song\u2019s testimony or to reflect negatively on her credibility. R. 74-75. Given the foregoing alone, this simple lack of corroboration cannot tip the totality of the circumstances toward supporting the IJ\u2019s credibility determination. <em>See Li v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 141, 150 (2d Cir.2008) (holding that remand is appropriate if the outcome may change when proper factors are considered).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">On remand, the agency is free to determine, <em>inter alia, </em>whether Song met her burden of proof. <em>See Liu, </em>575 F.3d at 198 n. 5 (holding that lack of corroboration alone may \u201csupport a finding that an alien has not met his burden of proof\u2019). In addressing corroboration, the agency should be cognizant that the IJ and BIA took differing approaches to Song\u2019s medical evidence. The IJ gave little weight to Song\u2019s hospital records after observing that the Chinese government often creates false documents, R. 74-75, while the BIA took administrative notice (without provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>ing Song an opportunity to respond) of a State Department report that suggests China does not issue documentation for involuntary abortions, R. 4. <em>See Chhetry v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>490 F.3d 196, 199-200 (2d Cir.2007) (per curiam) (noting that the BIA may take administrative notice of certain facts, but that petitioners should generally have the opportunity to challenge those facts). We decline to address Song\u2019s new argument regarding her competency because she did not raise it below. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 119-20 (2d Cir.2007). Song may present any new evidence on remand. <em>In re Patel, </em>16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 600, 601 (B.I.A. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED and the case is REMANDED to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this order. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
