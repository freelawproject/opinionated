Dickerson is barred from proceeding in forma pauperis (IFP) under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) because, on at least three prior occasions while incarcerated, he has brought a civil action in a court of the United States that was dismissed as frivolous, malicious, or for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>See Dickerson v. Anderson, </em>No. 4:07-CV-0009 (N.D.Tex. Feb. 16, 2007) (dismissing civil rights complaint for failure to state a claim); <em>Dickerson v. Tarrant County Jail, </em>No. 4:06-CV-0793 (N.D.Tex. Dec. 15, 2006) (dismissing civil rights complaint for failure to state a claim); <em>Dickerson v. Tarrant County Jail, </em>No. 4:06-CV-0743 (N.D.Tex. Oct. 25, 2006) (dismissing civil rights complaint for failure to state a claim). Further, the record does not reflect that Dickerson is \u201cunder imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-21\">Accordingly, Dickerson\u2019s IFP status is decertified, and the appeal is dismissed. Dickerson has 15 days from the date of this opinion to pay the full appellate filing fee to the clerk of the district court, should he wish to reinstate his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-22\">IFP DECERTIFIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b543-17\"> Pursuant to. 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
