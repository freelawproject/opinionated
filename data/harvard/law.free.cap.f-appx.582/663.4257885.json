The evidentiary hearing amounted to a bench trial-at which the court could determine witness credibility, and decide disputed facts-because Hawkins did not timely request a jury trial. <em>See Hartsfield v. Colburn, </em>491 F.3d 394, 395-96 (8th Cir. 2007); <em>Darst-Webbe Tenant Ass\u2019n Bd. v. St. Louis Rous. Auth., </em>339 F.3d 702, 710-11 (8th Cir.2003) (in appeal from civil bench trial, this court reviews trial court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law de novo). We find no basis, and Hawkins offers none,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for reversing the district court\u2019s disposition of his claims. <em>See Scott v. Benson, </em>742 F.3d 335, 339-40 (8th Cir.2014) (discussing deliberate-indifference standard, which requires mental state akin to criminal recklessness; mere difference of opinion over course of treatment or matters of expert medical judgment does not amount to constitutional violation); <em>see also Jackson v. Nixon, </em>747 F.3d 537, 543 (8th Cir.2014) (supervisory liability under \u00a7 1983). The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b691-19\">.

Bryant, United States Magistrate Judge for the Western District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b691-25\">. We do not address the new matters Hawkins raises in his opening and reply briefs, <em>see Stone v. Harry, </em>364 F.3d 912, 914-15 (8th Cir.2004); or those he has waived, <em>see Jenkins v. Winter, </em>540 F.3d 742, 751 (8th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
