Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, applying the standards governing adverse credibility determinations created by the REAL ID Act. <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039-40 (9th Cir.2010). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">With respect to Wang\u2019s claim based on her alleged forced abortion, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding based on the omission of the abortion from her asylum application. <em>See Zamanov v. Holder, </em>649 F.3d 969, 973 (9th Cir.2011) (\u201cMaterial alterations in the applicant\u2019s account of persecution are sufficient to support an adverse credibility finding.\u201d). With respect to Wang\u2019s religious persecution claim, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that she failed to carry her evidentiary burden of proof. <em>See Ren v. Holder, </em>648 F.3d 1079, 1093-94 (9th Cir.2011) (setting forth analysis IJ must undertake before relying on lack of corroborative evidence). Accordingly, Wang\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Because she failed to establish eligibility for asylum, Wang necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 1094 n. 17; <em>Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Further, Wang\u2019s CAT claim also fails because she has not established that it is more likely than not that she would be tortured if removed to China. <em>See Ren, </em>648 F.3d at 1094 n. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">Finally, we lack jurisdiction to consider Wang\u2019s arguments that she is a member of a disfavored group or that she faces persecution or torture as a result of leaving China illegally, because she did not raise these issues before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir. 2004). Similarly, we lack jurisdiction to review Wang\u2019s unexhausted claim that she received ineffective assistance from her former attorney. <em>See Puga v. Chertoff, </em>488 F.3d 812, 815-16 (9th Cir.2007) (ineffective assistance of counsel claims must be raised in a motion to reopen before the BIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b730-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>ed by 9th Cir.
