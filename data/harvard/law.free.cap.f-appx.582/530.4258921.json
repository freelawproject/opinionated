The district court imposed a sentence of 120 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. Garcia-Benitez argues that his above-guidelines sentence is unreasonable because the guidelines range adequately accounted for his conduct and the deaths of seven illegal aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-21\">The 120-month sentence challenged by Garcia-Benitez was the result of an upward variance from the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008). Because Garcia-Benitez did not object to the reasonableness of his sentence before the district court, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragor-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). Garcia-Benitez thus must show an error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The record indicates that the district court properly considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The 120-month sentence reflected the seriousness of GarciaBenitez\u2019s offense, the need to promote respect for the law, the need to provide just punishment, and the need to protect the public from future crimes. The sentence imposed \u201cwas reasonable under the totality of the relevant statutory factors.\u201d <em>Brantley, </em>537 F.3d at 349 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see also United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b558-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
