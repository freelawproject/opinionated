Wills alleged that the restrictions imposed by his security status, segregation, handcuffing, and shackling whenever he left his housing unit, violated his right as a pretrial detainee to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">When, as in this case, a district court certifies that an appeal is not taken in good faith under \u00a7 1915(a)(3), the appellant may either pay the filing fee or challenge the court\u2019s certification decision. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into an appellant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). If we uphold the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith, the appellant must pay the filing fee or, alternatively, we may dismiss the appeal sua sponte under 5th Circuit Rule 42.2 if it is frivolous. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">A condition or restriction of pretrial detention that constitutes punishment implicates the protection against the deprivation of liberty without due process. <em>Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 535, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). A restriction is not punitive if it is \u201creasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective,\u201d such as \u201cmaintaining jail security.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539-40, 99 S.Ct. 1861. Courts should ordinarily defer to the expertise of correctional officials. <em>Id. </em>at 540 n. 23, 99 S.Ct. 1861.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Wills\u2019s security status was based on the amount of his bond, $500,000, for a charge of second degree murder. He has not raised a nonfrivolous issue for appeal regarding whether the restrictions were not reasonably related to the jail\u2019s security interests and therefore punitive, particularly in light of the factors to be considered in determining the amount of bail and the deference owed to the correctional officials\u2019 judgment. <em>See Bell, </em>441 U.S. at 539-40 &amp; n. 23, 99 S.Ct. 1861; La.Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 334(1), (2), (3), (5). Accordingly, Wills\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g); <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Wills has two other strikes. <em>See Wills v. Davis, et al., </em>No. 5:96-CV-2836 (W.D.La. Mar. 31, 1997); <em>Wills v. Ott, et al., </em>No. 5:96-CV-2879 (W.D.La. Apr. 17, 1997). As Wills has accumulated at least three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed in a court of the United States while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g). Wills is further warned that any future frivolous or repetitive filings in this court or any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction will subject him to additional sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b548-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
