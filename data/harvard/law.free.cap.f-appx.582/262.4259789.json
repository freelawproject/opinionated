Brown seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to dismiss his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2012) action against Defendants. Brown has also filed a motion for appointment of counsel. We deny Brown\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-16\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P.' 4(a)(6). \u201c[T] he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360,168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-19\">The district court\u2019s judgment was entered on the docket on November 22, 2013. Brown filed his notice of appeal on May 6, 2014.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, Brown\u2019s notice of appeal is untimely. Although Brown suggests that he timely filed a notice of appeal soon after receiving notice of the district court\u2019s dismissal order, Brown provides no proof that his notice of appeal was timely filed. Moreover, Brown\u2019s May 6, 2014 notice of appeal cannot satisfy the requirements for a motion for extension or a reopening of the appeal period and, thus, it will not be construed as such. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), (a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-20\">Based on the foregoing, we deny Brown\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-21\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b291-17\"><em> Houston v.
