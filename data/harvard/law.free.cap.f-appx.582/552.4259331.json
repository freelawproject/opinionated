On appeal, Lopez contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to continue sentencing so as to allow him additional time to debrief.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-22\">We review the denial of a continuance for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Stalnaker, </em>571 F.3d 428, 439 (5th Cir. 2009). Lopez must demonstrate that the denial \u201cresulted in specific and compelling or serious prejudice.\u201d <em>United States v. Barnett, </em>197 F.3d 138, 144 (5th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We will uphold the district court\u2019s decision, even if it was harsh, as long as it was not arbitrary or unreasonable. <em>See Stalnaker, </em>571 F.3d at 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-23\">Lopez has failed to show that the denial of the continuance was arbitrary or unreasonable. <em>See id. </em>In denying the continuance, the district court voiced its concern why efforts to debrief had been unsuccessful and was apparently unmoved by the proffered reason, to wit, the agent\u2019s availability and trying to coordinate the parties\u2019 schedules. The court further suggested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>that a continuance was unnecessary because it could \u201crevisit\u201d any sentence reduction upon the appropriate motion from the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Lopez\u2019s assertion that he was prejudiced because it is likely that he would have a received a lesser sentence is unsupported and speculative. And, as pointed out by the Government, Lopez\u2019s assertion of a lesser sentence is refuted by the fact that during the two months following his plea, Lopez provided no cooperation. Further, as noted by the district court, whether the continuance was granted or not, it could consider any sentence reduction upon a proper motion by the Government. In short, Lopez has not alleged, much less demonstrated, that he suffered \u201cspecific and compelling or serious prejudice\u201d from the denial of the continuance. <em>Barnett, </em>197 F.3d at 144. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b580-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
