Walker, proceeding pro se, has filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, asking us to compel the District Court to act on his pending motion filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. We will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-19\">In April 2014, Walker filed a \u00a7 2255 motion challenging his 1992 conviction for attempted income tax evasion, for which he has served his sentence. In September 2014, he filed the present petition for a writ of mandamus, alleging delay and asking this Court to order the District Judge assigned to the matter to expeditiously rule on his motion, or to order that another District Judge rule on the motion. In the alternative, Walker asks this Court to rule on his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-20\">Mandamus is a drastic remedy that should be granted only in extraordinary circumstances. <em>In re Diet Drugs Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>418 F.3d 372, 378 (3d Cir. 2005). It may be used \u201cto confine an inferior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or to compel it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). To demonstrate that mandamus is appropriate, a petitioner must establish that he or she has \u201cno other adequate means\u201d to obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>the relief requested, and that he or she has a \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d right to issuance of the writ. <em>Madden v. Myers, </em>102 F.3d 74, 79 (3d Cir.1996), <em>superseded in part on other grounds by </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 24.1(c) (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">As a general rule, \u201cmatters of docket control\u201d are within the sound discretion of the District Court. <em>In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litig., </em>685 F.2d 810, 817 (3d Cir. 1982). Nonetheless, an appellate court may issue a writ of mandamus when an undue delay in adjudication is \u201ctantamount to a failure to exercise jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Madden, </em>102 F.3d at 79. This case, however, does not present such a situation. A delay of approximately six months in the disposition of Walker\u2019s pending motion \u201cdoes not yet rise to the level of a denial of due process,\u201d and is not so lengthy as to justify our intervention at this time. <em>Id. </em>We are confident that the District Court will rule on Walker\u2019s motion without undue delay. Accordingly, the petition for a writ of mandamus is denied. This denial is without prejudice to Walker\u2019s filing a new petition for a writ of mandamus should the District Court fail to act on his \u00a7 2255 motion within a reasonable time.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b166-12\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
