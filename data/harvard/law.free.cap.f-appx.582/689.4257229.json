We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>review for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s denial of leave to proceed IFP. <em>Tripati v. First Nat\u2019l Bank &amp; Trust, </em>821 F.2d 1368, 1369 (9th Cir.1987). We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">The district court denied Serrano\u2019s motion to proceed IFP because it determined that the action was barred under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). However, the action was not Heck-barred because Serrano did not allege that he had been convicted, and it was not clear from the allegations in the complaint whether his criminal proceedings were ongoing or had concluded. <em>See Wallace v. Kato, </em>549 U.S. 384, 393-94, 127 S.Ct. 1091, 166 L.Ed.2d 973 (2007) (recognizing that <em>Heck </em>applies only when an outstanding criminal conviction already exists and noting that civil proceedings may be stayed while related criminal charges are pending).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The district court also indicated in its order denying IFP that Serrano had made an inadequate showing of indigency and had not obtained certification of his prison account balance from an authorized officer. On remand, the district court should allow Serrano to supplement his showing of indigency and, if applicable, to obtain any necessary certification from prison officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b717-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
