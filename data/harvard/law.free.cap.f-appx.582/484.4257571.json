Madrid did not appeal. His 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion was denied, and he filed an unsuccessful motion for authorization to file a second \u00a7 2255 motion. His \u00a7 2241 petition was filed in 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Madrid asserts, in the light of <em>United States v. Santos, </em>553 U.S. 507, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008), that he was convicted of nonexistent offenses. Citing <em>Garland v. Roy, </em>615 F.3d 391, 397-404 (5th Cir.2010), and <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir. 2001), he contends he is entitled to assert his claims via the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">Along that line, and as a general rule, a federal prisoner seeking to collaterally challenge the legality of his conviction or sentence must file a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425-26 (5th Cir.2005). Such claims may be raised in a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) only if the prisoner shows the \u00a7 2255 remedy is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention\u201d. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). When a prisoner appeals the dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition, we review the \u201cdistrict court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its rulings on issues of law <em>de novo </em>\u201d. <em>Padilla, </em>416 F.3d at 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-14\">Madrid\u2019s \u00a7 2255 remedy was not inadequate for purposes of the savings clause simply because he filed an unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motion and was unable to meet the requirements for filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 878 (5th Cir.2000) (per curiam). To show his \u00a7 2255 remedy was inadequate, Madrid was required to raise a claim of actual innocence: \u201c(i) that [wa]s based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that [he] may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in [his] trial, appeal or first \u00a7 2255 motion\u201d. <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904. Madrid\u2019s <em>Santos-hased </em>claims do not meet that standard. For example, <em>Santos </em>was decided in 2008, prior to Madrid\u2019s pleading guilty in 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-15\">Madrid also asserts, but fails to establish, that the district court abused its discretion in denying his request for discovery to support jurisdiction. <em>See Hernandez v. Garrison, </em>916 F.2d 291, 293 (5th Cir.1990); <em>see also Moore v. Willis Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>233 F.3d 871 (5th Cir. 2000) (\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s discovery decisions for abuse of discretion and will affirm such decisions unless they are arbitrary or clearly unreasonable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b513-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
