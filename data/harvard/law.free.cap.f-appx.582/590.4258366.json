Arthur Smith pleaded guilty to multiple counts relating to his armed robbery of a CVS pharmacy in Sevierville, Tennessee. The district court sentenced Smith as a career offender, under \u00a7 4B 1.1(c) of the Guidelines Manual, to 262 months of imprisonment. It relied on Smith\u2019s prior conviction for North Carolina common-law robbery. Smith argues that: 1) his past conviction cannot serve as a predicate offense because it does not constitute a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Guidelines Manual; and 2) judicial fact-finding of prior convictions violates the Sixth Amendment. Because the district court correctly held both that North Car<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>olina common-law robbery qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and that Supreme Court precedent forecloses Smith\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim, we affirm the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">On April 23, 2013, Arthur Smith pleaded guilty, without a plea agreement, to: robbing a pharmacy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2118(a); brandishing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of \u00a7 924(c)(1); and being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of \u00a7 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">A. Presentence Report</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Smith\u2019s presentence report<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> determined that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2133.1(a) provided a base offense level of 20 for the pharmacy-robbery conviction. Because Smith took controlled substances from the pharmacy during the robbery, the presentence report increased his offense level by one, under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(6). And because the loss resulting from Smith\u2019s robbery was more than $10,000, the presentence report increased his offense level by one additional level, under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(7)(B). The presentence report assigned Smith a total offense level of 22 for the pharmacy-robbery conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">Additionally, the presentence report determined that \u00a7 2K2.1 provided the base offense level for the sentencing of offenses under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). Because Smith had at least two prior felony convictions for controlled-substance offenses or for what the Manual refers to as \u201ccrimes of violence,\u201d his base offense level was 24, under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">The presentence report noted that \u00a7 2K2.4 applies to the sentencing of offenses under \u00a7 924(c), the statute proscribing brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence. The report noted that, under \u00a7 2K2.4(b), the guideline sentence for a \u00a7 924(c) conviction is the minimum term of imprisonment required by statute. The report further noted that the statutory minimum in Smith\u2019s case was seven years, consecutive to the punishment for the underlying crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-14\">The presentence report determined that Smith\u2019s criminal history qualified him as a \u201ccareer offender\u201d under \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). Specifically, the report found that Smith was at least eighteen years old at the time he committed the robbery, that one of Smith\u2019s current convictions was for either a crime of violence or a controlled-substance offense, and that Smith had at least two prior felony convictions for controlled-substance offenses or crimes of violence. Ordinarily, a career offender\u2019s offense level, if greater than the offense level otherwise applicable, derives from the career-offender table in \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). The report, however, noted that this table was not applicable because \u00a7 4Bl.l(c) specifically contains a separate method of calculating the guideline range for career offenders convicted of violating \u00a7 924(c), i.e., possessing a firearm during a crime of violence. In particular, the Guidelines Manual instructs that the guideline range for a \u00a7 924(c) defendant, who also has other counts of conviction, is the greater of: (A) the sum of the mandatory minimum penalty under \u00a7 924(c) and the minimum and maximum of the otherwise applicable guideline range for the non-\u00a7 924(c) counts; or (B) the guideline range determined using the special \u00a7 924(c) career-offender table in \u00a7 4B1.1(c)(3). The presentence report ultimately determined that Smith\u2019s guideline range was 262-327 months, which results <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>from the special \u00a7 924(c) career-offender table. Although the presentence report did not \u201cshow its math,\u201d it presumably determined that this guideline range was greater than the sum of seven years \u2014 i.e., Smith\u2019s mandatory minimum penalty under \u00a7 924(c) \u2014 and the guideline range for Smith\u2019s non-\u00a7 924(c) counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">The presentence report detailed Smith\u2019s extensive criminal history, noting dozens of prior convictions, pending charges, and other arrests. The report noted that most prior convictions did not qualify for criminal-history points, largely because they were too old or insubstantial according to the Guidelines Manual. Importantly, the presentence report identified two prior convictions qualifying Smith as a \u201ccareer offender\u201d under \u00a7 4Bl.l(a): 1) a January 9, 2008, controlled-substances conviction, from Greenville, South Carolina; and 2) a February 9, 2009, common-law robbery conviction, from Buncombe County, North Carolina. The North Carolina robbery conviction forms the basis of Smith\u2019s present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Smith objected to the presentence report\u2019s classification of him as a career offender. Specifically, Smith argued that his North Carolina conviction for common-law robbery did not qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 4B1.2(a) of the Guidelines Manual. The probation officer considered Smith\u2019s objection and concluded that the robbery conviction properly qualified. The officer also stated that Smith\u2019s guideline range would be 110-137 months if the court determined that Smith was not a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">B. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">On September 30, 2013, United States District Judge Amul R. Thapar held a sentencing hearing. At sentencing, Smith renewed his previously raised objection to the career-offender designation. Smith argued that his North Carolina robbery conviction was not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Manual. After extensive oral argument on the issue, the district court overruled Smith\u2019s objection. The district court also issued a cogent written opinion on the issue, ordering the clerk to docket an appeal on Smith\u2019s behalf once judgment issued.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>Crim. No. 13-5-(3)-ART (E.D.Tenn. Sept. 30, 2013), ECF No. 74. First, the court held that North Carolina common-law robbery is not categorically a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l), the \u201cphysical-force clause.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>Crim. No. 13-5-(3)-ART, slip op. at 3. Second, the court held that North Carolina common-law robbery <em>does </em>qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l), the \u201cresidual clause.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>Crim. No. 13-5-(3)-ART, slip op. at 5. The district court, after discussion with counsel and the government, agreed that Smith\u2019s guideline range was 262-327 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">The district judge conducted a thorough discussion with counsel about the \u00a7 3553 factors and about whether a below-guidelines variance was warranted. The government argued that Smith was \u201cthe epitome of a career offender\u201d and that his case presented \u201cbasically no redeeming qualities.\u201d Smith\u2019s counsel emphasized Smith\u2019s age and poor health. The district court, noting Smith\u2019s \u201c37 arrests\u201d and \u201cmultiple robberies,\u201d declined to vary below the bot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>tom end of the guideline range. But in light of \u201cthe combination of [Smith\u2019s] upbringing, his poor health, [and] his- age,\u201d the district court imposed a sentence of 262 months of imprisonment, the bottom end of the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">On appeal, Smith argues that North Carolina common-law robbery does not constitute a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) of the Guidelines Manual and that he lacks the predicate offenses to qualify as a career offender. He also argues, as he did below, that the Sixth Amendment requires that the fact of prior conviction, if it increases the penalty, must be charged in the indictment and submitted to a jury and that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The crime-of-violence issue is important because were Smith not sentenced as a career offender, his sentence would be significantly lower than the 262-month sentence that he received.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s legal conclusions underlying the guideline range chosen. <em>United States v. Bolds, </em>511 F.3d 568, 579 (6th Cir.2007); <em>see, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez, </em>664 F.3d 1032, 1035 (6th Cir.2011) (de novo review of whether aggravated assault, under Ohio law, qualified as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">A. Career Offender</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">The Guidelines Manual instructs sentencing courts, when calculating a defendant\u2019s guideline range, to determine the offense-guideline section applicable to the offense of conviction. \u00a7 1B1.1(a)(1). The presentence report correctly determined that \u00a7 2B3.1 is the guideline section applicable to convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2118(a), \u00a7 2K2.1 is the section applicable to convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), and \u00a7 2K2.4 is the section applicable to convictions under \u00a7 924(c). Ordinarily, the Manual establishes the total offense level for a defendant convicted of multiple counts using the rules specified in Part D of Chapter Three. \u00a7 lBl.l(a)(4). The Manual, however, provides an alternate method of establishing the offense level for defendants who meet certain criteria and who qualify as what the Manual refers to as \u201ccareer offender[s].\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 lBl.l(a)(6), 4B1.1. Defendants deemed career offenders generally are assigned an offense level not from the offense-guideline section applicable to the offense of conviction but according to the specific rules of \u00a7 4B1.1. To qualify as a career offender, a defendant must meet three criteria: 1) the defendant must be at least 18 at the time of the instant offense; 2) the instant conviction must be a felony either for a crime of violence or a controlled-substance offense; and 3) the defendant must have at least two prior felony convictions for either a crime of violence or a controlled-substance offense. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">At issue in this case is the third condition \u2014 whether Smith has two prior felony convictions that count as predicate offenses. Smith\u2019s presentence report lists numerous prior criminal convictions, two of which served as predicate offenses for career-offender purposes. In 2008, Smith was convicted in South Carolina state court of possession of a controlled substance, with the intent to distribute; possession of methamphetamine; and possession of heroin. In 1999, Smith was convicted in North Carolina state court of common-law robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-14\">Smith argues that the North Carolina conviction cannot count as a predicate offense because it is not a \u201ccrime of vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>lence\u201d within the meaning of the Guidelines Manual. He does not dispute that his South Carolina conviction is a controlled-substance offense and a first predicate offense for career-offender purposes. At issue is whether Smith has a second.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">At sentencing, the district court overruled Smith\u2019s objection to counting the North Carolina conviction because the district court concluded that the offense qualified as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), the \u201cresidual clause.\u201d <em>See Smith, </em>Crim No. 13-5-(3)-ART, slip op. at 5. On appeal, Smith identifies this conclusion as error and argues that his prior North Carolina conviction does not qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d The district court observed that whether North Carolina common-law robbery is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is a \u201cmatter of first impression\u201d in this circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">B. \u201cCrime of Violence\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The Guidelines Manual itself defines \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d A \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is any crime punishable by a term of imprisonment greater than one year that \u201c[1] has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or [2] is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or [3] otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d \u00a7 4B1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The Manual\u2019s definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d closely tracks the definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d in the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA). <em>See </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). The one difference is that the Manual\u2019s enumerated-offense clause expressly refers to \u201cburglary of a dwelling,\u201d whereas the ACCA refers only to \u201cburglary.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Despite the nearly identical definitions between the Manual and the ACCA, the Manual expressly states that \u201cthe defmition[n] of \u2018violent felony\u2019 ... in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2) [is] not identical to the definitionfn] of \u2018crime of violence\u2019 ... used in [the Guidelines Manual].\u201d \u00a7 4B1.4 cmt. n.l. Notwithstanding this directive from the Sentencing Commission, we have previously determined that we decide whether an offense is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Manual in the same way as we decide whether an offense is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA \u201cbecause both share essentially the same definitions.\u201d <em>United States v. Gibbs, </em>626 F.3d 344, 352 n. 6 (6th Cir.2010); <em>see Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. 133, 140, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010) (construing \u201cviolent felony\u201d under \u00a7 924(e) by reference to the statutory definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">Under North Carolina law, common-law robbery is \u201cthe felonious, non-consenual taking of money or personal property from the person or presence of another <em>by means of violence or fear.\u201d State v. Bell, </em>359 N.C. 1, 603 S.E.2d 93, 117 (2004) (emphasis added); <em>accord State v. Smith, </em>305 N.C. 691, 292 S.E.2d 264, 270 (1982); <em>State v. Lawrence, </em>262 N.C. 162, 136 S.E.2d 595 (2004). The North Carolina Supreme Court has held that a state court may convict for common-law robbery by proving <em>either </em>violence or fear. <em>State v. Sawyer, </em>224 N.C. 61, 29 S.E.2d 34, 37 (1944) (\u201c[I]t is not necessary to prove both violence and putting in fear[ \u2014 ]proof of either is sufficient.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">North Carolina common-law robbery is not \u201cburglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, [and it does not] involve[e the] use of explosives.\u201d \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). We deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>mine, then, whether the statute falls within the Guidelines Manual\u2019s \u201cphysical-force clause\u201d \u2014 i.e., \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another\u201d\u2014 or whether the crime falls within the Manual\u2019s \u201cresidual offense\u201d \u2014 i.e., \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d \u00a7 4B1.2(a). Because the district court determined that North Carolina common-law robbery is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the residual clause, we begin there.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">C. The Residual Clause</p>\n<p id=\"ATq\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">A prior conviction qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Manual if it \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious risk of physical injury to another.\u201d \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). We must determine whether common-law robbery under North Carolina law meets this criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">In order to determine whether an offense qualifies as a predicate under the residual clause, courts must compare the elements of the prior offense of conviction with the elements contained in the residual clause. Courts must ask \u201cwhether the <em>elements of the offense </em>are of the type that would justify its inclusion within the residual provision, without inquiring into the specific conduct of the particular offender.\u201d <em>James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 202, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007) (emphasis in original). Here, the \u201cpivotal question\u201d is whether taking money or property from the person or presence of another by means of violence or fear is conduct that presents a serious risk of physical injury to another. <em>Id. </em>at 203, 127 S.Ct. 1586.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">Certain penal laws are what the Supreme Court calls \u201cdivisible\u201d offenses because they \u201cse[t] out one or more elements of the offense in the alternative.\u201d <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2281, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013). When a state \u201clist[s] potential offense elements in the alternative,\u201d it \u201crenders opaque which element played a part in the defendant\u2019s conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2283. The Court gave, as an example of a \u201cdivisible\u201d statute, one \u201cstating that burglary involves entry into a building or an automobile.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2281.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-13\">Under this understanding, common-law robbery under North Carolina law is a divisible offense because it \u201ccomprises multiple, alternative versions of the crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2284; <em>see United States v. Covington, </em>738 F.3d 759, 764 (6th Cir.2014) (Michigan prison-escape statute divisible under <em>Descamps </em>because it \u201clists several, alternative ways to violate the statute\u201d); <em>United States v. Hockenberry, </em>730 F.3d 645, 669 (6th Cir.2013) (Pennsylvania burglary statute divisible under <em>Descamps </em>because it \u201clists alternative elements in the statutory text\u201d). A person commits common-law robbery in North Carolina when he non-consensually takes \u201cmoney or personal property from the person or presence of another by means of <em>violence or fear.\u201d Bell, </em>603 S.E.2d at 117 (emphasis added). Because the crime has alternative elements, common-law robbery under North Carolina law, is, as the district court correctly concluded, a divisible offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-14\">In order to compare the elements of an offense to those in the residual clause, courts employ what the Supreme Court has \u201clabeled (not very inventively) the \u2018modified categorical approach.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Des</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number><em>camps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2281. This approach is a two-step process. First, courts determine whether \u201cone alternative (say, a building) matches [the] elements]\u201d in the residual clause\u201d but whether \u201cthe other (say, an automobile) does not.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(parenthetical in original). If that is the case, then courts can \u201cconsult a limited class of documents, such as indictments and jury instructions, to determine which alternative formed the basis of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Only then can the court \u201cdo what the categorical approach demands: compare the elements of the crime of conviction ... with the elements\u201d contained within the residual clause. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">As explained above, common-law robbery under North Carolina law is a divisible offense. Consider two alternatives of the elements provided by the North Carolina Supreme Court. One version requires taking money or property from a person by means of violence. Another requires taking money or property from a person by means of fear. In order for North Carolina common-law robbery categorically to be a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Guidelines Manual, we must conclude that <em>both </em>alternative sets of elements\u2014 taking by means of violence and taking by means of fear \u2014 present a serious risk of physical injury to another. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Mitchell, </em>743 F.3d 1054, 1065-66 (6th Cir.2014). Smith does not argue that taking money or property by means of violenee does not present a serious risk of physical injury to another. Our focus, then, is whether accomplishing the robbery <em>by means of fear </em>presents a serious risk of physical injury to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The North Carolina Supreme Court has interpreted the word \u201cfear\u201d as an element of robbery. In <em>State v. Moore, </em>the defendant in a robbery case argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction because the victim testified \u201cthat he \u2018was not scared or in fear of (his) life.\u2019 \u201d 279 N.C. 455, 183 S.E.2d 546, 547 (1971). The North Carolina Supreme Court interpreted \u201cfear\u201d expansively: it noted that the word \u201cfear\u201d in the definition of common-law robbery \u201cis not confined to fear of death\u201d and that common-law robbery does not require \u201cthe use or threatened use of a firearm or other dangerous weapon.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although fear of death is not necessary, the state supreme court has contemplated that \u201cfear\u201d refers to fear of bodily injury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">No matter how slight the cause creating the fear may be or by what other circumstances the taking may be accomplished, if the transaction is attended with such circumstances of terror, such threatening by word or gesture, as in common experience are likely to create an apprehension of danger and induce a man to part with his property <em>for the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number><em>sake of his person, </em>the victim is put in fear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-5\"><em>State v. Sawyer, </em>224 N.C. 61, 29 S.E.2d 34, 37 (1944) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>accord State v. Elkins, </em>210 N.C.App. 110, 707 S.E.2d 744, 748 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Based on the North Carolina Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of \u201cfear,\u201d Smith argues that North Carolina common-law robbery covers conduct that does not present a serious risk of physical injury. Surely Smith is correct that the offense definition <em>could </em>cover <em>some </em>conduct that does not present a serious risk of physical injury. One can imagine a robbery that reasonably places a person in fear yet does not present a serious risk of physical injury. Smith argues that \u201cfear does not have to be [fear] of physical injury.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Yet the law is just the opposite: a person must be in fear \u201cfor the sake of his person.\u201d <em>Sawyer, </em>29 S.E.2d at 37. Taking money or property from the person or presence of another by placing that person in fear of bodily injury, then, does generally present a serious risk of physical injury to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Our conclusion would not be different even if Smith were correct that the element of fear in North Carolina common-law robbery did not require fear of physical injury. He, cleverly, offers examples of robbery by means of \u201cfear of losing a job\u201d and \u201cfear of financial ruin.\u201d These kinds of robberies are, indeed, conceivable: \u201cGive me your money, or else I\u2019ll tell my uncle to fire you!\u201d and \u201cGive me your money, or else I\u2019ll expose your Ponzi scheme!\u201d These hypotheticals, though perhaps the stuff of law-school exams, are not the basis of the analysis. There are, of course, ways of committing robbery that do not \u201cpose a realistic risk of confrontation or injury to anyone.\u201d <em>James, </em>550 U.S. at 207, 127 S.Ct. 1586. But the Supreme Court has held that analysis under the residual clause, even when the analysis addresses a portion of a divisible statute, rests on \u201cinherently probabilistic concepts.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201c[T]he proper inquiry ... is whether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, <em>in the ordinary case, </em>presents a serious potential risk of injury to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 208, 127 S.Ct. 1586 (emphasis added). We think that, <em>in the ordinary case, </em>robbing someone by means of placing him in fear for his person <em>does </em>present a serious risk of physical injury. Here, the mere possibility that a person could, conceivably, commit the offense without creating a serious risk of physical injury to another is insufficient to move North Carolina common-law robbery outside the residual clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">Additionally, focusing on exceptional, hypothetical cases is a misapplication of the modified categorical approach. We have sometimes said that \u201c[i]f it is possible to violate the statute in a way that would constitute a crime of violence and in a way that would not, the court may consider the indictment, guilty plea, or similar documents to determine whether they necessarily establish the nature of the prior conviction.\u201d <em>Gibbs, </em>626 F.3d at 352. In light of recent Supreme Court decisions, we clarify that this is not quite right. \u201cOne can always hypothesize unusual cases in which even a prototypically violent crime might not present a genuine risk of injury.\u201d <em>James, </em>550 U.S. at 208, 127 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>1586. Accordingly, the inquiry is not whether it is possible for a defendant to commit a crime in a way that would not be a violent felony. As the Supreme Court said last year, the sentencing court must \u201clook only to the fact that the defendant ha[s] been convicted of crimes falling within certain categories, and not to the facts underlying the prior convictions.\u201d <em>Descamps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2286. Here, the mere fact that Smith was convicted of North Carolina common-law robbery \u2014 regardless under which version of elements \u2014 is sufficient to make that offense a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Guidelines Manual. We need not consider whether the offense also qualifies as a crime of violence under the physical-force clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">In light of the difficulties presented by analysis under the residual clause,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> our circuit has at times reached varying results about whether various state theft offenses qualify as crimes of violence. In <em>United States v. Mekediak, </em>we held that the crime of unarmed robbery under Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 750.530 \u2014 a felony committed without a weapon \u201cby force and violence, or by assault or putting in fear\u201d\u2014 \u201cfits comfortably within the residual clause of \u2018crime of violence.\u2019 \u201d 510 Fed.Appx. 348, 353 (6th Cir.2013). Similarly, we have held that larceny and attempted larceny under Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 750.530 \u2014 a felony committed \u201cby stealing from the person of another\u201d \u2014 falls within the residual clause and, therefore, is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Guidelines Manual. <em>United States v. Payne, </em>163 F.3d 371, 375 (6th Cir.1998) (larceny); <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>696 F.3d 628, 631 (6th Cir.2012) (attempted larceny). Our decision rested on the observation that Michigan interprets its larceny statute \u201cnarrowly to require that the property be taken from the possession of the victim or be taken from within the immediate presence or area of control of the victim.\u201d <em>Payne, </em>163 F.3d at 375. The Michigan decisions are squarely on point, given that \u00a7 750.530 contains the same violence-or-fear language as the North Carolina statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">Our analysis of Tennessee\u2019s robbery laws, however, has produced contradictory results in recent years. In a series of cases, we have interpreted two Tennessee robbery statutes \u2014 both of which list violence or fear as alternative elements \u2014 to determine whether convictions under them may serve as predicate offenses under the Manual and under the ACCA: Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-13-401(a) \u2014 prohibiting \u201cthe intentional or knowing theft of property from the person of another by violence or putting the person in fear\u201d and the now-repealed Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-2-501(a)\u2014 prohibiting \u201cthe felonious and forcible taking from the person of another, goods or money of any value, by violence or putting the person in fear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">First, in <em>United States v. Gloss, </em>a published opinion, we held that facilitation of aggravated robbery under Tennessee law \u2014 which requires that the crime be accomplished \u201cwith a deadly weapon or by display of an article used or fashioned to lead the victim to reasonably believe it to be a deadly weapon\u201d or where \u201cthe victim suffers serious bodily injury\u201d \u2014 is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA. 661 F.3d 317, 318-19 (6th Cir.2011). That decision rested squarely on the physical-force clause\u2014 not the residual clause. <em>See id. </em>at 318, 320 (\u201cnot deciding] whether the [offense] also qualifies under the residual clause\u201d). Second, in <em>United States v. Fraker, </em>an unpub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>lished opinion, we held that robbery under \u00a7 39-13-401(a), the current Tennessee law, is not a violent felony. 458 Fed.Appx. 461, 463 (6th Cir.2012). In <em>Fralcer, </em>we said that an offense qualifies as a predicate offense if it is a felony \u201cthat has an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We concluded that Tennessee\u2019s \u201crobbery statute includes criminal activity outside the scope of the ACCA because a defendant can violate the statute <em>by employing only fear, </em>rather than physical violence or force.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis added). <em>Fraker </em>did not address or refer to the enumerated-offense clause or the residual clause in any way, but our holding that Tennessee robbery is not a violent felony necessarily determined that the offense does not qualify under any of the three possible avenues.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The following year, in <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>another unpublished opinion, we considered convictions under the substantively identical but now-repealed \u00a7 39-2-501(a). 530 Fed.Appx. 528, 531-32 (6th Cir.2013). <em>Johnson </em>\u201cfollow[ed] the reasoning <em>of Fraker,\u201d </em>rather than <em>Gloss, </em>and declined to hold that a robbery conviction under \u00a7 39-2-501(a) \u201cis categorically a violent felony\u201d because \u201cthe robbery ... within [the] statute of conviction can be violated by employing only fear and not violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 532.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Earlier this year, in a published opinion, we held, \u201c[c]ontrary to <em>Fraker </em>and <em>Johnson,\u201d </em>that robbery under both Tennessee\u2019s repealed statute and its current statute qualify as violent felonies. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>743 F.3d 1054, 1058-63 (6th Cir.2014); <em>accord United States v. Huntley, </em>571 Fed.Appx. 402 (6th Cir.2014) (robbery under Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-13-401 also a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Guidelines Manual). We concluded that robbery under Tennessee law categorically is a violent felony under <em>both </em>the physical-force clause and the residual clause. <em>Mitchell, </em>743 F.3d at 1060. We declined to follow <em>Fraker </em>and <em>Johnson </em>because we said that those decisions \u201cturned to the colloquial understanding of fear\u201d and \u201cfailed to apply the definition of \u2018fear\u2019 enunciated by the Tennessee Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1059-60. Relevant to the <em>Mitchell </em>court was that the Tennessee Supreme Court interpreted \u201cfear\u201d in its robbery statutes to refer to \u201cfear of bodily injury and of present personal peril from violence offered or impending.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1059 (quoting <em>State v. Taylor, </em>771 S.W.2d 387, 398 (Tenn.1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">These prior decisions do not control whether common-law robbery under North Carolina law is a crime of violence. But the decision we reach is generally consistent with our own prior published decisions. We note that North Carolina\u2019s definitions of robbery and of \u201cfear\u201d are similar to Tennessee\u2019s. Our holding is limited to construing the offense of common-law robbery under North Carolina law. Every state statute, for better or worse, presents a different case when determining whether it qualifies as a crime of violence under the residual clause. ACCA decisions do not control beyond the specific statute under consideration in the jurisdiction issuing the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">The decision we reach is also consistent with opinions from other circuits, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>the circuit encompassing North Carolina. Two circuits have held that common-law robbery under North Carolina law is a crime of violence under the Guidelines Manual. <em>See United States v. Carmichael </em>408 Fed.Appx. 769, 771 (4th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>228 Fed.Appx. 422, 424 (5th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (with minimal analysis); <em>see also United States v. Ellis, </em>564 F.3d 370, 377-79 (5th Cir. 2009) (not plain error to count attempted common-law robbery under North Carolina law as a predicate offense). Additionally, the Seventh Circuit has reached the same result when analyzing Indiana\u2019s robbery statute, which has elements nearly identical to the North Carolina offense. <em>See United States v. Lewis, </em>405 F.3d 511, 514 (7th Cir.2005) (robbery under Ind. Code 35-42-5-1 is a crime of violence under the residual clause because \u201cfear\u201d under Indiana law \u201cis fear of physical injury rather than of defamation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">The district court may have incorrectly suggested that that we are bound by the Fourth Circuit\u2019s determination about whether a conviction under the law of a state within its jurisdiction qualifies as a crime of violence. At sentencing, the district court asked Smith\u2019s counsel: \u201cAnd you agree that the Fourth Circuit [opinion in <em>Carmichael </em>] is controlling unless the Supreme Court says otherwise?\u201d; and \u201cWhy isn\u2019t [the Fourth Circuit] binding at the very least[?]\u201d We clarify that whether an offense qualifies as a crime of violence under the Manual or as a violent felony under the ACCA \u201cis a question of federal law, not state law.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>559 U.S. at 138, 130 S.Ct. 1265; <em>accord Mitchell, </em>743 F.3d at 1058; <em>United States v. Rede-Mendez, </em>680 F.3d 552, 556 (6th Cir.2012) (\u201c[W]hether a crime is a crime of violence is a question of federal law.\u201d). Just as we are not bound by a state high court\u2019s interpretation of federal law, so too are we not bound by another circuit\u2019s decision. A circuit opinion concerning a state law from within its jurisdiction may be especially instructive, though reason might also suggest taking a different course. To be sure, \u201c[w]e are, however, bound by the [North Carolina] Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of state law, including its determination of the elements\u201d of common-law robbery. <em>Johnson, </em>559 U.S. at 138, 130 S.Ct. 1265; <em>accord Johnson v. Fankell, </em>520 U.S. 911, 916, 117 S.Ct. 1800, 138 L.Ed.2d 108 (1997) (No \u201cfederal tribunal has any authority to place a construction on a state statute different from the one rendered by the highest court of the State.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Smith also argues, as he did below, that the Sixth Amendment prohibits judicial factfinding of a defendant\u2019s prior convictions for the purpose of increasing a sentence. Smith correctly acknowledges that Supreme Court law forecloses his argument. \u201c[T]he Constitution does not impose th[e] requirement.... that [a defendant\u2019s] recidivism must be treated as an element of his offense.\u201d <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). The fact of prior conviction, even if it increases the maximum penalty for a crime, does not need to be \u201ccharged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 476, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Smith argues that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>should be overruled. \u201c[W]e must follow <em>[Almendarez-Torres </em>] until the Supreme Court expressly overrules it.\u201d <em>United States v. Mack, </em>729 F.3d 594, 609 (6th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Smith states that he raises the <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>claim solely to preserve the issue. It is so preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>v</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The North Carolina Supreme Court interprets \u201cfear\u201d in its robbery statute to refer to fear of bodily injury. Apart from this, the conduct encompassed by robbery by means of fear, in the ordinary case, involves fear of bodily harm. In light of this, we conclude that common-law robbery under North Carolina presents a serious risk of physical injury to another and, thus, categorically is a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2 of the Guidelines Manual. Smith\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim fails under <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>We, therefore, AFFIRM the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b619-11\">.
