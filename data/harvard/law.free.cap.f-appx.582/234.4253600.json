Following our review pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), we directed supplemental briefing on whether the district court adequately explained Ervin\u2019s sentence. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the revocation of Ervin\u2019s supervised release, vacate his sentence, and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">Generally, we will affirm a sentence imposed after revocation of supervised release if it is within the prescribed statutory range and not plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 439-40 (4th Cir.2006). In determining</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">whether a revocation sentence is plainly unreasonable, we first consider whether the sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 438. To be procedurally reasonable, the district court must, among other things, adequately explain the sentence and provide an individualized assessment based on the facts. <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">Although \u201c[a] court need not be as detailed or specific when imposing a revocation sentence as it must be when imposing a post-conviction sentence, ... it still must provide a statement of reasons for the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>595 F.3d 544, 547 (4th Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). An explanation of sentence upon revocation of supervised release \u201cshould ... provide ... assurance that the sentencing court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors with regard to the particular defendant before him, and also considered any potentially meritorious arguments raised by the parties with regard to sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Moulden, </em>478 F.3d 652, 657 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-15\">Here, the Government concedes that the district court neglected to address Ervin\u2019s request that his revocation sentence run concurrently with his undischarged state term of imprisonment. Nor did the district court offer any other explanation for Ervin\u2019s sentence. Accordingly, although we affirm the revocation of supervised release, we vacate Ervin\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See Thompson, </em>595 F.3d at 547-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-16\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b263-12\"> By our disposition, we indicate no view as to the appropriate sentence to be imposed on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
