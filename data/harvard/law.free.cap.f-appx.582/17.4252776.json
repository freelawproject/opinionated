Following their convictions on charges including the distribution of controlled substances, defendants moved for a new trial on the basis of alleged newly discovered evidence \u2014 specifically, the full names, correctly spelled, of the attorneys who had provided defendants certain counsel regarding their internet pharmacy business. The district court concluded that the allegedly new evidence failed in every respect to meet the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>requisite standard required for a new trial. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">We review the denial of a Rule 33 motion for \u201cabuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>712 F.3d 79, 107 (2d Cir. 2013). <em>See generally In re Sims, </em>534 F.3d 117, 132 (2d Cir.2008) (explaining the term of art \u201cabuse of discretion,\u201d which includes errors of law and clearly erroneous assessments of the evidence). The district court\u2019s findings will thus be upheld unless they are \u201cwholly unsupported by [the] evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>327 U.S. 106, 111, 66 S.Ct. 464, 90 L.Ed. 562 (1946); <em>accord United States v. Polisi, </em>416 F.2d 573, 576 (2d Cir.1969). In order to obtain Rule 33 relief based on a claim of newly discovered evidence, the burden is on the defendant to show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-5\">(1) that the evidence is newly discovered after trial; (2) that facts are alleged from which the court can infer due diligence on the part of the movant to obtain the evidence; (3) that the evidence is material; (4) that the evidence is not merely cumulative or impeaching; and (5) that the evidence would likely result in an acquittal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-6\"><em>James, </em>712 F.3d at 107 (citing <em>United States v. Owen, </em>500 F.3d 83, 88 (2d Cir. 2007)) (internal quotation marks omitted). We likewise review the decision as to whether to conduct an evidentiary hearing on the motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Sasso, </em>59 F.3d 341, 350 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Here, the record and relevant case law reveal that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendants\u2019 new trial motion. We affirm for substantially the same reasons stated by the district court in its thorough decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">We have considered all of defendants\u2019 arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the order of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
