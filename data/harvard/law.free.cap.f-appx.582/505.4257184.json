He alleged claims against various prison officials and employees for violating his rights to freedom of religion, equal protection, and access to courts and for retaliating against him for asserting his right to exercise his Baha\u2019i faith. The district court dismissed the case as frivolous and denied Shakouri\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Shakouri is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); FED. R. APP. P. 24(a)(5). A motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal \u201cmust be directed solely to the trial court\u2019s reasons for the certification decision.\u201d <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. As Shakouri does not address the bases for the district court\u2019s decisions dismissing his claims against the various defendants, he abandons any challenge to the court\u2019s certification that the appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Shakouri asserts that there were several procedural defects in the district court proceedings, most involving his lack of notice of the district court\u2019s rulings. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 77 requires that, \u201c[i]mmediately after entering an order or judgment, the clerk must serve notice of the entry, as provided in Rule 5(b), on each party who is not in default for failing to appear.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 77(d)(1). The clerk must also record the service on the docket. <em>Id. </em>Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5(b), service can be achieved by \u201cmailing [the paper] to the person\u2019s last known address-in which event service is complete upon mailing.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 5(b)(2)(C). A litigant\u2019s statutory right to notice under procedural rules is distinct from the constitutional right to due process. <em>See United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. Espinosa, </em>559 U.S. 260, 272, 130 S.Ct. 1367,176 L.Ed.2d 158 (2010). \u201cThe fundamental requirement of due process is an opportunity to be heard upon such notice and proceedings as are adequate to safeguard the right for which the constitutional protection is invoked.\u201d <em>Anderson Nat\u2019l Bank v. Luckett, </em>321 U.S. 233, 246, 64 S.Ct. 599, 88 L.Ed. 692 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The record belies Shakouri\u2019s claims that the clerk failed to serve him notice of the order granting voluntary dismissal of several defendants and that the court failed to rule on his attorney\u2019s objections to a motion for summary judgment. Even assuming arguendo that the clerk failed to serve him notice of the order overruling counsel\u2019s objections, a defendant is not entitled to rely on the notice required under Rule 77. <em>See Wilson v. Atwood Group, </em>725 F.2d 255 (5th Cir.1984) (en banc); <em>Latham v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>987 F.2d 1199, 1201 (5th Cir.1993). Nor does the issue present a viable due process claim, as the record shows that Shakouri received actual notice of the district court\u2019s decisions before filing the instant appeal. <em>See Luckett, </em>321 U.S. at 246, 64 S.Ct. 599. Shakouri\u2019s final suggestion that the district court erred by dismissing the majority of his claims without a hearing despite its determination that the complaint stated a claim against one of the defendants is frivolous. His failure to address the district court\u2019s bases for dismissing the claims, \u201cwithout even the slightest identification of any error in [the district court\u2019s] legal analysis or its application to [his] suit ..., is the same as if he had not appealed that judgment.\u201d <em>Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">In sum, Shakouri has abandoned his challenge to the district court\u2019s certifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>tion decision and failed to demonstrate that his \u201cappeal involves legal points arguable on their merits.\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, the motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of the case as frivolous and this court\u2019s dismissal of Shakouri\u2019s appeal count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Shakouri is WARNED that if he accumulates at least three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal in a court of the United States while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b533-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
