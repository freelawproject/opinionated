A Michigan jury convicted O\u2019Neal, inter alia, of three counts of felony murder and three counts of mutilation of a human body. As grounds for habeas relief, O\u2019Neal asserts that (1) his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel, and (2) the state unlawfully withheld exculpatory evidence in violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). The district court denied O\u2019Neal\u2019s habeas petition but granted a certificate of appealability \u201cas to both claims in the petition.\u201d We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-15\">The facts established at trial are set forth in the opinion of the Michigan Court of Appeals, <em>People v. O\u2019Neal, </em>No. 257333, 2008 WL 3851219, at *1-3 (Mich.Ct.App. Aug. 19, 2008), and those facts are presumed to be correct on habeas review. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). In pertinent part, the facts as outlined by the state appellate court are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b595-16\">O\u2019Neal\u2019s convictions arose from a \u201cdrug deal gone bad\u201d that took place at the Detroit residence of Jamal Stewart and his girlfriend, Tuwana Chambers, on November 19, 2002. On that date, before the drug deal took place, O\u2019Neal stopped by Stewart\u2019s house and accompanied Stewart to a car dealership. Stewart well knew O\u2019Neal because Stewart\u2019s mother, Felicia Stewart, had had a long-term intimate relationship with O\u2019Neal ending in 1997 or 1998.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> O\u2019Neal was in Detroit on November 19, having arrived from New York\u2014 where he then lived \u2014 several days earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-17\">While Stewart and O\u2019Neal were test driving a red Ford Explorer, Stewart received a call advising him that Christopher Kasshamoun, Rany Sharak, and Wesam Akrawi were at Stewart\u2019s house to deliver thirty-five pounds of marijuana. Kasshamoun, Sharak, and Akrawi had regularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>supplied Stewart with large quantities of marijuana for distribution. Rather than returning the Ford Explorer to the dealership, Stewart and O\u2019Neal drove the Explorer to Stewart\u2019s house to meet Kasshamoun, Sharak, and Akrawi.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Once inside the house, Stewart took possession of the wrapped package containing thirty-five pounds of marijuana and gave Sharak $29,000 in cash. While Sharak was counting the cash, O\u2019Neal said to Stewart, in private: \u201cLet me lick these niggas.\u201d Stewart responded: \u201cNo, these are my people.\u201d O\u2019Neal replied: \u201cI\u2019m your people.\u201d O\u2019Neal soon after shot and killed Kasshamoun, Sharak, and Akrawi with a .357 revolver that was lying on Stewart\u2019s credenza.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">When the bodies were all in the basement, O\u2019Neal left the house and drove to Home Depot where he purchased an electric chainsaw, Shop-Vac, garbage bags, and gloves. Upon O\u2019Neal\u2019s return, Stewart began cleaning blood from the living room floor while O\u2019Neal went to the basement and used the chain saw to dismember the body of Kasshamoun. Chambers arrived at the house around this time where she saw both Stewart and O\u2019Neal.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">At some point, Stewart placed a number of items \u2014 including the victims\u2019 bloody clothing \u2014 into garbage bags, placed the bags in the red Ford Explorer, and drove away from the house. He did not get far before two police officers stopped the Explorer. Stewart fled on foot, eluding the police officers who later identified Stewart in a lineup. A search of the Explorer revealed a large amount of marijuana and a Mac-11 nine-millimeter firearm. The garbage bags were processed by a Detroit police officer, who testified that the bags contained fifty-one items, including bloody clothes, pagers, cell phones, some monies, and identifications of Kasshamoun, Sharak, and Akrawi.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Stewart ultimately made his way back to the house where he joined O\u2019Neal, Chambers, and Stewart\u2019s older brother, Ramone. The four left the house in a friend\u2019s cab and checked into a hotel. During the cab ride to the hotel, O\u2019Neal said that he would burn down the house (the bodies were still inside). Felicia Stewart joined the group at the hotel and confronted O\u2019Neal about what had happened. O\u2019Neal explained that he couldn\u2019t let the money get away, that he didn\u2019t really intend to kill those people; but it was too much money. At the hotel, O\u2019Neal was seen with the $29,000 in his hands. Some hours after O\u2019Neal left the hotel, Stewart and Chambers saw on a television news program that their house was on fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">O\u2019Neal was ultimately arrested in New York and returned to Michigan where he was interviewed by law enforcement. According to Detroit Police Officer Gutierrez, O\u2019Neal admitted that he visited the car dealership with Stewart the morning of the murders and that he had driven the Ford Explorer that same day to Home Depot where he purchased a chain saw and Shop Vac.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">Once apprehended, Stewart entered a plea agreement with the state, pursuant to which he pleaded guilty to a firearm violation and to accessory after the fact to disinterment and mutilation, for a total of eight to twelve years imprisonment. He also agreed to testify truthfully in other proceedings involving the murders of Kasshamoun, Sharak, and Akrawi. In exchange for Stewart\u2019s plea bargain, felony murder charges against Stewart were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">O\u2019Neal was tried before a jury on three counts of felony murder, three counts of armed robbery, three counts of mutilation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>of a human body, one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, and one count of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. He was convicted on all counts following a five-day trial. The armed robbery counts were dismissed at sentencing, and O\u2019Neal is now serving three concurrent life sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Sometime during the trial, the state provided defense counsel with a report prepared by the Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cthe DEA Report\u201d or \u201cthe Report\u201d) that \u2014 according to the Michigan Court of Appeals \u2014 revealed that \u201ca person from New York named Rudy, who was related to [Stewart], came to Detroit to kill the victim after [Stewart] accepted a contract on the victim\u2019s life.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>People v. O\u2019Neal, </em>2008 WL 3851219, at *5. The Report contained in the record before this Court \u2014 and also before the district court \u2014 is incomplete.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While the Report before this Court reflects that a confidential source (\u201cSOI\u201d) \u201cbelieves\u201d \u2014 based on information the SOI heard from unidentified sources \u2014 that Kasshamoun, Sharak, and Akrawi \u201cwere killed by Jamal Stewart and his cousin Rudy, based on a contract put out on [Kasshamoun],\u201d <em>O\u2019Neal v. Woods, </em>No. 2:10cv12836-LPZ-MAR, Doc. 25-1 at 7, it does not reflect that \u201cRudy\u201d came from New York. The parties do not dispute \u2014 and we therefore accept \u2014 the state appellate court\u2019s representation that the complete Report in fact referred to \u201cRudy\u201d as a hitman who came from New York.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">Mid-afternoon on the third day of trial, the prosecutor stated on the record that defense counsel had reviewed the Report but had decided not to use it. Defense counsel acknowledged that the prosecutor\u2019s statement was \u201ccorrect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at Doc. 6-6 at 116. Later, at a post-conviction hearing, defense counsel explained that, when she said \u201ccorrect\u201d in response to the prosecutor\u2019s representation, she was simply acknowledging the trial court\u2019s earlier ruling prohibiting her from referring to the Report before the jury. Unfortunately, the side-bar conference during which the trial judge made that ruling was not recorded, leaving us with no record of what was raised, discussed, or decided during that side-bar conference. When asked at the post-conviction hearing about her failure to make a record of the sidebar discussion, O\u2019Neal\u2019s trial counsel responded: \u201cI obviously wasn\u2019t thinking because ... I know how to preserve a record and I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t say what had happened [at the side bar].\u201d Counsel admitted that she did not request a mistrial based on the late disclosure of the Report and she did not ask for an adjourn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>ment in the proceedings to allow her to investigate the information contained in the Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">On direct appeal, O\u2019Neal argued\u2014 among other things \u2014 that (1) he received ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), because his trial counsel failed to use the DEA Report to impeach witnesses and to provide an alternate theory of the crime; and (2) his due process rights were violated under <em>Brady </em>because the prosecutor failed to timely disclose the Report, which \u2014 according to O\u2019Neal \u2014 contained exculpatory information. The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected both claims in alternative holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Addressing O\u2019Neal\u2019s ineffeetive-assistance-of-counsel claim on the merits, the Michigan Court of Appeals found that it would have been an objectively reasonable trial strategy <em>not </em>to use the Report for impeachment purposes. According to the appellate court, the information in the Report \u2014 that a relative of Stewart\u2019s came from New York to kill Chris Kasshamoun \u2014 was largely consistent with the trial testimony implicating O\u2019Neal. Because the Report contained information that could be deemed prejudicial and <em>inculpatory, </em>the state court of appeals concluded that \u201cdefense counsel\u2019s waiver or failure to present the federal report ... [did not] amount[ ] to error so serious that counsel was not performing as the counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>People v. O\u2019Neal, </em>2008 WL 3851219, at *5.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">As to O\u2019Neal\u2019s claim of error under <em>Brady, </em>the Michigan Court of Appeals found that O\u2019Neal had not established error requiring reversal even assuming no waiver of the claim by O\u2019Neal\u2019s trial counsel. The state appellate court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">The failure to disclose impeachment evidence does not require automatic reversal, even where, as in the present situation, the prosecution\u2019s case depends largely on the credibility of a particular witness. The court still must find the evidence material. Undisclosed evidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A \u201creasonable probability\u201d is \u201ca probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-9\"><em>People v. O\u2019Neal, </em>2008 WL 3851219 at *9 (quoting <em>People v. Lester, </em>232 Mich.App. 262, 591 N.W.2d 267, 276 (1998)). Noting that O\u2019Neal only sought to use the DEA Report to impeach witnesses, the state appellate court concluded that the Report merely furnished an additional basis on which to impeach the state\u2019s primary witness (Stewart), whose credibility had already been shown to be questionable. In essence, the Michigan Court of Appeals determined that a reasonable probability did not exist that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different had the prosecutor disclosed the Report in a more timely manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">Further, the appellate court opined that the trial court would not have abused its discretion had it prohibited use of the Report as claimed by O\u2019Neal. According to the Michigan Court of Appeals, it fell within the trial court\u2019s discretion to disallow use of the Report because (1) \u201cthe federal report\u2019s minimal probative value as unsupported impeachment evidence is outweighed by the potential for unfair prejudice;\u201d (2) \u201cthe prejudice is obvious in that the federal report contains unsubstantiated beliefs;\u201d and (3) the \u201chearsay in the federal report would lend to confusion of the issues, and even to misleading of the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *11.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">O\u2019Neal thereafter filed a timely habeas corpus petition in federal court. Applying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>the rigorous standard of review for a state prisoner\u2019s federal habeas petition, the district court denied O\u2019Neal\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus, finding that O\u2019Neal failed to establish that the state court\u2019s adjudication of his claims resulted in a decision that involved an unreasonable application of either <em>Strickland </em>or <em>Brady.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">O\u2019Neal now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his habeas petition, arguing\u2014 among other things \u2014 that the state appellate court unreasonably applied Supreme Court law when it found that (1) his trial counsel was <em>not </em>ineffective for failing to utilize the DEA Report to offer an alternative theory of the murders and to impeach the credibility of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses; and (2) O\u2019Neal was <em>not </em>entitled to relief under <em>Brady </em>based on the late disclosure of the Report.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">In a \u00a7 2254 habeas proceeding, we review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo, applying the standards set forth in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). <em>Moore v. Berghuis, </em>700 F.3d 882, 886 (6th Cir.2012). Under the ADEPA, a court may not grant a habeas petition for \u201cany claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings\u201d unless the state proceedings (1) \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or (2) \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). A state court\u2019s decision amounts to an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established federal law if the court \u201ccorrectly identifies the governing legal rule but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Black v. Bell, </em>664 F.3d 81, 88 (6th Cir.2011). \u201c[E]ven a strong case for relief does not mean the state court\u2019s contrary conclusion was unreasonable.\u201d <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S. 86, 131 S.Ct. 770, 786, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">\u201cIf this standard is difficult to meet, that is because it was meant to be.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cSection 2254(d) reflects the view that habeas corpus is a \u2018guard against extreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice systems,\u2019 not a substitute for ordinary error correction through appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 332 n. 5, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). To obtain habeas relief from a federal court, a petitioner must show that the state court\u2019s ruling on a claim \u201cwas so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility of fairminded disagreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 786-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-13\">To establish ineffective assistance of trial counsel, O\u2019Neal must show that (1) his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient; and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To establish deficient performance, a petitioner must show that \u201ccounsel made errors so serious that coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>sel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. A court considering counsel\u2019s performance \u201cmust indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Recognizing that \u201c[a]fter an adverse verdict at trial even the most experienced counsel may find it difficult to resist asking whether a different strategy might have been better, and, in the course of that reflection, to magnify their own responsibility for an unfavorable outcome,\u201d the Supreme Court has emphasized that <em>Strickland </em>\u201ccalls for an inquiry into the objective reasonableness of counsel\u2019s performance, not counsel\u2019s subjective state of mind.\u201d <em>Harrington, </em>131 S.Ct. at 790; <em>see also Jennings v. McDonough, </em>490 F.3d 1230, 1247 (11th Cir.2007) (explaining that \u201c[t]he <em>Strickland </em>standard of objective reasonableness does not depend on the subjective intentions of the attorney, judgments made in hindsight, or an attorney\u2019s admission of deficient performance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">To establish prejudice under <em>Strickland, </em>a petitioner must show that there is \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is not enough \u201cto show that the errors had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 693. Counsel\u2019s errors must be \u201cso serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <em>see also Harrington, </em>131 S.Ct. at 792 (explaining that \u201c[t]he likelihood of a different result must be substantial, not just conceivable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">In <em>Harrington, </em>the Court explained the juxtaposition of the standards under <em>Strickland </em>and \u00a7 2254(d) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak3\">Establishing that a state court\u2019s application of <em>Strickland </em>was unreasonable under \u00a7 2254(d) is all the more difficult. The standards created by <em>Strickland </em>and \u00a7 2254(d) are both \u201chighly deferential,\u201d and when the two apply in tandem, review is \u201cdoubly\u201d so. The <em>Strickland </em>standard is a general one, so the range of reasonable applications is substantial. Federal habeas courts must guard against the danger of equating unreasonableness under <em>Strickland </em>with unreasonableness under \u00a7 2254(d). When \u00a7 2254(d) applies, the question is not whether counsel\u2019s actions were reasonable. The question is whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>deferential standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-7\"><em>Harrington, </em>131 S.Ct. at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">In this case, the Michigan Court of Appeals found that O\u2019Neal failed to establish that his trial counsel\u2019s performance with respect to the DEA Report was deficient under the first <em>Strickland </em>prong. The state court explained why a reasonable trial counsel could choose not to use the Report as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">Although at the Ginther hearing defense trial counsel maintained that she would have been effective in impeaching witnesses with the federal report ..., defense trial counsel failed to mention that the federal report ... also contains arguably prejudicial and inculpatory evidence. The federal report indicates a person from New York named Rudy, who was related to Jamal, came to Detroit to kill the victim after Jamal accepted a contract on the victim\u2019s life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4zR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Regardless of defense trial counsel\u2019s intent, not admitting the federal report ... constituted reasonable trial strategy. While defense trial counsel would have gained a minor advantage in possibly being able to impeach witnesses with the report, testimony that a hit man from New York committed the offenses is particularly prejudicial to defendant. The information in the report is especially prejudicial when considering evidence presented that defendant arrived from New York three days before the murders, that Jamal picked up defendant and rented him a room, and the manner of the offenses. Defendant claims in this regard that there is no evidence that defendant is Rudy. However, there is no dispute that defendant is from New York and has numerous nicknames, including Jason, Friday the 13th and New York. Further, defendant cedes that in questioning witnesses about the federal report, that \u201cthe witnesses would likely have denied some of these facts and allegations.\u201d Thus, we cannot conclude defense counsel\u2019s waiver or failure to present the federal report ... amounted to error so serious that counsel was not performing as the counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-5\"><em>People v. O\u2019Neal, </em>2008 WL 3851219, at *5.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">A habeas court, in reviewing a state court\u2019s denial of a <em>Strickland </em>claim, may not grant the writ if \u201cthere is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>deferential standard.\u201d <em>Harrington, </em>131 S.Ct. at 788. Here, as determined by the Michigan Court of Appeals, there <em>is </em>a reasonable argument that competent counsel could knowingly choose not to use the Report for impeachment purposes. To be sure, the Report presented a rumor implicating both Stewart and another individual named \u201cRudy\u201d in the murders. With the exception of the name \u201cRudy,\u201d however, the description of the other individual \u2014 a relative of Stewart\u2019s who came from New York \u2014 was strikingly close to O\u2019Neal, the man who, by his own admission, was with Stewart on the day of the murders and drove the Ford Explorer to Home Depot to purchase the chain saw used to dismember one of the victims. A reasonable juror could discount the rumor regarding the name \u201cRudy\u201d while attributing the other rumored descriptors to O\u2019Neal. In other words, a reasonable juror could conclude that the Report corroborated the <em>prosecution\u2019s </em>theory that the murders were committed by a relative of Stewart\u2019s \u2014 O\u2019Neal\u2014who came from New York just days before the murders. While the Report, if believed, could cast doubt on Stewart\u2019s testimony regarding his own role in the murders, it would not necessarily cast doubt on O\u2019Neal\u2019s role in the murders. Furthermore, not only does the Report contain information that could be inculpatory to O\u2019Neal, any value in terms of impeachment would be minimal given trial counsel\u2019s thorough impeachment of Stewart by other means. Balancing the potential pluses and minuses, competent counsel could decide that use of the Report for impeachment purposes was more risky than beneficial.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">To the extent O\u2019Neal now suggests that the state court\u2019s decision was unreasonable because trial counsel <em>admitted </em>\u2014 at a post-conviction hearing \u2014 that she had no strategic reason for not seeking to use the Report for impeachment purposes, his suggestion is unpersuasive. Under <em>Strickland, </em>courts give little weight to counsel\u2019s hindsight assessment of her trial actions. <em>See, e.g., Harrington, </em>131 S.Ct. at 790 (noting that the <em>Strickland </em>inquiry focuses on \u201cthe objective reasonableness of counsel\u2019s performance, not counsel\u2019s subjective state of mind\u201d); <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688-89, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (explaining that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>question is whether counsel\u2019s performance fell \u201cwithin the wide range of reasonable professional assistance\u201d that a competent criminal defense counsel could provide under \u201cprevailing professional norms\u201d); <em>Cofske v. United States, </em>290 F.3d 437, 444 (1st Cir.2002) (noting that \u201cas long as counsel performed as a competent lawyer would, his or her detailed subjective reasoning is beside the point\u201d). Instead, absent appropriate rebuttal, a court must presume that trial counsel\u2019s conduct \u201cfalls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance\u201d. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Given the record in this case, we cannot conclude that the Michigan Court of Appeals unreasonably applied <em>Strickland </em>when it found that failing to use the Report for impeachment purposes \u2014 whether by choice or otherwise \u2014 falls \u201cwithin the wide range of reasonable professional assistance\u201d that a competent criminal defense counsel could provide under \u201cprevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">O\u2019Neal claims that his trial counsel was ineffective not only because she failed to use the Report for impeachment purposes but also because she failed to use the Report to spur additional investigation. The Michigan Court of Appeals did not address this claim, although it was raised by O\u2019Neal in his appeal. The same claim was raised in O\u2019Neal\u2019s federal habeas petition and was rejected by the district court following de novo review. Addressing only the question of prejudice, and noting that O\u2019Neal had done nothing more than ask the court to speculate as to what evidence might have been uncovered with additional investigation, the district court found that O\u2019Neal failed to demonstrate \u201ca reasonable probability that additional investigation would have resulted in an acquittal, even assuming that an effective counsel would have taken steps to further investigate.\u201d <em>O\u2019Neal v. Woods, </em>No.. 10-CV-12836, 2013 WL 5340767, at *10 (E.D.Mich. Sept. 23, 2013). We agree with that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">More than two years after O\u2019Neal was convicted, the trial court held an evidentiary hearing pursuant to <em>People v. Ginther, </em>390 Mich. 436, 212 N.W.2d 922 (1973). At that hearing, O\u2019Neal\u2019s post-conviction counsel argued that it was Stewart, rather than O\u2019Neal, who committed the murders. According to counsel, the DEA Report supplied Stewart\u2019s missing motive, making trial counsel\u2019s failure to use the Report highly prejudicial to O\u2019Neal. The Report, however, constitutes rank hearsay and was itself inadmissible at trial. The portion of the Report at issue here was based on what a confidential informant heard from unknown and unnamed sources, making it triple hearsay or worse. At the evidentiary hearing, O\u2019Neal did not reveal what <em>admissible </em>evidence, if any, trial counsel might have discovered had she used the Report to spur further investigation. Rather than producing admissible evidence that might undermine confidence in the outcome of the case, O\u2019Neal instead asked the court to speculate that the outcome might have been different if only trial counsel had investigated the hearsay information contained in the Report. Speculation, however, is not enough to satisfy a defendant\u2019s burden to prove prejudice. <em>See Baze v. Parker, </em>371 F.3d 310, 322 (6th Cir.2004) (noting that where \u201cone is left with pure speculation on whether the outcome of the trial ... could have been any different,\u201d there is an insufficient showing of prejudice); <em>Villafuerte v. Stewart, </em>111 F.3d 616, 632 (9th Cir.1997) (denying petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance claim where he presented no evidence concerning what counsel would have found had he investigated further). As found by the district court, O\u2019Neal did not carry his burden of demonstrating a reasonable probability that, but for trial counsel\u2019s failure to use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>the DEA Report to spur further investigation, the result of the trial would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Pursuant to <em>Brady, </em>a defendant\u2019s due process rights are violated if the government suppresses evidence material either to guilt or punishment. <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194. A <em>Brady </em>violation thus occurs when a prosecutor \u201cwithholds evidence that is favorable to the defense and is material to the defendant\u2019s guilt or punishment.\u201d <em>Smith v. Cain, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 627, 630, 181 L.Ed.2d 571 (2012). \u201cEvidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). Where the disclosure of <em>Brady </em>evidence has been delayed rather than suppressed altogether, \u201ca defendant must show what he would have done differently had he been given more time to address the <em>Brady </em>evidence, and specifically how, had the evidence been given to the defendant earlier, a reasonable probability exists that the result of the defendant\u2019s trial would have been different.\u201d <em>United States v. Fields, </em>No. 13-5150, 2014 WL 3930528, at *11 (6th Cir. Aug. 13, 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>306 F.3d 398, 421 (6th Cir.2002) (noting that \u201c[d]elay violates <em>Brady </em>only where the delay causes prejudice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected O\u2019Neal\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim regarding the DEA Report finding, among other things, that timely disclosure of the Report would not have made any difference to the outcome of the trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In particular, the state appellate court determined that, given trial counsel\u2019s thorough impeachment of the state\u2019s principal witness by other means, the Report\u2019s incremental impeachment value was minimal. In O\u2019Neal\u2019s federal habeas case, the district court concluded that the state court \u201creasonably applied <em>Brady </em>in finding that [O\u2019Neal] had failed to establish that he was prejudiced by the late production of the federal DEA report.\u201d In the district court\u2019s words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-14\">[T]he report itself was inadmissible. [O\u2019Neal] failed during the [post-conviction] evidentiary hearing to establish that earlier production of the report would have led to admissible evidence. Therefore, as stated by the Michigan court, the only use for the report would have been to attempt to further impeach Jamal by asking him whether he had the victims killed for money, and asking other witnesses whether they sold drugs on behalf of Jamal. It is not reasonably likely that such a line of impeachment would have changed the result of the trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-15\"><em>O\u2019Neal v. Woods, </em>2013 WL 5340767, at *20.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-16\">Like the district court, we conclude that the Michigan Court of Appeals reasonably applied <em>Brady </em>when it found that O\u2019Neal failed to establish that he was prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s late production of the DEA Report. O\u2019Neal has not explained what he would have found if he had been given more time to investigate the rumors contained in the DEA Report, and he has not explained, with the required specificity, how earlier disclosure of the DEA Report would have led to a different result. He has instead relied on speculation, which is inadequate to establish prejudice in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number><em>Brady </em>context just as it is inadequate to establish prejudice in the <em>Strickland </em>context. <em>See Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 434, 115 S.Ct. 1555,131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995) (equating the prejudice inquiry under <em>Strickland </em>with the materiality inquiry under Brady).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Because we find that the district court properly denied O\u2019Neal\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Aft\">. The record reflects that Stewart and his mother lived with O'Neal for many years during Stewart's childhood. O'Neal is the father of Stewart\u2019s younger brother, and Stewart thinks of O'Neal as a stepfather.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b597-6\">. It is not clear from the record precisely when the state disclosed the DEA report to defense counsel. At the conclusion of the first day of trial, after the jury had been selected and excused for the day, the prosecutor asked the court to examine the Report, which had not then been disclosed to defense counsel, to determine whether it was discoverable. The court declined to do so. The prosecutor responded: \"Perhaps we can readdress it tomorrow. But at this point, it's not something that I wish to turn over, because of the fact that I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s discoverable, and I don't believe it's exculpatory.\u201d <em>O'Neal v. Woods, </em>No. 2:1 Ocv 1283 6-LPZ-MAR, Doc. 6-4 at 128. During a post-conviction hearing held in 2006, O\u2019Neal's trial counsel recalled that the Report may have been turned over to her before the lunch break on the third day of trial, after Stewart, his mother, his girlfriend, and two of Stewart\u2019s friends had already completed their testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b597-12\">. In his appellate brief, O\u2019Neal confirms that one page of the DEA Report is missing from the record before the federal courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b597-13\">. The record reflects that O\u2019Neal had several nicknames, including Jason, Friday the 13th, and Dee. The record does not reflect that O'Neal used \"Rudy\u201d or \u201cNew York\u201d as an alias or nickname.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b599-8\">. O'Neal also claims (1) that his trial counsel was ineffective (a) for failing to request and use letters written by Stewart and his mother, Felicia, to Stewart\u2019s brother, Ramone, while Ramone was in jail; and (b) for failing to call Keith Hale as an alibi witness; and (2) that the prosecutor's failure to turn over the jailhouse letters prior to trial constituted a <em>Brady </em>violation. These claims, which were addressed and rejected both by the Michigan Court of Appeals and by the district court, do not merit discussion here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b603-10\">. In the alternative, the state appellate court held that O'Neal\u2019s trial counsel waived use of the DEA Report, creating an adequate and independent state-law bar to relief in federal court. The district court did not address the state\u2019s procedural default defense, nor do we.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b604-6\">KAREN NELSON MOORE, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A2j\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">At the state court of appeals level, Judge Helene White dissented and would have remanded for a new trial based on <em>Brady </em>violations regarding the federal DEA report and the correspondence of Jamal Stewart and Felicia Stewart.
