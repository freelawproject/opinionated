Jan. 31, 2013), <em>aff'g </em>No. A055 434 128 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 4, 2011). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-20\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions \u201cfor the sake of completeness.\u201d <em>Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008) (quotation marks and citations omitted). The applicable standards of review are well established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-21\">Wu applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief based on his claim that he fears persecution in his home province of Heilongjiang because he has had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>more than one child in violation of China\u2019s population control program. For largely the same reasons as this Court set forth in <em>Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138 (2d Cir.2008), we find no error in the agency\u2019s determination that Wu failed to demonstrate his eligibility for relief. <em>See id. </em>at 158-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">For the foregoing reasons, this petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
