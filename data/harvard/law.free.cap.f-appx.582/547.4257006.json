He filed a purported habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the Southern District of Mississippi, where he is incarcerated. The district court construed the petition as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction. Hernandez was denied leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, and the district court certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. Hernandez now moves for leave to appeal IFP.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-22\">By moving for IFP, Hernandez contests the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(3)(A). We ask \u201cwhether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We may rule on the merits or dismiss the appeal \u201cwhere the merits are so intertwined with the certification decision as to constitute the same issue.\u201d <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-23\">Relying upon <em>Regalado Cuellar v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 550, 128 S.Ct. 1994, 170 L.Ed.2d 942 (2008), which modified the definition of money laundering under \u00a7 1956, Hernandez contends that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense. Because he attacked the validity of his conviction, his petition was properly construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877-78 (5th Cir.2000). Hernandez does not show that his claims could be brought in a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e), because he does not establish that a claim based upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number><em>Regalado Cuellar </em>was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when he could have filed a first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001); \u00a7 2255(f)(3). The action was properly dismissed because the district court did not have jurisdiction over the \u00a7 2255 motion, which could be filed, if at all, in the district where Hernandez was convicted. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Thus, Hernandez has identified no non-frivolous issue for appeal. His IFP motion is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b575-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
