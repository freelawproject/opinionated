We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Patel v. Del Taco, Inc., </em>446 F.3d 996, 998 (9th Cir.2006), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-22\">The district court properly remanded the action because, even assuming that the prosecution of the unlawful detainer action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>violated Azam\u2019s right to racial equality as a Persian-American, Azam failed to establish that the state court could not enforce this right because a California statute or a constitutional provision purported to command the state court to ignore her federal civil rights. <em>See id. </em>at 999 (setting forth Supreme Court\u2019s two-part test for removal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443); <em>California ex rel. Lockyer v. Dynegy, Inc., </em>375 F.3d 831, 838 (9th Cir.2004) (the removal statute is strictly construed against removal jurisdiction, and the burden of establishing such jurisdiction falls to the party seeking removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">We do not consider Azam\u2019s contentions regarding removal on the basis of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334 and 1441 because they are beyond the scope of review. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d) (\u201cAn order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise, except that an order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed pursuant to section 1442 or 1443 of this title shall be reviewable by appeal or otherwise.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Azam\u2019s pending motions \u2014 including for judicial notice, to strike portions of the answering brief and for sanctions against plaintiff, and for a stay and injunction pending appeal \u2014 as well as her request for reassignment of the action to a different district court judge and district, set forth in her reply brief, are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Plaintiffs request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs on appeal, set forth in its answering brief, is denied without prejudice. <em>See </em>Fed.
