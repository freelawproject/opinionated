He argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because his 168-month sentence, which is 81 months higher than a similarly situated co-conspir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>ator\u2019s sentence, results in an unwarranted sentencing disparity.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Vargas has not shown that the challenged difference between his sentence, which was based on accurate drug quantity information, and his co-conspirator\u2019s sentence, which was not, is the type of unwarranted sentencing disparity that Congress sought to eliminate under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). <em>See Pepper v. United States, </em>-U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1229, 1248-49,179 L.Ed.2d 196 (2011). Vargas fails to rebut the presumption that his within-guidelines sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b545-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
