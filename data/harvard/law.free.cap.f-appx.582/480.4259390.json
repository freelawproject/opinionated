Now, Cantu petitions this court for review of the order in which the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissed his appeal from the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">We do not have jurisdiction to consider challenges to \u201cany final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed certain designated criminal offenses, including an aggravated felony under ... \u00a7 1101(a)(43).\u201d <em>Larin-Ulloa v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 456, 460 (5th Cir .2006); <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). Nonetheless, we have jurisdiction to consider the issue whether Cantu\u2019s prior conviction is in fact an aggravated felony for immigration purposes. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">In determining whether a prior conviction falls within a statutory provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), we accord substantial deference to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the INA and the definitions of phrases within it. <em>Omari v. Gonzales, </em>419 F.3d 303, 306 (5th Cir. 2005). We then review de novo whether the particular statute governing a prior conviction falls within the relevant INA definition of an aggravated felony, rendering an alien removable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">Our review of the record shows no error in the disputed order. Insofar as Cantu argues that he does not have a COV conviction because one may commit a \u00a7 22.01 offense through inconsequential physical contact, this argument misses the mark. An offense falls under \u00a7 16(b) if the risk of substantial force is likely to arise in a given case. <em>Perez-Munoz v. Keisler, </em>507 F.3d 357, 362-64 (5th Cir.2007). \u201cBeing able to imagine unusual ways the crime could be committed without the use of physical force does not prevent it from qualifying as a crime of violence under \u00a7 16(b).\u201d <em>Perez-Munoz, </em>507 F.3d at 364; <em>cf. Zaidi v. Ashcroft, </em>374 F.3d 357, 360-61 (5th Cir.2004). This argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-14\">Next, Cantu contends that the analysis used in <em>United States v. Fierro-Reyna, </em>466 F.3d 324 (5th Cir.2006) should be used to address the issue whether his \u00a7 22.01 conviction is a COV. This argument is unavailing. <em>Fierro-Reyna </em>is materially distinguishable from the instant case insofar as it did not address the question whether a \u00a7 22.01(a)(1) offense is a \u00a7 16(b) COV because it involves a substantial risk of physical force. Cantu\u2019s argument that his prior offense is not a crime involving moral turpitude is misplaced because the BIA did not consider this issue. The petition for review is DISMISSED for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b509-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
