Two issues are presented on appeal: (1) whether the administrative law judge improperly concluded that Ms. Griffith does not have a \u201cmedically determinable mental impairment\u201d and (2) whether the administrative law judge also erred by relying upon vocational testimony that was allegedly based on inaccurate information. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the decision of the administrative law judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-14\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b584-15\">In March of 2010, Catherine Griffith (\u201cGriffith\u201d) applied for Supplemental Security Income, claiming that she suffered from bipolar disorder, depression, and nerves. As part of her application, Griffith was evaluated by several psychiatrists and doctors. The Social Security Administration also considered intellectual testing from Griffith\u2019s high school and other psychological/medical evaluations. We briefly summarize the various reports considered by the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-16\">In March of 2005, Cassaundra Murray (\u201cMurray\u201d), a certified school psychologist of the Lincoln County Schools, evaluated Griffith\u2019s intelligence when she was approximately 16 years old and determined that she fell in the \u201cBelow Average\u201d range with a \u201cFull Scale IQ Score\u201d of 62, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>falls in the lowest 2% of the population.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While noting that Griffith\u2019s communication skills were \u201ccommensurate with her peers\u201d and that she \u201cwas able to successfully solve problems requiring abstract reasoning and auditory short-term memory,\u201d Murray indicated that Griffith had a \u201cmild cognitive disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Murray also performed an Adaptive Behavior Assessment that tested the daily \u201cskills necessary to function effectively in [Griffith\u2019s] environment .... \u201d This included testing her \u201cHome Living,\u201d \u201cHealth and Safety,\u201d \u201cSelf-Care,\u201d and \u201cSelf-Direction\u201d skills. Griffith received a composite score of 81, which fell in the \u201cLow Average\u201d range, and as Murray reported, \u201cis not consistent with her overall intellectual functioning ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">On April 26, 2010, Psychiatrist Syed Raza (\u201cRaza\u201d) evaluated Griffith and diagnosed anxiety disorder and depressive disorder. Griffith scored \u201cslightly low\u201d in the assessment ratings for societal/role functioning and interpersonal functioning, but displayed no impairment with respect to her \u201cdaily living/personal care functioning,\u201d \u201cphysical functioning,\u201d or \u201ccognitive/intellectual functioning.\u201d In a followup appointment on August 2, 2010, Raza noted that Griffith was alert, \u201coriented to place, person and situation,\u201d and had fair judgment, fair insight, and linear thoughts.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Griffith underwent another evaluation on September 9, 2010, at age 21, with Dr. Timothy Baggs (\u201cDr. Baggs\u201d). During this evaluation, Griffith told Dr. Baggs that she had previously worked part-time at a Kroger\u2019s deli, but that this employment had only lasted a few months. Griffith also reported that she held a valid driver\u2019s license, though she did not drive much, and indicated that she was able to perform common household tasks, to care for her personal hygiene, to manage her personal finances, and to shop for herself. When asked about her social interactions with others, Griffith indicated that her family relationships were \u201calright,\u201d but expressed \u201cdifficulty in initiating and maintaining social relationships.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">In assessing her mental status, Dr. Baggs observed that Griffith \u201cappeared to be experiencing moderate to possibly moderately severe psychological distress in the form of depression,\u201d but noted that her \u201cthought processes did appear to be rational,\u201d \u201c[t]here was no suggestion of mental confusion or disorientation,\u201d and that \u201c[i]nsight and personal judgment were deemed fair.\u201d He ultimately estimated that her intellectual functioning fell in the low average range. Dr. Baggs further opined that Griffith \u201chad the ability to understand and remember simple instructions,\u201d that \u201c[s]he seemed capable of maintaining sustained concentration and persistence in completion of tasks in a normal amount of time,\u201d and that she \u201cmay experience moderate difficulty relating appropriately with people in either a workplace environment or social setting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-12\">Dr. Ann Demaree, Ph.D. (\u201cDr. Demaree\u201d) reviewed the Baggs Report and completed a Mental Residual Functional Capacity Assessment on September 23, 2010. In Section III of the assessment, Dr. Demaree concluded that Griffith remained able to \u201cunderstand/complete simple, routine tasks;\u201d to \u201crelate adequately to peers and supervisors where she has casual contact and no public contact;\u201d and to \u201cadapt in a task oriented work setting with few changes in routine.\u201d Dr. Jay Athy, Ph.D. (\u201cDr. Athy\u201d) reviewed the Baggs Report and found the same moderate limitations on Griffith\u2019s abilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>After reviewing the entire record and following a hearing where Griffith and a vocational expert testified, the ALJ issued a decision on September 13, 2011. At the time of the decision, Griffith was twenty-two years old, had completed eleventh grade in a special education program, and had limited work experience in the form of her part-time employment at the Kroger deli. Taking all of this information, as well as the various psychological and medical reports into account, the ALJ determined that Griffith suffered from anxiety disorder and depressive disorder that were \u201csevere\u201d in combination, but further determined there was no medically determinable mental impairment with regard to her intellectual functioning. The ALJ further concluded that Griffith had the residual functional capacity to perform \u201cwork that involves only simple, routine tasks with no more than casual contact with coworkers and the general public\u201d with a \u201ctask-oriented setting that involves few changes in routine.\u201d Then relying upon the testimony of a vocational expert, who indicated that substantial jobs existed in the national economy for a person with these limitations, the ALJ determined that Griffith was not disabled and denied her Supplemental Security Income.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Griffith subsequently requested review from the Appeals Council, which was denied on December 12, 2012. Having exhausted her administrative remedies, Griffith brought suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky and moved for summary judgment. On October 7, 2013, the district court denied the motion and affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision. Griffith appeals the ALJ\u2019s decision and the district court\u2019s affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s decision on a social security case <em>de novo. Rabbers v. Comm\u2019r Soc. Sec., </em>582 F.3d 647, 651 (6th Cir.2009). Our review is limited, however, to whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision \u201cis supported by substantial evidence and was made pursuant to proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Rogers v. Comm\u2019r Soc. Sec., </em>486 F.3d 234, 241 (6th Cir.2007)). \u201cSubstantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Heston v. Comm\u2019r Soc. Sec., </em>245 F.3d 528, 534 (6th Cir.2001) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Ultimately, if the commissioner\u2019s decision is based upon substantial evidence, we must affirm even if we would have ruled differently in the first instance. <em>See Ealy v. Comm\u2019r Soc. Sec., </em>594 F.3d 504, 512 (6th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-12\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b586-13\">Under the Social Security Act, a person qualifies for supplemental security income if they have a disability. Disability is defined as the \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d <em>Simpson v. Comm\u2019r Soc. Sec., </em>344 Fed. Appx. 181, 188 (6th Cir.2009) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A)). A five-step sequential evaluation is used to determine if a claimant has established a disability under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While the claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>ant bears the burden through step four of proving the existence and severity of limitations caused by her impairments, the burden shifts to the Commissioner at step five to identity a significant number of jobs in the national economy that the claimant can perform. <em>See Jones v. Comm\u2019r Soc. Sec., </em>336 F.3d 469, 474 (6th Cir.2003); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.912(a). Here, Griffith contends that the ALJ: (1) erred when he failed to find that Griffith has a medically determinable mental impairment with regard to her intellectual functioning, and (2) further erred by relying upon vocational testimony that was allegedly based on inaccurate information. We begin with the first contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">1. Does the complainant have a medically determinable mental impairment with regard to her intellectual functioning?</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Griffith alleges that she was disabled on the \u201cbasis of major depression, anxiety, and borderline intellectual functioning,\u201d and that the ALJ erred by failing to find that she has a medically determinable mental impairment based on her low I.Q. In order to be classified as disabled, Griffith must \u201chave a severe impairment,\u201d which \u201csignificantly limits [her] physical or mental ability to do basic work activities.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(c). A severe mental impairment is \u201cestablished by medical evidence consisting of signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings, not only by [a complaint\u2019s] statement of symptoms.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.908. Basic work activities include physical and mental tasks, ranging from walking and standing to remembering simple instructions. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.921. Griffith bears the burden of showing a severe impairment by medical evidence. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.908.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">The ALJ rejected Griffith\u2019s argument because the record as a whole indicated that her intellectual functioning was not as low as her I.Q. score indicated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Griffith counters that the ALJ has confused intellectual ability with adaptive functioning, which generally references a \u201cclaimant\u2019s effectiveness in areas such as social skills, communication, and daily living skills.\u201d <em>West v. Comm\u2019r Soc. Sec., </em>240 Fed.Appx. 692, 698 (6th Cir.2007). In actuality, Griffith has conflated the existence of a medically determinable mental impairment with a low I.Q. score. The ALJ\u2019s assessment does not begin and end solely on the basis of I.Q.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">While it is well established that an intelligence score may be helpful in assessing whether an individual has a medically de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>terminable mental impairment, it is not the sole determinative criteria, and notably the complainant has not cited a single case where a low I.Q. score was the sole basis for finding an intellectual disability. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 12.00(D)(6)(a); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520a. As the C.F.R. clarifies, \u201cintelligence tests are only part of the overall assessment.\u201d 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 12.00(D)(6)(a). \u201cThe narrative report that accompanies the test results should comment on whether the I.Q. scores are considered valid and consistent with the developmental history and <em>the degree of functional limitation.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). Case law is consistent on this point. As we emphasized in <em>Brown v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">The I.Q. score must reflect the plaintiffs true abilities as demonstrated by his or her performance at work, household management and social functioning. <em>The regulations do not limit the question of validity to test results alone in isolation from other factors. </em>In assessing the validity of a claimant\u2019s I.Q., [fin-formation from both medical and non-medical sources may be used to obtain detailed descriptions of the individual\u2019s activities of daily living; social functioning; concentration, persistance [sic] and pace; or ability to tolerate increased mental demands (stress).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">948 F.2d 268, 269 (6th Cir.1991) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). Thus, both the C.F.R. and the case law indicate that I.Q. scores should be read as part of an overall assessment that includes the individual\u2019s adaptive functioning and daily activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">Here, the ALJ acknowledged Griffith\u2019s low I.Q. of 62, but concluded that this test, which was performed when Griffith was 17 years-old, was not representative of her actual intellectual functioning. In support of this determination, the ALJ noted that the impact statement following Griffith\u2019s I.Q. score described her as having only a \u201cmild cognitive disability.\u201d The ALJ also referenced Griffith\u2019s concession that she did not qualify for \u201cintellectual disability,\u201d which is a listed disorder under 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 12.05, because she \u201cdid not have significant deficits in adaptive functioning prior to the end of the development period.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While Griffith\u2019s concession is not dispositive on the question of whether she suffered from a medically determinable mental impairment, the ALJ did not err in taking the concession under consideration when assessing her intellectual functioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">Moreover, there is ample evidence in the record as a whole and elsewhere in the ALJ\u2019s opinion that Griffith had a higher degree of intellectual functioning than her single I.Q. score indicated. For example, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>in section II of the order, the ALJ extensively discussed Griffith\u2019s normal level of adaptive functioning, including her ability to count change, perform household tasks, live independently, manage her food stamp benefits, maintain personal hygiene, drive a car, use a home computer, and maintain relationships with various extended family members. Along with those abilities, the ALJ also noted Griffith\u2019s only slightly low interpersonal functioning, her appropriate behavior during her various interviews, and her ability to answer questions without difficulty during her disability interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">In her reply brief, Griffith counters that several cases in the Sixth Circuit have found that adaptive abilities may be consistent with an I.Q. in the 60s. <em>See, e.g., Mowery v. Heckler, </em>771 F.2d 966, 971 (6th Cir.1985) (finding reliance on work history alone could not discount the individual\u2019s I.Q. of 66); <em>Brown, </em>948 F.2d at 270 (finding that claimant\u2019s abilities to use public transit, possess a driver\u2019s license, visit friends, and make change were not inconsistent with an I.Q. of 68). While this is true, all of the cases that Griffith has cited involved an analysis of 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 12.05(c), which Griffin has conceded is not at play in the present case. Additionally, Griffith has not offered an alternative to section 12.05(e), under which she would qualify as mentally impaired. Perhaps, most importantly, the ALJ in the present case, unlike in the cited cases, did not rely solely on Griffith\u2019s adaptive abilities for his conclusion that her intellectual disability did not qualify as \u201csevere.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">In particular, the ALJ expressly discussed the various psychological evaluations which indicated that Griffith only had a \u201cmild cognitive impairment\u201d or was \u201cbelow average.\u201d <em>See </em>R. 4-1, Baggs Report, PageID #290 (\u201cGriffith\u2019s intellectual functioning likely fell in the Low Average range.\u201d); Murray Report, PageID # 217, 219 (describing Griffith as possessing a \u201cmild cognitive disability\u201d and further indicating that her \u201cadaptive behavior [was] not consistent with her overall intellectual functioning, which fell in the below average range\u201d); Raza Report, Pa-geID #250, 266 (indicating Griffith did not have a \u201ccognitive/intellectual\u201d functional impairment and estimating Griffith\u2019s intelligence to be merely \u201cBelow Average,\u201d instead of \u201cBorderline Intellectual Functioning\u201d or \u201cMental Retardation.\u201d); Demaree Report, PageID #299 (failing to mention a cognitive impairment despite prompting from the psychiatric review form).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The opinions of these medical professionals consistently indicated that Griffith fell in the below-average range for general intelligence but eschewed a direct finding of borderline intellectual functioning or mental retardation. Taken together, these various psychological opinions in combination with the extensive evidence of Griffith\u2019s adaptive functioning provide substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>evidence for the ALJ to have concluded that Griffith did not have a severe mental impairment with regard to her intellectual functioning. <em>See Longworth v. Comm\u2019r Soc. Sec., </em>402 F.3d 591, 597 (6th Cir.2005) (relying on prior work experience and medical testimony to reject claimant\u2019s argument that her 51 I.Q. alone placed her in the bottom ten percent of the population in intelligence level).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Next, we address whether the ALJ impermissibly substituted his own medical judgment for those of trained professionals when he considered Griffith\u2019s adaptive functioning in assessing her intellectual functioning. <em>See Meece v. Barnhart, </em>192 Fed.Appx. 456, 465 (6th Cir.2006). Again, intellectual functioning is determined not just by considering raw I.Q. but more holistically taking into account the degree of functional limitation. Moreover, while the ALJ must base his findings of fact and legal conclusions on medical information that has been provided, we note that solicitation of an expert medical opinion is discretionary. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(e)(2); <em>Simpson, </em>344 Fed.Appx. at 189 (discussing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(f)(2)(iii) and 416.927(f)(2)(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">In <em>Foster v. Halter, </em>279 F.3d 348, 356 (6th Cir.2001), we held that the ALJ did not abuse his discretion in denying a request for additional expert testimony when there was sufficient evidence in the record for the ALJ to evaluate the claimant. <em>See also Landsaw v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>803 F.2d 211, 214 (6th Cir.1986) (\u201c[T]he regulations do not require an ALJ to refer a claimant to a consultative specialist, but simply grant him the authority to do so if the existing medical sources do not contain sufficient evidence to make a determination.\u201d). Similarly here, the record was amply developed by the psychological reports from Murray, Raza, Baggs, Demaree, and Athy. Moreover, the data consistently indicated that Griffith had low intelligence and a comparatively higher degree of adaptive functioning, making solicitation of additional medical opinions unnecessary. As the ALJ properly reviewed and weighed the reports to make a legal determination that is supported by substantial evidence, the assertion that the ALJ was \u201cplaying doctor\u201d is unsupported.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">For all of these reasons, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Griffith did not suffer from medically determinable mental impairment with regard to her intellectual functioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">2. Did the ALJ improperly rely on expert testimony from a vocational expert that was based on a flawed hypothetical?</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">In assessing at step 5 the availability of suitable work for a complainant, the ALJ may rely upon the testimony of a vocational expert. Such testimony can constitute substantial evidence, but it \u201cmust be given in response to a hypothetical question that accurately describes the plaintiff in all significant, relevant respects.\u201d <em>Felisky v. Bowen, </em>35 F.3d 1027, 1036 (6th Cir.1994). Failure to describe a complainant\u2019s limitations in all relevant respects, especially where the ALJ otherwise relies upon an expert\u2019s assessment of a claimant\u2019s limitations, can result in a finding of error. <em>See Ealy, </em>594 F.3d at 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">Here, the ALJ asked the vocational expert to assume a younger individual with an eleventh grade education, no exertional limitations, no more than occasional contact with coworkers and supervisors, and no contact with the general public. The ALJ also indicated that the person would be limited to one, two, and three-step instructions and would be required to work in a task-oriented setting with few changes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>in routine. Based on this hypothetical, the vocational expert determined that three jobs \u2014 kitchen helper, janitor, and laundry worker \u2014 existed in sufficient numbers in the national economy for an individual with such limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Griffith argues that the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical was flawed because it failed to take into account other relevant restrictions. Both Drs. Demaree and Athy concluded in Section I of their Mental Residual Functional Capacity Assessment that Griffith would experience moderate difficulty in a variety of areas, including working in coordination with or in proximity to others, completing a normal work day and performing work at a consistent pace without an unreasonable number of rest periods, and getting along with coworkers or peers without distracting them or exhibiting behavioral extremes. Griffith contends that these restrictions were relevant and should have been provided to the vocational expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">We are not persuaded. Claimant concedes, as she must, that Section I of the Mental Residual Functional Capacity Assessment is a \u201cworksheet\u201d and \u201cdoes not constitute the [Residual Functional Capacity] assessment.\u201d As the actual assessment document itself explains, Section I is intended for evaluators to record \u201csummary conclusions,\u201d while the \u201c[d]etailed explanation of the degree of limitation for each category ... as well as any other assessment information ... is to be recorded in Section III.\u201d The webpage for the Department of Social Security, to which Griffith draws our attention, also confirms that \u201cSection I is merely a worksheet ... and does <em>not </em>constitute the RCF assessment.\u201d <em>POMS DI 24510.060 Mental Residual Functional Capacity Assessment </em>(last visited 7/18/2014), available at https:// secure.ssa.gov/appslO/poms.nsf/lnx/ 0424510060 (emphasis added). In contrast, Section III is where \u201cthe actual [Residual Functional Capacity] assessment is recorded\u201d and explains \u201cthe conclusions indicated in section I, in terms of the extent to which these mental capacities or functions could or could not be performed in work settings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">These multiple sources make clear that Section III not only provides a more thorough and detailed assessment than the checklist in Section I, but also reflects the doctors\u2019 <em>actual findings </em>regarding their understanding of Griffith\u2019s work-related limitations. Additionally, the hypothetical that the ALJ ultimately posed to the vocational expert closely tracked the limitations detailed in Section III of the functional capacity assessment. It is apparent that the ALJ, in relying solely on the Section III analysis, was not acting arbitrarily or merely cherry picking from the record, as Griffith contends, but was properly applying the doctors\u2019 actual findings. We therefore conclude that the ALJ did not err in creating a hypothetical that solely referenced the Section III assessment. <em>See Webb. v. Comm\u2019r Soc. Sec., </em>868 F.3d 629, 633 (6th Cir.2004) (indicating that \u201ca hypothetical question need only reference all of a claimant\u2019s limitations, without reference to the claimant\u2019s medical conditions.\u201d). Our determination on this point is consistent with several district courts and with the Third Circuit. <em>See, e.g., Smith v. Comm\u2019r Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 632, 636-37 (3d Cir.2010) (holding, and listing cases, that indicate that a complainant cannot rely on the worksheet component of the Mental Residual Functional Capacity Assessment to contend that a hypothetical question was deficient).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">Griffith next contends that the ALJ failed to advise the vocational advisor as to all of the restrictions identified by Dr. Baggs. For example, Dr. Baggs indicated that Griffith <em>\u201cmay </em>experience moderate difficulty relating appropriately with peo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>pie in either a workplace environment or social setting\u201d and that her \u201cability to adapt and respond effectively to pressures found in normal work settings <em>seemed </em>moderately less to possibly much less than the average worker.\u201d In comparison, the ALJ indicated in his hypothetical that the worker should have \u201cno more than occasional contact with coworkers and supervisors, [and] no contact with [sic] general public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Both the ALJ\u2019s opinion and the Baggs Report speak to Griffith\u2019s social difficulties and problems adapting to the work environment, but while the Baggs Report speaks in terms of possible restrictions\u2014 the claimant \u201cmay\u201d have or \u201cseems\u201d to have problems \u2014 the ALJ sought to provide the vocational expert with more concrete information regarding Griffith\u2019s limitations. Thus, the distinction between the ALJ\u2019s language and the Baggs report is partially attributable to the need to provide the vocational expert with actionable guidance, and as this circuit has previously indicated, \u201ca hypothetical question may be incomplete, yet still accurately portray a claimant\u2019s limitations.\u201d <em>Brock v. Comm\u2019r Soc. Sec., </em>368 Fed.Appx. 622, 626 (6th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">But even assuming that the ALJ\u2019s language is less restrictive than the language from the Baggs Report, the ALJ was not required to discuss the Baggs Report verbatim. The opinion of a nontreating source or one-time examiner, such as Dr. Baggs, is not entitled to the degree of deference that is granted to a treating physician. <em>See Smith v. Comm\u2019r Soc. Sec., </em>482 F.3d 873, 875 (6th Cir.2007). Moreover, the ALJ is not required to simply accept the testimony of a medical examiner based solely on the claimant\u2019s self-reports of symptoms, but instead is tasked with interpreting medical opinions in light of the totality of the evidence. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(b); <em>Bell v. Barnhart, </em>148 Fed.Appx. 277, 285 (6th Cir.2005) (declining to give weight to a doctor\u2019s opinion that was only supported by the claimant\u2019s reported symptoms). The ALJ did precisely this.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The ALJ acknowledged Griffith\u2019s claim that her ability to respond to normal work stress was moderately less to possibly much less than the average worker, but then rejected this argument in light of the totality of the evidence. The ALJ first noted that Dr. Baggs found that Griffith was capable of understanding and remembering simple instructions; that she was capable of maintaining sustained concentration and persistence to complete tasks; and that she was oriented to person, place, and time with intact memory. The ALJ then turned to Dr. Demaree\u2019s conclusion in her functional capacity assessment that Griffith remained able to \u201cunderstand/complete simple, routine tasks\u201d and \u201crelate adequately to peers and supervisors <em>where she has casual contact and no public contact.\u201d </em>Dr. Athy affirmed Dr. Demaree\u2019s assessment. For purposes of his vocational expert hypothesis, the ALJ effectively co-opted the language from Dr. Demaree\u2019s Functional Capacity Assessment. The ALJ finally noted that Griffith did not exhibit any unusual or inappropriate social behavior during either her disability interview or her disability hearing, although both had the \u201cpotential to increase social stress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Based on this evidence \u2014 the opinions of two doctors that Griffith could \u201crelate adequately to peers\u201d under limited circumstances, the testimony of a third doctor regarding Griffith\u2019s general functional capacity, and Griffith\u2019s conduct throughout the proceedings \u2014 the ALJ crafted a hypothetical restriction that he believed best matched the totality of the evidence and complainant\u2019s medical conditions. <em>See Webb, </em>368 F.3d at 633 (rejecting the claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>that a hypothetical must include a listing of all of the complainant\u2019s medical conditions). As substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical, the ALJ did not err in failing to describe the exact restrictions referenced by Dr. Baggs to the vocational expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Lastly, Griffith attacks the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical on the grounds that it failed to indicate that Griffith\u2019s learning ability falls within bottom decile of the national population. Because all of the jobs put forth by the vocational expert required a General Learning Ability<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> above the bottom decile, Griffith argues that the vocational expert should have been advised of her capability. <em>See, e.g., Frazee v. Barnhart, </em>259 F.Supp.2d 1182, 1200-01 (D.Kan. 2003) (indicating that the ALJ should have listed the plaintiffs I.Q. of 79 as an impairment); <em>Sizemore v. Astrue, </em>No. 09-cv169-KKC, 2010 WL 3001711, at *9 (E.D.Ky. July 28, 2010) (indicating that borderline intellectual functioning was a severe impairment that should be included in the hypothetical to the vocational expert).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Griffith\u2019s argument fails for a number of reasons. Leaving aside the fact that Griffith improperly conflates I.Q. with General Learning Ability,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> she has provided no evidence apart from her I.Q. to demonstrate that her General Learning Ability fell within the bottom decile of the general population. In contrast, the ALJ referenced substantial evidence for his conclusion that Griffith\u2019s General Learning Ability did not fall within the bottom decile. Many of these points are familiar by now. The ALJ thoroughly discussed the Murray Report, acknowledging that Griffith\u2019s cognitive skills were below her peers but that her verbal and nonverbal skills were average. The ALJ additionally noted that Griffith\u2019s adaptive behavior assessment was deemed \u201caverage\u201d and that the longitudinal record established \u201cthat the claimant is able to function independently, read most things, work when she chooses, maintain and operate her own vehicle and deal with simple instructions, [and that] her most recent mental health treatment notes reflect no evidence of impairment in the area of daily living/personal care.\u201d The record supports each of these conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">Moreover, as discussed previously in section one above, the ALJ had substantial evidence to conclude that Griffith had not demonstrated a medically determinable intellectual impairment. Because Griffith\u2019s impairment was not determined to be \u201csevere,\u201d the ALJ was not required to reference it in his hypothetical question to the vocational expert. <em>See Russell v. Barnhart, </em>58 Fed.Appx. 25, 30 (4th Cir.2003) (\u201cFinally, the hypothetical question may omit non-severe impairments, but must include those that the ALJ finds to be se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>vere.\u201d); <em>Benenate v. Schweiker, </em>719 F.2d 291, 292 (8th Cir.1988) (similar). Griffith acknowledges that her reasoning relies on a determination that the ALJ erred in not concluding that she suffered from a medically determinable intellectual impairment. Thus, as her first claim falls, so does her second.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">For the aforementioned reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and the decision of the administrative law judge.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b585-8\">.

Fourth, if the plaintiff's impairment does not prevent her from doing her past relevant work, plaintiff is not disabled.

Griffith claims that the \"Commissioner conceded in her brief to the District Court that the ALJ\u2019s finding of 'no medically determinable intellectual impairment\u2019 was in error.\u201d This is simply incorrect. The Commissioner never conceded this point, but instead asserted \"the ALJ\u2019s characterization of Plaintiff\u2019s intellectual functioning as 'not medically determinable\u2019 <em>is no more than </em>harmless error.\u201d The .Commissioner has consistently argued that the ALJ\u2019s finding was not in error, but that even if it was erroneous, that the error was harmless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b588-7\">. Griffith conceded this point when the ALJ inquired as to why she was not pursuing an \"Intellectual Disability\u201d determination under 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1. \"Intellectual Disability\u201d is a term of art that \"refers to significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning <em>with deficits in adaptive functioning initially manifested during the developmental period </em>(before age 22).\u201d 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 12.05. Griffith indicated that \"while there were no reservations about the validity of the school age I.Q. scores, the school age test results also showed that the claimant did <em>not have significant deficits in adaptive function prior to the end of the development period, </em>as would be required to satisfy the diagnostic description in 12.00 of of [sic] 20 C.F.R. Part 404 ....\" Thus, while Griffith concedes, as she must, that she lacks an \"intellectual disability\u201d because of her adaptive functioning, she nonetheless argues that her cognitive impairment should still be recognized as a medically determinable impairment. Again, however, Griffith has failed to cite to any cases or regulations that indicate that an I.Q. score like hers, by itself, qualifies as a medically determinable impairment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b589-6\">.
