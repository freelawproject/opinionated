This Court has previously determined that Noyola Rodriquez gave false testimony, <em>Noyola Rodriguez v. Gonzales, </em>168 Fed.Appx. 283, 234 (9th Cir.2006), and there is substantial evidence in the record to support the immigration judge\u2019s determination on remand that her purpose in doing so was to obtain an immigration benefit, <em>Urzua Covarrubias v. Gonzales, </em>487 F.3d 742, 747 (9th Cir.2007). Because the IJ\u2019s determination rendered Noyola Rodriquez statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal or voluntary departure, there was no need to consider other evidence of her moral character. Thus, the IJ\u2019s decision not to do so did not violate the scope of this Court\u2019s previous remand order, and, even assuming Noyola Rodriquez\u2019s due process rights were violated, she cannot show prejudice. <em>See Larita-Martinez v. I.N.S., </em>220 F.3d 1092, 1095 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b781-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
