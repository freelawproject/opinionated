His counsel has moved to withdraw, and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), acknowledging an appeal waiver in Dangla-Sanchez\u2019s plea agreement, questioning the reasonableness of the sentence imposed, and raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-21\">To begin, we decline to consider counsel\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. McAdory, </em>501 F.3d 868, 872-73 (8th Cir.2007) (ineffective-assistance claims are ordinarily deferred to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceedings). As to counsel\u2019s challenge to the reasonableness of the sentence, we enforce the appeal waiver. <em>See United States v. Andis, </em>333 F.3d 886, 889-92 (8th Cir.2003) (en banc) (court should enforce appeal waiver and dismiss appeal where it falls within scope of waiver, plea agreement and waiver were entered into knowingly and voluntarily, and no miscarriage of justice would result); <em>see also United States v. Scott, </em>627 F.3d 702, 704 (8th Cir.2010) (de novo review of validity and applicability of appeal waiver). Finally, having reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no non-frivolous issues outside the scope of the appeal waiver. Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal based upon the appeal waiver, and we grant counsel leave to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-18\">. The Honorable Brian C.
