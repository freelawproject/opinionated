We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d). We review de novo, <em>Conlon v. United States, </em>474 F.3d 616, 621 (9th Cir.2007), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">The district court properly granted summary adjudication on the trustee\u2019s fraudulent transfer claims under California Civil Code \u00a7\u00a7 3439.04 and 3439.05 because Yang admitted that Sui transferred his interest in the real property to her without receiving anything in exchange for the transfer and did so with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud his creditors, and because Yang did not bring a motion to withdraw her admissions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 36(b). <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 36(b) (\u201cA matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless the court, on motion, permits the admission to be withdrawn or amended.\u201d); <em>Conlon, </em>474 F.3d at 621 (\u201cUnanswered requests for admissions may be relied on as the basis for granting summary judgment.\u201d); <em>see also </em>Fed. R. Bankr.P. 7036 (applying Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 36 in bankruptcy adversary proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">Yang\u2019s contentions that the requests for admissions were defective and invalid, that the trustee\u2019s complaint was invalid and untimely, and that the bankruptcy court lacks jurisdiction over the adversary proceeding are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">We deny all pending motions and requests, including Sui\u2019s motion to intervene, filed on February 18, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b769-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
