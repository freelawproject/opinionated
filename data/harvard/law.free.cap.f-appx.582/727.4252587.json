We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Lovell v. Chandler, </em>303 F.3d 1039, 1052 (9th Cir.2002), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Hulihan\u2019s ADA and Section 504 claims because Hulihan failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether defendants intentionally discriminated against her or excluded her from enjoying the benefits of public transportation on the basis of her disability. <em>See id. </em>(setting forth elements of a claim under Title II of the ADA); <em>Midgett v. Tri-County Metro. Transp. Dist, </em>254 F.3d 846, 850-51 (9th Cir.2001) (occasional, isolated problems in public transportation provider\u2019s service did not violate the ADA for purposes of injunctive relief, and showing of discriminatory intent is a prerequisite to obtaining compensatory damages under the ADA); <em>Zukle v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., </em>166 F.3d 1041, 1045 n. 11 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201cThere is no significant difference in analysis of the rights and obligations created by the ADA and [Section 504].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying reconsideration of its summary judgment ruling on Hulihan\u2019s negligence claim because Hulihan failed to establish grounds for such relief. <em>See Sch. Dist. No. 1J, Multnomah Cnty., Or., v. ACandS, Inc., </em>5 F.3d 1255, 1262-63 (9th Cir.1993) (setting forth standard of review and factors for reconsideration under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59(e) and 60(b)); <em>Joynt v. Cal. Hotel &amp; Casino, </em>108 Nev. 539, 835 P.2d 799, 801 (1992) (per curiam) (setting forth elements of negligence under Nevada law).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">Hulihan\u2019s motion \u201crevoking oral argument,\u201d filed on May 30, 2014, is granted. Accordingly, her motions for oral argument, filed on June 7, August 27, and September 3, 2013, are denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">Hulihan\u2019s contentions regarding the district court\u2019s alleged bias, failure to consider evidence, denial of due process, and lack of consideration for her pro se status are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b755-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
