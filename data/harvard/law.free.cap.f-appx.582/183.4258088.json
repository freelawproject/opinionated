R. Civ.P. 59(e) motion to alter, amend, or vacate a prior judgment. Ford\u2019s motion sought reconsideration of the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2012) motion. The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (2012). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2012). When the district court denies relief on the merits, a prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims is debatable or wrong. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>see Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S. Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). When the district court denies relief on procedural grounds, the prisoner must demonstrate both that the dispositive procedural ruling is debatable, and that the motion states a debatable claim of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484-85, 120 S.Ct. 1595.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-24\">We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Ford has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
