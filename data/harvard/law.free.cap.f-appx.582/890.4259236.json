United States, </em>No. 14-66C, 2014 WL 1910577 (Fed.Cl. May 12, 2014); <em>Barksdale, </em>No. 14-66C (Fed.Cl. May 13, 2014). Because the Claims Court correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction on the merits and because it did not abuse its discretion in the denial of sanctions we affirm the Claims Court\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">Barksdale filed a complaint in the Claims Court seeking to overturn the Sixth Circuit\u2019s dismissal of his case. In his complaint, Barksdale sought $32,300,000 in damages, as well as injunctive relief compelling the Sixth Circuit and the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio to change its policies, procedures, and training. Barksdale raised tort claims, claims of government criminal activity, constitutional claims, and other claims relating to the state of Ohio\u2019s statutory and constitutional provisions. The Claims Court dismissed Barksdale\u2019s case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. It noted that some of Barksdale\u2019s claims were based in tort and criminal law, over which the Claims Court has no jurisdiction. It also found that Barksdale\u2019s remaining claims were based on constitutional provisions that are not money-mandating or other authorities, over which, again, the Claims Court lacks jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-13\">Barksdale also sought sanctions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 and Rule 11 of the Claims Court. The Claims Court denied the motion for sanctions, because Barks-dale\u2019s allegations related to government actions in separate matters. Barksdale appealed to this court. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-14\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b919-15\">Barksdale argues that the Claims Court erred in dismissing his complaint for lack of jurisdiction, requests that we \u201c[djeclare 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e) violates Art. 1 sec. 10 clause 1 as Bill of Attainder ex post facto law,\u201d and seeks a remand for further \u201cDefault Proceedings.\u201d Brief for Appellant at Form 12, No. 6. The government responds that the Claims Court properly dismissed Barksdale\u2019s complaint for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-16\">\u201cThe Court of Federal Claims\u2019 decision to grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction is a matter of law, which this court reviews <em>de novo.\u201d Keener v. United States, </em>551 F.3d 1358, 1361 (Fed.Cir.2009). Jurisdiction in the Claims Court \u201crequires a money mandating act to confirm jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Joshua v. United States, </em>17 F.3d 378, 379 (Fed.Cir. 1994) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491). In the section of his appeal brief titled \u201cBasis of U.S. Court of Federal Claims Jurisdiction,\u201d Barksdale mentions the First, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution, the Full Faith and Credit clause, state law, and fraud. Appellant Brief at 3-10. Barksdale\u2019s brief does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>nothing to refute the Claims Court\u2019s well-reasoned decision that none of Barksdale\u2019s sources of law are money-mandating. As noted by the Claims Court, Barksdale\u2019s Fifth Amendment claims are based on the Due Process Clause, which is not money-mandating. <em>See LeBlanc v. United States, </em>50 F.3d 1025, 1028 (Fed.Cir.1995) (holding the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause is not \u201ca sufficient basis for jurisdiction\u201d). Barksdale\u2019s repackaged First and Fourteenth Amendment claims\u2014 claiming the government has acted \u201cimpermissibl[y] ... by <em>taking </em>African American pro se litigants!\u2019] first and fourteenth amendment rights,\u201d Appellant Brief at 11 (emphasis in original) \u2014 fair no better. Despite the use of the word \u201ctaking,\u201d which could be money-mandating under the Fifth Amendment, these are claims under the First and Fourteenth Amendment, which the Claims Court properly ruled was outside its jurisdiction. <em>See LeBlanc, </em>50 F.3d at 1028 (stating that that the First Amendment, the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, and the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clauses are not \u201ca sufficient basis for jurisdiction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">Because Barksdale \u201chas the burden of establishing ... jurisdiction,\u201d <em>Rocovich v. United States, </em>933 F.2d 991, 993 (Fed.Cir. 1991) (citing <em>KVOS, Inc. v. Associated Press, </em>299 U.S. 269, 278, 57 S.Ct. 197, 81 L.Ed. 183 (1936)), and failed to do so, we affirm the Claims Court\u2019s dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. As it was \u201cwithout jurisdiction,\u201d the Claims Court could not \u201cproceed at all in any cause,\u201d including addressing the constitutionality of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e). <em>Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co., </em>526 U.S. 574, 583, 119 S.Ct. 1563, 143 L.Ed.2d 760 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">Barksdale also requests sanctions, asserting that U.S. Attorneys committed fraud, perjury and prosecutorial misconduct by \u201cwith[holding] evidence\u201d and by the \u201cU.S. Department of Justice[\u2019s] failure of duty.\u201d Brief for Appellant at Form 12, No. 6; Brief for Appellant at 21. The government responds that the Claims Court properly denied sanctions because Barksdale failed to show any sanctionable conduct. Appellate courts \u201capply an abuse-of-discretion standard in reviewing all aspects of a district court\u2019s Rule 11 determination.\u201d <em>Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., </em>496 U.S. 384, 405, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990); <em>see Judin v. United States, </em>110 F.3d 780, 784 (1997) (applying <em>Cooter </em>to Rule 11 of the Claims Court). The Claims Court denied Barks-dale\u2019s motion for sanctions because these parties were not involved Barksdale\u2019s matters. Barksdale\u2019s brief again does nothing to refute the Claims Court\u2019s decision. Thus, the Claims Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Barksdale\u2019s motion for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">For these reasons, the Claims Court\u2019s decision that it lacked jurisdiction over Barksdale\u2019s complaint and its denial of Barksdale\u2019s request for sanctions are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
