Jun. 28, 2013). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-16\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-17\">As Ye concedes in his brief, his fourth motion to reopen filed in May 2013 was untimely, number barred, and did not fall under any statutory exception to the time and number limitations. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(C)(i). Ye argues that, because his 1997 removal proceedings were improvidently begun after he had already been ordered excluded, the time and number rules do not apply. Ye, however, cites to no authority in support of this proposition except for general case law regarding the doctrine of <em>res judicata, </em>which, by itself, is unavailing. First, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(g) bars judicial review of the agency\u2019s determination to \u201ccommence proceedings,\u201d thus, to the extent Ye argues that the 1997 removal proceedings should not have been commenced, judicial review is not available. In any event, Ye raises his <em>res judicata </em>argument for the first time in his fourth motion to reopen, without explaining why he did not raise it earlier. Ye could have raised that argument as early as 1997, but did not do so. The regulations provide that a motion to reopen must be based on new, previously unavailable evidence. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). As Ye identifies no basis for finding that the BIA abused its discretion by denying reopening and termination of proceedings, his petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
