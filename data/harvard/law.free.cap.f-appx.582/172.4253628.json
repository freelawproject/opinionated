The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>court imposed a total term of 896 months\u2019 imprisonment, the top of the 240 to 396 month range to which the parties stipulated in the plea agreement. Mitchell appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning whether the court erred in imposing Mitchell\u2019s sentence. Mitchell was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not filed one. The Government declined to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Subject to narrow exceptions, a defendant who agrees to and receives a particular sentence pursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(C) may not appeal that sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) (2012); <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>428 F.3d 928, 932 (10th Cir.2005). In this case, the district court imposed a sentence within the stipulated range and the sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum. Moreover, the sentence was not imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the Sentencing Guidelines because it was based on the parties\u2019 agreement and not on the district court\u2019s calculation of the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>653 F.3d 337, 339-40 (4th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Cieslowski, </em>410 F.3d 353, 364 (7th Cir.2005). Review of Mitchell\u2019s sentence is thus precluded by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court with respect to Mitchell\u2019s convictions and we dismiss the appeal with respect to Mitchell\u2019s sentence. We remand to the district court with instructions to correct the judgment, pursuant to Fed. R.Crim.P. 36, to reflect that the statutes of conviction for Count One are 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), 846, 856(a)(1), for Count Eleven are 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(iii), 2, and for Count Thirteen are 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1), (j)(l), 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">This court requires that counsel inform Mitchell, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Mitchell requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Mitchell. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
