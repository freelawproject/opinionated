We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s decision to decline supplemental jurisdiction. <em>Tritchler v. County of Lake, </em>358 F.3d 1150, 1153 (9th Cir.2004). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Bartz\u2019s state law claims after it had dismissed his federal claims. <em>See Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, </em>484 U.S. 343, 350 n. 7, 108 S.Ct. 614, 98 L.Ed.2d 720 (1988) (where all federal claims are eliminated before trial, courts generally should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over remaining state law claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to appoint counsel to assist Bartz in connection with summary judgment or by granting Bartz\u2019s appointed counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. <em>See Palmer v. Valdez, </em>560 F.3d 965, 970 (9th Cir.2009) (setting forth the standard or review and discussing the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d requirement for appointment of counsel under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(1)); <em>LaGrand v.
