Specifically, he argues that the New York Court of Appeals failed to reasonably apply the prejudice prong of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), when it denied his ineffective assistance of counsel claim under the New York Constitution. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">As this Court has recognized previously, the standard for ineffective assistance of counsel under the New York Constitution differs from the standard under the Federal Constitution in one critical way. Under the federal standard, a criminal defendant must demonstrate \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\u201d <em>id., </em>whereas under the New York standard, a criminal defendant need show only that counsel\u2019s \u201cerror affected the \u2018fairness of the process as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rosario v. Ercole, </em>601 F.3d 118, 124 (2d Cir.2010) (quoting <em>People v. Benevento, </em>91 N.Y.2d 708, 674 N.Y.S.2d 629, 697 N.E.2d 584, 588 (1998)). The New York standard is understood to subsume the federal standard because it is considered more protective of criminal defendants. <em>See Rosario, </em>601 F.3d at 124 (citing <em>People v. Turner, </em>5 N.Y.3d 476, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154, 840 N.E.2d 123, 125-26 (2005)). \u201cProperly applied,\u201d therefore, the New York standard is \u201cnot contrary to <em>Strickland.\u201d Rosario, </em>601 F.3d at 126. Rather, \u201cby its nature [the New York standard] must always encompass prejudice [analysis].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125. Moreover, a New York state court is not required to decide a case \u201cin <em>Strickland </em>terminology\u201d in order to conform with the federal standard. <em>See id. </em>at 127 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">As the <em>Rosario </em>majority cautioned, however, there is a possibility that \u201csome [New York state] courts might misunderstand the New York standard and look past a prejudicial error as long as counsel conducted himself in a way that bespoke of general competency throughout the trial. That would produce an absurd result inconsistent- with New York constitutional jurisprudence and the mandates of <em>Strickland. </em>\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126. Cummings argues that this case presents such a scenario. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-12\">First, while the Court of Appeals did not explicitly rely on the <em>Strickland </em>standard, its decision nevertheless makes clear that it implicitly considered whether Cummings\u2019s counsel committed prejudicial er<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>ror as required under <em>Strickland. </em>In describing the relevant legal inquiry under New York law, the Court of Appeals emphasized that where \u201ca single error or omission ... was \u2018so egregious <em>and prejudicial\u2019 </em>as to deprive defendant of a fair trial,\u201d the representation of counsel cannot be meaningful. J.A. 20 (quoting <em>Turner, </em>806 N.Y.S.2d 154, 840 N.E.2d at 126) (emphasis added). Moreover, in reaching its conclusion under this standard, the Court of Appeals focused exclusively on the single error alleged: namely, that Cummings\u2019s counsel failed at the close of the People\u2019s case to move to dismiss the burglary charge on the grounds that the evidence did not support the conclusion that the precinct was a \u201cdwelling.\u201d To conclude, therefore, that the Court of Appeals looked past the alleged error because it believed that the totality of counsel\u2019s representation was meaningful is simply not consistent with the text of the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Second, the Court of Appeals\u2019s application of the prejudice prong was not unreasonable. In the very first paragraph of its decision, the Court of Appeals explained that \u201c[a] building is considered a dwelling, if it is usually occupied by a person lodging therein at night.\u201d J.A. 19 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). But, the Court continued, \u201c[b]y using the phrase \u2018usually occupied\u2019 to define a dwelling the Legislature clearly intended to enact a flexible standard [and accordingly, there is no requirement that the building must always be a home or what would normally be considered a residence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations marks and citations omitted). We are satisfied that this discussion, though brief, demonstrates that the Court of Appeals\u2019s analysis was not unreasonable because it considered the underlying merits of Cummings\u2019s dwelling argument. In addition, we find that the conclusion the Court of Appeals reached was not unreasonable because the dormitories in the precinct bore many of the customary indicia of a residence, including that officers \u201croutinely\u201d slept there overnight and that the dormitory rooms were not used for other purposes. J.A. 29; <em>see also People v. Quattlebaum, </em>91 N.Y.2d 744, 675 N.Y.S.2d 585, 698 N.E.2d 421, 423 (1998) (describing the standard for a \u201cdwelling\u201d under N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 140.00[3]).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">For the reasons given, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
