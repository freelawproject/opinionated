After careful review, we conclude that it was proper for the district court to sanction Evans for willfully disregarding an order compelling discovery, and that the court imposed an appropriate sanction by dismissing the action without prejudice, after Evans had been warned of the possibility of dismissal. <em>See Rodgers v. Curators of Univ. of Missouri, </em>135 F.3d 1216, 1219, 1221-22 (8th Cir.1998) (finding of willful disregard of order is reviewed for clear error; selection of sanction is reviewed for abuse of discretion; concluding that district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing action). We further conclude that the remaining issues raised by Evans on appeal are meritless. Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b693-18\">.
