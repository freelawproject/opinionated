Sargus, Jr., United States District Judge for the Southern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b605-7\">SARGUS, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Plaintiff-Appellant, Gary Gaylor, a Georgia resident who suffers from multiple sclerosis and needs a cane or wheelchair for mobility, sued Defendant-Appellee, TRU RE I, LLC (\u201cTRU\u201d), operator of a Toys-R-Us, alleging that he encountered barriers on TRU\u2019s property in violation of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12181 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cADA\u201d). The district court dismissed Gaylor\u2019s claim against TRU with prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, holding that Gaylor lacked standing because he failed to sufficiently allege an actual injury. The district court also denied Plaintiffs subsequent request for leave to amend on the grounds of undue delay, prejudice, and futility. On appeal, Gaylor challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claim against TRU and alternatively challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his request for leave to amend. Because we conclude that the district court erred in dismissing Plaintiffs claim against TRU, it is unnecessary to address his alternative argument that the district court erred in denying his subsequent request for leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-13\">Gaylor\u2019s claims in this action arise from his alleged visits to the Hamilton Crossing Shopping Center in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Gaylor initiated this action in March 2012 against TRU and other owners and operators of stores located within the shopping center, alleging that he observed and encountered barriers, to access during these visits that violate Title III of the ADA. Following a motion dismiss, Gaylor filed his First Amended Complaint (\u201cFAC\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-14\">Gaylor\u2019s FAC, like his original complaint, alleged violations of Title III of the ADA against TRU and other shopping center store owners/operators and sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. The FAC identified TRU as \u201cthe owner, lessee, and/or operator of the real property and improvements [that] are the subject of this action, to wit: the Property, known as Toys R Us at Hamilton Crossing.\u201d Other allegations reflect that the phrase \u201cthe Property,\u201d as Gaylor utilized it in his FAC, also includes the other named defendants\u2019 specific retail stores as well as the shopping center generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>According to the FAC, Gaylor \u201cvisited Defendants\u2019 Property numerous times\u201d prior to filing this action, most recently in January 2012. During this January 2012 visit, Gaylor \u201cmade a purchase at World Market and browsed several other stores at the shopping center.\u201d Gaylor alleged that in April 2012, after filing the action but prior to filing his FAC in June 2012, he \u201creturned to the property to browse and buy goods on the premises.\u201d Gaylor further alleged that \u201c[wjhile at the property, [he] experienced serious difficulty accessing the goods and utilizing the services due to the architectural barriers.... \u201d He proceeded to identify specific \u201cbarriers to access [that he] personally observed and encountered\u201d during these visits, delineating the alleged violations attributable to each named defendant. With regard to TRU, Gaylor alleged as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-4\">A. Plaintiff had difficulty parking and exiting his vehicle and accessing the designated accessible spaces due to excessive slopes in front of Toys-R-Us.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Gaylor alleged that this barrier and other specific barriers he identified injure him because they prevent or cause him \u201cunequal access when parking his vehicle at the Property, navigating the sidewalks and curb cuts throughout the Property, and attempting to purchase or get service at tenant spaces throughout the Property....\u201d He also alleged that \u201c[rjemoval of the barriers to access located on the Property\u201d is readily achievable without placing an undue burden on Defendants and \u201cwould allow [him] to fully utilize the goods and services located therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Gaylor further alleged that he \u201cenjoys traveling with his wife\u201d and that \u201cthey take frequent road trips to Tennessee.\u201d He travels to the Chattanooga area because his sister-in-law resides there and because, as \u201ca history aficionado and former high school teacher,\u201d he \u201cenjoys visiting ... the area museums and Civil war era attractions,\u201d as well as \u201cshopping at the local malls and attractions, including Hamilton Place Mall and Hamilton Crossing.\u201d Gaylor alleged that he visits the Hamilton Crossing shopping center in particular \u201cbecause it offers him and his wife a variety of stores that they enjoy.\u201d By way of example, Gaylor alleged that he enjoys the coffee and chocolates at World Market and that his wife enjoys the Guitar Center store and Michaels Arts and Crafts store, all of which, in addition to TRU, are located within the Hamilton Crossing Shopping Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">With regard to his intent to return, Gaylor alleged that he \u201ccontinues to desire to visit the Property, but genuinely fears that he will continue to experience serious difficulty due to the barriers\u201d he identified. He further alleged that he \u201cplans to and will visit the property in the near future to utilize the goods and services offered thereon\u201d and added that he \u201cintends to return to the property at the end of this month on a trip to visit his sister in law.\u201d He also alleged that he \u201cadditionally intends to return to the Property as an ADA tester\u201d to ascertain whether Defendants removed the barriers to access that he identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">TRU sought dismissal of Gaylor\u2019s FAC under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) on the basis that Gaylor lacked standing. TRU alternatively moved for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6). The district court granted TRU\u2019s motion to dismiss on 12(b)(1) grounds, holding that Gaylor lacked standing. The district court premised this determination upon its finding that Gaylor had failed to allege sufficiently that he had visited or intended to return to TRU and that Gaylor had failed to provide factual support for his allegation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>that he was harmed as a result of the excessive slopes at TRU\u2019s store.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">We conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of the district court\u2019s dismissal of Gaylor\u2019s FAC for lack of standing. <em>In re Carter, </em>553 F.3d 979, 984 (6th Cir.2009) (\u201cWhere a district court rules on a 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss that attacks the claim of jurisdiction on its face, this Court reviews the decision <em>de novo.\u201d). </em>As with a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, we must accept the allegations set forth in the complaint as true, drawing all inferences in favor of the plaintiff. <em>RMI Titanium Co. v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., </em>78 F.3d 1125, 1134 (6th Cir. 1996) (citing <em>Mortensen v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>549 F.2d 884, 890-91 (3d Cir.1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Article III standing requires a plaintiff to satisfy three key elements: (1) the plaintiff suffered an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d that is \u201cconcrete and particularized\u201d and \u201cactual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical\u201d; (2) the injury must be \u201cfairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant\u201d; and (3) \u201cit must be likely ... that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\u201d <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992) (alterations, internal quotation marks, and citations omitted). At issue in this case is whether Gaylor has sufficiently alleged the injury-in-fact element. In order to demonstrate this element, an individual who, like Gaylor, seeks only injunctive relief, must \u201cshow that he is under threat of suffering [an] \u2018injury in fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Summers v. Earth Island Inst., </em>555 U.S. 488, 493, 129 S.Ct. 1142, 173 L.Ed.2d 1 (2009) (citing <em>Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., </em>528 U.S. 167, 180-81, 120 S.Ct. 693, 145 L.Ed.2d 610 (2000)). The \u201cthreat\u201d of a prospective injury must be real and immediate and not premised upon the existence of past injuries alone. <em>City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, </em>461 U.S. 95, 102-03, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983); <em>Whitmore v. Arkansas, </em>495 U.S. 149, 158, 110 S.Ct. 1717, 109 L.Ed.2d 135 (1990). Finally, each of the standing elements \u201cmust be supported ... with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.\u201d <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130. Where, as here, a court evaluates a facial challenge to standing at the pleading stage, \u201cgeneral factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant\u2019s conduct may suffice\u201d because in considering a motion to dismiss, \u201cwe presume that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">The parties dispute whether Gaylor\u2019s allegations are sufficient to establish either prong of the injury-in-fact element within the context of an ADA Title III claim. We address each prong in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">A. Concrete and Particularized Injury in Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">Gaylor has sufficiently alleged an injury that is concrete and particularized. \u201cParticularized\u201d means that \u201cthe injury must affect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.\u201d <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 561 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 2130; <em>see also Whitmore, </em>495 U.S. at 155, 110 S.Ct. 1717 (\u201cThe complainant must allege an injury to himself that is distinct and palpable, as opposed to merely abstract....\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Gaylor has alleged that he personally observed and encountered an architectural barrier to access in TRU\u2019s parking lot in the form of excessive slopes, causing him to experience serious difficulty and depriving him of equal access <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>when parking his vehicle and navigating the property. In addition to his allegations of difficulty, it is reasonable to infer \u2014 especially at the pleading stage \u2014 that the barriers to accessibility Gaylor encountered would interfere with a mobility-impaired individual\u2019s full and equal enjoyment of TRU\u2019s property. Thus, Gaylor has sufficiently alleged that he was personally affected. .</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">The district court both incorrectly held that Gaylor was required to provide additional facts to show he was harmed and improperly considered whether the slopes were, in fact, excessive. As discussed above, at the pleadings stage, we must accept Gaylor\u2019s plausible allegations of harm as true. <em>See RMI, </em>78 F.3d at 1134. Moreover, whether TRU\u2019s slopes actually exceed permissible standards \u2014 which is clearly a merits-based inquiry \u2014 has no place in our or the district court\u2019s standing analysis. <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 500, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975) (\u201c[SJtanding in no way depends on the merits of the plaintiffs contention that particular conduct is illegal....\u201d); <em>Carrier Corp. v. Outokumpu Oyj, 673 F.3d 430, </em>443-44 (6th Cir.2012) (\u201c[TJhe district court is prohibited from making factual findings with respect to a jurisdictional issue when such a finding would adversely affect the merits of the plaintiffs case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">B. Real and Immediate Threat of Prospective Injury</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">This Court has not specifically addressed the pleading requirements for demonstration of the requisite threat of future injury within the context of a Title III ADA public accommodation claim for injunctive relief. But we agree with those circuits that have considered the issue and concluded that a plaintiff demonstrates the requisite threat of future injury where he establishes (1) a plausible intent to return to the noncompliant accommodation or (2) that he would return, but is deterred from visiting the noncompliant accommodation because of the alleged accessibility barriers. <em>See, e.g., Kreisler v. Second Ave. Diner Corp., </em>731 F.3d 184, 188 (2d Cir. 2013); <em>Scherr v. Mamott Int'l Inc., </em>703 F.3d 1069, 1074 (7th Cir.2013); <em>Daniels v. Arcade, L.P., 477 </em>Fed.Appx. 125, 130 (4th Cir.2012); <em>Camarillo v. Carrols Corp., </em>518 F.3d 153, 157-58 (2d Cir.2008); <em>D\u2019Lil v. Best W. Encina Lodge &amp; Suites, </em>538 F.3d 1031, 1037 (9th Cir.2008); <em>Tandy v. City of Wichita, </em>380 F.3d 1277, 1284 (10th Cir. 2004); <em>Steger v. Franco, Inc., </em>228 F.3d 889, 892 (8th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Applying these pleading standards here, we conclude that Gaylor\u2019s allegations are sufficient to establish a plausible likelihood that he will suffer future harm. As set forth above, Gaylor defined \u201cthe Property\u201d in his FAC to include both the shopping center <em>and </em>the named defendants\u2019 specific retail stores. Thus, construing the FAC\u2019s references to \u201cthe Property\u201d broadly to include TRU\u2019s store, Gaylor has alleged both that he intends to return as a patron to TRU\u2019s store and that he continues to desire to visit TRU\u2019s store, but genuinely fears that he will continue to experience serious difficulty due to the excessive slopes in TRU\u2019s parking lot. Gaylor\u2019s allegations of intent and desire to return to TRU\u2019s property are plausible in light of (1) his alleged history of visiting the Chattanooga, Tennessee area; (2) his allegations that he has visited and attempted to patronize TRU\u2019s store \u201cnumerous times,\u201d most recently in January and April 2012; (3) his allegations of past injury in TRU\u2019s parking lot; (4) his allegations setting forth reasons why he makes regular trips to Chattanooga, Tennessee, and why he particularly enjoys visiting the shopping center in which TRU is located; and (5) his alleged plan to return to the property at the end of the month in connection with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>a trip to visit his sister-in-law. Accepting these allegations as true for purposes of resolving TRU\u2019s motion to dismiss, Gaylor has established the requisite threat of prospective injury to seek injunctive relief against TRU under Title III of the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">In sum, accepting the allegations in the FAC as true, with all inferences drawn in Gaylor\u2019s favor, we find that he has established an injury in fact that is traceable to TRU and redressable by declaratory judgment or an injunction. We therefore conclude that his FAC demonstrates standing to pursue his ADA Title III claim against TRU. For these reasons, we reverse the district court\u2019s holding that Gaylor lacked Article III standing to sue TRU, vacate its judgment, and remand this action for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
