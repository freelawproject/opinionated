Because the BIA relied on the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well as the decision of the BIA. <em>See Theodros v. Gonzales, </em>490 F.3d 396, 400 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Villeda asserts that the IJ abused his discretion by denying his motion for a continuance. A continuance may be granted upon a showing of good cause, and the decision whether to grant a continuance \u201clies within the sound discretion of the immigration judge.\u201d <em>Witter v. INS, </em>113 F.3d 549, 555 (5th Cir.1997);. <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29. Villeda has made no showing that he was actually prejudiced by the IJ\u2019s refusal to continue the merits hearing. <em>See Gharti-Magar v. Holder, </em>551 Fed.Appx. 197, 200 (5th Cir.2014); <em>In re Sibrun, </em>18 I. &amp; N. Dec. 354, 356 (BIA 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The IJ abused his discretion, Villeda complains, by failing to give him \u201cthe opportunity to go forward with the case\u201d by presenting his own testimony in support of his application for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT. This contention is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The question whether the BIA abused its discretion in denying the motion to reopen and remand has not been briefed and, therefore, is waived. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b493-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
