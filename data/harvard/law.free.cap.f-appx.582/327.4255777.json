His sentence was enhanced based on the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) because of his three prior \u201cviolent felony\u201d convictions. The district court sentenced De La Cruz at the bottom of the guideline range to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, De La Cruz argues that: (1) the district court erred in classifying one of his prior offenses as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of applying the ACCA enhancement; and (2) the statute of conviction, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), is unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause. We hold that the district court properly classified De La Cruz\u2019s prior offense, and that the constitutional challenge is foreclosed. Therefore, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s classification of a \u201cviolent felony\u201d <em>de novo. United States v. Schmidt, </em>623 F.3d 257, 260 (5th Cir.2010). The ACCA states that a person who violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) and has three previous violent felony convictions shall be sentenced to no less than fifteen years in prison. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). The statute defines \u201cviolent felony\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-15\">any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-18\">(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-19\">(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-20\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-21\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-22\">De La Cruz argues that the ACCA enhancement was improperly applied because his prior felony conviction for Possession of a Prohibited Object in Prison does not qualify as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause, emphasized above. In determining whether a prior conviction qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA, we begin with the categorical approach, which requires looking only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the predicate offense, rather than to the particular underlying facts. <em>See Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2159, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). However, there are instances which require a variation of this approach. <em>Id. </em>This variation, referred to as the \u201cmodified categorical approach,\u201d allows a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>to look at other documents, limited to \u201cthe terms of the charging document, the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant.... or to some comparable judicial record.\u201d <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1263, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). The modified categorical approach is applicable only when a divisible statute is at issue. <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013). The Court explained divisibility as follows: when a statute is divisible \u201ci.e., comprises multiple, alternative versions of the crime \u2014 a later sentencing court cannot tell, without reviewing something more\u201d which element of the statute the defendant was convicted under. <em>Id. </em>at 2284.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Here, De La Cruz\u2019s statute of conviction criminalized possession of certain objects by prisoners. The statute defined \u201cprohibited object\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-8\">(B) marijuana or a controlled substance in schedule III, other than a controlled substance referred to in subparagraph</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-9\">(C) of this subsection, ammunition, a weapon (other than a firearm or destructive device), <em>or </em>an object that is designed or intended to be used as a weapon or to facilitate escape from a prison.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(d)(1)(B) (emphasis added). This statute is divisible because it lists in the disjunctive multiple, alternative elements for committing the offense, e.g., by possessing marijuana, ammunition, a non-firearm weapon, or an object designed to be used as a weapon. Under <em>Descamps, </em>the statute may be analyzed under the modified categorical approach.,</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">De La Cruz argues, however, that the statute of conviction is not divisible. He asserts that the possession of non-firearm weapons and possession of marijuana were statutorily listed together because they are simply possession offenses, and as such, they do not satisfy the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. De La Cruz relies heavily on <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 122, 129 S.Ct. 687, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009), for this assertion. He contends that <em>Chambers </em>stands for the proposition that a statute is not necessarily divisible merely because it lists different kinds of conduct in the disjunctive. In <em>Chambers, </em>the statute at issue listed various types of \u201cfailure to report\u201d offenses in the same section as \u201cescape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 124, 129 S.Ct. 687. The Court determined that \u201cfailure to report\u201d was a separate crime from \u201cescape,\u201d but that the statute grouped all the \u201cfailure to report\u201d offenses together as a single crime. <em>Id. </em>at 127, 129 S.Ct. 687. Likewise, De La Cruz asserts that the \u201cpossession\u201d offenses listed together in the statute at issue should also be analyzed as a single crime, i.e., possession of a weapon should not be analyzed separately from possession of marijuana. De La Cruz\u2019s argument misses the point. The Supreme Court in <em>Chambers </em>grouped the \u201cfailure to report\u201d offenses together because they described similar types of behavior, and it held that \u201cseparately listed behaviors [that] pose a similar degree of risk\u201d may be considered as a single crime. <em>Id. </em>at 127, 129 S.Ct. 687 (citing <em>James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 207-209, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007)). Unlike the \u201cfailure to report\u201d offenses in <em>Chambers, </em>possession of marijuana and possession of a stabbing weapon clearly involve very different types of behaviors and do not pose a similar degree of risk. Even following <em>Chambers\u2019 </em>reasoning, the statute of conviction in the instant case is divisible.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-14\">Because the statute of conviction is divisible and the modified categorical approach is applicable, we can look beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>the statute to determine the crime of conviction. De La Cruz\u2019s indictment reveals that the \u201cprohibited object\u201d he was convicted of possessing was \u201can approximately six inch metal stabbing weapon.\u201d In <em>United States v. Marquez, </em>626 F.3d 214 (5th Cir.2010), we held that possession of a deadly weapon by a prisoner (there a club) is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. De La Cruz\u2019s possession of a metal stabbing weapon is similar and presents \u201ca serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d for purposes of the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">De La Cruz attempts to sidestep <em>Marquez </em>by distinguishing between the definitions of \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA and \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2. However, we have deemed the \u00a7 4B1.2 and ACCA definitions \u201cvery similar.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 215-217 (stating that the only difference in the black letter text of the \u00a7 4B1.2 definition of a crime of violence and the ACCA violent felony definition is the insertion of \u201cof a dwelling\u201d after \u201cburglary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">De La Cruz additionally argues that <em>Marquez </em>was not consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Chambers </em>and in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree. The <em>Marquez </em>court followed the reasoning of the Supreme Court and drew the proper distinctions, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">We are persuaded, based on the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Begay </em>and <em>Chambers, </em>that Marquez\u2019s conviction for possession of a deadly weapon by a prisoner in a penal institution is a crime of violence.... [A] prisoner\u2019s possession of a deadly weapon is more similar \u201cin kind\u201d to arson, burglary, extortion, or crimes involving the use of explosives.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-10\"><em>Marquez, </em>626 F.3d at 221 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">The <em>Marquez </em>court further emphasized the potential risk of harm by stating that \u201can inmate may not intend to attack another person when he obtains a deadly weapon, but at a minimum his intentional possession of a deadly weapon signals his willingness to use it if, in his mind, the occasion warrants it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">Marquez held that possession of a deadly weapon by a prisoner is a violent felony under the ACCA, and that holding controls us. Accordingly, the district court properly classified De La Cruz\u2019s prior offense as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of applying the ACCA sentence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">De La Cruz\u2019s constitutional challenge to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) under the Commerce Clause is foreclosed in this circuit and was not overruled by the Supreme Court in <em>National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 2566, 183 L.Ed.2d 450 (2012). <em>United States v. Alcantar, </em>733 F.3d 143 (5th Cir. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-16\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b356-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b358-7\">. The <em>Begay </em>Court, in holding that DUI was not a \u201cviolent felony,\u201d reasoned that even if an offense presents a potential risk for physical injury to another, it must also be \"roughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed\u201d to the enumerated offenses and \"must be purposeful, violent, and aggressive.\u201d <em>Be-gay, </em>553 U.S. at 158, 128 S.Ct. at 1594 (internal quotation marks omitted). The <em>Chambers </em>Court followed the <em>Begay </em>analysis in deciding that the \"failure to report\u201d offenses were not \"purposeful, violent, and aggressive.\u201d <em>Chambers, </em>555 U.S. at 128, 129 S.Ct. at 692 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
