Jiminez argues that the district court reversibly erred in the application of the Sentencing Guidelines. For the following reasons, we VACATE the sentence and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">Count One of a four-count indictment issued on March 20, 2012, charged Edgar Adelaido Jiminez and Juan Angel Nunez, Jr. with aiding and abetting the making of a false statement with respect to information required to be kept in the records of a licensed firearms dealer. Specifically, the indictment alleged that Jiminez served as a \u201cstraw purchaser\u201d by falsely representing that he was the actual buyer of four rifles from The Armory, a firearms dealer in McAllen, Texas. The remaining counts charged Nunez and other codefendants with similar offenses involving the same type of firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-14\">On January 4, 2013, pursuant to a written plea agreement, Jiminez pleaded guilty to Count One of the indictment. The plea did not contain an appeal waiver provision. As part of the factual basis underlying the plea, Jiminez admitted that he purchased firearms from The Armory and that, as part of the purchases, he represented on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms form 4473 that he was the actual purchaser of the firearms. Jiminez further admitted that he was not the actual purchaser, but instead purchased the firearms on behalf of Nunez.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-15\">In an interview with ATF agents, Jiminez stated that he purchased Romanian AK-47 rifles from The Armory on three separate occasions. He purchased four rifles on September 18, 2010, five rifles on September 21, 2010, and five additional rifles on September 23, 2010. On each of these occasions, Jiminez and Nunez met an individual at a parking lot, received instructions and cash, and drove to The Armory. Jiminez then purchased the rifles, returned with Nunez to the parking lot, unloaded the guns, and received a cash payment. Jiminez attempted to purchase another five rifles from The Armory on a fourth occasion, but that purchase was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-16\">Prior to sentencing, the probation officer prepared a Presentence Report (PSR). The PSR determined that Jiminez\u2019s base offense level was 12 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(7) (2009). With respect to specific offense characteristics, Jiminez received a four-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(B) because he was held responsible for straw purchasing 14 firearms.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He received two additional four-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>level increases, for engaging in the \u201ctrafficking\u201d of firearms, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), and for transferring firearms in connection with the felony offense of unlawful exportation of firearms, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). This resulted in a total offense level of 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">However, the PSR found that the cross-reference at U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l)(A), which applies where a defendant \u201cpossessed or transferred a firearm or ammunition with knowledge or intent that it would be used or possessed in connection with another offense,\u201d <em>id., </em>applied to Jiminez. The PSR determined that this other offense was the illegal exportation of firearms, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">As previously noted, Edgar Jiminez transferred and disposed of the 14 firearms he purchased to Juan Nunez for further distribution to \u201cPareja/Paraja.\u201d Thus, it is <em>reasonably foreseeable </em>that Edgar Jiminez knew that the firearms were being illegally smuggled into Mexico, due to the suspicious circumstances surrounding the firearms purchases; the types of weapons; proximity of the border and drug cartel violence; the number of weapons; and the type and nature of how the weapons were purchased. Additionally, there is no record that anyone in the straw purchasing organization secured a license to export these weapons into Mexico. Thus, the organization would have the potential to facilitate any other felony offense of exportation of arms without [a] required validated export license.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">(emphasis added). Application of this cross-reference resulted in a base offense level of 26, the base offense level for the exportation of illegal firearms.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2M5.2(a)(l). Following a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), the resulting total offense level was 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Jiminez had no prior criminal convictions and, therefore, had zero criminal history points. Accordingly, his criminal history category was I. The resulting Guidelines range of imprisonment, based on a total offense level of 24, a criminal history category of I, and a statutory maximum of five years imprisonment for the crime, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(1), was 51 to 60 months, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. Sentencing Table.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">Jiminez submitted written objections to the PSR. He objected to the enhancement for trafficking in firearms, the enhancement for possessing or transferring a firearm in connection with another felony offense, and the use of the cross-reference. He also requested that the district court consider a minor role reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, as well as a third-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b). Further, Jiminez requested a downward departure from the recommended Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">At sentencing, the Government moved for the third-level acceptance of responsibility reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b), and the district court granted the motion. Jiminez then re-raised his objections to the application of the enhancements and the cross-reference. The Government argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>that \u201cthe enhancements were appropriate under the <em>Juarez ... </em>standard,\u201d (emphasis added), apparently in reference to <em>United States v. Juarez, </em>626 F.3d 246 (5th Cir. 2010). The district court responded, \u201cI agree.\u201d The Government then stated that it had no objection to the district court\u2019s consideration of a minor role reduction for the cross-reference. Thereafter, the district court adopted the factual findings contained in the PSR and granted a two-point minor role reduction, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">I conclude that the report was correctly scored, that the enhancements were appropriately made. However, on the cross reference to unlawfully exporting firearms, Mr. Jiminez being a conspirator in that, his role being to purchase the firearms that ultimately were smuggled into Mexico, I find in that conspiracy he was a minor participant so I\u2019ll grant a two point role adjustment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">This resulted in a total offense level of 21 which, when combined with a criminal history category of I, resulted in a Guidelines range of 37 to 46 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Sentencing Table. The district court sentenced Jiminez to 37 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. Jiminez filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">We ordinarily review the appeal of a sentence for procedural error and for substantive reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). However, because Jiminez challenges only the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines, this court \u201cneed consider only that procedural aspect of the sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>649 F.3d 301, 303 (5th Cir.2011). The district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo, and its factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Hicks, </em>389 F.3d 514, 529 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">If a district court commits a significant procedural error, such as an improper calculation of the Guidelines range, the appellate court must reverse and remand unless the error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752-53 (5th Cir.2009). \u201cA procedural error during sentencing is harmless if the error did not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 753 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted.). The party seeking to uphold the sentence bears the burden of establishing harmless error and \u201cmust point to evidence in the record that will convince [the appellate court] that the district court had a particular sentence in mind and would have imposed it, notwithstanding the error made in arriving at the defendant\u2019s guideline range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">III. Application of the Guidelines</p>\n<p id=\"b409-13\">Jiminez challenges the application of the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l)(A) cross-reference, arguing that the district court applied the wrong legal standard and that, even if it applied the correct legal standard, the evidence does not support the application of the cross-reference. He also argues for the first time on appeal that, assuming the district court\u2019s application of the cross-reference was appropriate, the district court erred by failing to subtract three levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Xl.l(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-14\">The cross-reference provision at issue states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>(1) If the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with the commission or attempted commission of another offense, or possessed or transferred a firearm or ammunition with knowledge or intent that it would be used or possessed in connection with another offense, apply\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-4\">(A) \u00a7 2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) in respect to that other offense, if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXt\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(c). This court has held that the cross-reference applies only if the district court finds that: (1) \u201cthe firearm facilitated or had the potential to facilitate another offense,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe defendant transferred the firearm <em>knowing or intending </em>it to be used or possessed for that offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnston, </em>559 F.3d 292, 295 (5th Cir.2009) (emphasis added). In <em>Johnston, </em>we reviewed a district court\u2019s application of the cross-reference where \u201cthe defendant knew <em>or should have known\u201d </em>that the firearm would be used to commit another offense \u2014 in that case, attempted murder. <em>Id. </em>at 296. We reversed and remanded for resentencing, clarifying that the cross-reference applies only if the defendant \u201ctransferred the gun <em>knowing </em>\u201d it would be used to commit the other offense, and stating that \u201c[t]he cross-reference ... should not be followed if [the defendant] should have known (but did not actually know)\u201d the gun would be used for the other offense. <em>Id. </em>at 295-96 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The standard applied in the PSR, which was adopted by the district court, is less than clear. The Government contends that the PSR asserted the proper standard, as it stated that the cross-reference applies \u201cif the defendant ... possessed or transferred a firearm or ammunition with knowledge or intent that it would be used or possessed in connection with another offense.\u201d But this was a mere recitation of the text of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(c). In the PSR\u2019s analysis of the cross-reference, it stated that, because \u201cit is <em>reasonably foreseeable </em>that ... Jiminez knew that the firearms were being illegally smuggled into Mexico,\u201d the cross-reference applied, (emphasis added). This suggests that the lower court, in adopting the PSR, applied a standard less stringent than <em>Johnston\u2019s </em>\u201cactual knowledge\u201d requirement. Such a conclusion is bolstered by the lower court\u2019s reference at sentencing to the <em>Juarez </em>case. In <em>Juarez, </em>we analyzed different Guidelines provisions, U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) and (6), which are both triggered by the lesser \u201creason to believe\u201d standard. <em>See Juarez, </em>626 F.3d at 249-50. Finally, the lower court never stated or otherwise indicated on the record a finding that Jiminez had actual knowledge that the firearms would be smuggled to Mexico. Therefore, we conclude that the district court erred by applying a standard inconsistent with that laid out in Johnston.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">The Government further argues that, even assuming the inapplicability of the cross-reference, the lower court\u2019s error was harmless. The Government has the \u201cheavy burden\u201d of \u201cconvincingly demonstrating]\u201d that the lower court would have reached the same sentence absent the error. <em>United States v. Ibarra-Luna, </em>628 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>F.3d 712, 717 (5th Cir.2010). Here, it is undisputed that, assuming all the same adjustments apply, the total offense level without application of the cross-reference \u2014 19\u2014would be lower than that under the cross-reference \u2014 21. The term of imprisonment range for the former is 30 to 37 months, while the range for the latter is 37 to 46 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Sentencing Table.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">However, the Government challenges Jiminez\u2019s assumption that he would be entitled to a two-level minor role reduction if sentenced under the straw purchasing Guidelines provision, <em>i.e., </em>the applicable provision absent the cross-reference. The Government points to the lower court\u2019s discussion of the reduction, which focused on Jiminez\u2019s role in the exportation of firearms: \u201c[0]n the cross[-]reference to unlawfully exporting firearms, Mr. Jiminez being a conspirator in that, his role being to purchase the firearms that ultimately were smuggled into Mexico, I find in that conspiracy he was a minor participant so I\u2019ll grant a two point role adjustment.\u201d According to the Government, this statement makes clear that the lower court would have applied the minor role reduction only in the context of the cross-reference. But because the lower court was applying the cross-reference based on the \u201cother offense\u201d of illegal exportation of firearms, it is no surprise that its analysis focused solely on Jiminez\u2019s conduct in relation to that crime. There was no reason for the court to address whether a minor role adjustment would apply with respect to Jiminez\u2019s role in the straw purchases, as it was not sentencing Jiminez pursuant to that Guidelines provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The Government argues that, with respect to the straw purchases, Jiminez cannot be considered \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant\u201d in the offense, as required for application of the minor role reduction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 3(A); <em>see also United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 204 (5th Cir. 2005) (\u201c[I]n order to qualify as a minor participant, a defendant must have been peripheral to the advancement of the illicit activity.\u201d (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)). But deciding whether a minor role reduction applies \u201cinvolves a determination that is heavily dependent upon the facts of the particular case,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 3(C), a determination the lower court had no occasion to make in the first instance. We are reluctant to speculate on what the district court could or will do in this heavily fact-bound situation. It is enough for present purposes for us to conclude that the Government has not \u201cconvincingly demonstrate^]\u201d that the lower court would find a minor role reduction inappropriate upon resentencing. <em>Ibarrar-Luna, </em>628 F.3d at 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Finally, it is true that Jiminez\u2019s 37-month sentence falls within the Guidelines range even absent application of the cross-reference, and after applying the minor role adjustment. But it falls at the <em>high </em>end of the range of 30 to 37 months. In selecting a term of imprisonment at the <em>low </em>end of what it believed to be the proper Guidelines range, the lower court stated: \u201cI made this ... reduction off your sentence because of your youth, in part, and in part because I believe this sentence is already harsh enough where you\u2019ll learn your lesson and not resort to any kind of future criminal activity.\u201d The lower court also allowed Jiminez to self-surrender several days after the sentencing hearing, rather than requiring that he be taken into custody immediately. This at least suggests that, upon resentencing, the lower court may again show leniency and select a sentence at the low end of the applicable range. Therefore, the Government has failed to meet its heavy burden to show that the lower court would have reached the same sentence without applying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>cross-reference. Indeed, \u201cthe improper calculation of the Guidelines range can rarely be shown not to affect the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d at 753 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Because the district court erred by utilizing the wrong legal standard in applying the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(c) cross-reference, and because the Government has failed to meet its burden to show that the error was harmless, we VACATE Jiminez\u2019s sentence and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b407-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b407-19\">. Although the indictment charged Jiminez with the straw purchases of only four fire<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>arms, the district court, in calculating the Guidelines range, was entitled to consider relevant conduct that was not formally charged. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(A) and (B); <em>United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 462 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b408-7\">. The cross-reference directs the use of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, Conspiracy) with respect to the \"other offense\u201d if the resulting offense level is greater than the offense level already determined using U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1. The base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X1.1 is the same as the base offense level of the underlying substantive offense \u2014 -here, the exportation of illegal firearms.

On appeal, Jiminez does not challenge the enhancements for trafficking in firearms, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), or for possessing or transferring a firearm in connection with the felony offense of unlawful exportation of firearms, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b410-6\">.

Accordingly, we need not reach Jiminez\u2019s alternative argument that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of actual knowledge.
