At sentencing, Spohr withdrew his objection to the district court\u2019s refusal to give him credit for acceptance of responsibility. That refusal was based on Spohr\u2019s attack on another federal inmate while Spohr awaited sentencing. Spohr has waived any appeal of that issue, and we need not consider it. <em>See United States v. Conn, </em>657 F.3d 280, 286 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Spohr argues that his 90-month sentence is substantively unreasonable. The sentence is a variance above the advisory guideline range maximum of 63 months pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard and \u201cgive due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">In clearly and adequately explaining the sentence, the district court recounted Spohr\u2019s extensive and violent criminal history that included convictions involving violence, threats of violence, and risks of harm. Several convictions were not counted in Spohr\u2019s criminal history score. The prior convictions are relevant to \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d under \u00a7 3553(a)(1). <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 363-64 (5th Cir.2009). The court also explained that the 90-month sentence is needed to deter Spohr and to protect the public. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B) &amp; (C). The degree of deviation is also reasonable in light of other sentences we have affirmed. <em>See United States v. Herrera-Garduno, </em>519 F.3d 526, 531-32 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">Spohr fails to show that the sentence is unreasonable or an abuse of discretion. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b326-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
