Cole, Deputy Attorney General, to All Federal Prosecutors (Oct. 14, 2014), <em>available at </em>http://pdfserver.amlaw.com/ nlj/DOJ_Ineffective_Assistance_Counsel. pdf (\u201cFor cases in which a defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance claim would be barred by a previously executed waiver, prosecutors should decline to enforce the waiver when defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance resulting in prejudice or when the defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance claim raises a serious debatable issue that a court should resolve.\u201d). In light of this new policy, and in response to our directive asking the United States Attorney to address its impact on the instant case, the Government has withdrawn its reliance on Jeremy Jones\u2019s collateral-attack waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-24\">As a result, the judgment of the District Court is VACATED and the case is REMANDED to the District Court with the instruction to afford Jones an evidentiary hearing on his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-25\">VACATED and REMANDED, with instruction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
