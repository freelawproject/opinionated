In his lawsuit, Grant alleges that he was subject to unlawful discrimination and retaliation that eventually led to his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">On Defendant-Appellees CPC Logistics, Incorporated\u2019s and CPC Building &amp; Manufacturing Products\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the district court dismissed all of Grant\u2019s claims. Proceeding through the <em>McDonnell </em>Douglas<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> circumstantial evidence framework for race discrimination claims,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the district court first concluded that Grant failed to establish all four elements of the <em>prima facie </em>case. Specifically, the district court concluded that one of Grant\u2019s two comparators had a different and noncomparable violation history, and that the second of Grant\u2019s comparators was not treated more favorably than Grant, because he too was fired after the same number of logbook violations. Second, the district court concluded that even if Grant had established the <em>prima facie </em>case, the Defendant-Appellees had articulated legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for terminating Grant \u2014 namely, failure to comply with company logbook and speed limit policies \u2014 and that Grant failed to establish that these legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons were mere pretext for race discrimination. The district court next addressed Grant\u2019s claims of retaliation, again proceeding through the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court held that Grant failed to make the <em>prima facie </em>case, because there was no evidence that he had engaged in any protected activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-15\">Grant timely appeals the grant of summary judgment, arguing that the district court erred in dismissing his claims. On <em>de novo </em>review of the district court\u2019s grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>of summary judgment to Defendant-Appellees, we AFFIRM for essentially the same reasons given by the district court.-<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b405-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
