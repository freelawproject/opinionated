We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d). We review de novo BAP decisions, and apply the same standard of review that the BAP applied to the bankruptcy court\u2019s ruling. <em>Boyajian v. New Falls Corp. (In re Boyajian), </em>564 F.3d 1088, 1090 (9th Cir.2009). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">The BAP properly determined that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion by reconverting Sui\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 proceeding, and that the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of bad faith were not clearly erroneous. <em>See Marrama v. Citizens Bank of Mass., </em>549 U.S. 365, 373, 127 S.Ct. 1105, 166 L.Ed.2d 956 (2007) (Chapter 13 proceeding may be converted to a Chapter 7 proceeding \u201cfor cause,\u201d including bad faith conduct); <em>Rosson v. Fitzgerald (In re Rosson), </em>545 F.3d 764, 771 (9th Cir.2008) (setting forth standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The BAP properly determined that it lacked jurisdiction to review the bankruptcy court\u2019s interlocutory orders allowing administrative claims for fees and expenses because those orders are not final decisions. <em>See United States v. Fowler (In re Fowler), </em>394 F.3d 1208, 1211 (9th Cir.2005) (discussing \u201cpragmatic approach to determining finality\u201d of bankruptcy court orders and setting forth tests to determine finality); <em>Leichty v. Neary (In re Strand), </em>375 F.3d 854, 858 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201c[Ijnterim awards are interlocutory and often require future adjustments!];] they are always subject to the court\u2019s reexamination and adjustment during the course of the case.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">We reject Sui\u2019s contentions that his bankruptcy was moot and that the BAP erred by not amending its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">Sui\u2019s request for sanctions, set forth in his reply brief, is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-11\">We grant Sui\u2019s request for judicial notice filed on January 6, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b767-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
