Uribe-Nava argues that the United States District Court for the Northern District lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate violations of his probation committed prior to the Northern District\u2019s acceptance of jurisdiction over his probation imposed in 2008 in the Western District. Conceding that his arguments are foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>379 F.3d 270 (5th Cir.2004), he contends that <em>Fernandez </em>was incorrectly decided, and he raises the issue to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">As Uribe-Nava concedes, whatever their merit, his arguments challenging the transfer of jurisdiction from the Western District to the Northern District are foreclosed by <em>Fernandez. See Fernandez, </em>379 F.3d at 272-77. As Uribe-Nava further concedes, one panel of this court may not overrule the decision of another absent an en banc or superseding Supreme Court decision. <em>See United States v. Lipscomb, </em>299 F.3d 303, 313 n. 34 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b452-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
