The district court sentenced them to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, an upward variance of 36 months from the Sentencing Guidelines range. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.4(b) (2013). Jacobs and Gatford appeal, claiming that their sentences are substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-19\">We review the district court\u2019s sentence, \u201cwhether inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range[,]\u201d for reasonableness \u201cunder a deferential abuse-of-diseretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Because Jacobs and Gatford do not challenge the procedural reasonableness of their sentences, we turn our attention to substantive reasonableness and consider \u201cthe totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. An upward variance is permitted where justified by the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2012) factors. <em>See id. </em>We \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of a variance,\u201d and \u201c[t]he fact that [we] might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-20\">Jacobs and Gatford assert that the district court improperly relied upon the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) to the exclusion of the other statutory sentencing factors. We disagree. The district court described how Appellants\u2019 individual actions were more culpable than those of defendants with similar charges and were analogous to discharging a firearm. We also conclude that the court did not improperly rely upon the sentence imposed on a codefendant to determine the length of the variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-21\">Jacobs and Gatford also argue that their sentences are contrary to Congress\u2019 intent for different mandatory minimum sentences to apply to brandishing and discharging a firearm. However, Congress left district courts with the option of imposing sentences of seven years or more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>for brandishing a firearm if the facts so warranted. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) (declining to set maximum sentence). Therefore, Congress\u2019 intent in formulating \u00a7 924(c) does not render unreasonable the district court\u2019s imposition of 120-month sentences under \u00a7 924(c)(i)(A)(ii).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Accordingly, we hold that the upward variance imposed by the district court is substantively reasonable, and we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b280-15\"> To the extent Appellants raise new claims in their reply brief, those claims are not properly before the court. <em>See United States v. Ashford, </em>718 F.3d 377, 383 n. * (4th Cir.2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
