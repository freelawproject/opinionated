Clevenger appeals the district court\u2019s judgment affirming the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s decision denying Clevenger\u2019s application for Disability Insurance Income and Supplemental Security Income under Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act. Clevenger contends that the Administrative Law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) failed to set forth specific and legitimate reasons for rejecting the opinion of her treating psychologist, Dr. John Arnold. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-23\">We review the district court\u2019s decision de novo. <em>Molina v. Astrue, </em>674 F.3d 1104, 1110 (9th Cir.2012). We may set aside the denial of benefits only if it is not supported by substantial evidence or is based on legal error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-24\">A treating physician\u2019s opinion is entitled to substantial weight in social security proceedings. <em>Bray v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>554 F.3d 1219, 1228 (9th Cir. 2009). \u201cWhen presented with conflicting medical opinions, the ALJ must determine credibility and resolve the conflict.\u201d <em>Batson v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>359 F.3d 1190, 1195 (9th Cir.2004). If an ALJ rejects a treating physician\u2019s opinion that is contradicted by another doctor, he must provide specific, legitimate reasons based on substantial evidence in the record. <em>Valentine v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>574 F.3d 685, 692 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-25\">The ALJ properly discounted the opinion of treating psychologist Dr. Arnold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>because his opinion was inconsistent with Clevenger\u2019s activities and the other medical evidence in the record. First, the ALJ properly concluded that Dr. Arnold\u2019s opinion was inconsistent with Clevenger\u2019s activities, which included successfully living and working with others. Second, the ALJ properly concluded that Dr. Arnold\u2019s opinion conflicted with the opinions of examining psychologist Samantha Chandler, Psy.D. and State reviewing experts Rita Flanagan, Ph.D., and Mary Gentile, Ph.D. In contrast to Dr. Arnold\u2019s conclusion that Clevenger had marked limitations in learning new tasks and interacting with others, each of these medical witnesses found that Clevenger could follow simple instructions and interact at least superficially with others in the workplace. Therefore, the ALJ provided specific and legitimate reasons for rejecting Dr. Arnold\u2019s opinion. <em>See Valentine, 574 </em>F.3d at 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b737-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
