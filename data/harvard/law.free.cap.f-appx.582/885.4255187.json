To prevail, Mr. Izon must establish that he completed at least five years of creditable service with at least one of the last two years before separation being completed in a \u201ccovered service.\u201d Because Mr. Izon has not shown that any of his employment constituted a \u201ccovered service,\u201d we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>Background</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Mr. Izon worked for the Department of the Navy at the Subic Bay Naval Base in the Philippines from 1966 to 1992. In 1992, he resigned from his position as an Electronics Mechanic to take early retirement. Retirement deductions were not withheld from Mr. Izon\u2019s pay during his employment, and he appears to have been eligible for a lump sum retirement benefit equivalent to 85% of 24 months of basic pay under the U.S. Forces early retirement plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">In February 2013, Mr. Izon applied for a deferred retirement annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) denied Mr. Izon\u2019s application. He then appealed to the Merit System Protection Board (the \u201cBoard\u201d), which affirmed on the basis that Mr. Izon did not establish that any of his employment is a \u201ccovered service\u201d under the Civil Service Retirement Act (CSRA). Mr. Izon timely appealed to this Court. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9) (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">We must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless it was \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c); <em>Dela Rosa v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>583 F.3d 762, 764 (Fed.Cir.2009). To qualify for a civil service retirement annuity, Mr. Izon must have completed at least five years of \u201ccreditable\u201d service, of which at least one of his last two years before separation were completed in a \u201ccovered service.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8333; <em>Quiocson v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>490 F.3d 1358, 1360 (Fed.Cir.2007). Most service is \u201ccreditable,\u201d but not all is \u201ccovered.\u201d <em>Rosete v. Office of Pers. Mgmt, </em>48 F.3d 514, 516 (Fed.Cir.1995). To be \u201ccovered,\u201d the service must be subject to the Civil Service Retirement Act, and the employee must deposit part of his pay into the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">On appeal, Mr. Izon appears to argue that, under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8334(c) and 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.303(a), he should be allowed to retroactively contribute to the CSRDF, and thereby become eligible for a CSRS annuity. Section 831.303(a) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-10\">Periods of creditable civilian service performed by an employee or Member after July 31, 1920, but before October 1, 1982, for which retirement deductions have not been taken shall be included in determining length of service to compute annuity under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code; however, if the employee, Member, or survivor does not elect either to complete the deposit describes [sic] by section 8334(c) of title 5, United States Code, or to eliminate the service from annuity computation, his or her annuity is reduced by 10 percent of the amount which should have been deposited (plus interest) for the period of noncontributory service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">Mr. Izon appears to contend that under this regulation he is an \u201cemployee,\u201d and as such is permitted to retroactively contribute to the CSRDF for his service until October 1,1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-12\">Whether Mr. Izon qualifies as an \u201cemployee\u201d under section 831.303(a) and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8334(c) is determined according to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.112(a). <em>Dela Rosa, </em>583 F.3d at 765; 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.303(a). A prerequisite for an individual to qualify as an \u201cemployee\u201d under \u00a7 831.112(a) is that the individual\u2019s position be a \u201ccovered service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Having reviewed the record before us, we are unable to find any basis to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>hold that any of Mr. Izon\u2019s service of employment was a \u201ccovered service.\u201d For example, his SF-50s state that throughout his employment, his retirement plan was either \u201cnone\u201d or \u201cother,\u201d indicating that his position was not a \u201ccovered service.\u201d Nor has Mr. Izon cited to any other evidence indicating that his position was nonetheless a \u201ccovered service.\u201d As a result, Mr. Izon is not an \u201cemployee\u201d for the purpose of the authority to make retroactive deposits under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8334(c) and 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.303(a). For this reason we affirm the decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Because Mr. Izon has not shown that any of his employment was a \u201ccovered service,\u201d we <em>affirm </em>the Board\u2019s decision affirming OPM\u2019s denial of Mr. Izon\u2019s application for annuity under CSRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
