Apr. 17, 2013), <em>aff'g </em>No. A087 633 146 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Nov. 29, 2010). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-19\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the IJ\u2019s decision minus the portions of the ruling not affirmed by the BIA. <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. DOJ, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513-14 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-20\">For asylum applications, like Guo\u2019s, governed by the REAL ID Act, the agency may, \u201c[c]onsidering the totality of the circumstances,\u201d base a credibility finding on inconsistencies in the applicant\u2019s statements and other record evidence \u201cwithout regard to whether\u201d they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 163 n. 2 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam). Furthermore, for purposes of a credibility determination, \u201c[a]n inconsistency and an omission are ... functionally equivalent.\u201d <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 166. We \u201cdefer to an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact finder could make\u201d such a ruling. <em>Id. </em>at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>The IJ reasonably based her adverse credibility determination on inconsistencies in Guo\u2019s evidence and the lack of plausible explanation for those inconsistencies. Guo claimed that (1) she had a second intrauterine device (\u201cIUD\u201d) forcibly placed, which she then had removed prior to her departure from China to the United States, and (2) she told the asylum officer about adverse health effects she suffered from IUDs and about the placement of the second IUD. The IJ found, however, that the asylum officer\u2019s assessment did not reflect this information, and neither Guo\u2019s asylum application nor a letter from Guo\u2019s husband indicated that the second IUD had been removed. The agency rejected Guo\u2019s explanation that the removal of the second IUD was \u201ca matter of privacy,\u201d finding that removal of the IUD went \u201cto the heart of a marital relationship,\u201d and Guo\u2019s husband had \u201cintimate knowledge regarding the first IUD\u201d and \u201capparent knowledge that a second IUD had been placed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The IJ also found Guo\u2019s testimony regarding her opportunity to leave China inconsistent. Guo initially testified that she had no opportunity to leave China until 2008. When confronted with tourist visas on her passport from 2005, however, Guo admitted that she had travelled to Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand in 2005. As a result, the IJ found that Guo\u2019s testimony was \u201cnot plausible\u201d because \u201c[h]er testimony that she did leave China in 2005 and returned undercuts her initial claim that she was unable to find a smuggler to help her leave that country until 2008.\u201d Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, and a reasonable fact finder could have found Guo not credible in view of the totality of the circumstances. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 163 <em>&amp; </em>n. 2,166.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">We have considered all of petitioner\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
