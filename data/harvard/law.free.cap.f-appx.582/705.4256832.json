We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a dismissal for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915A and 1915(e)(2). <em>Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Barren v. Harrington, </em>152 F.3d 1193, 1194 (9th Cir.1998) (order). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">The district court properly dismissed Shepard\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim against defendant P. Munoz because Shepard failed to allege facts showing that P. Munoz\u2019s conduct objectively established a constitutional violation. <em>See Watison v. Carter, </em>668 F.3d 1108, 1112-14 (9th Cir. 2012) (\u201c[N]ot every malevolent touch by a prison guard gives rise to a federal cause of action.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">The district court properly dismissed Shepard\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim against defendants C. Munoz and Campos because Shepard failed to allege facts showing that these defendants knew of and disregarded an excessive risk to his safety. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (a prison official cannot be found liable for failing to protect an inmate \u201cunless the official knew of and disregarded an excessive risk to inmate ... safety\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-12\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Shepard\u2019s state law claims after dismissing his federal claims without leave to amend. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3). We construe the dismissal of the state law claims to be without prejudice. <em>See Gini v. Las Vegas Metro. Police Dep\u2019t, </em>40 F.3d 1041, 1046 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-13\">We reject Shepard\u2019s contention that the district court dismissed Shepard\u2019s action as a favor to defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b734-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
