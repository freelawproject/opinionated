She appeals the district court\u2019s order imposing restitution in the amount of $100,272.72. Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Booth, </em>309 F.3d 566, 575 n. 6 (9th Cir.2002), we affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-23\">Under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A, courts are directed to order restitution \u201cin the full amount of each victim\u2019s losses.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(1)(A). When more than one defendant has contributed to the loss, courts have discretion to either \u201cmake each defendant liable for payment of the full amount [or] apportion liability among the defendants to reflect the level of contribution to the victim\u2019s loss.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-24\">The district court properly exercised its discretion when it declined Defendant\u2019s request to apportion restitution to reflect her low degree of culpability and responsibility for the victim\u2019s loss. The court was aware that it had such discretion, but nonetheless found Defendant blameworthy with re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>spect to the offense for which she was charged. The reason the district court gave is also consistent with the purposes that restitution is designed to serve. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>722 F.3d 1146, 1150 (9th Cir.) (noting that the purpose of restitution is \u201cnot to punish the defendant, but to make the victim whole again\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 658, 187 L.Ed.2d 422 (2013). Even if the court could have apportioned restitution in light of the fact that her codefendant\u2019s sentence had already been imposed, its decision not to do so was properly within its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b798-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
