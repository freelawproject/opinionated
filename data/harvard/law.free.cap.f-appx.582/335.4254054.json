Appellant has waived his claims on appeal by failing to adequately explain them and by failing to furnish citations to the record. F.R.A.P. 28(a)(8); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993) (citations to record are necessary; pro se appellants must brief arguments correctly to preserve them); <em>Moore v. FDIC, </em>993 F.2d 106, 107 (5th Cir.1993). Most of his arguments do not challenge the grounds for the district court\u2019s dismissal of each of his claims. Nevertheless, we find no reversible error of fact or law by the district court and affirm for substantially the reasons expressed in that Court\u2019s conscientious and well-reasoned opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b363-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
