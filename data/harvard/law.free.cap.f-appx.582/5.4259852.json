The court has accorded the issues full consideration and has determined that they do not warrant a published opinion. See D.C. CIR. R. 36(D). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b33-18\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the judgment of the district court be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-19\">Appellant Charles L. Light seeks reversal of the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to appellee, the Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d), on Light\u2019s claim that the SBA, through Disaster Personnel Director Alan Hoberman, rejected his application for employment in retaliation for his prior equal employment opportunity (\u201cEEO\u201d) activity. Appellant\u2019s Br. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-21\">The SBA has proffered a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for Hoberman\u2019s decision not to rehire Light: Light\u2019s inappropriate and disruptive conduct as a pri- or SBA employee. Appellee\u2019s Br. 19. Hoberman testified that he considered a negative comment in Light\u2019s employment record (the \u201cblue card\u201d) as well as a discussion with SBA official Evelyn Morris. See Hoberman Dep. 75:12-76:10. In a letter to Light explaining the reasoning for his decision, Hoberman also referred to a letter that Light sent to the SBA in September 1994 in which Light announced his departure, stated that he was angry, and made comments that Hoberman considered \u201cneither correct nor constructive\u201d regarding his former supervisor's. Hoberman Ltr. to Light, Oct. 6, 2004; Hoberman Dep. 118:08-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-22\">Because the SBA has provided a legitimate explanation for Hoberman\u2019s decision, \u201cthe only question is whether the employee\u2019s evidence creates a material dispute on the ultimate issue of retaliation \u2018either directly by [showing] that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones v. Benanke, </em>557 F.3d 670, 678 (D.C.Cir.2009) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>U.S. Postal Serv. Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, </em>460 U.S. 711, 716, 103 S.Ct. 1478, 75 L.Ed.2d 403 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-23\">Light pursued both the direct and indirect avenues. The district court correctly found, however, that Light had failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact on the question of Hoberman\u2019s motivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>First, Light fails to show that Hoberman\u2019s \u201cproffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>557 F.3d at 678. Light argues that discrepancies between versions of the blue card indicate that the negative comment was false, inaccurate, or added after the fact. Appellant\u2019s Br. 15-19. However, any version of the blue card in the record would have been sufficient to support Hoberman\u2019s testimony. The issue is not \u201cthe correctness or desirability of [the] reasons offered,\u201d but \u201cwhether the employer honestly believes in the reasons it offers.\u201d <em>Fischbach v. D.C. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>86 F.3d 1180, 1183 (D.C.Cir.1996) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>McCoy v. WGN Cont\u2019l Broad. Co., </em>957 F.2d 368, 373 (7th Cir.1992)). Furthermore, the SBA has adequately explained the causes of the differences among the versions. See Appellee\u2019s Br. 21-25. .Light also fails to demonstrate any reversible error in the district court\u2019s rulings on his claims that certain of the materials offered by the SBA in support of its summary judgment motion would not have been admissible in evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">Nor does Light show that \u201ca discriminatory reason more likely motivated\u201d Hoberman. <em>Jones, </em>557 F.3d at 678. Even if we adopted the first-opportunity-to-retaliate test \u2014 under which Hoberman rejected Light\u2019s application \u201chours\u201d after first having the opportunity to do so, Appellant\u2019s Br. 34 \u2014 Light\u2019s evidence that his prior protected activity in fact motivated Hoberman\u2019s decision would remain \u201canemic.\u201d <em>Light v. Mills, </em>895 F.Supp.2d 191, 197 (D.D.C.2012). Because Hoberman\u2019s testimony was \u201creasonable in light of the evidence,\u201d there was \u201cno basis for permitting a jury to conclude\u201d that his explanation was untrue. <em>Brady v. Office of Sergeant at Arms, </em>520 F.3d 490, 495 (D.C.Cir.2008). Unlike in <em>Borgo v. Goldin, </em>204 F.3d 251 (D.C.Cir.2000), where a jury could reasonably have inferred either that a supervisor retaliated in response to a paragraph alleging discrimination or that he generally responded to \u201cthe letter\u2019s overall non-responsiveness and message of non-acquiescence,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 257, the evidence here provides no grounds for doubting that Hoberman relied on permissible bases \u2014 including any non-protected portions of Light\u2019s letter \u2014 for his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Pursuant to Rule 36 of this court, this disposition will not be published. The clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after the disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing <em>en banc. </em>See Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. R. 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
