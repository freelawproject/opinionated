A COA will be granted \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 327, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). This standard is satisfied \u201cby demonstrating that jurists of reason could disagree with the district court\u2019s resolution of [the movant\u2019s] constitutional claims or that jurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 327, 123 S.Ct. 1029; <em>see also Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146. L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">In his \u00a7 2255 motion Duckett raised four claims; however, in his COA filing in this court he raises only one of these claims, which we discuss below. Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993). The claims not addressed by Duckett in his COA filing are deemed abandoned. <em>See Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 613 (5th Cir.1999). A COA is denied as to these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Duckett argues that reasonable jurists would debate the correctness of the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to file a requested notice of appeal. In denying relief on this claim, the district court referred to an affidavit submitted by Duckett\u2019s trial counsel, who swore that Duckett did not ask that a notice of appeal be filed. However, Duckett filed in the district court a declaration pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746 in which he averred that, during a meeting following sentencing, he requested that his attorney file an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">To demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel based on a claim that counsel failed to file a requested notice of appeal, a defendant must show that counsel performed deficiently and that a reasonable probability exists that, but for counsel\u2019s deficient conduct, the defendant would have timely appealed. <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 476-77, 484, 486, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000). Counsel\u2019s performance is deficient if counsel disregards his client\u2019s wishes concerning filing an appeal or if counsel fails to consult with the client on the matter when counsel has a constitutionally imposed duty to do so. <em>Id. </em>at 477-78, 120 S.Ct. 1029. The defendant need not demonstrate prejudice by showing that he would have been able to raise a meritorious issue on appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 486, 120 S.Ct. 1029. Rather, \u201cwhen counsel\u2019s constitutionally deficient performance deprives a defendant of an appeal that he otherwise would have taken, the defendant has made out a successful ineffective assistance of counsel claim entitling him to an appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">A district court must hold an evidentiary hearing and make findings of fact regarding a \u00a7 2255 motion, \u201c[u]nless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\u201d \u00a7 2255(b); <em>United States v. Bartholomew, </em>974 F.2d 39, 41 (5th Cir. 1992). The record shows that there is a conflict in the accounts given by Duckett and his attorney as to whether Duckett requested that counsel file an appeal. In view of the foregoing, the district court erred by denying relief on Duckett\u2019s claim without holding a hearing and making findings of fact. Accordingly, we grant a COA on this claim, vacate in part the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>denial of \u00a7 2255 relief, and remand this claim for further proceedings. Duckett\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">COA MOTION GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART; VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS; IFP MOTION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b553-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
