(Count 2), and conspiracy to commit bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 871, 1344 (Count 3). She was sentenced on each count to concurrent 18-month terms of imprisonment to be followed by concurrent two-year terms of supervised release. Bell\u2019s term of supervision commenced in July 2013, and it was revoked in November 2013. The district court imposed a new prison term of 27 months but did not impose any additional term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">In her sole argument, Bell asserts that the 27-month revocation sentence is illegal because it exceeds the statutorily allowable maximum sentence. Based on the Government\u2019s concession of error, Bell has filed an unopposed motion to vacate and remand for resentencing as well as to have the mandate issue forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Despite Bell\u2019s failure to raise this issue in the district court, we review it de novo. <em>See United States v. Vera, </em>542 F.3d 457, 459 (5th Cir.2008). Of Bell\u2019s three convictions, her conviction on Count 1 carried the stiffest sentence, <em>ie., </em>up to 15 years of imprisonment. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1028(a)(7), (b)(1)(D), and (f). That conviction is thus for a Class C felony. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(3). Upon revoking a term of supervised release on a Class C felony offense, the district court may impose a new prison term of not more than two years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). In light of the foregoing, the 27-month sentence imposed by the district court exceeds the statutory maximum allowable sentence of 24 months, and it is illegal. <em>See Vera, </em>542 F.3d at 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Bell\u2019s unopposed motion is GRANTED. We therefore VACATE the judgment of sentence and REMAND for resentencing. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b327-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
