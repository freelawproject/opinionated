We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Cole v. Oroville Union High Sch, </em>228 F.3d 1092, 1097 (9th Cir. 2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>The district court properly granted summary judgment because Quillar failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether there remained any case or controversy warranting further relief after defendants expunged the disciplinary reports related to grooming violations that Quillar challenged under RLUIPA, and restored his classification status, loss of credits, and access to privileges as if the reports were never issued. <em>See Alvarez v. Hill, </em>667 F.3d 1061, 1064 (9th Cir.2012) (\u201cA claim is moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Ruiz v. City of Santa Maria, </em>160 F.3d 543, 549 (9th Cir.1998) (\u201cThe basic question in determining mootness is whether there is a present controversy as to which effective relief can be granted.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Quillar\u2019s contentions that defendant erroneously failed to expunge a June 22, 2005 disciplinary report or restore his classification status from \u201cA2B\u201d to \u201cA1A;\u201d that court-appointed pro bono counsel in his prior appeal and on remand prejudiced his ability to prosecute his claims; and that the district court prevented him from submitting relevant evidence on summary judgment, are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Defendant\u2019s motion for judicial notice, filed on June 18, 2013, is granted. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b764-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
