He also appeals the sentence imposed by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. For the following reasons, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-17\">We write solely for the parties\u2019 benefit and thus recite only the facts essential to our disposition. Sergeant Walt Medycki responded to a radio call, early in the morning of May 20, 2006, which reported that shots had been fired at Old York Road and Godfrey Avenue in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Medycki observed Harold Griffin at the nearby intersection of Old York Road and Stenton Avenue and believed Griffin was carrying a gun. He approached Griffin and, Medycki testified at trial, Griffin pointed the barrel of the rifle he was holding at Medycki\u2019s chest. Griffin offered a justification defense, which he articulates before this Court as well, that he obtained the gun after struggling with an assailant who attempted to rob him. Griffin claims that his left ankle was grazed by a shot fired during the struggle, that he told Sergeant Medycki about the wound, but that Sergeant Medycki \u201cwouldn\u2019t listen and ordered [him] to get against the cruiser.\u201d Griffin Br. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-18\">During the voir dire process, a prospective juror remarked before the jury pool that his \u201cbrother\u2019s only daughter was viciously murdered by a handgun that\u2014 that \u2014 that person had no business having.\u201d Supplemental Appendix (\u201cS.A.\u201d) 73. The District Court.denied Griffin\u2019s request to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>dismiss the jury panel, and instead issued a detailed curative instruction. The jury found Griffin guilty of possession of a firearm and ammunition as a convicted felon, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). The District Court denied Griffin\u2019s motion, brought pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33(a), to vacate the jury verdict and grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The District Court held the final sentencing hearing on July 12, 2012, where it adopted the recommendations contained in the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d). S.A. 552. The PSR calculated that, although Griffin\u2019s base offense level was twenty-four, Griffin\u2019s three prior convictions meant that his final offense level was thirty-three, pursuant to the \u201carmed career criminal\u201d provision of the advisory United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(B); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Griffin filed a motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.11, which permits the sentencing court to reduce a sentence when it finds that the defendant \u201ccommitted] a crime in order to avoid a perceived greater harm.\u201d The District Court deni\u00e9d the motion. Although Griffin attempted to cooperate with the Government, the Government did not file a motion for downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, and the District Court denied Griffin\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing on the Government\u2019s decision not to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">The District Court sentenced Griffin to 262 months of imprisonment. Griffin now appeals the District Co\u00fcrt\u2019s decision not to strike the jury panel, the denial of Griffin\u2019s motion for a new trial, the designation of Griffin as a career offender pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), the District Court\u2019s denial of Griffin\u2019s motion pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.11, the denial of Griffin\u2019s motion to compel the Government to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, and, finally, the sentence imposed by the District Court, which Griffin argues was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">The District Court had jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231, and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. However, we lack jurisdiction over Griffin\u2019s claims that \u201cattack[] the district court\u2019s exercise of discretion in refusing to reduce the sentences below the sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Denardi, </em>892 F.2d 269, 272 (3d Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss the jury panel for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>566 F.3d 353, 359 (3d Cir.2009). Likewise, we review the District Court\u2019s denial of a Rule 33(a) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Saada, </em>212 F.3d 210, 215 (3d Cir.2000). As for the District Court\u2019s designation of a defendant as an armed career offender, \u201c[w]e exercise plenary review over legal questions about the meaning of the sentencing guidelines, but apply the deferential clearly erroneous standard to factual determinations underlying their application.\u201d <em>United States v. Inigo, </em>925 F.2d 641, 658 (3d Cir.1991). Furthermore, \u201c[w]e review a district court\u2019s decisions concerning departures from the Sentencing Guidelines for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Abuhouran, </em>161 F.3d 206, 209 (3d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a district court\u2019s sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). This requires that we consider \u201cwhether the final sentence, wherever it may lie within the permissible statutory range, was premised upon appropriate and judicious consideration of the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Doe, </em>617 F.3d 766, 770 (3d Cir.2010). We apply a deferential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>standard, affirming \u201cunless no reasonable sentencing court would have imposed the same sentence on that particular defendant for the reasons the district court provided.\u201d <em>United States v. Tomko, </em>562 F.3d 558, 568 (3d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Griffin argues that the District Court abused its discretion in failing to dismiss the entire jury panel when, during the voir dire process, a prospective juror declared that his \u201cbrother\u2019s only daughter was viciously murdered by a handgun that \u2014 that\u2014that person had no business having.\u201d S.A. 73. We disagree. The District Court recognized the potentially prejudicial nature of the prospective juror\u2019s remarks, and properly addressed, it with a curative instruction that stressed that \"the prospective juror\u2019s comment \u201cwas not an appropriate thing to say,\u201d that \u201c[njeither Mr. Griffin nor any of the rest of us is complicit in the crime\u201d the prospective juror recounted, and that \u201cthe very terrible events that according to [the prospective juror\u2019s] statement befell [his] niece\u201d have \u201cnothing to do, nothing to do with\u201d Griffin\u2019s case. S.A. 75. The court also reiterated that Griffin \u201csits here presumed innocent of th[e] crime\u201d for which he was on trial, and that the Government would need to prove Griffin\u2019s guilt \u201cby the very, very heavy burden of proof\u2019 required in criminal cases. <em>Id. </em>The District Court then asked the jurors whether they had difficulties with the \u201cconstraints that are essential\u201d to \u201cdue process both to the government and Mr. Griffin\u201d \u2014 namely, whether the jurors had difficulty \u201cavoiding] any kind of taint of transference of blame from one situation to another.\u201d S.A. 76-77. We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the request to dismiss the jury panel after delivering this detailed instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">We likewise hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Griffin\u2019s motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33. Griffin presented a justification defense at trial, and he argues before this Court that \u201cfair consideration of the evidence presented\u201d at trial demonstrates that Griffin\u2019s possession of the rifle was justified, and that \u201cthe jury\u2019s verdict of guilty [was] an egregious miscarriage of justice.\u201d Griffin Br. 20. To establish a justification defense, the defendant must show the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">(1) he was under unlawful and present threat of death or serious bodily injury; (2) he did not recklessly place himself in a situation where he would be forced to engage in criminal conduct; (3) he had no reasonable legal alternative (to both the criminal act and the avoidance of the threatened harm); and (4) there is a direct causal relationship between the criminal action and the avoidance of the threatened harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-10\"><em>United States v. Alston, </em>526 F.3d 91, 95 (3d Cir.2008) (footnote omitted). Although Griffin testified as to these elements of his defense at trial, and the District Court properly instructed the jury as to the four elements, S.A. 399, the jury found Griffin guilty. As the District Court explained, even though \u201cDefendant\u2019s testimony was not outlandish, nor was the officers\u2019 testimony so ironclad that it could not but be believed,\u201d \u201cjurors could have, reasonably, chosen not to credit defendant\u2019s testimony.\u201d Attachments to Griffin\u2019s Br. 5. We agree, and hold that the District Court correctly denied Griffin\u2019s motion for a new trial on the grounds that the jury should have accepted his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">We further hold that the District Court did not err in classifying Griffin as a career offender under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). That subsection requires a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>sentence of a minimum of fifteen years of imprisonment for individuals found to have violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) who have \u201cthree previous convictions ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both.\u201d Griffin argues that his robbery convictions pursuant to arrests on June 20, 1989 and July 12, 1989 should be counted as a single conviction for the purposes of \u00a7 924(e)(1), sinee a single sentence of imprisonment \u2014 representing the conduct charged on both arrests \u2014 was imposed on September 27, 1990. However, pursuant to the June 20, 1989 arrest, Griffin was charged with committing four robberies. In <em>United States v. Schoolcraft, </em>we adopted the \u201cseparate episode test\u201d to determine whether the AGCA\u2019s sentence-enhancing provision applies to \u201ccases where the defendant received multiple convictions in a single judicial proceeding.\u201d 879 F.2d 64, 73 (3d Cir.1989). We held that the separate episode test requires \u201csimply ... that the criminal episodes be distinct in time\u201d; \u201cseparate\u201d does not require that convictions be entered at different proceedings. <em>Id. </em>We therefore hold that Griffin had the requisite number of convictions for proper application of \u00a7 924(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Griffin\u2019s additional argument, that the robbery convictions are \u201cconstitutionally defective and, thereby, outside of 924(e),\u201d Griffin Br. 27, because counsel who represented him for the robbery convictions was ineffective, is also unavailing given that the Supreme Court has held that \u201ca defendant in a federal sentencing proceeding ... has no ... right ... to collaterally attack prior convictions.\u201d <em>Custis v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 485, 487, 114 S.Ct. 1732, 128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994). Finally, because this Court has held that, notwithstanding the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the holding of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), remains good law, \u201cprior convictions that increase the statutory maximum for an offense are not elements of the offense and thus may be determined by the District Court by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Coleman, </em>451 F.3d 154, 159 (3d Cir.2006). Therefore, we hold that the District Court properly applied \u00a7 924(e)(1) to Griffin\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">We do not consider Griffin\u2019s argument that the District Court erred in rejecting his request for a sentence reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.11. In the instant case, the District Court did hear Griffin\u2019s request for a reduction under the lesser-harms provision, and declined to reduce Griffin\u2019s sentence. S.A. 509-11. We lack jurisdiction to consider claims that \u201cattack[] the district court\u2019s exercise of discretion in refusing to reduce the sentences below the sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>Denardi, </em>892 F.2d at 272. Because the District Court properly exercised its discretion when it declined to grant Griffin\u2019s requested reduction, we do not have jurisdiction to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Griffin further argues that the District Court erred in denying his motion to compel the Government to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion in light of Griffin\u2019s efforts to cooperate with the Government. Citing the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992), this Court has explained that a \u201cprosecutor\u2019s discretion to file [a \u00a7 5K1.1] motion [is] almost unfettered: the government\u2019s refusal [can] only be challenged if it was based on an unconstitutional motive, like race or religion.\u201d <em>United States v. Isaac, </em>141 F.3d 477, 481 (3d Cir.1998) (quotation marks omitted). Thus \u201c[i]t follows that a claim that a defendant merely provided substantial assistance will not entitle a defendant to a remedy or even to discovery or an evidentiary hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Griffin has made no showing that the Government\u2019s refusal to make a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>stemmed from an unconstitutional motive. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in refusing to compel the Government to file such a motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Griffin argues, finally, that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. He contends that because the conduct underlying the instant conviction \u201cwas a victimless non-violent offense,\u201d since Griffin \u201csurrendered and cooperated with authorities, ... had not committed a violent offense since 1989,\u201d and had cooperated with the Government for several years, a sentence of 262 months of imprisonment was greater than necessary to achieve the relevant factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Griffin Br. 45. Because we do not believe that \u201cno reasonable sentencing court would have imposed the same sentence on that particular defendant for the reasons the district court provided,\u201d we hold that Griffin\u2019s sentence was not substantively unreasonable. <em>Tomko, </em>562 F.3d at 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s orders and the judgments of conviction and sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
