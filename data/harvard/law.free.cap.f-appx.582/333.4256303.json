Quarterman, </em>507 F.3d 884, 888 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-22\">Ubani did not seek a COA in the district court, nor did the district court deny a COA in its order denying his Rule 60(b) motion. Due to the absence of a COA ruling by the district court, we assume without deciding that we lack jurisdiction over the instant appeal from that order. <em>See </em>Rule 11(a), Rules Governing \u00a7 2255 Proceedings; <em>Cardenas v. Thaler, </em>651 F.3d 442, 443-44 &amp; n. 2 (5th Cir.2011). We decline to remand this case to the district court for a COA ruling because such a remand would be futile and a waste of judicial resources. <em>See United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-23\">Because Ubani\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion involved either new claims or requested reconsideration of claims first asserted in the \u00a7 2255 motion, the motion was successive. <em>See Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 532 &amp; n. 4, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005). Because the motion was unauthorized, the district court lacked jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir.2000). In the absence of such authorization, this court\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to correction of the error of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>lower court in entertaining the motion, which may be raised sua sponte. <em>See Crone v. Cockrell, </em>324 F.3d 833, 836 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">The appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction, and Ubani\u2019s motions for a COA and for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
