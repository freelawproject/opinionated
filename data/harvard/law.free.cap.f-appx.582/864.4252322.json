Because the Board erred in construing the relevant claim limitation, we <em>vacate </em>and <em>remand.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-16\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b893-17\">Facebook requested, and the Patent Office initiated, <em>inter partes </em>reexaminations of the '470 and '921 patents. The patents share the same parent, nearly identical specifications, and similar claims (the '470 patent recites method claims and the '921 patent recites system claims). The patents are directed to facilitating real-time communications between users over computer networks. <em>E.g., </em>'470 patent, Abstract. All of the independent claims are directed to providing a first user with a list of identifiers of other users, allowing the first user to select an identifier of a second user from the list, and establishing communications between the two users using the addressing information of the second user\u2019s communication device. <em>Id. </em>claims 1, 16, 29, 43; 921 patent claims 1, 13, 25. Relevant to this appeal, each claim requires maintaining associations between users and the addressing information of the devices used by those users. For example, claim 1 of the '470 patent, which is representative, recites:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-18\">A method comprising:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWN\">maintaining a first association between a first user and corresponding addressing information of a first communication device used by the first user to log in; maintaining a second association between a second user and corresponding addressing information of a second communication device used by the second user to log in....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b893-19\">This appeal centers on the construction of the phrase \u201caddressing information of [the] device\u201d that is common to the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>\u201cmaintaining\u201d limitations reproduced above.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Facebook\u2019s requests for <em>inter partes </em>reexamination proposed various anticipation and obviousness rejections of the claims, each relying on at least one of three prior art references \u2014 Bowen, Bowen II, and Liehty \u2014 as the primary reference.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bowen and Bowen II are CompuServe user guides and Liehty is an America Online user guide. The examiner determined that all claims were patentable because Bowen, Bowen II, and Liehty do not disclose the \u201cmaintaining a first association\u201d limitation. In particular, the examiner determined that the references do not disclose the claimed \u201caddressing information of a first communication device\u201d that is a part of the first association.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">The Board affirmed the examiner\u2019s confirmation of all claims. <em>Facebook, Inc. v. Pragmatus AV, LLC, </em>No. 2012-010460, 2013 WL 5402217 (Patent Tr. &amp; App. Bd. Jan. 11, 2013) <em>(\u2019470 patent); Facebook, Inc. v. Pragmatus AV, LLC, </em>No. 2012-010461, 2013 WL 5402218 (Patent Tr. &amp; App. Bd. Jan. 11, 2013) <em>(\u2019921 patent).</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Board construed the phrase \u201caddressing information of [the] device\u201d as \u201cthe physical location of a communication device.... \u201d Bd. Op. at *5. Based on this construction, it found that none of the three references disclosed the \u201cmaintaining a first association\u201d limitation because it determined that the alleged \u201caddressing information\u201d in each of the cited references was not a \u201cphysical location\u201d of the first communication device. Bd. Op. at *6-11. Facebook appeals. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">I. Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">When the Board reexamines an unexpired patent, it construes the claims under the broadest reasonable interpretation consistent with the specification. <em>In re ICON Health and Fitness, Inc., </em>496 F.3d 1374, 1379 (Fed.Cir.2007). When the Board reexamines an expired patent, it construes the claims in accordance with the claim construction standard set forth in <em>Phillips v. AWH Corp., </em>415 F.3d 1303 (Fed.Cir.2005). <em>In re Rambus, Inc., </em>753 F.3d 1253, 1256 (Fed.Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">These reexamination appeals come to us in an interesting procedural posture. The '470 and '921 patents had not expired at the time of the Board\u2019s decisions, but are both expired now. Because the patents were then unexpired, the Board construed the claims in accordance with the broadest reasonable interpretation standard. Bd. Op. at *5. We review the Board\u2019s claim construction de novo. <em>Rambus Inc. v. Rea, </em>731 F.3d 1248, 1252 (Fed.Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-12\">We hold that the Board erred by unduly limiting the broadest reasonable interpretation of \u201caddressing information of [the] device\u201d to the \u201cphysical location\u201d of the device. As an initial matter, it is not clear what the Board meant by a \u201cphysical location.\u201d It is not clear whether this requirement in the Board\u2019s construction refers to a geographical location, a location on the network, or some other location. We hold, however, that \u201cphysical location\u201d unduly narrows the claim term \u201caddressing information of [the] device,\u201d because nothing in the plain language of the claims or in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>specification or prosecution history requires such a limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">We start with the language of the claims themselves. <em>Phillips, </em>415 F.3d at 1314. The plain meaning of \u201caddressing information of [the] device\u201d is \u201cinformation specific to the device that enables communication with the device.\u201d The parties generally agree that the plain meaning of the first half of the limitation at issue\u2014 \u201caddressing information\u201d \u2014 is information that enables communication with the device. Pragmatus argued to the Board that \u201caddressing information can be expressed in many forms. And really need only allow the system to direct information to the destination computer. That is what the phrase, addressing information means.\u201d J.A. 6905. Similarly, Facebook argues on appeal that \u201c \u2018addressing information\u2019 as used in the claims simply means information that the system uses to send data to the communications device used to log in.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 14-15. Moreover, the claims require that the \u201caddressing information\u201d enables communication with the device because each independent claim recites \u201cusing the addressing information of the second communication device to allow communication between the first and second users.\u201d <em>E.g., </em>'470 patent claim 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">The remaining portion the claim term, \u201cof [the] device,\u201d does not require the claimed \u201caddressing information\u201d to be a physical location. The plain meaning of \u201cof [the] device\u201d is that the \u201caddressing information\u201d is specific to the device. Nothing about the phrase imparts a physical location requirement. The use of the phrase \u201cof [the] device\u201d in the claims makes this clear. For example, claim 1 of the '470 patent recites:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-9\">maintaining a first association between a first user and corresponding addressing information of a first communication device used by the first user to log in; maintaining a second association between a second user and corresponding addressing information of a second communication device used by the second user to log in....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-10\"><em>Id. </em>Viewing these two limitations together, \u201cof the first communication device\u201d and \u201cof the second communication device\u201d differentiate the two pieces of \u201caddressing information.\u201d In particular, the \u201caddressing information\u201d in the first limitation is specific to the first communication device used by the first user to log in, whereas the \u201caddressing information\u201d in the second limitation is specific to the second communication device used by the second user to log in. Thus, the plain meaning of \u201caddressing information of [the] device\u201d is \u201cinformation specific to the device that enables communication with the device.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Al7\">Neither the phrase \u201cof [the] device\u201d nor the corresponding construction of \u201cinformation specific to the device\u201d requires that the addressing information be permanently associated with the device. For example, certain addressing information, such as a dynamic IP address,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> may be temporarily assigned to a particular device when the device connects to a network. If the device disconnects and then later reconnects to the network, a second dynamic IP address is assigned to the device which may be different than the first dynamic IP address. Oral Argument at 27:45-28:22, <em>available at </em>http://oralarguments.cafc. uscourts.gov/default.aspx?fl=20 13-1350.-mp3. These dynamic IP addresses are still \u201cspecific to the device\u201d while the device is logged in to the network. The specifications of the patents at issue expressly con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>template using mobile devices, which could access a network at different entry points and thus be assigned different IP addresses, '470 patent col. 15 11. 10-14, col. 18 11. 22-37, and explain that certain embodiments use \u201cTCP/IP network protocols,\u201d <em>id. </em>col. 20 11. 17-20. This is also supported by the claims themselves, which recite \u201cusing the addressing information ... to allow communication between the first and second users\u201d \u201cif the second user is logged in.\u201d <em>E.g., id. </em>claim 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">The remaining claim language does not limit the \u201caddressing information of [the] device\u201d beyond its plain meaning. The claims require that the \u201cassociations\u201d between the first and second users and the corresponding addressing information must be \u201cdynamically changeable ... so that the first and second users, if logged in, can be found no matter where they are located.\u201d <em>E.g., id. </em>However, requiring the associations to be dynamic so that users can be found \u201cno matter where they are located\u201d does not require that the addressing information included in that association is, itself, a physical location.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Of course, under <em>Phillips, </em>the claim terms must be construed in light of the specification and the prosecution history, and not in isolation. 415 F.3d at 1313. We only depart from the plain meaning where the patentee has acted as his own lexicographer by clearly setting forth a definition of the disputed claim term or where he has disavowed the full scope of the claim term using clear and unmistakable statements of disclaimer. <em>GE Lighting Solutions, LLC v. AgiLight, Inc., </em>750 F.3d 1304, 1309 (Fed.Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Nothing in the specifications or prosecution histories of the patents at issue rises to the \u201cexacting\u201d level of lexicography or disavowal. <em>See id. </em>Nowhere does the patentee define the term \u201caddressing information\u201d (let alone the more complete \u201caddressing information of [the] device\u201d) or otherwise disclaim its full scope. To the contrary, the specifications support the plain-meaning construction. For example, the Abstract and Summary of the Invention of both patents describe retrieving addressing information of a second user so that a connection between a first and second user on their respective communication devices can be established. <em>E.g., </em>'470 patent, Abstract, col. 6, 11. 1-13. They do not limit the recited addressing information to a physical location or impose any other requirement beyond the plain meaning of the phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">In fact, except for the claims, the patent specifications do not mention the phrase, \u201caddressing information of [the] device.\u201d They describe \u201caddressing information of a ... <em>user\u201d </em>such as an e-mail address. <em>E.g., id. </em>col. 6 11. 8-9, col. 19 11. 54-59, col. 22 11. 2-8. As demonstrated by the exemplar email address, the disclosed addressing information \u201cof a user\u201d is not the physical location of that user, or of that user\u2019s device.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">The patent specifications do describe \u201clocation information\u201d of a device that is stored as part of a \u201cservice record.\u201d <em>E.g., id. </em>col. 19 11. 59-65, col. 21 11. 7-17, col. 22 11. 9-16. These portions of the specifications, however, do not support limiting \u201caddressing information of [the] device\u201d to a \u201cphysical location.\u201d They do not describe the disclosed \u201clocation information\u201d as \u201caddressing information.\u201d Thus, even if the specification somehow limited the disclosed \u201clocation information\u201d to a \u201cphysical location,\u201d there is nothing in the specification that requires the claimed \u201caddressing information\u201d to be of identical scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">We thus conclude that the correct construction of \u201caddressing information of [the] device\u201d is \u201cinformation specific to the device that enables communication with the device.\u201d We reach this conclusion af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>ter applying the <em>Phillips </em>claim construction framework, as the patents are now expired. We note that the Board\u2019s construction \u2014 limited to the physical location of the device \u2014 is narrower than ours. The broadest reasonable interpretation of a claim term may be the same as or broader than the construction of a term under the <em>Phillips </em>standard. But it cannot be narrower. Thus, the Board\u2019s construction cannot be the broadest reasonable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">II. Validity</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Because the Board analyzed the claims and the prior art under an erroneous construction, we vacate the Board\u2019s decision and remand for the Patent Office to assess the validity of these claims under the correct construction. The record does not include the factual findings necessary for us to assess validity in the first instance. For example, the Board\u2019s analyses of Bowen, Bowen II, and Lichty focus primarily on whether those references disclose maintaining associations of \u201caddressing information\u201d under the Board\u2019s construction requiring a physical location. Similarly, the examiner did not perform an element-by-element analysis of what each reference disclosed because the examiner determined in the first office action that the claims were patentable based on the \u201cmaintaining a first association\u201d limitations, making it unnecessary to determine whether the references disclosed the remaining limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">We do not agree with Facebook that we ought to infer the presence of the remaining limitations in the references based on the examiner\u2019s findings in the Orders granting the requests for <em>inter partes </em>reexamination. In those Orders, the examiner was determining whether there was a substantial new question of patentability with regard to the claims at issue; the examiner was not determining whether the references disclosed or suggested each claimed limitation. See, <em>e.g., </em>J.A. 6623-24, 6634. The examiner made certain limited findings in the Order about what Bowen disclosed. J.A. 6623. However, these findings were made to support the examiner\u2019s ultimate conclusion that Bowen was \u201cimportant in deciding the patentability\u201d of the claims at issue; they were not a part of an element-by-element invalidity analysis. <em>Id. </em>Thus, to the extent the examiner on remand determines that one or more of the prior art references disclose the \u201cmaintaining a first association\u201d limitation (we take no position on this point), the examiner will also have to address, in the first instance, whether the prior art discloses the remaining limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">Because the Board erred in construing \u201caddressing information of [the] device,\u201d as recited in each independent claim, we <em>vacate </em>and <em>remand.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">VACATED AND REMANDED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b894-6\">.
