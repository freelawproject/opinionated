Castro argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because he was entitled to a downward variance to avoid an unwarranted disparity between his sentence and those of his codefendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-20\">Castro did not object to the sentence after the district court imposed it, so we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir. 2007). Under plain error review, Castro has the burden of demonstrating a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error, but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-21\">Castro\u2019s claim that the presumption of reasonableness accorded within-guidelines sentences should not apply in his case because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b) lacks an empirical basis is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir. 2009). As for his contention that his guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable, Castro has not established that an unwarranted disparity in the sentences exists, <em>see United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 766-67 (5th Cir.2008), or that the district court failed to consider his personal characteristics. His disagreement with the district court\u2019s balancing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors is insufficient to establish error on the part of the district court. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, he has not shown that his sentence is substantively unreasonable and has not established that the district court committed plain error. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), <em>Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b454-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
