He asserts that he is disabled due to a memory impairment and is entitled to an alteration to the multiple choice exam used as part of the ABP\u2019s certification process. Because Rawdin has not shown he is entitled to the relief he seeks, we will affirm the judgment in favor of ABP.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">While attending college, Rawdin was diagnosed with Posterior Fossa Ependymoma, a type of brain tumor. After brain surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, Rawdin completed college and graduated from medical school. He, however, twice failed Step III of the United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE), which used a multiple choice format.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">After failing the second time, Rawdin felt something was amiss and saw a neuropsyehologist, who concluded that Rawdin had a cognitive impairment, likely due to the treatment he received for his brain tumor, that impacted his memory retrieval system, and that this impairment likely gave him trouble on the multiple choice exam.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-17\">Not long after the neurological evaluation, Rawdin\u2019s tumor recurred and he had to undergo further surgical treatment. After surgery, Rawdin experienced multiple complications, requiring him to leave the medical profession for four years. Upon his return, and based on the neuropsychologist\u2019s diagnosis, Rawdin requested accommodations when taking Step III for the third time. His request was granted and he was provided the following accommodations: (1) double time to take the exam, (2) an individual testing room, and (3) \u201coff the clock\u201d breaks. With these accommodations, Rawdin passed Step III on his third attempt and received his Pennsylvania medical license in 2000. He thereafter completed a pediatric residency and began practicing at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). Rawdin flourished at CHOP, successfully treating over 10,000 babies.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-18\">CHOP required its physicians to obtain \u201cboard certification\u201d within five years of joining the hospital. JA 7. ABP is the only organization that certifies pediatricians. To receive certification from ABP, a physician must, among other things: (1) complete three years of pediatric training; (2) pass a peer and patient review; and (3) pass a multiple choice exam known as the General Pediatrics Certifying Examination (the Exam).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-19\">The Exam consists of four sections and 335 multiple choice questions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>question is \u201ccue- or story-based and contextual, providing the test-taker with a scenario and asking for the most likely diagnosis, treatment, or next step.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> JA 8, 372-73, 753. The examinee must select the correct answer from five choices. The multiple choice format facilitates the testing of a breadth of knowledge in only seven hours, does not rely on the subjective judgments of graders, and is more reliable<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> than other exam forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Rawdin sat for the Exam five times and failed each time. After he failed the second time, his neuropsychologist reevaluated him using intelligence, academic achievement, neuropsychological, personality, and behavior tests. His scores showed that his memory was weak as compared to his overall intelligence, but was within the normal range. The neuropsychologist found that Rawdin\u2019s memory was not \u201cefficient\u201d and that he struggled when asked to retrieve information out of context. JA 10, 215.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">A second neuropsychologist, Dr. Edward Moss, who has assisted other doctors struggling with their training, reviewed the neurological test results. He similarly described Rawdin\u2019s specific impairment as difficulty pulling \u201ctogether on command discrete] bits of unrelated information,\u201d which he opined was the kind of task an examinee faces on a multiple choice exam. JA 494, 581. Moss acknowledged, however, that he was not familiar with the Exam and was not trained as a psychometrician. Moss nonetheless opined that if Rawdin were tested in another format, he might \u201cperform at a higher level.\u201d JA 497. Moss agreed that while Rawdin\u2019s memory was weak as compared to his overall intelligence, it fell within the average range.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">By the time Rawdin reached the five-year deadline to receive his certification, he still had not passed the Exam and faced termination at CHOP. Due to Rawdin\u2019s excellent performance and a letter from Moss explaining Rawdin\u2019s impairment, however, CHOP gave Rawdin an extra year to obtain his certification. Rawdin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>again took the Exam but failed, and was terminated in January 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">In 2010, Rawdin wrote to ABP, explaining his impairment and requesting an alternative means of certification. In response, ABP informed Rawdin that it could not waive the Exam, offer an alternative format, or certify a doctor who had not passed the Exam, as this would \u201cfundamentally alter the nature of the certification process,\u201d JA 12, 148, but suggested that he request accommodations under the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">In April 2011, Rawdin applied to take the Exam again. For the first time, his neuropsychologist informed ABP of Raw-din\u2019s diagnosis and requested the following accommodations: (1) extended time; (2) a quiet setting; (3) advance knowledge of the subjects covered on each part of the Exam; (4) access to reference materials (i.e., making the Exam \u201copen-book\u201d); (5) short breaks; and (6) an essay format. ABP granted Rawdin\u2019s request for additional time, a quiet setting, and short breaks, but denied his request for \u201cadvance knowledge\u201d of the topics and \u201copen-book\u201d accommodations because \u201cthese accommodations would not allow ABP to adequately, reliably, and validly test Dr. Rawdin\u2019s knowledge.\u201d JA 13, 422-25. ABP also determined that an essay exam would take an unreasonably long time to construct (over two years), would be prohibitively expensive, and would not meet its reliability and validity standards. Raw-din failed the 2011 Exam.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">In December 2012, Rawdin filed suit against ABP, and subsequently filed a motion for a preliminary injunction directing ABP to grant him immediate board certification without having to pass the Exam, or, in the alternative, to provide him with an open-book format, essay format, or evaluation in a clinical setting. With the parties consent, the District Court consolidated the preliminary injunction hearing with a bench trial on the merits, and found that Rawdin was not entitled to relief because: (1) Rawdin was not disabled; and (2) Rawdin was not entitled to the requested accommodations because they (a) were unreasonable and (b) would fundamentally alter the Exam or impose an undue burden on ABP. Rawdin appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">II<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">Congress enacted the ADA to eliminate discrimination against individuals with disabilities. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(b)(1). Title III of the ADA specifically prohibits public accommodations, including testing entities, from engaging in disability discrimination. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12181-12189. Title III contains a section governing testing entities, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-11\">Any person that offers examinations or courses related to applications, licensing, certification, or credentialing for secondary or post-secondary education, professional, or trade purposes shall offer such examinations or courses in a place and manner accessible to persons with disabilities or offer alternative accessible arrangements for such individuals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12189. The purpose of this section is \u201cto assure that persons with disabilities are not foreclosed from educational, professional or trade opportunities because an examination or course is conducted in an inaccessible site or without an accommodation.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 101\u2014 485(III), at 68-69 (1990), <em>reprinted in </em>1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 445, 491-92. Section 12189 applies to ABP because it is an entity that \u201coffers examinations or courses related to ... certification, or credentialing for ... professional ... purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">The Attorney General is charged with issuing regulations for all non-transportation provisions of Title III, including issuing accessibility standards that testing entities must follow.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under this authority, the Attorney General issued a regulation implementing \u00a7 12189, which defines the obligation of testing entities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">Any private entity offering an examination covered by this section must assure that ... [t]he examination is selected and administered so as to <em>best ensure </em>that, when the examination is administered to an individual with a disability that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the examination results accurately reflect the individual\u2019s aptitude or achievement level or whatever other factor the examination purports to measure, rather than reflecting the individual\u2019s impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">28 C.F.R. \u00a7 36.309(b)(l)(i) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">We will assume without deciding that Rawdin is disabled under the ADA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We therefore next address whether his disability entitles him to protection under \u00a7 36.309(b)(l)(i).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Even if Rawdin\u2019s impairment fell within the categories of disabilities that the regulation covers, ABP has shown that the Exam \u201cbest ensures\u201d that its results will accurately reflect Rawdin\u2019s aptitude rather than his disability. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 36.309(b)(l)(i). According to his experts, Rawdin\u2019s disability impairs his ability to recall information out of context. It follows, then, that ABP is required to \u201cbest ensure\u201d that the Exam reflects Raw-din\u2019s aptitude and not his difficulty recalling information out of context. ABP provided example questions and testimony that show that it satisfies this standard since the Exam does not require an examinee to recall information out of context. JA 753 (testimony that the Exam does not require an examinee \u201cto dredge up the answer from nowhere and write it down\u201d and that the questions provide \u201ccontext\u201d); JA 373 (testimony that the questions are \u201ccontextual\u201d and present the examinee with a \u201cscenario\u201d); JA 420 (testimony that the questions are \u201cconstructed in a way that an individual is presented with a clinical vignette\u201d). Rawdin failed to present any evidence refuting ABP\u2019s characterization of the exam questions as contextual and cue- and story-based. Indeed, his only expert, Dr. Moss, admitted that he knew nothing about the Exam\u2019s questions, layout, or format, and that he is not a psychometrician and has never developed an exam. Given Moss\u2019s lack of familiarity with the Exam and testing generally, it was not clearly erroneous for the District Court to discount his testimony and credit the testimony of witnesses who were familiar with the Exam and testing generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Like the District Court, we acknowledge Rawdin\u2019s impressive clinical talents but conclude that the record and law do not provide a basis for relief. Thus, we will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-13\">. ABP develops the Exam through a series of phases that involves identifying the thirty-five subjects to be tested, allotting the percent of the Exam devoted to each subject, and having subject-matter experts write questions. The questions are then edited and reviewed at two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>consecutive annual meetings. An expert for ABP testified that the development cost for the 2011-2012 exam was $3,500 per question and that, on average, it takes two years from the time a question is first submitted until it appears on the exam.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b144-6\">.
