We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Rowe v. Educ. Credit Mgmt. Corp., </em>559 F.3d 1028, 1029 (9th Cir.2009). We may affirm on any basis supported by the record, <em>Corrie v. Caterpillar, Inc., </em>503 F.3d 974, 979 (9th Cir. 2007), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">The district court properly dismissed Makreas\u2019s FCRA claim because Makreas failed to allege facts sufficient to show that defendants accessed his credit report without a permissible purpose, or that there was a bona fide dispute regarding the debt. <em>See Pintos v. Pac. Creditors Ass\u2019n, </em>605 F.3d 665, 674-76 (9th Cir.2010) (discussing the two requirements for establishing permissible purpose under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 168lb(a)(3)(A)); <em>Gorman v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, LLP, </em>584 F.3d 1147, 1163 (9th Cir.2009) (under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s-2(b), a furnisher can only be liable by failing to report a bona fide dispute\u2014 that is, \u201ca dispute that could materially alter how the reported debt is understood\u201d). Moreover, to the extent that the claim is based on violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s-2(a), there is no private right of action. <em>See Gorman, </em>584 F.3d at 1154, 1162.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">The district court properly dismissed Makreas\u2019s claim under California\u2019s Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act against defendant Citibank because Makreas failed to alleged facts sufficient to show that Citibank itself engaged in debt collection activities, or that the Moore Law Group acted as Citibank\u2019s agent when it engaged in debt collection activities, thereby making Citibank vicariously liable for its acts. <em>See </em>Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7\u00a7 1788.1(b), 1788.2(c) (explaining that purpose of Act is \u201cto prohibit debt collectors from engaging in unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the collection of consumer debts\u201d and defining \u201cdebt collector\u201d); <em>Fenton v. Freedman, </em>748 F.2d 1358, 1361-62 (9th Cir.1984) (listing requirements for establishing agency under California law); <em>see also Clark v. Capital Credit &amp; Collection Servs., Inc., </em>460 F.3d 1162, 1173 (9th Cir.2006) (addressing vicarious liability under federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">The district court properly dismissed Makreas\u2019s unfair competition claim because Makreas failed to allege facts sufficient to show that he sought injunctive relief, or that defendants obtained money or property from him as a result of their alleged misconduct, warranting restitution. <em>See Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>29 Cal.4th 1134, 131 Cal.Rptr.2d 29, 63 P.3d 937, 943-45 (2003) (explaining that under California\u2019s Unfair Competition Law, Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7 17200, relief is generally limited to injunctive relief and restitution, and defining restitution); <em>see also Los Angeles v. Lyons, </em>461 U.S. 95, 111, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983) (injunctive relief is \u201cunavailable absent a showing of irreparable injury, a requirement that cannot be met where there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>showing of any real or immediate threat that the plaintiff will be wronged again\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying leave to amend. <em>See Cervantes v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., </em>656 F.3d 1034, 1041 (9th Cir.2011) (setting forth standard of review and explaining that leave to amend may be denied if amendment would be futile); <em>Chodos v. W. Publ\u2019g Co., </em>292 F.3d 992, 1003 (9th Cir.2002) (setting forth the standard of review and requirements for leave to amend, and noting that a district court\u2019s discretion is particularly broad where it has already granted leave to amend).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to enter default judgment against the Moore Law Group. <em>See Direct Mail Specialists, Inc. v. Eclat Computerized Techs., Inc., </em>840 F.2d 685, 689 (9th Cir.1988) (Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(b)(1) applies only to parties who have never appeared in the action); <em>Eitel v. McCool, </em>782 F.2d 1470, 1471 (9th Cir.1986) (setting forth the standard of review and discussing the process for obtaining default judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">We reject Makreas\u2019s contentions that the district court erred by allegedly disregarding defendants\u2019 \u201ccontinued willful and negligent violations of the FCRA,\u201d and that the district court should have permitted discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">We do not consider issues not specifically and distinctly raised in the opening brief. <em>See Padgett v. Wright, </em>587 F.3d 983, 985 n. 2 (9th Cir.2009) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b722-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
