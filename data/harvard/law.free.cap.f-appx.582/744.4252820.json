Given an opportunity to account for the monies spent and to submit amended budgets, Pena missed court deadlines and failed to consult with his creditors to resolve the problem. As a result, the bankruptcy court converted his ease to one under Chapter 7, finding that Pena had given it cause under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112(b), and appointed interim Chapter 7 Trustee Trudi Manfredo. The bankruptcy court also denied Pena\u2019s subsequent motion for reconsideration, and the district court affirmed the conversion order. On appeal, Pena argues that (1) there was no cause to convert his case, either because he did not use cash collateral or because any such use was not substantially harmful to any creditor; (2) unusual circumstances existed preventing the bankruptcy court from converting the case; and (8) the bankruptcy court failed to follow the public policy favoring reorganization over liquidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Pena admitted at oral argument that the $16,000 he spent constituted cash collateral. In light of this acknowledged unauthorized use of cash collateral, as well as Pena\u2019s failure timely to produce appropriate budgets, we cannot find clearly erroneous the bankruptcy court\u2019s determination that at least one creditor was substantially harmed. <em>Marshall v. Marshall (In re Marshall), </em>721 F.3d 1032, 1039 (9th Cir. 2013); 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112(b)(4)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">We also decline Pena\u2019s invitation to rule that an attorney\u2019s ineffective legal advice constitutes the kind of \u201cunusual circumstance\u201d forbidding a bankruptcy court from converting a case under Chapter 11 to one under Chapter 7. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">Finally, we reject Pena\u2019s argument that, in converting his case, the bankruptcy court flouted the public policy favoring reorganization over liquidation. Instead, the bankruptcy court simply followed Congress\u2019s explicit instruction to convert a Chapter 11 case for cause where the unauthorized use of cash collateral substantially harms one or more creditors. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112(b)(4)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-11\">For all of these reasons, we cannot conclude that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion by converting Pena\u2019s Chapter 11 case to one under Chapter 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b773-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
