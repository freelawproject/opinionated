For the following reasons, we AFFIRM both Schaffer\u2019s and Gamez\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-22\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b497-23\">This case centers around an undercover investigation of a conspiracy to illegally distribute drugs in Plano, Texas. Without reciting the entire course of the undercover investigation, it is important to detail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>how Schaffer and Gamez were implicated in the conspiracy at issue here. In the months before April 2010, Christopher Frosch, a detective with the Rowlett Police Department, was working on an investigation into the distribution of ecstasy in Plano. On May 5, 2010, Frosch, who was acting in an undercover capacity, first met James Wood, who was identified as someone willing to engage in a drug transaction. Wood indicated to Frosch that his drug supplier was Hai Van Schaffer. Subsequently, it was decided that on June 2, 2010, Frosch would purchase cocaine from Wood. Frosch also spoke with Schaffer over the phone to plan the details of the transaction. Ultimately, the June 2, 2010 transaction did not take place; however, Frosch and Wood did meet.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">On the evening of June 2, 2010, Frosch and Schaffer discussed a second transaction over the phone. Schaffer explained how he and \u201c[his] people\u201d handle transactions, and how his \u201cguys\u201d prefer to count their money and \u201cstuff\u2019 (cocaine) to \u201cmake sure that everything\u2019s there and everything\u2019s in check.\u201d Frosch expressed hesitation about whether he wanted to conduct a second transaction: \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s gonna be a next time man.\u201d Schaffer stated that he had a location for transactions \u201cwhere we do it very privately, in a very private neighborhood,\u201d where \u201cwe\u2019ve been doing it for a couple years.\u201d He further explained that \u201ceverybody knows our routine.\u201d Schaffer explained to Frosch how the next transaction would take place. He also assured Frosch that \u201cthese guys are consistent with their stuff all the time,\u201d and that the cocaine was \u201clegit.\u201d Next, Schaffer reiterated that he should have \u201ctaken the reins in my hand like I normally do, and ... mad[e] [the previously attempted transaction] work right.\u201d Schaffer explained that he was not looking for \u201cthe short term gain,\u201d but rather \u201ca long term relationship.\u201d He also stated that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of money to be made for everybody.\u201d Schaffer and Frosch eventually agreed that Frosch would purchase 15 kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">On June 10, 2010, Wood and Daryl Preston, another co-conspirator, gave a bag filled with five kilograms of cocaine to Frosch. Wood and Preston were subsequently arrested. Upon being stopped by the police, Wood called Schaffer to let him know that the deal was a set-up. As this was happening, Matt Quillen, an officer with the Plano Police Department (\u201cPPD\u201d) who was involved in the investigation and surveillance of Wood and Schaffer, followed Schaffer\u2019s car from Schaffer\u2019s residence. Quillen contacted a marked patrol unit, which conducted a traffic stop of the vehicle. Schaffer was ultimately arrested near a McDonald\u2019s. Adolph Gamez was arrested around the same time as Schaffer, after he was observed bringing the cocaine to Schaffer\u2019s residence earlier in the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">On June 11, 2010, the United States Attorney filed a criminal complaint against Gamez, Schaffer, and four others. On July 7, 2010, all six defendants were indicted in a one-count indictment charging that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">from sometime in or about January 2009, and continuously thereafter up to and including May 12, 2010, in the Eastern District of Texas and elsewhere ... defendants[] did knowingly and intentionally combine, conspire, and agree with each other, and with other persons known and unknown to the United States Grand Jury, to knowingly and intentionally possess with the intent to distribute 5 kilograms or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine, a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(l)[, and] [i]n violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Schaffer and Gamez were tried together by jury in June 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">At the trial, the Government offered evidence that an off-duty police officer with the PPD, Sergeant Terry Holway, arrested Schaffer at a dance club on March 14, 2010 (\u201cMarch 14 arrest\u201d) on an outstanding warrant. After Schaffer was arrested, Holway\u2019s partner performed a search of Schaffer and found \u201ca small baggy of cocaine\u201d in his pocket, as well as three and a half pills that Holway believed \u201cwere hydrocodone and alprazolam, which is Xanax.\u201d Holway asked Schaffer if the baggy contained \u201ccocaine or methamphetamine,\u201d to which Schaffer responded, \u201c[y]eah.\u201d The substance tested positive for cocaine in a field test. Holway testified that, based on her experience and the packaging of the cocaine, she believed Schaffer \u201cwas going in to sell [the cocaine] or give it to somebody.\u201d When Holway asked Schaffer where he was taking it, he responded, \u201c[t]o a business partner.\u201d Holway testified that the amount of cocaine that Schaffer had on him, approximately 1.9 grams, was \u201ctoo much to do in one night,\u201d and that it was a \u201cdistributable amount.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The Government filed a pre-trial notice that it intended to offer evidence of Schaffer\u2019s March 14 arrest under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b). The Government alternatively argued that the evidence was intrinsic to the offense because it showed that Schaffer \u201chad the intent to distribute,\u201d and the incident \u201cfalls squarely within that time frame of when he\u2019s distributing cocaine,\u201d as outlined in the indictment. The district court conducted a <em>United States v. Beechum, </em>582 F.2d 898 (5th Cir. 1978) (en banc), analysis and described the evidence regarding the March 14 arrest as \u201c404(b) [e]vidence.\u201d The court did not formally rule that the evidence was admissible under Rule 404(b), but instead rested its admissibility determination on the conclusion that the evidence was intrinsic to the charged offense. Specifically, the district court found that the arrest was \u201cwithin the time frame of the indictment and involves cocaine and possessing it and it involves his admission that he was going to distribute it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">During the trial, Officer Quillen testified that he \u201cjust briefly\u201d had an opportunity to question Schaffer immediately following the June 10 arrest, and he \u201casked him where he was going to.\u201d Schaffer \u201ctold [Quillen] he was going to the McDonald\u2019s\u201d that was in the vicinity of the traffic stop. Quillen also asked Schaffer his name. Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) special agent Tahariiq Gray testified that he arrived at the traffic stop shortly after Quillen spoke with Schaffer. The following exchange took place at trial, during Gray\u2019s direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-9\">Q. Okay. And was Mr. [Schaffer] inside the vehicle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-10\">A. When I got there, he was not inside the vehicle, he was out of the vehicle. And when I got there, the Plano Police Department detectives advised that they had spoken to Mr. [Schaffer] and he wasn\u2019t being cooperative at the time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsS\">Schaffer did not make a contemporaneous objection to the testimony. The Government did not refer to Gray\u2019s statement in its closing argument. The record does not indicate when Schaffer received a <em>Miranda </em>warning, or whether he received the warning before speaking with the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">On the fourth day of the trial, outside the presence of the jury, the court conducted a hearing on evidence that the government intended to submit under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), including evidence that Schaffer \u201chad asked another inmate to contact ... Schaffer\u2019s parents, his father specifically, to try to bribe [the Assistant United States Attorney] to dismiss th[e] case.\u201d The Government had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>previously placed the inmate, Juan Rios, on its witness list, and had informed the court that Rios would testify to the conversation he had with Schaffer. The Government informed the court that it would not pursue the testimony about the attempted bribery during the guilt phase of the trial, but would present it at sentencing. The Government also indicated that it might cross-examine Schaffer\u2019s father (\u201cMr. Schaeffer\u201d) about the attempted bribery, if he took the stand. Schaffer\u2019s counsel did not object or respond in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">After the Government rested its case, Schaffer moved for a directed verdict on the basis that the activities for which he was arrested took place after May 2010 (the ending date of the conspiracy designated in the indictment). Gamez joined Schaffer\u2019s motion. Gamez argued that the language in the indictment was a \u201cfatal defect,\u201d and that it was \u201csubstantially prejudicial ... that all of the conduct that they\u2019ve alleged ... is outside of the date period in the indictment.\u201d The district court denied the defendants\u2019 motions for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">On the fifth and final day of the trial, Mr. Schaeffer testified for the defense. The defense asked Mr. Schaeffer whether Schaffer\u2019s criminal charge was \u201cin keeping with the child that [Mr. Schaeffer] raised,\u201d and Mr. Schaeffer responded \u201cNo.\u201d Mr. Schaeffer also responded negatively when asked whether there was anything \u201cfrom [his] knowledge and background of Hai [Schaffer], to prepare [Mr. Schaeffer] for this kind of charge.\u201d Lastly, Mr. Schaeffer responded affirmatively when asked whether Schaffer \u201cappealed] to be having ... a normal lifestyle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">On cross-examination, the Government asked Mr. Schaeffer several questions about his knowledge of specific examples of Schaffer\u2019s conduct, including Schaffer\u2019s March 2010 arrest and his admission to \u201cbeing in the drug-distribution business for at least two years.\u201d The Government also asked the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">Q. Mr. Schaeffer, were you aware that your son was trying to have another inmate contact you to pay Mr. Gonzalez 30 to 50 thousand dollars to make the case go away?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Schaffer\u2019s counsel objected to the question, and the court recessed the jury. Schaffer\u2019s counsel contended that the government was \u201cgetting into hearsay\u201d with its question. The court expressed concern about \u201cthrowing] out\u201d the bribery question for the jury with \u201cno definitive answer,\u201d given that the Government had already rested its case and had not called Rios to testify about the attempted bribery. The Government indicated that it would withdraw the question; the court stated that it would \u201cinstruct the jury to disregard the question, not consider it for any purpose.\u201d Accordingly, when the jury returned, the court stated: \u201cLadies and gentlemen, before we resume, I need to instruct you to disregard the last question. Do not consider it for any purpose.\u201d Schaffer did not object to the instruction or move for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">Once the evidence was submitted to the jury, the district court conducted a lengthy hearing regarding whether to give the jury an instruction regarding the entrapment defense. After giving both the Government and the defense an opportunity to address the question, the district court ruled that it would not instruct the jury on entrapment. Subsequently, the jury found both defendants guilty. The district court sentenced the defendants-appellants, and they timely appealed their convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">II. SCHAFFER\u2019S CHALLENGES</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">Schaffer argues that the district court erred at trial by declining to instruct the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>jury on his proposed entrapment defense; by admitting evidence of the March 14 arrest as intrinsic evidence; and by admitting testimony that he was \u201cuncooperative\u201d following his arrest. Schaffer further argues that the government committed prosecutorial misconduct during his trial; that he received ineffective assistance of counsel; and that the cumulative effect of the alleged errors at trial entitles him to a new trial. We address these claims in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">A. Entrapment Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s decision not to grant an entrapment instruction <em>de novo, </em>looking at the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>732 F.3d 504, 513 (5th Cir.2013). Although entrapment is a question for the jury and not the court, in order \u201cfor an entrapment instruction to be put to the jury, a defendant must make a prima facie showing of two elements: (1) lack of predisposition to commit the offense and (2) some governmental involvement and inducement more substantial than simply providing an opportunity or facilities to commit the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 514 (internal quotation marks omitted). Both elements assist the court in making the \u201ccritical determination\u201d of \u201cwhether criminal intent originated with the defendant or with the government agents.\u201d <em>United States v. Bradfield, </em>113 F.3d 515, 521 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">In order to determine \u201cwhether the defendant lacked predisposition, we consider whether he \u2018intended, was predisposed, or was willing to commit the offense <em>before first being approached by government agents.\u2019 \u201d Nelson, </em>732 F.3d at 514 (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>United States v. Theagene, </em>565 F.3d 911, 919 (5th Cir. 2009)). \u201c[A] defendant\u2019s eager willingness to participate in government-solicited criminal activity is sufficient to prove predisposition.\u201d <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>239 F.3d 722, 741 (5th Cir.2001). We have found that \u201c[a] defendant lacks predisposition where he had no prior interest or experience related to the crime, displayed \u2018significant hesitation or unwillingness, or attempt[ed] to return discussion to lawful conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nelson, </em>732 F.3d at 514 (quoting <em>Theagene, </em>565 F.3d at 920). It may be taken as evidence of predisposition that the defendant was an \u201cactive, enthusiastic participant] or demonstrated expertise in the criminal endeavor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 515 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">\u201cGovernment inducement consists of the creative activity of law enforcement officials in spurring an individual to crime.\u201d <em>Theagene, </em>565 F.3d at 922 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cEvidence that government agents merely afforded the defendant an opportunity ... for the commission of the crime is insufficient to warrant the entrapment instruction.\u201d <em>United States v. Bradfield, </em>113 F.3d 515, 522 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">Schaffer argues that the drug transaction with Frosch was at a standstill and that it was the Government\u2019s prodding that made it come to fruition. He further argues that he was a reluctant participant in the drug conspiracy and that, but for the Government\u2019s efforts, the conspiracy would not have begun. In support of these arguments, Schaffer highlights the testimony of his father who stated that the charges against Schaffer were not \u201cin keeping with the child that [I] raised.\u201d Although Schaffer acknowledges that the jury could have concluded that he was a willing participant, he argues that they jury should have been instructed on entrapment to allow it to evaluate the merits of the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">After a review of the record, with the evidence viewed in Schaffer\u2019s favor, he does not show that his entrapment defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>was \u201cplausible enough that the jury deserved a chance to evaluate it.\u201d <em>Theagene, </em>565 F.3d at 922. As to Schaffer\u2019s predisposition, he \u201cdemonstrated expertise in the criminal endeavor,\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>732 F.3d at 514, when he described to Frosch, in depth, how he usually conducted drug transactions, when he indicated that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of money to be made for everybody\u201d from such drug transactions, and when he described how the drugs would be packaged to deter detection. Schaffer did not express \u201csignificant hesitation or unwillingness\u201d when presented with the opportunity to make a second attempt to transact with the undercover officer. <em>Theagene, </em>565 F.3d at 920. In fact, he was an eager participant, which he demonstrated by encouraging the hesitant officer to make a second attempt at the drug transaction. Mr. Schaeffer\u2019s vague testimony concerning his impression of Schaffer\u2019s character cannot rebut the evidence that Schaffer was an \u201cactive, enthusiastic participant in the crime.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>732 F.3d at 515 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). As to inducement, Schaffer fails to assert how the June 10 transaction amounted to anything more \u201cthan simply providing an opportunity or facilities to commit the offense.\u201d <em>Theagene, </em>565 F.3d at 922. In short, the district court did not err when it declined to provide the jury with an entrapment defense instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">B. Admission of Other Act Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The court reviews a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion, subject to harmless-error analysis. See <em>United States v. Girod, </em>646 F.3d 304, 318 (5th Cir.2011). \u201cFor any of the evidentiary rulings to be reversible error, the admission of the evidence in question must have substantially prejudiced the defendant\u2019s rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The district court referred to the evidence relating to the March 14 arrest as both \u201c404(b) evidence\u201d and \u201cintrinsic\u201d evidence. Although the court performed a <em>Beechum </em>analysis, its ruling on admissibility rested on its conclusion that the evidence was intrinsic. We need not decide whether the district court was correct when it held the March 14 arrest evidence to be intrinsic, because that evidence was properly admitted pursuant to Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Rule 404(b) provides that \u201c[e]vidence of a crime, wrong, or other act is not admissible to prove a person\u2019s character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.\u201d However, \u201c[t]his evidence may be admissible for another purpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This court held in <em>United States v. Beechum, </em>582 F.2d 898 (5th Cir.1978), that Rule 404(b) requires a two-step analysis: \u201c[fjirst, it must be determined that the extrinsic offense evidence is relevant to an issue other than the defendant\u2019s character,\u201d and \u201c[sjecond, the evidence must possess probative value that is not substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice and must meet the other requirements of rule 403.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">\u201cWe have previously held that in a conspiracy case, the defendant puts his intent into issue when he pleads not guilty.\u201d <em>United States v. Heard, </em>709 F.3d 413, 430 (5th Cir.2013). Accordingly, Schaffer\u2019s possession of a \u201cdistributable amount\u201d of cocaine and other drugs on March 14 and the fact that he admitted that he was taking it \u201cto a business partner\u201d are clearly relevant to establishing Schaffer\u2019s intent to participate in the conspiracy at issue here. As for the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>prong of the <em>Beechum, </em>analysis, \u201cwe must take care not to infringe upon the broad discretion of the trial court regarding the relevance, probative value, and prejudicial effect of evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Bermea, </em>30 F.3d 1539, 1562 (5th Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Given that the evidence regarding the March 14 arrest was within the time frame alleged by the indictment and involved possession by Schaffer of a \u201cdistributable amount\u201d of cocaine, we conclude that the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by any undue prejudice. Therefore, the evidence was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">C. Evidence that Schaffer was \u201cuncooperative\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The Supreme Court has established that \u201cuse of [a] defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence\u201d to impeach a defendant is a violation of due process. <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 611, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976). \u201cOrdinarily, we review a constitutional question <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Potts, </em>644 F.3d 233, 236 (5th Cir.2011). However, where, as is the case here, an appellant \u201cdid not properly preserve his claim of error regarding the prosecutor\u2019s comments on his post-arrest silence in the district court, we review this claim only for plain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Salinas, </em>480 F.3d 750, 755 (5th Cir.2007). In order to establish plain error, \u201cthe defendant must show that (1) there is an error, (2) the error is clear or obvious, and (3) the error affects his substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 756 (internal quotation marks omitted). For the error to be considered plain, it must have been clear under existing law. <em>See id. </em>\u201cIf those three conditions are satisfied, this court may grant relief if \u2018the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Ibarra-Zelaya, </em>465 F.3d 596, 606 (5th Cir.2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">Schaffer argues that it was a violation of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent when DEA Agent Gray testified that the \u201cPlano Police Department Detective advised that they had spoken to Mr. Schaffer and he wasn\u2019t being cooperative.\u201d However, Gray\u2019s statement that Schaffer was not \u201cbeing cooperative\u201d was likely not a comment on Schaffer\u2019s supposed post-arrest silence,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but a spontaneous comment suggesting that Schaffer\u2019s explanation for where he was going when the police pulled him over \u2014 he stated he was en route to McDonald\u2019s \u2014 rang hollow under the circumstances. As such, it is likely that Gray\u2019s statement was not a comment on Schaffer\u2019s silence and did not implicate Schaffer\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights. <em>See Salinas, </em>480 F.3d at 756 (\u201c[T]he Supreme Court has established that due process prevents the prosecution from commenting at trial on a criminal defendant\u2019s silence.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">Given that the test for a <em>Doyle </em>violation is \u201cwhether the manifest intent of the remarks was to comment on the defendant\u2019s silence, or (stated another way) whether the character of the remark was such that the jury would naturally and necessarily construe it as a comment on the defendant\u2019s silence,\u201d <em>United States v. Pennington, </em>20 F.3d 593, 599 (5th Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks omitted), it is difficult to see how the jury could consider the vague remark, \u201cwasn\u2019t being cooperative,\u201d as a comment on Schaffer\u2019s silence. Moreover, the remark was \u201ca spontaneous comment by the witness,\u201d not \u201ca comment prompted by the prosecutor.\u201d <em>United States v. Andaverde-Ti\u00f1oco, </em>741 F.3d 509, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>521 (5th Cir.2013) (quoting <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>185 F.3d 465, 472 (5th Cir. 1999)). This analysis leads us to reject Schaffer\u2019s argument, regardless of whether he received a <em>Miranda </em>warning before his short discussion with the police officers. <em>See Doyle, </em>426 U.S. at 619, 96 S.Ct. 2240 (addressing post-arrest, post-Miranda silence); <em>Salinas, </em>480 F.3d at 758 (addressing post-arrest, pre-Miranda silence).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">D. Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">This court applies a \u201ctwo-step analysis to claims of prosecutorial misconduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>609 F.3d 663, 677 (5th Cir.2010). \u201cFirst, we assess whether \u2018the prosecutor made an improper remark.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Fields, </em>483 F.3d 313, 358 (5th Cir.2007)). If so, we then ask if the defendant was prejudiced because of the prosecutor\u2019s remark. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe determinative question is whether the prosecutor\u2019s remarks cast serious doubt on the correctness of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Fields, </em>483 F.3d 313, 358 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). We determine whether the prosecutor\u2019s remark cast serious doubt on the correctness of the jury\u2019s verdict by considering three factors: \u201c(1) the magnitude of the prejudicial effect of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, (2) the efficacy of any cautionary instruction by the judge, and (3) the strength of the evidence supporting the conviction.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>609 F.3d at 677 (internal quotation marks omitted). While we review \u201cthe propriety of the prosecution\u2019s arguments de novo, we review the question of whether or not the defendant\u2019s substantial rights were affected under the abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>United States v. McCann, </em>613 F.3d 486, 494 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Schaffer argues that his substantial rights were affected when the prosecutor, on cross-examination of Schaffer\u2019s father, asked, \u201cMr. Schaeffer, were you aware that your son was trying to have another inmate contact you to pay [the Assistant United States Attorney] 30 to 50 thousand dollars to make this case go away?\u201d We disagree because we find that this question was proper. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 405(a),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-8\">[w]hen evidence of a person\u2019s character or character trait is admissible, it may be proved by testimony about the person\u2019s reputation or by testimony in the form of an opinion. On cross-examination of the character witness, the court may allow an inquiry into relevant specific instances of the person\u2019s conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATB\">We have \u201cexplained that \u2018[o]nce a witness has testified concerning a defendant\u2019s good character, it is permissible during cross-examination to attempt to undermine his credibility by asking him whether he has heard of prior misconduct of the defendant which is inconsistent with the witness\u2019 direct testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Skelton, </em>514 F.3d 433, 444 (5th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Wells, </em>525 F.2d 974, 976 (5th Cir.1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">Schaffer\u2019s father had testified on direct examination to Schaffer\u2019s good character. He was asked whether there was anything in Schaffer\u2019s background to prepare him for the news of the drug conspiracy charge, whether Schaffer was employed since graduating from college, and whether he had a \u201cnormal lifestyle.\u201d These questions were clearly asked by the defense as a means to establish Schaffer\u2019s good character and to attempt to show that he was not predisposed, for entrapment purposes, to commit the offense. As such, the prosecution\u2019s question on cross-examination about Schaffer\u2019s attempted bribery was proper under the Federal Rules of Evidence, given that the record shows that the prosecutor had a good faith basis to ask the question. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>the prosecutor did not make an improper remark and there was no prosecutorial misconduct. <em>Davis, </em>609 F.3d at 677 (prosecutorial misconduct is assessed by asking whether prosecutor made improper remark).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">E. Ineffective assistance of trial counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Schaffer argues that we should, on direct appeal, consider his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. He highlights a number of points in the trial where he believes his lawyer made errors sufficient to establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. However, we decline to reach this claim \u201cbecause it is premature.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes, </em>602 F.3d 381, 387 (5th Cir.2010). In this circuit, the \u201cgeneral rule ... is that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be resolved on direct appeal when the claim has not been raised before the district court since no opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Gulley, </em>526 F.3d 809, 821 (5th Cir.2008)). We will only consider a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal \u201cin those rare occasions where the record is sufficiently developed.\u201d <em>Gulley, </em>526 F.3d at 821. If the record does not allow us to \u201cfairly evaluate the claim ... we must decline to consider the issue without prejudice to a defendant\u2019s right to raise it in a subsequent proceeding.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Schaffer\u2019s ineffective assistance claim was not raised before the district court. As a result, the record is not sufficiently developed for the court to fairly evaluate the claim that Schaffer\u2019s attorney was ineffective. As in <em>Montes, </em>this case \u201cfalls within th[e] general rule because the record reveals neither the reasons for [Schaffer\u2019s] attorney\u2019s decisions nor the availability of alternative strategies.\u201d 602 F.3d at 387. Schaffer makes no persuasive argument for why this is one of the \u201crare occasions\u201d in which the court should evaluate his claim on direct appeal. Accordingly, we decline to reach his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">F. Cumulative effect</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">Schaffer next argues that the \u201ccumulative effect\u201d of the errors he has identified was to deprive him of a fair trial. The cumulative error doctrine \u201cprovides that an aggregation of non-reversible errors (i.e., plain errors failing to necessitate reversal and harmless errors) can yield a denial of the constitutional right to a fair trial, which calls for reversal.\u201d <em>United States v. Delgado, </em>672 F.3d 320, 343-44 (5th Cir.2012) (en banc) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). There being no error, the cumulative error doctrine has no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">III. GAMEZ\u2019S CHALLENGE</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">Gamez raises one issue on appeal: the adequacy of the indictment. He asserts that it was impermissibly vague, and that it \u201cfailed to allege the correct time period in which most of the criminal conduct occurred.\u201d Gamez argues that since the \u201cmajority of testimony centered around a \u2018buy bust\u2019 on June 10, 2010 that resulted in [his] arrest,\u201d and the indictment alleges conduct from \u201csometime in or about January 2009, and continuously thereafter up to and including May 12, 2010,\u201d most of the evidence at trial concerned events outside of the dates alleged in the indictment. As a result of this alleged deficiency, Gamez argues that he was unable to properly prepare a defense, and that he was unable to ensure that his prosecution was based on facts previously presented to the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-13\">Gamez waived his challenge to the indictment by failing to raise it before trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number><em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(e); <em>United States v. Whitfield, </em>590 F.3d 325, 359 (5th Cir.2009) (\u201cFailure to comply with this rule generally constitutes waiver.\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we will review the alleged errors relating to the adequacy of the indictment here for plain error. <em>See United States v. Hoover, </em>467 F.3d 496, 498 n. 2 (5th Cir.2006) (citing <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>360 F.3d 949, 958 (9th Cir.2004) (reviewing alleged insufficient indictment for plain error when raised for first time in a Rule 34 motion)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">This court has held that in the conspiracy context \u201c[a]n allegation as to the time of the offense is not an essential element of the offense charged in the indictment, and, within reasonable limits, the offense need only occur before the return of the indictment and within the statute of limitations.\u201d <em>United States v. Valdez, </em>453 F.3d 252, 259-60 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We have previously found that \u201c[a] five-month variance between the date alleged and the date proved is not unreasonable as a matter of law as long as the date proven falls within the statute of limitations and before the return of the indictment.\u201d <em>Girod, </em>646 F.3d at 316-17 (5th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Russell v. United States, </em>429 F.2d 237, 238 (5th Cir.1970) (finding that in the conspiracy context \u201cwithin reasonable limits, proof of any date before the return of the indictment and within the statute of limitations is sufficient.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">Given that the \u201cbuy bust\u201d and Gamez\u2019s arrest occurred on June 10, 2010, there is no question that the offense conduct occurred both before the return of the indictment, which was on July 7, 2010, and within the statute of limitations. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3282 (establishing five year statute of limitations). The facts here are well within the five-month discrepancy we concluded in <em>Girod </em>was not an unreasonable variance between the evidence presented at trial and the indictment, 646 F.3d at 316, since the \u201cbuy bust\u201d took place on June 10, 2010, and the indictment listed May 12, 2010 as the end date of the conspiracy. Moreover, Gamez fails to explain how the indictment failed to provide him with \u201cthe substantial safeguards ... an indictment is designed to provide.\u201d <em>Russell v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 749, 763, 82 S.Ct. 1038, 8 L.Ed.2d 240 (1962) (internal quotation marks omitted). He was fully aware of the charges against him, and the criminal complaint, issued the day after his arrest, indicated that the criminal conduct ran \u201cup until the present.\u201d Given these circumstances, Gamez cannot establish that he is entitled to relief.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the Defendants\u2019 convictions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b497-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.

The record does not establish whether Schaffer\u2019s discussion with the police officers occurred before or after he received a <em>Miranda </em>warning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b506-5\">. On December 1, 2014, absent congressional action, revisions to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12 will take effect. These revisions will alter the rule\u2019s \"waiver\u201d provision by making it a \"timeliness\u201d provision: \"Consequences of Not Making a Timely Motion Under Rule 12(b)(3). If a party does not meet the deadline for making a Rule 12(b)(3) motion, the motion is untimely. But a court may consider the defense, objection, or request if t\u00edre party shows good cause.\u201d Gamez has never attempted to show \"good cause\u201d for why he failed to make a timely motion challenging the indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b506-6\">. <em>Rodriguez </em>dealt with a situation where the defendant brought his challenge to the indictment for the first time in a Rule 34 motion, after he had pled guilty and judgment had been entered. 360 F.3d at 958. The defendant argued that he was entitled to <em>de novo </em>review, whereas the government argued that the review should be for plain error because the \"post-judgment Rule 34 motion does not constitute pre-trial review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Ninth Circuit sided with the Government and conducted a plain error review. <em>Id. </em>Here, Gamez brought his challenge for the first time after the Government rested its case-in-chief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b506-11\">. Gamez\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Cecil, </em>608 F.2d 1294 (9th Cir.1979) is misplaced. <em>Cecil </em>is distinguishable because the temporal language of the indictment there was \"open-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>ended in both directions,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1297, which is not the case here. In <em>Cecil, </em>the indictment alleged that the conspiracy had \"beg[un] <em>on or before </em>July, 1975, and continu[ed] thereafter until <em>on or after </em>October, 1975.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The Ninth Circuit held that \u201cthe indictment fail[ed] to allege sufficient facts to facilitate the proper preparation of a defense and to ensure that the defendants were prosecuted on facts presented to the Grand Jury,\u201d because of the open-ended nature of the indictment\u2019s time frame. <em>Id. </em>The indictment here has an end date of \u201cup to and including May 12, 2010,\u201d which is definitive; accordingly, the concerns recognized by the Ninth Circuit in <em>Cecil </em>do not apply here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
