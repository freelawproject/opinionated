On appeal, defendant contends that the District Court erred in sentencing him above the statutory maximum for Count One and requests a full resentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and the procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">As Choudhury concedes that he did not object to his sentence when it was imposed, we review for plain error. Under plain error review, \u201can appellate court may, in its discretion, correct an error not raised at trial only where the appellant demonstrates that (1) there is an \u2018error\u2019; (2) the error is \u2018clear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute\u2019; (3) the error \u2018affected the appellant\u2019s substantial rights, which in the ordinary case means\u2019 it \u2018affected the outcome of the district court proceedings\u2019; and (4) \u2018the error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Marcus, </em>560 U.S. 258, 262, 130 S.Ct. 2159, 176 L.Ed.2d 1012 (2010) (quoting <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009)). Generally, to \u201caffect substantial rights,\u201d an error must have caused prejudice and affected the outcome of the district court proceedings. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). On plain error review, \u201c[i]t is the defendant rather than the Government who bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-12\">There is no dispute that the District Court erred in sentencing Choudhury principally to 108 months imprisonment for Count One, which exceeds the 90-month statutory maximum for that count. However, the properly imposed concurrent sentence of imprisonment for 108 months on Count Two undermines the defendant\u2019s claim that the District Court\u2019s error affected his \u201csubstantial rights.\u201d <em>See United States v. Outen, </em>286 F.3d 622, 640 (2d Cir.2002) (\u201c[A]n erroneous sentence on one count of a multiple-count conviction does not affect substantial rights where the total term of imprisonment remains unaffected[.]\u201d). Thus, the requirements of plain error have not been satisfied and the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>ment of the District Court should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">We have considered all of appellant\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b54-10\">. Both parties agree that, following Choudhury's guilty plea in front of the Magistrate Judge, the District Court failed to formally . accept Choudhury\u2019s plea. While Choudhury is not challenging his conviction on this basis, we take this opportunity to remind district judges of their responsibility to accept guilty pleas prior to sentencing. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(4); <em>see also United States v. Williams, </em>23 F.3d 629, 634 (2d Cir.1994) (allowing plea allocution by magistrate judges but only \"[bjecause the district court remains in control of the proceeding, and the matter is reported to that court for its approval\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 1045, 115 S.Ct. 641, 130 L.Ed.2d 547.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
