Stephens claims his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to explain adequately the sentence, and failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors in not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>recommending his placement in the Federal Residential Drug Abuse Treatment Program (RDAP). And, he further claims his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to balance fairly the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, the district court must still properly calculate the advisory Guidelines-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Because Stephens did not raise these issues in district court, review is only for plain error. <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391 (5th Cir.2007). Under that standard, Stephens must show a forfeited plain (clear or obvious) error that affected his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he does so, we have the discretion to correct the error, but should do so only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The record reflects the district court considered the evidence presented, including Stephens\u2019 history of drug abuse and his need for treatment by requiring his participation in a drug treatment program as a condition of his supervised release. It then provided a legally sufficient explanation of the sentence by both noting the sentence adequately addressed all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and stating it had considered the Guidelines in addition to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>E.g., Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 358-59, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Because the Bureau of Prisons has the sole discretion to determine prisoner eligibility and to make arrangements for each prisoner\u2019s participation in the appropriate substance-abuse program, the court did not err in not recommending for Stephens\u2019 enrollment in the RDAP. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(b), (e). Stephens has not demonstrated the district court committed plain error in either explaining the sentence imposed or not recommending him for placement in RDAP. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525-26 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, Stephens has not demonstrated his sentence is procedurally unreasonable. <em>E.g., id. </em>at 525; <em>see also Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Regarding Stephens\u2019 substantive-unreasonableness claim, the record shows the court considered the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as well as Stephens\u2019 claims for mitigating his sentence. By concluding a within-Guidelines sentence was appropriate, the court implicitly overruled Stephens\u2019 claims. <em>E.g., Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d at 526. It goes without saying that \u201cthe sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant\u201d. <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Stephens\u2019 general disagreement with the propriety of his sentence and the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-Guidelines sentence. <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010). Stephens has not demonstrated the district court committed plain error by sentencing him to a within-Guidelines, 240-month prison term and, thus, has not shown his sentence is substantively unreasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b528-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
