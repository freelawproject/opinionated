O\u2019Connor appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing for lack of standing her action alleging a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) and various state law claims. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Skaff v. Meridien N. Am. Beverly Hills, LLC, </em>506 F.3d 832, 837 (9th Cir.2007) (interpretation of the ADA); <em>Canatella v. California, </em>304 F.3d 843, 852 (9th Cir.2002) (dismissal for lack of standing). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-26\">The district court properly dismissed O\u2019Connor\u2019s ADA claim because O\u2019Connor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>failed to allege a concrete and particularized injury-in-fact traceable to defendants\u2019 conduct in delaying O\u2019Connor\u2019s access to a hospital\u2019s premises with her service dog. <em>See Chapman v. Pier 1 Imps. (U.S.), Inc., </em>631 F.3d 939, 946 (9th Cir.2011) (setting forth elements of standing to allege a claim under Title III of the ADA); <em>Skaff, </em>506 F.3d at 835-36 (wheelchair-bound paraplegic lacked standing as to his ADA claim arising from a one-hour delay in getting a hotel room with a roll-in shower and portable shower chair). Moreover, O\u2019Connor failed to establish a \u201c \u2018real and immediate threat of repeated injury\u2019 in the future\u201d to pursue injunctive relief under the ADA. <em>Chapman, </em>631 F.3d at 946 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying O\u2019Connor leave to amend because amendment would be futile. <em>See Platt Elec. Supply, Inc. v. EOFF Elec., Inc., </em>522 F.3d 1049, 1054 (9th Cir. 2008) (setting forth standard of review and noting that district court does not abuse its discretion by denying leave to amend where amendment would be futile).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying reconsideration because O\u2019Connor failed to establish grounds for such relief. <em>See </em>D. Ariz. Loe. R. 7.2(g)(1) (setting forth grounds for reconsideration); <em>Hinton v. Pac. Enters., </em>5 F.3d 391, 395 (9th Cir.1993) (reviewing application of local rules for an abuse of discretion); <em>see also Sch. Dist. No. 1J, Multnomah Cnty., Or. v. ACandS, Inc., </em>5 F.3d 1255, 1263 (9th Cir.1993) (setting forth standard of review and factors for reconsideration under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59(e) and 60(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Defendants\u2019 contention that O\u2019Connor\u2019s motion for reconsideration did not constitute a tolling motion for purposes of filing her notice of appeal is unpersuasive. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(l)(4)(A)(iv) &amp; (vi).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b723-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
