We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 1291, 2253. <em>See Ash v. Cvetkov, </em>739 F.2d 493, 496 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Tooley argues that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing for failure to prosecute. The State of Washington agrees that this was an abuse of discretion but urges us to reach the merits of Tooley\u2019s petition. \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a habeas corpus petition de novo and may affirm on any ground supported by the record, even if it differs from the rationale of the district court.\u201d <em>Pollard v. White, </em>119 F.3d 1430, 1433 (9th Cir.1997). Assuming without deciding that the district court erred by dismissing for failure to prosecute, we nonetheless affirm the district court because we conclude that Tooley\u2019s petition is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Tooley contends that the prosecutor breached the plea agreement in violation of <em>Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971), by referring to facts not in the plea agreement during his sentencing hearing. Specifically, he faults the prosecutor for saying that Tooley had \u201crobbed\u201d a store clerk at gun point after committing the murder to which he pleaded guilty. Although the prosecutor was regrettably imprecise in using the word \u201crobbed,\u201d the context was of the prosecutor arguing that no one was threatening Tooley when, as Tooley stipulated, he stole a lighter and threatened a clerk with a gun. The Washington Court of Appeals reasonably concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s reference \u201cto the QFC shop lift and use of a gun to threaten the QFC clerk was within the stipulated real facts\u201d and did not undercut the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">In reviewing a federal habeas petition, \u201cstate court findings of fact are presumed correct unless rebutted by clear and convincing evidence or unless based on an unreasonable evidentiary foundation.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Pliler, </em>341 F.3d 897, 903 (9th Cir.2003). Here, the record supports the Washington Court of Appeals\u2019 determination. In the plea agreement, the parties \u201cstipulated that the following are real and material facts for purposes of this sentencing: The facts set forth in the certifieation(s) for determination of probable cause and prosecutor\u2019s summary.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s summary states that \u201c[a]fter the homicide, the defendant stole a lighter and threatened the [store] clerk with a gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">Thus, Tooley had stipulated that those facts were \u201creal and material facts for the purposes of ... sentencing.\u201d The Washington Court of Appeals\u2019 determination that the prosecutor was referring to those stipulated facts, rather than to a \u201crobbe[ry]\u201d offense to which Tooley had not admitted, was neither contrary to, nor involved an unreasonable application of <em>Santobello v. New York. See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b789-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
