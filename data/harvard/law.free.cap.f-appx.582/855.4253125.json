After careful review, we affirm both his conviction and his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Mikle first argues that, due to inconsistencies between the police officers\u2019 trial testimony and police reports, the evidence was insufficient to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude sufficient evidence supported Mikle\u2019s conviction despite the alleged inconsistencies. Issues about conflicting testimony are credibility issues for the jury to resolve, <em>United States v. Moore, 525 </em>F.3d 1033, 1049 (11th Cir.2008), and we presume the jury resolved all credibility issues in favor of its verdict, <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>480 F.3d 1025, 1026 (11th Cir.2007). Here, the jury convicted Mikle and therefore found the officers\u2019 trial testimony to be credible despite any inconsistencies with the police reports. Sufficient evidence supported every element of the charge, and the jury reasonably concluded Mikle was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. We accordingly affirm Mikle\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Mikle also argues his sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mikle contends the sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not adequately explain its reasoning for declining to grant a downward variance. This argument lacks merit. The record shows the district court considered the parties\u2019 arguments and issued a reasoned basis for its decision to impose a sentence within the Guidelines range. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (\u201c[W]hen a judge decides simply to apply the Guidelines to a particular case, doing so will not necessarily require lengthy explanation.\u201d); <em>United States v. Livesay, 525 </em>F.3d 1081, 1090 (11th Cir.2008) (holding \u201csentencing judge is not required\u201d to explicitly consider or discuss each of the sentencing factors). Mikle\u2019s sentence was therefore procedurally reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">Mikle opines that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because the length of his conviction \u2014 240 months \u2014 is excessive in light of the crime for which he was convicted: the possession of 1.4 grams of cocaine base and 0.8 grams of cocaine powder. We conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing the 240-month sentence. The district did not act unreasonably by attaching great weight to the Guidelines\u2019 treatment of Mikle\u2019s criminal history and less weight to the nature and circumstances of his offense. <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201c[W]e ordinarily ... expect a sentence with the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d) (quotation omitted); <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court....\u201d) (quotation omitted). Given his extensive criminal history, Mikle cannot show the district court afforded unjustified weight to this factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">In light of the foregoing reasons, we affirm Mikle\u2019s conviction and his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b884-6\">. This Court reviews the sufficiency of evidence to support a defendant\u2019s conviction de novo, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>United States v.
