Memorandum Opinion and Order, filed May 7, 2013. Rule 54 provides, \u201cUnless a federal statute, these rules, or a court order provides otherwise, costs other than attorney\u2019s fees should be allowed to the prevailing party.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d)(1). There is a presumption in favor of awarding costs. <em>White &amp; White, Inc. v. Am. Hosp. Supply Corp., </em>786 F.2d 728, 729 (6th Cir.1986). We give deferential review to the decision of the district court to award costs and to their amount. <em>In re Cardizem CD Antitrust Litig., </em>481 F.3d 355, 358 (6th Cir.2007). Among others things, federal law provides that costs may be taxed for fees for printed or electronically recorded transcripts, fees for printing and witnesses, and fees for making copies of any materials where the copies are necessarily obtained for use in the case. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-20\">Plaintiffs asked that the district court defer awarding costs until the merits appeal, case number 12-5947, was resolved or, in the alternative, to refuse to award McMahan $1,293.60 in copying costs and to refuse HSA\u2019s request for $16,579.60 in videotaping costs. The district court found that McMahan\u2019s copying costs of 15 cents per page were reasonable. Mem. Op. at 4. As for the videotaping, the court looked to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920 and found that \u201cvideo deposition costs are taxable.\u201d Mem. Op. at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-21\">In a separate opinion, we have affirmed judgment in favor of defendants in case number 12-5947. <em>Hyland v. Homeservices of Am., Inc., </em>771 F.3d 310 (2014). In light of our decision, we detect no error in the decision of the district court to award costs to defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-22\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
