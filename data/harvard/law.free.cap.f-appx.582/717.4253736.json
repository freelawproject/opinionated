We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Hawn v. Exec. Jet Mgmt., Inc., </em>615 F.3d 1151, 1155 (9th Cir.2010), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-22\">The district court properly granted summary judgment because Cornelio failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether defendant treated similarly situated employees outside of Cornelio\u2019s protected class more favorably than him. <em>See id. </em>at 1156, 1158-61 (setting forth elements of prima facie case of discrimination under Title VII based on circumstantial evidence); <em>Vasquez v. County of Los Angeles, </em>349 F.3d 634, 641 (9th Cir.2003) (employee who held the same level position as plaintiff was not similarly situated to plaintiff where the employee did not engage in problematic conduct \u201cof comparable seriousness\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-23\">Moreover, even if Cornelio had established a prima facie case of discrimination, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>Cornelio failed to carry his burden of raising a triable dispute as to whether defendant\u2019s legitimate reasons for firing him were a pretext. <em>See Tex. Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 258, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981) (defendant rebuts presumption of prima facie discrimination with any admissible evidence of a valid reason for the adverse employment decision, which plaintiff can only overcome by proving that it lacks factual basis and is a pretext); <em>Vasquez, </em>349 F.3d at 642 (plaintiff must submit \u201cspecific\u201d and \u201csubstantial\u201d evidence of pretext).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">Cornelio\u2019s contentions regarding alleged harassment during his employment, and alleged threats during the course of this litigation, are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b745-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
