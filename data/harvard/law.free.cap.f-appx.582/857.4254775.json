Marshall contends that he should be permitted to argue \u201cwith greater precision\u201d what he already argued in support of the dismissed petition he seeks to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">In dismissing Marshall\u2019s original \u00a7 2241 petition, which was filed on February 16, 2010, the district court found that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Flores-Figueroa v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 646, 129 S.Ct. 1886, 173 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009), narrowed the knowledge element of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A, the aggravated identity theft statute under which Marshall had been convicted in 2007. The court also found that the holding in <em>Flores-Figueroa </em>established that Marshall was convicted of a nonexistent offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the district court denied Marshall\u2019s original \u00a7 2241 petition on the ground that he had failed to establish that applicable Eighth Circuit law<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> squarely foreclosed this knowledge element claim at the time of his guilty plea (February 2007) and when he filed his first \u00a7 2255 motion (November 2007), as required to open the portal to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding. The court specifically ruled that Marshall\u2019s claim was not squarely foreclosed until March 28, 2008, when the Eighth Circuit decided <em>United States v. Mendoza-Gonzalez, </em>520 F.3d 912 (8th Cir.2008) (holding that to be guilty of aggravated identity theft under \u00a7 1028A, the defendant need not know that the stolen means of identification belonged to another actual person), <em>vacated, </em>556 U.S. 1232, 129 S.Ct. 2377, 173 L.Ed.2d 1289 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">This Court affirmed the dismissal of Marshall\u2019s original \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Marshall v. United States, </em>514 Fed.Appx. 936, 938 (11th Cir.2013). We determined that \u201c[u]ntil 2008, when the Eighth Circuit issued its <em>Mendozar-Gonzalez </em>decision, that court\u2019s precedent did not squarely foreclose Marshall\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 937-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">After the Supreme Court denied Marshall\u2019s petition for certiorari, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2749, 186 L.Ed.2d 203 (2013), he filed a motion to amend his \u00a7 2241 petition in the district court. Marshall\u2019s stated purpose for amending his petition was to argue that the knowledge element claim was, in fact, squarely foreclosed by the 2007 decision <em>United States v. Hines, </em>472 F.3d 1038 (8th Cir.2007). The district court denied Marshall\u2019s motion to amend because, among other things, <em>\u201cHines </em>did not squarely foreclose Marshall\u2019s knowledge-element claim\u201d and therefore the amendment would be futile. That conclusion is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">Significantly, <em>Hines </em>is a decision that was cited in <em>Mendoza-Gonzalez </em>\u2014 and also in our opinion affirming the dismissal of Marshall\u2019s original \u00a7 2241 petition \u2014 as a decision that did <em>not </em>directly address the question of whether the government must establish that a defendant knew that he was stealing the identity of another actual person. <em>See Mendozar-Gonzalez, </em>520 F.3d at 916; <em>Marshall, </em>514 Fed.Appx. at 938, n. 5. In other words, <em>Hines </em>did not squarely foreclose Marshall\u2019s knowledge element claim and, perhaps more importantly for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>purposes of Marshall\u2019s motion to amend, it is clear that we gave due consideration to <em>Hines </em>in connection with Marshall\u2019s appeal of the dismissal of his original \u00a7 2241 petition. Even if we had not, a \u00a7 2241 petition may not be amended after we have affirmed a district court\u2019s dismissal of the petition, especially not for the purpose of arguing a decision that existed when the petition was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b886-5\">. Marshall altered one digit of his own social security number without knowing that the altered number belonged to another person. In <em>Flores-Figueroa, </em>the Supreme Court held that the government must \"show that the defendant knew that the means of identification at issue belonged to another person.\" 556 U.S. at 657, 129 S.Ct. at 1894.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b886-12\">. Marshall was convicted in a Missouri federal court, where he brought his direct appeal and his first \u00a7 2255 motion, so Eighth Circuit precedent is the circuit law that determines whether the \"binding precedent had specifically addressed ... and had squarely foreclosed [Marshall\u2019s] claim.\u201d <em>Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1274 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
