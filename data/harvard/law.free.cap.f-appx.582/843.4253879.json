He contends that the district court erred in finding that the evidence presented at his sentence hearing justified applying the four-level enhancement under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(6)(B) for using or possessing a firearm in connection with another felony offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">We will not disturb the sentencing court\u2019s factual findings absent clear error. <em>United States v. Askew, </em>193 F.3d 1181, 1183 (11th Cir.1999). We review <em>de novo, </em>however, the court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines to those facts. <em>United States v. Cannon, </em>41 F.3d 1462, 1466 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">Section 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) provides for a four-level increase in the defendant\u2019s base offense level if the defendant \u201cused or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B). Application Note 14(B) to \u00a7 2K2.1 specifically provides that \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) applies \u201cin the case of a drug trafficking offense in which a firearm is found in close proximity to drugs, drug-manufacturing materials, or drug paraphernalia ... because the presence of the firearm has the potential of facilitating another felony offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n. 14 (B); <em>see United States v. Jackson, </em>276 F.3d 1231, 1234 (11th Cir.2001) (noting that, where the defendant\u2019s offense involves possession of contraband, a court may infer that the firearm emboldened him to undertake illicit drug activity, and that he \u201cwould have, if necessary, used [his] firearm [ ] in furtherance of [his] crime [ ]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-12\">At Grice\u2019s sentence hearing, the district court found that, during their search of Grice\u2019s residence, law enforcement officers found powder cocaine and marijuana in a safe in Grice\u2019s bedroom, as well as a shotgun and three unspent shotgun shells under a couch in his living room. Grice argued that he had not \u201cpossessed\u201d the shotgun for purposes of the \u00a7 2K2. 1(b)(6)(B) enhancement because the shotgun did not belong to him and he had no intention of using it, but the district court rejected that argument. In doing so, the district court credited a police officer\u2019s testimony about the contents of several recorded phone calls that Grice made from jail after his arrest. According to the officer, Grice referred to the shotgun that had been found at his residence but did not express surprise at the officers\u2019 discovery. Instead, he made comments along the lines of \u201cwe should have gotten rid of it.\u201d That was enough to establish constructive possession. <em>See United States v. Perez, </em>661 F.3d 568, 576 (11th Cir.2011). In light of that, the district court found that Grice possessed the shotgun, that the shotgun \u201cwas available for use in connection with [Grice\u2019s] drug offense[s],\u201d and that the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) enhancement was warranted. The district court\u2019s factu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>al findings were not clearly erroneous, and the enhancement was properly applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
