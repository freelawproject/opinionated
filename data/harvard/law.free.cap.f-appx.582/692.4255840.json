We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, <em>Tapia Madrigal v. Holder, </em>716 F.3d 499, 503 (9th Cir.2013), and we grant the petition for review and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">In assessing Higueros\u2019s fear of torture, the BIA acknowledged the evidence showed the existence of \u201crogue officials\u201d in Guatemala, and found the existence of rogue officials \u201ccannot be used\u201d to demonstrate that government officials would acquiesce to any torture of Higueros. The BIA\u2019s finding is not supported, <em>see Tapia Madrigal, </em>716 F.3d at 509-10 (\u201c[A]n application for CAT relief need not show that the entire foreign government would consent to or acquiesce in his torture. He need show only that \u2018a public official\u2019 would so acquiesce.\u201d), and its analysis is otherwise not clear, <em>see Recinos De Leon v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 1185, 1189 (9th Cir. 2005) (\u201cWhen the agency\u2019s reasoning is indiscernible, the courts cannot exercise their duty of review, and instead must remand to the agency.\u201d) (internal citations and quotation omitted). Accordingly, we grant the petition and remand Higueros\u2019s CAT claim for further proceedings consistent with this disposition. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">In light of our disposition, we do address Higueros\u2019s remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b721-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
