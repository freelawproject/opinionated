Jura brought claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), the Americans with Disabilities Act (the \u201cADA\u201d), and Hawaii state law, claiming that (1) she was subjected to a hostile work environment as a result of defendant Marie Kosegarten\u2019s conduct; (2) she was terminated in retaliation for her participation in an investigation triggered by a coworker\u2019s complaint about Kosegarten\u2019s conduct; and (3) defendants failed to provide her with a reasonable accommodation for her hearing disability. We review de novo, <em>Kaplan v. City of N. Las Vegas, </em>323 F.3d 1226, 1229 (9th Cir.2003), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">To prevail on a claim of hostile work environment, a plaintiff must establish a \u201cpattern of ongoing and persistent harassment severe enough to alter the conditions of employment.\u201d <em>Draper v. Coeur Rochester, Inc., </em>147 F.3d 1104, 1108 (9th Cir. 1998). In addition, the plaintiff must prove that any harassment took place \u201cbecause of ... sex.\u201d <em>Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., </em>523 U.S. 75, 79, 118 S.Ct. 998, 140 L.Ed.2d 201 (1998). While Kosegarten\u2019s conduct towards Jura was highly inappropriate, it was not so severe as to create a work environment that a reasonable person would consider hostile or abusive or alter the conditions of Jura\u2019s employment. <em>See Westendorf v. W. Coast Contractors of Nev., Inc., </em>712 F.3d 417, 421 (9th Cir.2013); <em>see also Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 U.S. 775, 787-88, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">In order to make out a retaliation claim under Title VII, a plaintiff must show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-11\">(1) involvement in a protected activity,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-12\">(2) an adverse employment action and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-13\">(3) a causal link between the two. Thereafter, the burden of production shifts to the employer to present legitimate reasons for the adverse employment action. Once the employer carries this burden, plaintiff must demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the reason advanced by the employer was a pretext.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-14\"><em>Brooks v. City of San Mateo, </em>229 F.3d 917, 928 (9th Cir.2000) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-15\">The district court concluded that Jura had failed to make out a prima facie case of retaliation based on its determination that the conduct Jura reported fell outside the ambit of Title VII. However, Title VII protects employees from actions taken by an employer as the result of an employee\u2019s opposition to what the employee reasonably, but mistakenly, believes to be an unlawful employment practice. <em>Moyo v. Gomez. </em>40 F.3d 982, 984 (9th Cir.1994). The reasonableness of a plaintiffs belief is construed broadly. <em>Id. </em>at 985.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-16\">However, although the district court did not reach defendants\u2019 argument that Jura was terminated for legitimate reasons, we can affirm on any grounds supported by the record. <em>Schmidt v. Contra Costa Cnty. </em>693 F.3d 1122, 1132 (9th Cir.2012). Even if Jura established a prima facie case of retaliation, she failed to establish a genuine issue of fact as to whether the reason advanced for her termination was a pretext. <em>See Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., </em>281 F.3d 1054, 1062 (9th Cir.2002) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>(holding that where a plaintiff relies on \u201ccircumstantial evidence to show pretext, such evidence must be both specific and substantial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">The ADA \u201cprohibits an employer from discriminating against an \u2018individual with a disability\u2019 who ... can perform the essential functions of the job.\u201d <em>U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, </em>535 U.S. 391, 393, 122 S.Ct. 1516, 152 L.Ed.2d 589 (2002) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112). \u201c \u2018[Discrimination\u2019 includes an employer\u2019s \u2018not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified ... employee.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396, 122 S.Ct. 1516 (quoting \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A)) (emphasis omitted). \u201cAn employer is not obligated to provide an employee the accommodation he requests or prefers, the employer need only provide some reasonable accommodation.\u201d <em>Zivkovic v. S. Cal. Edison Co., </em>302 F.3d 1080, 1089 (9th Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Although Jura contended that the amplifying headphones available in the courtroom were not a reasonable accommodation for her hearing disability, she failed to provide sufficient evidence supporting this contention. Considering only the arguments properly raised in the district court, <em>see USA Petroleum Co. v. Atl. Richfield Co., </em>13 F.3d 1276, 1284 (9th Cir.1994), Jura failed to establish a genuine issue as to whether the headphones served as a reasonable accommodation.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Jura\u2019s discrimination and retaliation claims under Hawai'i Revised Statutes \u00a7 378-2 are largely analogous to her claims under Title VII and the ADA. <em>See French v. Haw. Pizza Hut, Inc., </em>105 Hawai'i 462, 99 P.3d 1046, 1051 (2004); <em>Gonsalves v. Nissan Motor Corp. in Haw., Ltd., </em>100 Hawai'i 149, 58 P.3d 1196, 1209 (2002); <em>Nelson v. Univ. of Haw., </em>97 Hawai'i 376, 38 P.3d 95, 110 (2001). Summary judgment was properly granted on Jura\u2019s state-law claims for the same reasons it was properly granted on her federal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b771-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
