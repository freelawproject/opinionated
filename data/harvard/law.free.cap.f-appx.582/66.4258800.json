Christensen, denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Rui Jun Shi, </em>No. A201 126 207 (B.I.A. Aug. 6, 2013), <em>aff'g </em>No. A201 126 207 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Jan. 30, 2012). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions \u201cfor the sake of completeness.\u201d <em>Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u2018conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 165 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B)). The agency may, \u201c[cjonsidering the totality of the circumstances ... base a credibility determination on the demeanor\u201d of an asylum applicant and \u201cthe internal consistency\u201d of the applicant\u2019s statements, \u201cwithout regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 163-64. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Shi was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">The agency reasonably relied on Shi\u2019s demeanor, noting that his testimony was unresponsive at times and gave the impression that he was testifying from a script. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see also Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005). That finding is supported by the hearing transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">The agency\u2019s demeanor finding is further bolstered by inconsistencies and implausibilities in the record regarding Shi\u2019s actions after he purportedly escaped detention at a family planning facility. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 166 n. 3; <em>see also Wensheng Yan v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 63, 66-68 &amp; n. 2 (2d Cir.2007) (per curiam). Shi and his family asserted that he had to fearfully hide in constant danger after his June 2009 escape until his March 2010 arrival in the United States, while he admitted that he used his own passport to take two international vacations during that time, including a fifteen day sightseeing trip to the United States, returning to hide at his aunt\u2019s house in China on both occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-13\">Having questioned Shi\u2019s credibility, the agency reasonably relied further on his failure to provide certain evidence corroborating his claim or rehabilitating his testimony. <em>See Biao Yang v. Gonzales, </em>496 F.3d 268, 273 (2d Cir.2007) (per curiam). Furthermore, the IJ was not required to make a finding as to the availability of such evidence before relying on Shi\u2019s lack of corroboration. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Given the agency\u2019s findings regarding Shi\u2019s demeanor and the implausibility and lack of corroboration for his testimony, the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. This determination is dispositive of Shi\u2019s claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see also Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148,156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
