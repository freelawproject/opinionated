Reader appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing her action arising from foreclosure proceedings. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Cervantes v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., </em>656 F.3d 1034, 1040 (9th Cir.2011). We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-24\">The district court properly denied Reader\u2019s motion to remand because the district court had diversity jurisdiction and defendants timely removed. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a) (diversity jurisdiction); <em>Destfino v. Reiswig, </em>630 F.3d 952, 955-56 (9th Cir. 2011) (setting forth standard of review and holding that each defendant is entitled to thirty days to exercise his removal rights after being served).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-25\">The district court properly dismissed Reader\u2019s claims for wrongful foreclosure and tortious interference with enjoyment of property, and her request for a declaratory judgment, because her allegations did not \u201cplausibly suggest an entitlement to relief.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 681, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009); <em>see also Cervantes, </em>656 F.3d at 1043-44 (explaining that \u201cArizona state courts have not yet recognized a wrongful foreclosure cause of action,\u201d and in states that do recognize such claims, they typically are available only after foreclosure and are premised on allegations that the borrower was not in default).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-26\">The district court properly dismissed Reader\u2019s claim for \u201cbreach of the deed of trust contract\u201d because documents referred to in the complaint showed that defendants complied with the provision re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>quiring notice prior to acceleration. <em>See Chartone, Inc. v. Bernini, </em>207 Ariz. 162, 83 P.3d 1103, 1111 (Ariz.Ct.App.2004) (elements of breach of contract under Arizona law); <em>see also Knievel v. ESPN, </em>393 F.3d 1068, 1076 (9th Cir.2005) (court may consider documents not physically attached to the plaintiffs pleading whose contents are alleged in the complaint and whose authenticity no party questions).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">The district court properly dismissed Reader\u2019s quiet title claim because Reader failed to allege facts showing that the loan has been repaid. <em>See Farrell v. West, </em>57 Ariz. 490, 114 P.2d 910, 911 (1941) (where \u201cit appears there is an unsatisfied balance due to a defendant-mortgagee, or his assignee, the court will not quiet the title until and unless [plaintiff] pays off such mortgage lien\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">However, after the district court dismissed Reader\u2019s claims for promissory estoppel, in which Reader alleged breach of a promise to offer a permanent loan modification after she made trial payments, we held that a bank may be contractually obligated to offer a permanent loan modification to a borrower who made trial payments. <em>See Corvello v. Wells Fargo Bank, NA, </em>728 F.3d 878, 883-84 (9th Cir.2013) (per curiam). Because the district court did not have the benefit of <em>Corvello </em>when it issued its order of dismissal, we vacate and remand to allow the court to reconsider Reader\u2019s claims for promissory estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">We also vacate and remand Reader\u2019s claim for violation of Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 33-420 to allow the court to reconsider it in light of intervening state case law. <em>See Sitton v. Deutsche Bank Nat\u2019l Trust Co., </em>233 Ariz. 215, 311 P.3d 237, 240-11 (Ariz. Ct.App.2013) (holding that property owner had standing under Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 33-420 and that the allegedly false documents fell within the statute\u2019s scope); <em>Stauffer v. U.S. Bank Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n, </em>233 Ariz. 22, 308 P.3d 1173, 1176-77, 1179 (Ariz.Ct.App. 2013) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">Finally, we vacate and remand Reader\u2019s claim for an injunction against the trustee\u2019s sale under Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 33-811(0 in light of our decision to remand some of her other claims. <em>See </em>Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 33-811(C) (defenses and objections to a trustee\u2019s sale are waived if they are not raised in an action resulting in injunctive relief before the sale).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">Reader\u2019s motion to file an oversized exhibit, filed on August 30, 2012, is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">Defendants\u2019 request to strike the portion of Reader\u2019s opening brief inserting alleged images from a home loan help website, set forth in their answering brief, is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-12\">Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-13\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b747-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
