The BIA applied the categorical approach and found him removable on the basis of his Arizona conviction for conspiracy to sell a narcotic drug under Arizona Revised Statutes (\u201cA.R.S.\u201d) \u00a7 13-3408(A)(7). In light of <em>Ragasa v. Holder, </em>752 F.3d 1173 (9th Cir. 2014), <em>amended by </em>2014 WL 2498950 (9th Cir. June 4, 2014), we grant Huerta-Flores\u2019s petition for review and remand for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">In <em>Ragasa </em>we were faced with the same mismatch between the federal and state lists of controlled substances present here: the inclusion of benzylfentanyl and thenylfentanyl in the state list but not in the federal list. <em>See id. </em>at *2 (comparing Hawaii list with federal list). <em>Compare </em>A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3401(20), <em>with </em>21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1308.11-15. The court held that the petitioner was not categorically removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) because of this mismatch. <em>Ragasa, </em>752 F.3d 1173, 2014 WL 1661491, at *2. For the same reason, Huerta-Flores\u2019s petition must be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">Unlike <em>Ragasa, </em>it appears that documents in the record of this case may reflect the substances involved in Huerta-Flores\u2019s conviction. The BIA\u2019s decision did not discuss application of the modified categorical approach. We leave that question to its consideration in the first instance on remand. Huerta-Flores may present his arguments against application of the modified categorical approach to the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b787-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
