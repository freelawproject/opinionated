Relevant to this appeal, at the same time that Ratliff was seeking \u00a7 2255 relief in the district court, so was Debra. Debra raised essentially the same Fourth Amendment claim and related claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as Ratliff, namely that trial attorney\u2019s failure to file a motion to suppress constituted ineffective assistance of counsel and rendered involuntary his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-23\">As we explained in Debra\u2019s appeal, \u201c[t]o prove that claim, Ratliff was required to show that (1) a suppression motion would have been meritorious, (2)[his] counsel\u2019s failure to file one was objectively unreasonable (the \u2018performance\u2019 prong), and (3) but for [his] counsel\u2019s deficient performance in that regard, [he] would not have pleaded guilty (the \u2018prejudice\u2019 prong).\u201d <em>United States v. Debra Ratliff, </em>719 F.3d 422, 423 (5th Cir.2013). Although the district court rejected this claim, the court went on to grant a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) in both cases on the issue whether the suppression motion would have been meritorious. As in Debra\u2019s case, the district court did not indicate whether it intended for the COA to include the independently dispositive issues of performance and prejudice, and Ratliff did not ask this court to expand the scope of the COA to include those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-24\">\u201cA certificate of appealability may issue,\u201d pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c), \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a <em>constitutional right.\u201d Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 481, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (emphasis added). \u2018Where a federal habeas corpus petition, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244, or, as here, a motion to vacate, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, raises a constitutional claim with multiple elements, a COA may issue with respect to that claim only if the defendant makes a substantial showing as to each element.\u201d <em>Debra Ratliff, </em>719 F.3d at 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Consistent with the action taken in <em>Debra Ratliff, </em>719 F.3d at 424, we VACATE the COA and REMAND for clarification as to whether Delbert Ratliff has made a substantial showing of the denial of his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel and is entitled to a COA on that issue. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b349-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
