Plaintiffs James Mullen and Karl Schmidt and plaintiff Nicholas Vassenelli had initiated two actions by complaints dated September 16, 2010 and November 24, 2010, respectively, against the City of Syracuse, Syracuse Police Department officials, private third-party benefits administrator POMCO Group, and other individual defendants. Plaintiffs asserted numerous claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, <em>inter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number><em>alia, </em>all arising out of a municipal policy change that allegedly affected plaintiffs\u2019 access to medical care and benefits guaranteed by New York state law. Plaintiffs also challenge on appeal several District Court orders affirming discovery orders issued by Magistrate Judge David E. Peebles. Because these two cases, which were argued in tandem, concern coincident issues, present substantively similar facts, and seek identical relief, we consolidate them for disposition. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>an order granting summary judgment and \u201cresolv[e] all ambiguities and draw[ ] all permissible factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought.\u201d <em>Burg v. Gosselin, </em>591 F.3d 95, 97 (2d Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). We must affirm a summary judgment order when \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). \u201c[C]onclusory statements or mere allegations [are] not sufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion.\u201d <em>Davis v. New York, </em>316 F.3d 93, 100 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">On appeal, plaintiffs challenge the District Court\u2019s summary dismissal of their procedural and substantive due process claims. It is axiomatic that \u201c[t]he first inquiry in every due process challenge is whether the plaintiff has been deprived of a protected interest in \u2018property or \u2018liberty. \u201d <em>Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, </em>526 U.S. 40, 59,119 S.Ct. 977, 143 L.Ed.2d 130 (1999) (citing U.S. Const. amend. XIV; <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 332, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976)). To establish a substantive due process claim, plaintiffs must further demonstrate that the deprivation \u201cis so egregious, so outrageous, that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience.\u201d <em>Velez v. Levy, </em>401 F.3d 75, 93 (2d Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Cnty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, </em>523 U.S. 833, 847 n. 8, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">The District Court found that plaintiffs had failed to sufficiently establish actual deprivation of necessary medical care guaranteed under New York General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c, and further failed to demonstrate \u201cconscience-shocking behavior.\u201d <em>Mullen et al. v. City of Syracuse et al., </em>No. 5:10-cv-1110 (DNH), Dkt. 157 at 14-17, 22 (N.D.N.Y. Aug. 5, 2013); <em>Vassenelli v. City of Syracuse et al., </em>No. 5:10\u2014 cv-1422 (DNH), Dkt. 240 at 15-19, 27 (N.D.N.Y. Aug. 5, 2013). Upon an independent review of the record, we agree. In light of the failure to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to either procedural or substantive due process claims, summary judgment was properly granted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">We review the denial of a motion brought pursuant to Rule 59(e) or Rule 60(b) for \u201cabuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Schwartz v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>539 F.3d 135, 150 (2d Cir.2008); <em>Motorola Credit Corp. v. Uzan, </em>561 F.3d 123, 126 (2d Cir.2009); <em>see In re Sims, </em>534 F.3d 117, 132 (2d Cir.2008) (noting that a district court abuses its discretion if it \u201cbase[s] its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>erroneous assessment of the evidence, or render[s] a decision that cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions\u201d (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)). We apply the same \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard of review to a district court\u2019s discovery rulings, bearing in mind that a \u201cdistrict court has broad discretion to manage pre-trial discovery.\u201d <em>Wood v. FBI, </em>432 F.3d 78, 84 (2d Cir.2005). Where, as here, the district court has referred a non-dispositive matter to a magistrate judge for decision, the district court shall set aside the order only insofar as it \u201cis clearly erroneous or is contrary to law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiffs\u2019 post-judgment motions, which essentially attempted to relitigate issues already resolved. <em>See Shrader v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>70 F.3d 255, 257 (2d Cir.1995). Similarly, the District Court acted well within its discretion in denying as meritless plaintiffs\u2019 objections to Magistrate Judge Peebles\u2019s orders.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">We have considered all of the arguments raised by plaintiffs on appeal and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the District Court\u2019s judgments and orders of February 4, 2013, May 28, 2013, August 5, 2013 and November 6, 2013.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b88-6\">. We do, however, view with skepticism the District Court's conclusion that all non-municipal defendants, including self-employed nurse case manager Sharon Eriksson, engaged in \"state action\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1983. <em>Mullen et al. v. City of Syracuse et al., </em>No. 5:10-cv-l 110 (DNH), Dkt. 157 at 8-10 (N.D.N.Y. Aug. 5, 2013); <em>Vassenelli v. City of Syracuse et al., </em>No. 5:10-cv-1422 (DNH), Dkt. 240 at 9-12 (N.D.N.Y. Aug. 5, 2013). Nevertheless, since the presence (or absence) of state action is not outcome-determinative here, nor was it before the District Court, we need not reach the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b89-9\">. Because we affirm the District Court\u2019s finding that plaintiffs\u2019 objections were meritless, we need not reach the issue of whether they were timely filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
