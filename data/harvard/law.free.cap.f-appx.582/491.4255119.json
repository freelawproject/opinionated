The Government moves to dismiss Esparza\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction. For the following reasons, we grant the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-17\">In September 2010, Esparza pleaded guilty to and was convicted of indecency with a child, a second-degree felony under Texas law. The Department of Homeland Security commenced removal proceedings against him in September 2012 on the grounds that his conviction of an aggravated felony made him deportable. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). While Esparza\u2019s removal proceedings were pending, his son, who is a U.S. citizen, petitioned for him to be classified as an \u201cimmediate relative\u201d so that he would be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa. In January and February 2014, the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) held hearings on Esparza\u2019s application for adjustment of status and his claim for derivative citizenship through his U.S. citizen mother. The IJ found that Esparza\u2019s claim for derivative citizenship lacked merit, and she denied Esparza\u2019s application for adjustment of status as a matter of discretion. The IJ therefore ordered that Esparza be removed from the United States to Mexico. Esparza appealed only the denial of his application for adjustment of status. The Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirmed that denial and dismissed his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-22\">We are generally prohibited from reviewing a final order of removal against an alien who is removable because he committed an aggravated felony. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). We are also generally prohibited from reviewing the discretionary denial of a request for adjustment of status. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Chhetri v. Holder, </em>560 Fed.Appx. 396, 397 (5th Cir.2014). However, there is an exception to both prohibitions for petitions for review based on \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Esparza claims that his petition raises a legal issue suitable for appellate review because his petition argues that the IJ and BIA did not properly apply the law to the facts. As support for his argument that the law was misapplied, Esparza claims that both the IJ and the BIA ignored certain evidence of his rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Esparza does not raise a colorable legal argument. Both the IJ and BIA expressly considered evidence bearing on rehabilitation and concluded that that evidence did not support a favorable exercise of discretion. Esparza effectively brings a factual challenge to the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s conclusions based on the record. We lack jurisdiction to review that challenge. <em>See Solorzano-Moreno v. Mukasey, </em>296 Fed.Appx. 391, 394 (5th Cir.2008) (holding that claims were unreviewable because they \u201camount[ed] to an argument that the immigration judge \u2018abused her discretion in weighing the multiple desiderata made relevant by the BIA[ ])\u2019 \u201d (citing <em>Petrov v. Gonzales, </em>464 F.3d 800, 802 (7th Cir.2006) (brackets omitted)); <em>see also Al-Shahin v. Holder </em>354 Fed.Appx. 583, 584 (2d Cir. 2009) (holding that the immigration judge\u2019s finding of an absence of rehabilitation was unreviewable).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Esparza\u2019s petition for review is therefore DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b519-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
