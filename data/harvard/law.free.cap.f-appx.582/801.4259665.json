After review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">Because we write for the parties, we assume familiarity with the underlying facts of the case and recite only what is necessary to resolve this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">Mr. Dowbenko, a writer and artist, alleged that Google and/or its employees were responsible for publishing a copyright-protected photograph of himself and a defamatory article about him on the \u201cEncyclopedia of American Loons\u201d website, located at http://amerieanloons. blogspot.com. Whereas the article does not appear at all in search results from certain other search engines, Google purportedly used algorithms to manipulate its search results so that the article appears immediately below Mr. Dowbenko\u2019s own website in Google searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">Mr. Dowbenko asserted claims against Google, four of its executives, and several anonymous bloggers for defamation, false light invasion of privacy, copyright infringement, and violation of the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. They argued that \u00a7 230 of the Community Decency Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230, preempted Mr. Dowbenko\u2019s state law claims, and that the allegations that Google and its officers authored the defamatory content at issue did not pass muster under the plausibility standard set forth in <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007), and its progeny. They also argued that the copyright claim failed because Mr. Dowbenko failed to allege that he either registered or applied to register the photograph at issue, and that his RICO claim should be dismissed because he neither pled fraud with the requisite particularity, nor alleged a predicate act, violation of criminal laws, or racketeering activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-12\">The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. Because Mr. Dowbenko did not respond to the defendants\u2019 arguments concerning the copyright infringement and RICO claims, the district court dismissed those claims \u201cby default.\u201d It also dismissed his defamation and false light invasion of privacy claims, concluding that they were preempted by \u00a7 230 of the CDA as to Google and implausible as to the Google executives who were named as defendants. Mr. Dowbenko now. appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b831-14\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. <em>See Butler v. Sheriff of Palm Beach Cnty., </em>685 F.3d 1261, 1265 (11th Cir.2012). Although the complaint need not contain detailed factual allegations, the plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to make the claim \u201cplausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). \u201c[T]he tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions,\u201d and \u201c[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice\u201d to meet this standard. <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number><em>Pro se </em>pleadings are held to \u201cless stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972). Even so, a court may not \u201cserve as de facto counsel for a party\u201d or \u201crewrite an otherwise deficient pleading in order to sustain an action.\u201d <em>GJR Inv., Inc. v. Cnty. of Escambia, Fla., </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998), <em>overruled on other grounds by Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">We may affirm the district court on any ground supported by the record, \u201cregardless of whether that ground was relied upon or even considered by the district court.\u201d <em>Kernel Records Oy v. Mosley, </em>694 F.3d 1294, 1309 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">On appeal, Mr. Dowbenko contests the district court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 230 of the CDA preempts his defamation and false light invasion of privacy claims. He also argues that he adequately pled his copyright and RICO claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">Mr. Dowbenko contends that the district court erred when it concluded that \u00a7 230 of the CDA preempted his state law causes of action. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">As an initial matter, Mr. Dowbenko\u2019s false light invasion of privacy claim fails because Florida law does not recognize such a cause of action. <em>See Jews for Jesus, Inc. v. Rapp, </em>997 So.2d 1098, 1100 (Fla.2008). We therefore proceed to discuss the applicability of \u00a7 230 preemption to his defamation claim only.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-12\">Under the CDA, \u201c[n]o provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230(c)(1). The term \u201cinteractive computer service\u201d refers to \u201cany information service, system, or access software provider that provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a computer server[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 230(f)(2). The Act defines \u201cinformation content provider\u201d as \u201cany person or entity that is responsible, in whole or in part, for the creation or development of information provided through the internet or any other interactive computer service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 230(f)(3). The CDA also preempts any inconsistent state law causes of action, providing that \u201c[n]o cause of action may be brought and no liability may be imposed under any State or local law that is inconsistent with this section.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230(e)(3). <em>See Almeida v. Amazon.com, Inc., </em>456 F.3d 1316, 1321 (11th Cir.2006) (recognizing that \u201c[t]he majority of federal circuits have interpreted the CDA to establish broad federal immunity to any cause of action that would make service providers liable for information originating with a third-party user of the service\u201d) (punctuation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-13\">In keeping with the Act\u2019s plain language, the Florida Supreme Court has held that the CDA \u201cexpressly bars \u2018any actions\u2019 \u201d under Florida law that conflict with it. <em>See Doe v. America Online, Inc., </em>783 So.2d 1010, 1018 (Fla.2001). <em>See also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number><em>Giordano v. Romeo, </em>76 So.3d 1100, 1102 (Fla. 3d DCA 2011) (holding that operator of website that hosted defamatory statements \u201cenjoys complete immunity [under the CDA] from any action brought against it as a result of the postings of third party users of its website\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Mr. Dowbenko\u2019s defamation claim is preempted under \u00a7 230(c)(1). It is uncontested that Google is an interactive computer service provider, and the article in question indicates that it was authored and posted by an \u201cinformation content provider\u201d: two anonymous bloggers. Nor does the allegation that Google manipulated its search results to prominently feature the article at issue change this result. <em>See Zeran v. Am. Online, Inc., </em>129 F.3d 327, 330 (4th Cir.1997) (\u201c[Ljawsuits seeking to hold a service provider liable for its exercise of a publisher\u2019s traditional editorial functions \u2014 such as deciding whether to publish, withdraw, postpone or alter content \u2014 are barred.\u201d). The district court therefore properly dismissed Mr. Dowbenko\u2019s state law defamation claim. <em>See Doe, </em>783 So.2d at 1018; <em>Giordano, </em>76 So.3d at 1102.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Mr. Dowbenko also argues that he properly stated a copyright claim, asserting that the defendants were neither entitled to immunity under \u00a7 230(c)(1) nor could prevail on a fair use defense. Mr. Dowbenko misconstrues the defendants\u2019 arguments; rather than asserting \u00a7 230(c)(1) immunity or a fair use defense as to this particular cause of action, the defendants actually argue that Mr. Dowbenko cannot state a claim because he did not allege that he registered the copyright to the photograph in question in accordance with 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">Under \u00a7 411(a), subject to certain exceptions inapplicable here, \u201cno civil action for infringement of the copyright in any United States work shall be instituted until preregistration or registration of the copyright claim has been made[.]\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a). The Supreme Court recently clarified that, although \u00a7 411(a)\u2019s registration requirement is not jurisdictional, it nevertheless amounts to \u201ca precondition to filing a claim.\u201d <em>Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, </em>559 U.S. 154, 157, 130 S.Ct. 1237, 176 L.Ed.2d 18 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">Mr. Dowbenko failed to plead that he registered the copyright to the photograph appearing alongside the allegedly defamatory article at issue. The mere fact that a photograph of Mr. Dowbenko appeared on a third-party website does not, without more, mean that he has satisfied this \u201cprecondition to filing a [copyright infringement] claim.\u201d Reed <em>Elsevier, Inc., 559 </em>U.S. at 157, 130 S.Ct. 1237. Dismissal of Mr. Dowbenko\u2019s copyright infringement claim was therefore appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-11\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">Nor do we agree that dismissal of Mr. Dowbenko\u2019s RICO claim was improper. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c), it is \u201cunlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity!.]\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c). To state a RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege \u201c(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.\u201d <em>Williams v. Mohawk Indus., </em>465 F.3d 1277, 1282 (11th Cir.2006) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Because Mr. Dowbenko appears to hinge his RICO claim on a pattern of fraudulent activity, his \u201csubstantive RICO allegations must comply not only with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>plausibility criteria articulated in <em>Twombly </em>and <em>Iqbal </em>but also with Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b)\u2019s heightened pleading standard, which requires that \u2018[i]n alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.\u2019 \u201d <em>Am. Dental Ass\u2019n v. Cigna Corp., </em>605 F.3d 1283, 1291 (11th Cir.2010) (citing <em>Ambrosia Coal &amp; Constr. Co. v. Pages Morales, </em>482 F.3d 1309, 1316 (11th Cir. 2007)). To meet this heightened pleading standard, the substantive RICO allegations must include \u201c(1) the precise statements, documents, or misrepresentations made; (2) the time, place, and person responsible for the statement; (3) the content and manner in which these statements misled the Plaintiffs; and (4) what the defendants gained by the alleged fraud.\u201d <em>Brooks v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Fla., Inc., </em>116 F.3d 1364, 1380-81 (11th Cir.1997)</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Mr. Dowbenko\u2019s allegations fall short of satisfying these standards. As an initial matter, he has not alleged acts qualifying as \u201cracketeering activity\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1), and hence has failed to allege a pattern of racketeering activity. Moreover, even if common-law fraud did qualify as \u201cracketeering activity,\u201d beyond the bare assertion that the defendants have engaged in fraudulent activity as an enterprise over a number of years, the RICO claim includes no specifics of underlying fraudulent predicate acts on the part of the defendants, much less the heightened level of specificity required under Rule 9(b). <em>See Am. Dental Ass\u2019n, </em>605 F.3d at 1291. Mr. Dowbenko\u2019s RICO claim therefore fails.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Dowbenko\u2019s amended complaint is affirmed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b831-10\">. The anonymous bloggers were never properly served.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b832-10\">. We need not address the propriety of the district court\u2019s dismissal of the copyright infringement and RICO counts \"by default\u201d because we affirm the dismissal of these claims on other grounds. We also affirm the dismissal of these claims on the independent ground that Mr. Dowbenko did not respond to the defendants\u2019 arguments in favor of dismissing them below. <em>See Albra v. Advan, Inc., </em>490 F.3d 826, 828 n. 1 (11th Cir.2007) (declining to consider pro se plaintiff\u2019s argument in opposition to a motion to dismiss raised for the first time on appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b834-5\">. Since he has failed to state a claim, Mr. Dowbenko's request for discovery likewise lacks merit. <em>See Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678-79, 129 S.Ct. 1937 (\"Rule 8 ... does not unlock the doors of discovery for a plaintiff armed with nothing more than conclusions.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b834-6\">. Because he does not address the issue in his initial brief, Mr. Dowbenko has abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s conclusion that his claims against the individually-named Google executives should be dismissed as implausible. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (\"While we read briefs filed by pro se litigants liberally, issues not briefed on appeal by a pro se litigant are deemed abandoned.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
