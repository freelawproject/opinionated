Chew alleged that he was working as a butcher at TCCF and slipped and fell in the kitchen injuring himself. Chew filed a similar complaint in the Eastern District of California. This complaint was transferred to the Northern District of Mississippi, and the two cases were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-21\">The district court dismissed the consolidated complaints for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The district court found that Chew\u2019s suit was barred by the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel. Chew moved for leave to appeal in forma pauperis (IFP). The district court denied the motion and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith under 28 U.S.C 1915(a)(3) and Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 24(a)(3). Chew challenges the certification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry is \u201climited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">On appeal, Chew does not address the reason for dismissal but makes the conclusional argument that the district court was biased against him. Although pro se pleadings are afforded liberal construction, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). In view of Chew\u2019s complete failure of his argument to address the reasons for dismissal, he has abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s application of the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel to his current complaints. <em>See Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 613 (5th Cir.1999); <em>see also Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987). As he has abandoned the only possible issues for appeal, Chew\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and therefore frivolous. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20. Accordingly, the IFP motion is DENIED. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. Further, because the appeal does not involve legal points arguable on their merits, the appeal is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Chew\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is also DENIED. <em>See Schwander v. Blackburn, </em>750 F.2d 494, 502 (5th Cir. 1985)</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The district court\u2019s dismissal and the dismissal of this appeal count as two strikes against Chew. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir. 1996). Chew is cautioned that, should he accumulate three strikes, he will not be permitted to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">IFP DENIED; APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b571-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
