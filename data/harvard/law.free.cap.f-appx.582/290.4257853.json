On appeal, Velasquez-Contreras contends that the district court erred in considering a New York Certificate of Disposition to determine whether his 2012 attempted second-degree assault conviction constituted a crime of violence warranting a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). A Certificate of Disposition from New York is a judicial record under state law and contains sufficient indicia of reliability to be used as rebuttable evidence that a defendant was convicted under a specific statutory subsection. <em>United States v. Neri-Hernandes, </em>504 F.3d 587, 591-92 (5th Cir.2007). The Certificate of Disposition reflects that Velasquez-Contreras was convicted under N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 120.05(2) (McKinney 2012), which constitutes a crime of violence. <em>See id. </em>Velasquez-Contreras concedes that his arguments against the use of the Certificate of Disposition are foreclosed by <em>Neri-Hemandes, </em>but he seeks to preserve th\u00e9 issue for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-22\">The appellant\u2019s motion for summary disposition is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b318-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
