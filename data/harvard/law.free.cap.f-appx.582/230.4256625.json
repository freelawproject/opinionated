Tate seek to appeal the district court\u2019s order entered October 1, 2013, dismissing all claims as to one of the defendants in the underlying civil action. This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2012), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2012); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 545-46, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The order appellants seek to appeal is neither a final order nor an appeal-able interlocutory or collateral order.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-26\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b258-18\"> We note that, after the notice of appeal was filed, the district court entered orders dismissing claims against the remaining two defendants. Under the doctrine of cumulative finality, <em>see Equip. Fin. Grp., Inc. v. Traverse Computer Brokers, </em>973 F.2d 345, 347-48 (4th Cir. 1992), it is possible to cure the jurisdictional defect resulting from the appeal of a non-final order if the district court enters final judgment prior to this court\u2019s consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>ation of the appeal. However, because at least some claims against defendant Lifestore Bank are still pending in the district court, a final order has not yet been entered.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
