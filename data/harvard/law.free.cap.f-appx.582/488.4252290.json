Ortiz argues that, contrary to the BIA\u2019s decision, his conviction under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 38.02(b) as enhanced by subsection (d)(2) is not for a crime involving moral turpitude (CIMT) under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2) and thus does not bar his eligibility for cancellation of removal. He forgoes any challenge to the determinations that he was inadmissible and thus removable. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), (a)(6)(A)(i); <em>Sharma v. Holder, </em>729 F.3d 407, 411 n. 1 (5th Cir .2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Conviction of a CIMT under \u00a7 1182(a)(2) renders an alien ineligible for cancellation of removal. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(C). Texas Penal Code \u00a7 38.02 does not categorically describe offenses involving moral turpitude. <em>See Nino v. Holder, </em>690 F.3d 691, 694-95 (5th Cir.2012) (construing \u00a7 1229b and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)\u2019s deportability CIMT, which parallels the CIMT of \u00a7 1182(a)(2), the provision that governs if removal is for inadmissibility). Therefore, a modified categorical approach is used to determine whether Ortiz was convicted under a part of \u00a7 38.02 that describes a CIMT. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">The record reflects that Ortiz was convicted of the offense described in \u00a7 38.02(b) as enhanced by subsection (d). A person violates \u00a7 38.02(b) by intentionally giving a false or fictitious name, residential address, or birth date to someone he knows to be a peace officer, who has lawfully arrested or detained him or who has requested the information from a person believed to have witnessed a crime. <em>See </em>\u00a7 38.02(b); <em>Green v. State, </em>951 S.W.2d 3, 4 (Tex.Crim.App.1997). This offense involves dishonesty or lying and the Government, to obtain a conviction, must prove that the defendant acted with the intent to deceive. <em>See Omagah v. Ashcroft, </em>288 F.3d 254, 260 (5th Cir.2002). Therefore, Ortiz\u2019s offense of failure to identify while fugitive is a CIMT for immigration purposes. <em>See id. </em>We thus conclude that the BIA did not err in finding that the Texas conviction makes Ortiz ineligible for cancellation of removal under \u00a7 1229b(b)(l). Consequently, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b517-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
