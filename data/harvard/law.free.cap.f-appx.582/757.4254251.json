Assuming \u2014 without deciding \u2014 that Portillo-Vega was illegally arrested and that he has not waived his illegal-arrest claim by entering an unconditional guilty plea, his argument is foreclosed by Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit precedent. <em>I.N.S. v. Lopez-Mendoza, </em>468 U.S. 1032, 1039, 104 S.Ct. 3479, 82 L.Ed.2d 778 (1984) (\u201cThe \u2018body' or identity of a defendant or respondent in a criminal or civil proceeding is never itself suppressible as a fruit of an unlawful arrest, even if it is conceded that an unlawful arrest, search, or interrogation occurred.\"); <em>United States v. Guzman-Bruno, </em>27 F.3d 420, 421-22 (9th Cir.1994) (holding, within the context of a prosecution under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, that neither defendant\u2019s \u201cidentity nor the records of his previous convictions and deportations could be suppressed as a result of the illegal arrest\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Portillo-Vega attempts to distinguish these cases, and raise a separate basis for vacating his conviction, by claiming that the illegal arrest constituted outrageous government conduct. Because PortilloVega did not raise this argument before the district court, it is waived, <em>United States v. Robertson, 52 </em>F.3d 789, 791 (9th Cir.1994) (\u201cIssues not presented to the district court cannot generally be raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d), and none of the exceptions to waiver apply here. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Portillo-Vega also argues that the Sixth Amendment prohibited the district court from increasing Portillo-Vega\u2019s sentence based on his prior felony conviction, since the existence of the conviction was not a fact found by the jury. The Supreme Court rejected precisely this argument in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Portillo-Vega claims that subsequent cases have overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>but the Supreme Court has expressly declined to revisit its holding in that case. <em>See Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2160 n. 1, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013). <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>continues to bind us. Consequently, Portillo-Vega\u2019s Sixth Amendment argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b785-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
