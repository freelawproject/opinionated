R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b800-15\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-16\">Salvador Gonzalez-Chavez appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment and challenges the 168-month sentence imposed following his guilty-plea conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. We dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-22\">Gonzalez-Chavez argues that the district court erred by miscalculating his advisory Sentencing Guidelines range. He further argues that his counsel was constitutionally deficient in failing to object to the erroneous Guidelines calculation. The government argues that the appeal is barred by the appeal waiver in the parties\u2019 plea agreement. We review de novo whether a defendant has waived his right to appeal. <em>See United States v. Bibler, </em>495 F.3d 621, 623 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-23\">In the plea agreement, Gonzalez-Chavez waived his right to appeal \u201cthe procedures and calculations used to determine and impose any portion of the sentence ... [and] the term of imprisonment imposed by the Court....\u201d By its terms, the waiver bars Gonzalez-Chavez\u2019s claim of Guidelines error, and a defendant \u201cwaives the right to argue ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing on direct appeal when [he] waives the right to appeal the sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Nunez, </em>223 F.3d 956, 959 (9th Cir.2000). Contrary to Gonzalez-Chavez\u2019s contentions, no exception to the waiver applies here. <em>See Bibler, </em>495 F.3d at 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-24\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b800-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
