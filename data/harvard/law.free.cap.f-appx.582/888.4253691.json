United States, </em>No. 14-cv-0058, 2014 WL 2430786 (Fed.Cl. May 30, 2014) <em>(\u201cOrder\u201d). </em>Because the Claims Court did not err in dismissing Upshaw\u2019s complaint, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">On January 24, 2014, Upshaw filed a complaint against the United States in the Claims Court, in which he sought damages from the United States based on a January 2014 decision by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (\u201cBand\u201d) declining to enroll him as a member. <em>Order </em>at 1. The government moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. In response, Upshaw submitted documents showing the rejection in 1907 of an application by Georgeana Upshaw, in which Georgeana Upshaw requested a share of a fund appropriated by Congress for the Cherokee Indians. Upshaw asserted that he was a descendant of Georgeana Upshaw and that he had suffered injury by reason of the 1907 rejection. <em>Id. </em>The court granted the government\u2019s motion and dismissed Upshaw\u2019s complaint after concluding that his claims were beyond the jurisdiction of the Claims Court. <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">Upshaw appealed to this court. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">We review the Claims Court\u2019s decision to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Waltner v. United States, </em>679 F.3d 1329, 1332 (Fed.Cir.2012). A plaintiff bears the burden of establishing jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence, <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>303 F.3d 1357, 1359 (Fed.Cir.2002), and \u201cthe leniency afforded <em>pro se </em>litigants with respect to mere formalities does not relieve them of jurisdictional requirements,\u201d <em>Demes v. United States, 52 </em>Fed.Cl. 365, 368 (2002) (citing <em>Kelley v. Sec\u2019y, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>812 F.2d 1378, 1380 (Fed.Cir.1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-13\">Upshaw generally alleges that the Claims Court erred by failing \u201cto take into account power and authority.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Informal Br. 1. The government responds that Upshaw has provided no argument to establish how the Claims Court specifically erred and that the Claims Court correctly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over Upshaw\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-14\">We agree with the government that the Claims Court lacked jurisdiction. The Claims Court is a court of limited jurisdiction. <em>Brown v. United States, </em>105 F.3d 621, 623 (Fed.Cir.1997). The Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491, limits the jurisdiction of the Claims Court to claims for money damages against the United States based on sources of substantive law that \u201ccan fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal Government.\u201d <em>United States v. Navajo Nation, </em>556 U.S. 287, 290, 129 S.Ct. 1547, 173 L.Ed.2d 429 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-15\">Here, the Claims Court correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction over Upshaw\u2019s claims relating to his failure to enroll with the Band because the federal government has no statutory obligation to act in Cherokee enrollment issues. Moreover, to the extent that Upshaw specifically attempts to seek damages based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>1907 rejection of Georgeana Upshaw\u2019s application, even if the provision of the fund appropriated by Congress could be considered to be a money-mandating statute, we agree with the Claims Court\u2019s finding that the matter was time-barred by the six-year statute of limitations and thus beyond the jurisdiction of the Claims Court for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">We have considered Upshaw\u2019s remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Claims Court is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">No Costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
