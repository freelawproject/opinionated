On appeal, he argues that the district court abused its discretion when it excluded testimony about out-of-court statements made by Banks\u2019s younger brother, referred to in the proceedings as B.T. According to this testimony, B.T. had previously stated that a person other than Banks had shown B.T. how to access and view child pornography on Banks\u2019s computer. Banks argues that the district court should have admitted the testimony as a statement against penal interest under Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3), and that the district court erred in finding the statements were not inculpatory. After careful consideration, we affirm the district court because any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">We review the district court\u2019s rulings on admission of evidence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>708 F.3d 1256, 1275 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 342, 187 L.Ed.2d 238 (2013). However, \u201c[i]n a case involving non-constitutional evidentiary errors, we read these rules of evidence and criminal procedure along with the federal harmless-error statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111, which requires that \u2018the court shall give judgment after an examination of the record without regard to errors or defects which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d \u2019 <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1266 n. 20 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc). Errors only \u201caffect a substantial right of a party if they have a \u2018substantial influence\u2019 on the outcome of a case or leave \u2018grave doubt\u2019 as to whether they affected the outcome of a case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 764-65, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1248, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">Banks argues that the district court abused its discretion in excluding testimony about B.T.\u2019s statement that someone other than Banks showed him how to access child pornography on Banks\u2019s computer. But even if the district court did abuse its discretion by excluding B.T.\u2019s statement, that error would not leave us with \u201cgrave doubt\u201d about the outcome of the case. The evidence connecting Banks to the child pornography \u2014 especially the temporal proximity of access to child pornography on Banks\u2019s computer and activity in Banks\u2019s personal e-mail account, university student account, and Facebook and YouTube accounts, and the fact that access to child pornography never occurred when Banks was at work or school \u2014 was overwhelming. On top of that, the jury heard evidence that Banks admitted in an interview to FBI agents before trial that he had \u201cused [Limewire] to download and view child porn[ography].\u201d Finally, the district court did not exclude all of B.T.\u2019s testimony that Banks offered; it allowed testimony regarding other statements made by B.T. that <em>\u201che </em>viewed child pornography on the computers at his home.\u201d <em>See Frazier, </em>387 F.3d at 1266 n. 20 (finding that an evidentiary error was harmless because, among other things, \u201cthe district court did not exclude <em>all </em>of [the declarant\u2019s] testimony\u201d). In light of the foregoing, the district court\u2019s decision to exclude portions of B.T\u2019s statement did not have a substantial influence on the outcome of the case, and any district court error was harmless.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b882-10\">. Because we find any error to be harmless, we need not and do not address whether any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>error occurred: namely, whether the district court abused its discretion by excluding portions of B.T.'s statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
