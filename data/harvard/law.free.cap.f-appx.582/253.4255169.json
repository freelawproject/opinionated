On appeal, counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there are no meritorious issues for review but questioning whether the district court committed procedural sentencing error by declining to apply a seven-level downward adjustment to Latham\u2019s base offense level pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 2P1.1(b)(2) (2013). The Government has declined to file a response brief. Latham was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-22\">\u201cIn assessing a challenge to a sentencing court\u2019s application of the Guidelines, we review the court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Alvarado Perez, </em>609 F.3d 609, 612 (4th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). We will find a court\u2019s factual finding clearly erroneous \u201conly if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>734 F.3d 339, 342 (4th Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 1528, 188 L.Ed.2d 460 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-25\">The Guidelines permit courts to apply a seven-level downward reduction to the base offense level if the defendant \u201cescaped from non-secure custody and returned voluntarily within ninety-six hours.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2P1.1(b)(2). The Guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>define \u201cnon-secure custody\u201d to mean \u201ccustody with no significant physical restraint.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2P1.1 cmt. n. 1. Examples include, but are not limited to, leaving \u201ca work detail outside the security perimeter of an institution,\u201d failing to return from a furlough or pass, and \u201cescap[ing] from an institution with no physical perimeter barrier.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Our review of the record reveals no clear error in the district court\u2019s finding that the facility from which Latham escaped was not \u201cnon-secure custody,\u201d and no error in the court\u2019s decision not to apply the desired reduction on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Latham\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Latham, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Latham requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Latham.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
