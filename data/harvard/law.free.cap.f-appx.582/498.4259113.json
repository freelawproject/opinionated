He argues that the district court improperly participated in the plea negotiations and that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-17\">Ayala did not raise his claims below. Consequently, we review his claims for plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-22\">The district court did not engage in plea negotiations when it rejected Ayala\u2019s initial plea agreement; rather, it properly stated its reasons for rejecting the plea. <em>See United States v. Hemphill, </em>748 F.3d 666, 672-73 (5th Cir.2014). Because the district court did not interfere in plea negotiations or specify an acceptable plea agreement, it did not violate Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1). <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 488 (5th Cir .2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-23\">The record reflects that the district court properly considered the sentencing factors set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in imposing a sentence outside of the guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349-50 (5th Cir.2008). The district court explained that the sentence was necessary because Ayala was a danger to society due to his extensive criminal history, which was substantially underrepresented by the guidelines range. Thus, the district court\u2019s reasons for the sentence were fact-specific and consistent with the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-24\">The extent of the departure, while substantial, does not constitute error. This court has upheld variances of similar magnitude. <em>See United States v. Segura, </em>747 F.3d 323, 326-27 (5th Cir.2014); <em>Smith, </em>417 F.3d at 491-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-25\">Ayala has shown no error, plain or otherwise, by the district court. Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b526-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
