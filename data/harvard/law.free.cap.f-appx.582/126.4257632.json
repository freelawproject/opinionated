For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">As we write principally for the benefit of the parties, we recite only the essential facts and procedural history. Petrikonis worked for the Hospital as a phlebotomist from 1995 to 1996. After a seven-year absence from the healthcare industry, he returned to work at the Hospital as a part-time phlebotomist and enrolled in courses at Luzerne County Community College (\u201cLCCC\u201d) to obtain an Associate\u2019s Degree in nursing. To finance his education, Petrikonis received a $10,000 loan from the Hospital. As a condition of the loan, he was required to work full-time as a nurse for the Hospital for three years. The loan would thereafter be forgiven so long as he was not terminated for \u201cjust cause.\u201d App. 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Petrikonis graduated from LCCC in May 2009, and the Hospital granted his request to work on the orthopedic unit on floor 5E starting in July 2009. He was unable to commence work in July because he failed the nursing board exam. In October 2009, Petrikonis passed the nursing board exam, and Judy Ragukas, Clinical Director of 5E, reoffered him a position on 5E.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">In November 2009, at age forty-eight, Petrikonis began an eight- to twelve-week orientation program on 5E.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was initially paired with Pat Chivarella, an experienced nurse, who trained Petrikonis on the \u201cbasics of nursing\u201d and noticed that he \u201cmade a lot of mistakes.\u201d App. 185, 192. On one occasion, Petrikonis attempted to use an IV that had fallen into a trash can. Moreover, despite instruction, he repeatedly failed to properly or efficiently bathe patients or to clean up afterwards. He was also unable to use the Pyxis, a machine that dispensed medications, without assistance, despite Chivarella\u2019s repeated instructions. Petrikonis could not recall basic information about his patients and needed daily instruction on what to record on patient charts. Chivarella reported to Mary Beth Moss, her supervisor, that Petrikonis was not progressing and that she was uncomfortable entrusting him with more difficult tasks.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">After a few weeks, Petrikonis was assigned to a new nurse, Mary Carol Montagna. Montagna observed that Petrikonis was \u201cstruggling,\u201d App. 211, and \u201crequired constant direction and supervision,\u201d including step-by-step instruction for each task, from bathing patients and charting to timely distributing medications, App. 218. Like Chivarella, she too noted that Petrikonis was unable to learn \u201csimple\u201d tasks, such as how to retrieve medicines from the Pyxis, App. 214, needed a \u201cvery long time\u201d and assistance to bathe a patient, App. 211-212, and \u201cwasn\u2019t able to complete documentation,\u201d App. 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">On December 8, 2009, Petrikonis underwent a \u201cmed pass.\u201d A med pass assesses whether a nurse is capable of passing medications. Moss conducted Petrikonis\u2019s med pass and noted that he \u201c[njeeded constant direction\u201d and \u201cwas unable to proceed through one process of administering meds to a patient without checking each step with [her] first.\u201d App. 254. Moss said it took him an \u201cunacceptable\u201d length of time to remove medications from the Pyxis and he required thirty-five minutes to complete an IV priming procedure that \u201cshould have taken 5 minutes.\u201d App. 254. Moss was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>unable to \u201cestablish any confidence that [Petrikonis] could pass meds on a patient assignment in a timely fashion without constant supervision.\u201d App. 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">The next day, Petrikonis was given a second opportunity to complete the med pass. He again required \u201cconstant supervision or direction,\u201d needed assistance removing medications from the Pyxis, failed to record the result from a glucometer and then, when prompted to do so, indicated the incorrect number, could not identify a proper injection site, and required twenty minutes to complete an IV priming procedure. App. 255. In the end, Petrikonis was unable to complete the med pass \u201cin a timely fashion\u201d and another nurse had to administer approximately one-third of the medications. App. 255. Moss concluded that Petrikonis was \u201cnot building on any skill or procedure that was accomplished the previous day\u201d and \u201cshow[ed] no initiative to complete a task on his own.\u201d App. 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Moss shared her observations with Ragukas, who prepared an Improvement Action Plan (\u201cIAP\u201d) for Petrikonis. The IAP identified several of Petrikonis\u2019s deficiencies, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">1. Inability to obtain medications from [P]yxis machine or obtain missing medication for his patients within a reasonable timeframe and without direction</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">2. Inability to identify proper injection sites</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">3. Inability to complete documentation of ... assigned patients accurately, completely and within a reasonable timeframe</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-9\">4. Inability to independently prime and administer iv medications</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-10\">5. Inability to complete a reasonable assignment of 2 patients in a timely fashion [while] on week four of orientation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-14\">6. Has not yet taped report for the next shift</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-15\">7. Was unable to obtain verification of accucheck result from the accucheck machine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-16\">App. 258. The IAP included a plan to address each deficiency. Ragukas presented the IAP to Petrikonis on December 10 and informed him that she would reevaluate his performance on December 16 and that he would be terminated if his performance did not improve.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-17\">Petrikonis continued to make a number of mistakes, even after receiving the IAP. He failed to document patients\u2019 bowel movements, used incorrect markings on patient charts to indicate whether wounds were closed with sutures or staples, administered medications late by as much as three hours, incorrectly documented the time medications were actually administered, and \u201cwas still unable to complete an assignment without ... direction and supervision.\u201d App. 221. After reviewing his records,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ragukas decided on December 15<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to terminate Petrikonis and informed him of her decision on December 16. As a result, Petrikonis did not complete his three-year employment commitment or repay the education loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-18\">Petrikonis filed a Complaint in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, alleging that he was terminated based on his sex in violation of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1), and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (\u201cPHRA\u201d), 43 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 955(a), and his age in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(1), and the PHRA, 43 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 955(a). The Hospital filed a counterclaim for breach of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>contract based on his failure to repay the education loan. After discovery was completed, the Hospital filed a motion for summary judgment on all claims, which the District Court granted. Petrikonis appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">II<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Because Petrikonis has not provided direct evidence of discrimination, we analyze his claims arising under Title VII, the ADEA, and the PHRA under the burden-shifting analysis set forth in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>Burton v. Teleflex Inc., </em>707 F.3d 417, 425-26 (3d Cir.2013) (applying <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework to Title VII and ADEA claims); <em>Fairfield Twp. Volunteer Fire Co. No. 1 v. Commonwealth, </em>530 Pa. 441, 444, 609 A.2d 804 (Pa.1992) (applying <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework to PHRA claim). The parties do not dispute that Petrikonis made out a prima facie case of age and sex discrimination and the Hospital offered a legitimate non-discriminatory justification for his termination as required under the first two steps of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting analysis. We therefore focus on whether Petrikonis produced \u201cevidence from which a factfinder could reasonably infer that the employer\u2019s proffered justification,\u201d namely Petrikonis\u2019s deficient performance and lack of improvement, \u201cis merely a pretext for discrimination.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Burton, </em>707 F.3d at 426. To make a showing of pretext, Petrikonis \u201cmust point to some evidence ... from which a factfinder could reasonably either (1) disbelieve the employer\u2019s articulated legitimate reasons; or (2) believe that an invidious discriminatory reason was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause of the employer\u2019s action.\u201d <em>Fuentes v. Perskie, </em>32 F.3d 759, 764 (3d Cir.1994). If he challenges the \u201ccredibility of the employer\u2019s proffered justification,\u201d then he must produce evidence \u201cdemonstrating] such weaknesses, implausibilities, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Burton, </em>707 F.3d at 427 (internal quotations marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">Petrikonis does not contest that his performance was deficient in many respects.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He contends, however, that other nurses performed similarly but were not terminated. In particular, he points to the performance of a younger female trainee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>(\u201cTrainee\u201d). Trainee\u2019s deficiencies are detailed in a report prepared by Susan Heiser, an individual Petrikonis hired to review the records of other nurses on 5E. The report notes a number of instances in which Trainee failed to document stools, administered medications late, and failed to record whether she encouraged deep breathing or the use of an Incentive Spirometer on three occasions when a patient\u2019s oxygen levels fell to dangerously low levels. Unlike Petrikonis, Trainee was not placed on an IAP or terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Comparators may be used to discredit an employer\u2019s proffered reason for a termination by showing \u201cthat the employer treated other, similarly situated persons not of his protected class more favorably.\u201d Fuentes, 32 F.3d at 765. Petrikonis, however, has failed to show Trainee is similarly situated. First, Ragukas testified that she did not review the records of other trainees when she decided to terminate Petrikonis and there is no evidence that she was aware of the deficiencies in Trainee\u2019s performance. Thus, Petrikonis has not provided evidence from which the fact-finder could conclude that Ragukas knowingly treated him and Trainee differently. <em>See Morrow v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>152 F.3d 559, 563 (7th Cir.1998) (explaining that the \u201crelevant inquiry ... is whether [the employer\u2019s] management knew enough about [the comparator\u2019s] behavior to trigger an investigation\u201d). Second, Trainee\u2019s and Petrikonis\u2019s deficiencies are not of \u201ccomparable seriousness.\u201d <em>Lee v. Kan. City So. Ry. Co., </em>574 F.3d 253, 261 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). The undisputed facts show that Petrikonis was unable to perform \u201csimple\u201d tasks expected of nursing school graduates, such as bathing patients, and there is no evidence that Trainee shared these deficiencies. App. 214. Furthermore, Petrikonis failed to improve despite receiving repeated instructions, and there is no evidence that Trainee failed to improve after being instructed to correct her deficiencies. Therefore, Trainee is not similarly situated to Petrikonis, and thus her more favorable treatment does not show pretext.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">The timing of Petrikonis\u2019s termination also does not show pretext. Petrikonis was terminated after only five weeks of orientation and provided only a few days to address the concerns identified in his IAP. The evidence, however, demonstrates that Petrikonis\u2019s mistakes regarding \u201cbasic\u201d nursing duties continued during the IAP period. While the Hospital certainly could have given Petrikonis additional time to demonstrate improvement, the \u201cquestion is not whether the employer made the best, or even a sound, business decision; it is whether the real reason is discrimination.\u201d <em>Simpson v. Kay Jewelers, Div. of Sterling, Inc., </em>142 F.3d 639, 647 (3d Cir.1998). Given that Petrikonis\u2019s deficiencies concerned \u201cbasic\u201d nursing. duties and he showed no improvement, we cannot infer pretext from the timing of the Hospital\u2019s decision to terminate him.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Finally, with regard to the Hospital\u2019s breach of contract claim, Petrikonis concedes that he must repay the education loan he received from the Hospital unless his termination was without \u201cjust cause.\u201d App. 43, 98. Petrikonis relies solely on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>purported evidence of pretext to show that he was not terminated for \u201cjust cause.\u201d Because we have concluded that the record does not contain evidence that the Hospital\u2019s performance-based reasons for termination were pretextual, there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the Hospital had just cause and summary judgment as to the breach of contract claim was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-9\">. When Petrikonis began orientation, seventeen registered nurses worked on 5E. Seven were over age fifty, and one was male.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b156-11\">. Ragukas did not compare Petrikonis's records to those of other nurses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b156-19\">. Petrikonis did not work at the Hospital on December 12 or 13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b157-8\">. The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1343(a) and 1367. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, applying the same standard that the district court should have applied. <em>Klein v. Weidner, </em>729 F.3d 280, 283 (3d Cir.2013). Summary judgment is appropriate \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b157-9\">. Petrikonis claims that the Hospital\u2019s reason for terminating him shifted from charting errors to non-charting errors after he produced a report by Susan Heiser, who concluded that Petrikonis's \"documentation[ ] was equal to the standards set by the other ... [n]urses\u201d on 5E. App. 332. This contention, however, is unsupported. The record shows Petrikonis was deficient in areas unrelated to charting as demonstrated in the IAP and his inability to complete a med pass. All of this evidence predates Heiser's report and therefore undermines Petrikonis\u2019s contention that the Hospital changed its proffered reason for terminating him to hide a discriminatory motive. <em>See Siegel v. Alpha Wire Corp., </em>894 F.2d 50, 55 (3d Cir.1990) (shift in reason for termination is evidence of pretext where employer's proffered reasons for termination at time of termination and during litigation are inconsistent).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b157-14\">. Petrikonis admitted to a number of mistakes, including making errors on patient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>charts, failing to accurately complete them, failing to accurately assess patients' risk factors, and administering medications late.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b158-6\">. Petrikonis also contends that he need not rely exclusively on Trainee because Heiser\u2019s report concluded that Petrikonis's charting errors were akin to those regularly committed by'nurses on 5E. This argument focuses only on charting errors, however, and therefore fails to account for the many other deficiencies in Petrikonis\u2019s performance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b158-12\">. Petrikonis also contends that the District Court erred in failing to consider a training manual that contained ethnic and racial ster<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>eotypes pertaining to patients. Specifically, he argues that this demonstrates an \"institutional bias\u201d that encouraged Ragukas to base her termination decision on discriminatory factors. As there is no evidence that Ragukas created the training manual, reviewed it in making the decision to terminate Petrikonis, subscribed to the views contained within it, or was accused of discriminating against Petrikonis on the basis of his race or national origin, the training manual is not relevant to Petrikonis's discrimination claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
