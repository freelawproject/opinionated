Stark was convicted by a jury of wire fraud and securities fraud related to a scheme to defraud investors in his investment firm, Sardaukar Holdings. He has appealed his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The district court denied Stark\u2019s motion for a nonjury trial on the ground that the Government had not given its consent to a nonjury trial. <em>See </em>FED. R. CRIM. P. 23(a). Stark contends that the Government had no legitimate basis for withholding its consent. The Government is not required to articulate its reasons for withholding its consent, and this was not a case in which it would have been appropriate for the district court to override the Government\u2019s refusal to give its consent. <em>See Singer v. United States, </em>380 U.S. 24, 36-38, 85 S.Ct. 783, 13 L.Ed.2d 630 (1965). No abuse of discretion has been shown. <em>See id. </em>at 34, 85 S.Ct. 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Stark contends that the evidence of his guilt was insufficient. To establish that Stark committed wire fraud, the Government had to prove that he engaged in \u201ca scheme or artifice to defraud\u201d and that he used \u201cwire communications in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme.\u201d <em>United States v. Stephens, </em>571 F.3d 401, 404 (5th Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Stark does not contend that evidence of his use of wire communications was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">Many of the investments in Sardaukar were generated by third-party aggregators. Contrary to Stark\u2019s assertions, \u201cthe government [was] not required to prove that any misrepresentations were made directly to the victim[s].\u201d <em>United States v. Bernegger, </em>661 F.3d 232, 240 (5th Cir. 2011). Nor was it required to prove that Stark intended that some harm result from his deceit, as it was sufficient for the Government to show that Stark intended to bring about a financial gain to himself. <em>See United States v. Judd, </em>889 F.2d 1410, 1414 (5th Cir.1989). A reasonable juror could have found that the Government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Stark had engaged in a scheme or artifice to defraud. <em>See United States v. Vargas-Ocampo, </em>747 F.3d 299, 301 (5th Cir.2014) (en banc), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(June 24, 2014) (No. 13-10737).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-14\">Additionally, the Government proved that Stack was involved in the offer or sale of securities falling within the scope of the securities fraud statute. The joint venture agreements and subscription agreements between Sardaukar and its investors constituted \u201cinvestment contracts\u201d and were thus \u201csecurities\u201d under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77b(a)(1). <em>See S.E.C. v. W.J. Howey Co., </em>328 U.S. 293, 298-99, 66 S.Ct. 1100, 90 L.Ed. 1244 (1946). Contrary to Stark\u2019s assertions, the lack of a written agreement between one group of investors and Sardaukar did not prevent him from being convicted of securities fraud with respect to sums invested by those investors. <em>See id. </em>The evidence introduced to prove that Stark committed securities fraud was sufficient. <em>See Vargas-Ocampo, </em>747 F.3d at 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-15\">The district court did not err in denying Stark\u2019s motion for a new trial. Stark asserts that a new trial should have been granted because Sardaukar\u2019s receiver testified falsely as part of the Government\u2019s case. After reviewing the record, we conclude that the receiver\u2019s inaccurate testimony with respect to a relatively minor matter could not have had a significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>effect on the outcome of the trial. <em>See United States v. O\u2019Keefe, </em>128 F.3d 885, 893-94 (5th Cir.1997). No abuse of discretion has been shown. <em>See United States v. Piazza, </em>647 F.3d 559, 564-65 &amp; n. 3 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Stark contends that the district court erred in overruling his objection to the probation officer\u2019s finding that the offense involved at least 250 victims and in increasing his guidelines offense level by six levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(C). There was an ample evidentiary basis supporting the district court\u2019s finding. <em>See United States v. Valencia, </em>44 F.3d 269, 274 (5th Cir.1995). The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b491-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
