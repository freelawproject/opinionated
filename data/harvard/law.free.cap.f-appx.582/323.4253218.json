Because Lowe did not utilize available administrative remedies, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Lowe was born in San Antonio, Texas, and is a United States citizen. In December 2011, he submitted a Form SS-5 (Application for a Social Security Card) to the SSA, requesting a change in his citizenship status from \u201cU.S. Citizen\u201d to \u201cLegal Alien Allowed to Work.\u201d At some point thereafter, the SSA issued an interim decision denying his request. That decision explains that (1) the SSA could not approve Lowe\u2019s request until he contacted and obtained a ruling on his citizenship status from the United States Citizen and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d), and (2) at that point, Lowe could resubmit his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-13\">In spite of acknowledging receipt of the decision, Lowe did not contact USCIS or appeal the decision. Instead, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>he sued the Commissioner of the SSA under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702, and the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a. Lowe claimed that in spite of being a \u201cpolitical citizen of the nation of the United States,\u201d he remains \u201celigible to elect a Form SS-5 Block 5 civil status of \u2018Legal Alien Allowed to Work\u2019 without being a person of foreign nationality.\u201d Accordingly, he requested the court to order the Commissioner to update the agency\u2019s information to reflect his requested status of \u201cLegal Alien Allowed to Work.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In response, the Commissioner moved to dismiss and, in the alternative, for summary judgment, contending that Lowe had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. The district court agreed and dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-15\">If a statute requires a plaintiff to exhaust administrative remedies, his failure to do so deprives this court of subject-matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201c[I]n the absence of a statutory requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies, the jurisprudential doctrine of exhaustion controls.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>127 F.3d at 475. If a statute does not require exhaustion, but the jurisprudential doctrine of exhaustion applies, unexhausted claims will fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>hi.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Under the Privacy Act, an agency must provide a requesting party with access to certain records.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Act also requires agencies \u201cto establish procedures for reviewing a request from an individual concerning the amendment of any record or information pertaining to the individual, for making a determination on the request, [and] for an appeal within the agency of an initial adverse agency determination.... \u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(f)(4). The SSA has promulgated regulations, implementing the Privacy Act, which detail the process by which an individual can (a) correct records maintained by it<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (b) appeal the agency\u2019s determination of whether a record will be corrected. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 401.65. Those regulations observe that \u201c[disagreements with these determinations are to be resolved through the SSA appeal process.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Although we have held that \u201c[t]he Privacy Act contains no express statutory requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies,\u201d under the jurisprudential exhaustion doctrine, as a general matter, a litigant must still exhaust available administrative remedies. <em>Taylor, </em>127 F.3d at 476. That doctrine \u201cis a long settled rule of judicial administration which mandates that no one is entitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened injury until the prescribed administrative remedy has been exhausted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-12\">Lowe does not dispute that (1) further SSA appeals were available to him and (2) he did not pursue a ruling from the USCIS or further SSA appeals before suing. Instead, he advances two reasons why we should entertain his claim on the merits: (1) He claims that he never received the initial decision from the SSA and therefore had nothing to appeal. And (2) he believes his appeal falls within the exception to judicial exhaustion outlined in <em>Patsy v. Florida International University, </em>634 F.2d 900 (5th Cir. Jan.1981) (en banc), <em>rev\u2019d and remanded on other grounds sub nom. Patsy v. Board of Regents, </em>457 U.S. 496, 102 S.Ct. 2557, 73 L.Ed.2d 172 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-13\">As to Lowe\u2019s first contention, the district court found that the SSA did in fact send him its interim decision before he sued.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To demonstrate error, Lowe only points to the fact that the interim decision was not dated. That fact \u2014 which Lowe pointed out to the district court \u2014 does not demonstrate that the court clearly erred in its finding. Lowe\u2019s unsupported assertion does not excuse his failure to exhaust administrative remedies available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-14\">As to his second contention, \u201c[w]hile courts have discretion in applying the jurisprudential exhaustion requirement, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>exercise of that discretion is circumscribed in that a court should only excuse a claimant\u2019s failure to exhaust administrative remedies <em>in extraordinary circum</em>stances.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>127 F.3d at 477 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). We fully agree with the district court that Lowe \u201chas not shown \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 were present here to excuse the SSA\u2019s exhaustion requirements.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">' The judgment of dismissal is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b352-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
