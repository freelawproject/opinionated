Brennan, denying her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d); and (2) denied her motion to remand. <em>In re Yanzhen Liu, </em>No. A088 380 301 (B.I.A. Feb. 8, 2012), <em>aff'g </em>No. A088 380 301 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 2, 2010). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-19\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well established. <em>See Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009); <em>see also Jian Hui Shoo v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 168-69 (2d Cir.2008); <em>Li Yong Cao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>421 F.3d 149, 156-57 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-20\">Liu applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief based on her claim that she fears persecution because she has had more than one child in violation of China\u2019s population control program. For largely the same reasons as this Court set forth in <em>Jian Hui Shoo, </em>546 F.3d 138, we find no error in the agency\u2019s determination that Liu failed to demonstrate her eligibility for relief. <em>See id. </em>at 158-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>As to Liu\u2019s motion to remand, we find no error in the BIA\u2019s determination that she failed to demonstrate her <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for relief based on her conversion to Christianity. <em>See Li Yong Cao, </em>421 F.3d at 156. The evidence Liu submitted did not demonstrate that Chinese authorities are aware of, or likely to become aware of, her religious practice. <em>See Hongsheng Leng v. Mukasey, </em>528 F.3d 135, 143 (2d Cir.2008); <em>see also Jian Hui Shoo, </em>546 F.3d at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">For the foregoing reasons, this petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
