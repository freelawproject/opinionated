His counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and a motion to withdraw. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-23\">The district court did not err in applying a 4-level enhancement for possessing the firearms in connection with another felony offense, as the record showed that the firearms facilitated or had the potential to facilitate Adney\u2019s commission of the felony offense of harassment in the first degree. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) &amp; comment. (n.14); <em>United States v. Betts, </em>509 F.3d 441, 445 (8th Cir.2007) (de novo review of district court\u2019s application of Guidelines, and clear-error review of its factual findings); Iowa Code \u00a7\u00a7 708.7.2, 903.1.2 (harassment in first degree; 0-2 year prison sentence). The district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the government\u2019s motion for an upward departure, as Adney\u2019s 15 unscored adult convictions\u2014 many of which involved violence or threats thereof \u2014 provided an adequate basis for departure, and the court stated adequate reasons for the extent of the departure. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>573 F.3d 600, 605-06 (8th Cir.2009) (standard of review; district court may take into account evidence of obvious incorrigibility and may conclude that past leniency has not been effective); <em>United States v. Walking Eagle, </em>553 F.3d 654, 657-58 (8th Cir.2009) (finding no error in upward departure, as defendant\u2019s multiple unscored convictions for assaults, threats, and assaulting officer indicated that he was dangerous to others and had strong likelihood of recidivism). Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Adney at the top of his amended Guidelines range, as the court provided a detailed explanation of its sentence, emphasizing Adney\u2019s violent and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>abusive history, and the dangerous, potentially fatal circumstances of this offense. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>578 F.3d at 605, 607 (standard of review); <em>United States v. Feemster, </em>572 F.3d 455, 464 (8th Cir.2009) (en banc) (substantive review is narrow and deferential to sentencing court).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">An independent review of the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), reveals no nonfrivolous issues for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b695-20\">. The Honorable Linda R. Reade, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
