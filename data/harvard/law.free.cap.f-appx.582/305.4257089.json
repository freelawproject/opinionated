He contends that his sentence violates due process because it was enhanced under \u00a7 1326(b)(2) based on. a prior conviction that was not charged in the indictment. Limon-Pacias acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 </em>U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but raises the issue to preserve it for further review. He contends that the Supreme Court is likely to revisit its decision, which has been cast into doubt by <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014 n. 1, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2160 n. 1, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">In <em>Almendarez-Toms, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u00a7 1326(b)(2)\u2019s enhancement provision was a sentencing factor and not a separate criminal offense which must be alleged in the indictment and submitted to a jury to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. at 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219. Although the Supreme Court has expressed some doubt as to whether <em>Almendarez-Toms </em>was correctly decided, it has declined to revisit that decision. <em>See Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2160 n. 1; <em>Apprendi </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Because <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding precedent, Limon-Pacias\u2019s argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Wallace, </em>No. 12-51192, 759 F.3d 486, 2014 WL 3558003, at 9-10 (5th Cir. July 18, 2014); <em>United States v.
