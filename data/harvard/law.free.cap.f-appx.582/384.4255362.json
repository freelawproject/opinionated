The two insurers are called Ace American and Acadia. Both insurers filed motions for summary judgment arguing that their respective insurance policies did not cover the Coward family\u2019s claims. The district court granted both motions. The district court also denied HCSD\u2019s motion for leave to amend its pleading to include a counterclaim against Acadia for a breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-16\">As explained below, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of Ace American\u2019s motion for summary judgment. By contrast, we reverse the district court\u2019s grant of Acadia\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Finally, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of HCSD\u2019s motion for leave to amend because its proposed counterclaim against Acadia would have been futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-18\">The Coward family\u2019s daughter, M.L.C., is confined to a wheelchair and lacks control over her arms. The Coward family alleges that while incapacitated, M.L.C. was injured between 2008 and 2009 by a schoolteacher, Louise Miley Johnston, who was employed by HCSD. According to the Coward family, Johnston dropped M.L.C. out of her wheelchair on at least one occa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>sion. Based on this incident and a number of other acts allegedly committed by Johnston, the Coward family brought claims against HCSD under Mississippi tort law and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The Coward family\u2019s lawsuit is still pending before the district court. In the present appeal, HCSD argues that two insurers, Ace American and Acadia, are obliged to defend and indemnify HCSD as to the Coward family\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The first insurer, Ace American, insured HCSD under Scholastic Advantage Educators Legal Liability Policy No. EON G23640806001 (\u201cAce American Policy\u201d). This insurance policy sets forth a number of exclusions, one of which states that \u201cthe Insurer shall not be liable for Damages or Claims Expenses on account of any Claim ... alleging, based upon, arising out of or attributable to any ... Bodily Injury, other than Mental Distress arising out of a Wrongful Employment Practice.\u201d In its order of June 13, 2013, the district court concluded that although the Coward family\u2019s claims for bodily injury did include claims for \u201cMental Distress,\u201d such claims did not \u201caris[e] out of a Wrongful Employment Practice.\u201d The district court therefore reasoned that the Ace American Policy did not cover the allegations in the Coward family\u2019s lawsuit and Ace American had no duty to defend HCSD under Mississippi law.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The second insurer, Acadia, insured HCSD during the relevant time under Commercial General Liability Policies CNA 4235393-11 and CNA 4235393-12 (\u201cAcadia Policy\u201d), the relevant provisions of which are identical. In its order of March 29, 2013, the district court concluded that the Coward family\u2019s claims fell outside the scope of the Acadia Policy for three reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">First, the Acadia Policy provides that any covered \u201cbodily injury\u201d must be the consequence of an \u201coccurrence,\u201d which the policy further defines as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u201d As the district court explained, discovery had produced \u201cno evidence\u201d that M.L.C.\u2019s drop from the wheelchair was accidental, rather than the result of an intentional act by Johnston.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Second, the Acadia Policy also excludes from coverage any \u201cexpected or intended\u201d injury and any injury arising from \u201cabuse or molestation.\u201d According to the district court, however, the Coward family alleged \u201ca pattern of <em>abuse, </em>which is intentional conduct.\u201d The Coward family\u2019s claims were therefore excluded from coverage under these provisions of the Acadia Policy as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">Third, the district court found that the Coward family was unable to prove any \u201cbodily injury\u201d that would be covered by the policy. As the district court acknowledged, \u201cthe plaintiffs certainly alleged in their complaint that M.L.C. had suffered a variety of bodily injuries.... \u201d The record, however, contained \u201cno evidence about treatment by doctors for physical injuries or any physical limitations M.L.C. will suffer from the alleged abuse.... Any physical injuries she suffered must be inferred from the fact that she fell to the ground, and even then they appear to be <em>de minimis.\u201d </em>Accordingly, the district court concluded that Acadia was entitled to summary judgment based on the absence of evidence regarding M.L.C.\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">HCSD appealed the district court\u2019s orders granting summary judgment in favor of Ace American and Acadia. We consolidated HCSD\u2019s two appeals and consider each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-12\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s order granting or denying summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>ment de novo, applying the same standards as the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Summary judgment is proper under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure if the \u201cmaterials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations\u201d and other materials do not establish a \u201cgenuine dispute as to any material fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">We look to state law for rules governing contract interpretation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under Mississippi law, an insurance policy is subject to the general rules of contract interpretation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In Mississippi, construction of an insurance policy presents a question of law, which we review de novo.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The duty of an insurance provider to defend its insured depends upon the language of the policy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018The traditional test\u2019 for whether an insurer has a duty to defend under the policy language \u2018is that the obligation of a liability insurer is to be determined by the allegations of the complaint or declaration\u2019 \u201d in the underlying action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the factual allegations in an underlying complaint state a claim that is within or arguably within the scope of coverage provided by a policy, then the insurance provider is obligated to defend the insured.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Additionally, as held by the Supreme Court of Mississippi in <em>Automobile Insurance Co. of Hartford v. Lipscomb, </em>75 So.3d 557, 559 (Miss.2011), \u201cthe insurer must provide a defense until it appears that the facts upon which liability is predicated fall outside the policy\u2019s coverage.\u201d In Mississippi, therefore, an insurer is relieved of its duty to defend where \u201cno genuine issue of material fact\u201d remains as to coverage based on the \u201clanguage of the policy, the complaint, and the relevant deposition testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-15\">\u201c \u2018[T]he duty to defend is broader than the insurer\u2019s duty to indemnify under its policy of insurance: the insurer has a duty to defend when there is any basis for potential liability under the policy.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But \u201c[ujnlike the duty to defend, which can be determined at the beginning of the lawsuit, an insurer\u2019s duty to indemnify generally cannot be ascertained until the completion of litigation, when liability is established, if at all.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cThis is because, unlike the duty to defend, which turns on the pleadings and the policy, the duty to indemnify turns on the actual facts giving rise to liability in the underlying suit, and whether any damages caused by the insured and later prov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>en at trial are covered by the policy.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AsR\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">We affirm the district court\u2019s order of June 13, 2013, for essentially the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s opinion. Reading the Ace American Policy as a whole, the only claims for bodily injury covered under the Ace American Policy are claims for mental distress experienced by an employee or applicant for employment due to the actions of the employer. Because M.L.C. is not HCSD\u2019s employee, her injuries do not arise from a \u201cWrongful Employment Practice\u201d under the Ace American Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The Ace American Policy excludes coverage for bodily injury \u201cother than Mental Distress arising out of a Wrongful Employment Practice.\u201d The insurance policy further explains that a \u201cWrongful Employment Practice\u201d must be predicated on one of thirteen injurious activities. Nearly all of the thirteen injurious activities can logically arise only out of the employment relationship: \u201cwrongful dismissal,\u201d \u201cemployment-related misrepresentation,\u201d \u201cwrongful deprivation of a career opportunity,\u201d \u201cwrongful demotion,\u201d \u201cfailure to employ or promote,\u201d \u201cemployment-related libel,\u201d \u201cdefamatory statements in connection with an Employee reference,\u201d and \u201cfailure to grant tenure.\u201d Other items on this list are identified using more general terms, such as \u201cdiscrimination\u201d and \u201cretaliation,\u201d but even these terms are elsewhere defined in the policy to include only injuries to employees or applicants for employment. \u201cDiscrimination,\u201d for example, is defined specifically to include only \u201cactual or alleged violation of employment discrimination laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">In arguing that the Coward family has alleged a claim based on a \u201cwrongful employment practice\u201d under the Ace American Policy, HCSD has focused on only a single injurious activity from the list of thirteen: \u201cnegligent evaluation.\u201d According to HCSD, the Coward family has alleged that HCSD negligently gave the schoolteacher, Johnston, positive performance evaluations. These negligently positive evaluations thereby enabled her to remain in the classroom where she could cause mental distress to students.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">We reject HCSD\u2019s argument. In Mississippi, the interpretive principle of <em>ejusdem generis </em>applies both to contractual interpretation as well as to statutory construction.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> According to this principle, general words listed among an enumeration of specific words \u201care construed to embrace only those objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the ... specific words.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The fact that nearly all of the items on the Ace American Policy\u2019s list of wrongful employment practices could only logically be injurious to an employee suggests that \u201cnegligent evaluation\u201d should be construed in this way as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-14\">This conclusion is supported by the Ace American Policy when it is read \u201cas a whole,\u201d as required under Mississippi law.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Ace American Policy defines damages \u201carising out of a Wrongful Employment Practice\u201d to include \u201cfront pay and back pay,\u201d as well as \u201cliquidated dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>ages awarded pursuant to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 or the Equal Pay Act of 1983,\u201d but not \u201cemployment-related benefits, retirement benefits, perquisites, vacation and sick days ... provided, however, this limitation does not include salary, wages, bonuses, commissions and non-deferred cash incentive compensation....\u201d These detailed provisions, which are only relevant in the context of an employment relationship, suggest that the term \u201cWrongful Employment Practice\u201d was not intended to encompass injuries arising from the teacher-student relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Finally, this interpretation finds further confirmation in the blanket exclusion for all bodily injury other than mental distress. Young students such as M.L.C., after all, are obviously more likely to experience a bodily injury than a deprivation of back-pay or retirement benefits. It is evident, therefore, that young students were not contemplated as potential victims of \u201cnegligent evaluation\u201d or any other wrongful employment practice under the Ace American Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">For these reasons, the district court was correct to conclude that the Coward family\u2019s lawsuit is not covered by the Ace American Policy and, therefore, that Ace American has no duty to defend HCSD.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment on June 13, 2013, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">We reverse the district court\u2019s order of March 29, 2013, with respect to Acadia\u2019s duties to defend and indemnify. As explained above, the parties dispute primarily whether Johnston\u2019s alleged conduct constitutes an \u201coccurrence\u201d that falls within the terms of the Acadia Policy. In the leading cases, <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Moulton, </em>464 So.2d 507, 510 (Miss.1985), and <em>U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v. Omnibank, </em>812 So.2d 196, 198-200 (Miss. 2002), the Supreme Court of Mississippi held that insurance for injury caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d is triggered only by \u201caccidental\u201d conduct. As explained in <em>Omnibank, </em>812 So.2d at 201, \u201ca claim resulting from intentional conduct which causes foreseeable harm is not covered [by the term, \u2018occurrence\u2019], even where the actual injury or damages are greater than expected or intended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">We therefore begin our consideration of Acadia\u2019s duty to defend based on whether Johnston\u2019s alleged conduct was accidental or intentional. As demonstrated in <em>Lipscomb, </em>75 So.3d at 559-61, the Mississippi courts\u2019 analysis of the duty to defend may take into account materials in the record outside the complaint and the insurance policy. In that case, the Supreme Court of Mississippi looked to the \u201clanguage of the policy, the complaint, and the relevant deposition testimony\u201d to determine whether the insurer possessed a duty to defend the insured against a lawsuit arising from a fire in an apartment building.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In particular, the insurance policy in <em>Lipscomb, </em>75 So.3d at 559-61, excluded injuries \u201c[a]rising out of or in connection with a business engaged in by any insured,\u201d as well as injuries \u201c[a]rising out of the rental or holding for rental of any premises\u201d that were not found specifically at \u201can insured location.\u201d As the Supreme Court of Mississippi explained, the insured\u2019s own deposition testimony revealed affirmatively that the insured \u201cwas operating a business,\u201d that the insured\u2019s \u201csource of income at the time of the fire was his rental properties,\u201d and that the apartment building was not an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>insured rental property.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Accordingly, because \u201cno genuine issue of material fact\u201d existed regarding the applicability of the insurance policy\u2019s exclusions, the Supreme Court of Mississippi held that the insurer had no duty to defend Lipscomb against the underlying claims.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Here, by contrast, a genuine issue of material fact does exist with respect to the applicability of the exclusions in the Acadia Policy. In particular, the Coward family alleged that Johnston dropped M.L.C. out of her wheelchair and onto the ground. This allegation is supported by the written statement of Larina Mason, a physical therapist who worked with Johnston\u2019s students. Although Mason\u2019s statement is ambiguous, we are obliged to construe the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in the non-movant\u2019s favor at the summary judgment stage.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In conducting our present analysis, therefore, we must draw the reasonable inference based on Mason\u2019s written statement that M.L.C.\u2019s fall from the wheelchair was unintended and accidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Mason\u2019s written statement contains a number of criticisms regarding Johnston\u2019s attitude of disrespect toward Mason, the other therapists, Johnston\u2019s own teaching assistants, and the students. Only the first paragraph, however, is actually relevant to the incident where M.L.C. was dropped from her wheelchair:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-10\">On 9/08/2008 an incident occurred when I asked for assistance to get [M.L.C.] out of her wheelchair and onto a mat on the floor. While I had my back turned putting on gloves, I heard a thud. When I turned around [M.L.C.] was lying on the floor on the mat. Kourtney (assistant in classroom) had transferred her without any help. She commented, \u201cShe\u2019s alright. I\u2019m not going to hurt my back bending over.\u201d I did not <em>see </em>her drop [M.L.C.] on the mat, but by her response and the look on Ms. Johnston\u2019s face and the look on [M.L.C.\u2019s] face, I know she didn\u2019t transfer her appropriately.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">This paragraph is ambiguous, and the parties have parsed it very differently. According to Acadia, this paragraph means that \u201cKourtney\u2019s act of dropping M.L.C. ... was not an accident, but was intentionally done by Kourtney to keep her from hurting her own back.\u201d According to HCSD, Mason\u2019s statement is \u201ccouched in terms of negligence,\u201d which \u201csupports Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation\u201d that the wheelchair incident was \u201caccidental and/or negligent.\u201d It is also evidently the Coward family\u2019s understanding, based on their complaint in the underlying lawsuit, that it was not HCSD\u2019s assistant teacher, Kourtney, but rather \u201cMs. Johnston\u201d who \u201cdropped M.L.C.\u201d on this occasion.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Fairly read, this ambiguous paragraph would support any of these proposed interpretations. In particular, because Mason\u2019s written statement describes an incident involving three female individuals, it is difficult to tell for certain who is being described by each use of the pronouns, \u201cshe\u201d and \u201cher.\u201d Kourtney may have dropped M.L.C. to avoid hurting her (Kourtney\u2019s) own back and then told Mason that she (M.L.C.) was \u201calright\u201d (meaning uninjured). Or Kourtney may have been describing Johnston as \u201calright\u201d (meaning blameless), because her (Johnston\u2019s) help wasn\u2019t actually required to transfer M.L.C. from the wheelchair. Or Johnston might have been the \u201cshe\u201d who commented that Kourtney was \u201calright\u201d (meaning capable of performing the task by herself), which was why Johnston left Kourtney to perform the transfer \u201cwithout any help\u201d rather than hurting her (Johnston\u2019s) own back.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In other words, the written statement is ambiguous. Where the evidence is \u201cat least ambiguous\u201d with respect to a material issue of fact, as we stated in <em>Carroll v. Metropolitan Ins. &amp; Annuity Co., </em>166 F.3d 802, 807 (5th Cir.1999), summary judgment must be denied. Here, \u201c[g]iven the ambiguities in the record, the parties\u2019 conflicting versions of the facts, and the competing factual inferences arising from this muddle, the only thing clear is that the appellee could not properly obtain summary judgment on this point.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Although Mason\u2019s written statement is difficult to follow, it does support the reasonable inference that M.L.C. fell from the wheelchair because of accidental conduct by either Johnston or Kourtney. Accordingly, Acadia is not relieved of its duty to defend HCSD based on the term, \u201coccurrence,\u201d in the Acadia Policy or the exclusion for \u201cintended\u201d injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Mason\u2019s statement also prevents summary judgment based on the Acadia Policy\u2019s exclusion for \u201cabuse or molestation.\u201d All of the Mississippi decisions cited by the parties have applied \u201cabuse or molestation\u201d exclusions either to sexual conduct<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>or to plainly intentional conduct.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Accordingly, if M.L.C. were dropped from her wheelchair accidentally and unintentionally, this would not necessarily be excluded as \u201cabuse\u201d under the Acadia policy. Because \u201cthe insurer has a duty to defend when there is any basis for potential liability under the policy\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> under Mississippi law, the duty to defend is therefore triggered in this case.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Conversely, the fact that the Coward family has explicitly alleged that Johnston subjected M.L.C. to a pattern of \u201cabuse\u201d does not relieve Acadia of the duty to defend. Most critically, under Mississippi law, \u201c[i]n comparing the complaints with the policy terms, we look not to the particular legal theories pursued by the state complainants, but to the allegedly tortious conduct underlying their suits.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Accordingly, even if the Coward family were to characterize a non-abusive act as \u201cabuse,\u201d the Coward family\u2019s characterization would not be dispositive of Acadia\u2019s duty to defend under Mississippi law. Moreover, the Coward family\u2019s complaint does not necessarily include the wheelchair incident within Johnston\u2019s alleged pattern of abuse. Apart from the wheelchair incident, the Coward family has also alleged that Johnston committed numerous other injurious acts.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The complaint also repeatedly attributes M.L.C.\u2019s injuries to \u201cnegligent and grossly negligent acts or omissions.\u201d Construing the complaint in favor of the nonmovant, HCSD, it is therefore reasonable to conclude that Johnston allegedly committed both a pattern of abusive acts and at least a single non-abusive act when M.L.C. was dropped from her wheelchair.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">Additionally, the district court erred by granting summary judgment based on the absence of any \u201cevidence about treatment by doctors for physical injuries or any physical limitations M.L.C. will suffer from the alleged abuse.\u201d The present case is not an inst\u00e1nce such as <em>Lipscomb, </em>75 So.3d at 559-61, in which deposition testimony affirmatively demonstrated that coverage was excluded under the \u201crental property\u201d exclusion contained in the applicable insurance policy. Nor is this an instance such as <em>State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co. v. LogistiCare Solutions, LLC, </em>751 F.3d 684, 692-93 (5th Cir.2014), where the written interrogatories likewise affirmatively demonstrated that the insured received payment for the use of a vehicle and thus fell within the applicable insurance policy\u2019s \u201cfor a charge\u201d exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">Here, the district court consulted the record not with respect to an affirmative demonstration that coverage was excluded, but with respect to the absence of evidence. Such an analysis of the duty to defend apparently has no basis in any Mississippi case law. Indeed, such an analysis of the duty to defend would be fundamen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>tally unfair to the insured. It is, after all, not the insured who is obliged to bring forward evidence of the plaintiffs injury, but the plaintiff. Even if the Coward family has not yet produced evidence of physical injury, they may yet be able to do so during the ongoing proceedings before the district court. As for the complaint itself, as the district court acknowledged, \u201cthe plaintiffs certainly alleged in their complaint that M.L.C. had suffered a variety of bodily injuries.\u201d Accordingly, the district court should not have concluded that Acadia was entitled to summary judgment based on the absence of evidence regarding bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Finally, with respect to the duty to indemnify, our decision in <em>Barden Mississippi Gaming LLC v. Great Northern Ins. Co., 576 </em>F.3d 235, 239-40 (5th Cir.2009), explained that the duty to indemnify usually should not be evaluated \u201cuntil the resolution of [the underlying claimant\u2019s] lawsuit.\u201d Similarly, as we explained in <em>Essex Ins. Co. v. Greenville Convalescent Home Inc., </em>236 Fed.Appx. 49, 52 (5th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Green v. Aetna Ins. Co., </em>349 F.2d 919, 923-26 (5th Cir.1965)), \u201c[a]ny associated legal questions regarding coverage will be informed by the results of the trial, and the resolution of these questions should also await its conclusion.\u201d Given the particular ambiguity surrounding the key piece of evidence in this case \u2014 Mason\u2019s written statement \u2014 the usual rule regarding the duty to indemnify should be applied here. As compared with speculation about what the Coward family will or will not be able to demonstrate, or what Mason\u2019s ambiguous written statement might have meant, the evidence actually produced at trial will provide a firmer basis on which to judge whether Acadia must indemnify HCSD under the Acadia Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-14\">Turning to HCSD\u2019s counterclaim, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying HCSD leave to amend its pleading under Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Such leave should not be granted if the proponent of the amendment fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-15\">Invoking the duty of good faith and fair dealing, HCSD argues that Acadia had an obligation to provide \u201cindemnity settlement authority\u201d for the purposes of a mediation on June 20, 2012, to HCSD\u2019s <em>Moeller </em>counsel, who represents the interests of the insured under <em>Moeller v. American Guarantee and Liability Insurance Co., </em>707 So.2d 1062 (Miss.1996). In HCSD\u2019s view, its attorney should have been authorized to settle the Coward family\u2019s claims not only on behalf of HCSD, but also on behalf of Acadia.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-16\">HCSD cites no authority, however, that would support this argument. Indeed, as is illustrated by <em>Twin City Fire Insurance Co. v. City of Madison, MS., </em>309 F.3d 901 (5th Cir.2002), the insured\u2019s decision to settle and the insurer\u2019s decision to settle are ordinarily two independent decisions in Mississippi.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The bad faith alleged in that case involved the insurer\u2019s improper use of privileged information regarding the insured, which had been obtained by the insurer through the insured\u2019s <em>Moeller </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>counsel in order to \u201cdevelop [the insurer\u2019s] position of non-coverage.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> There is no similar allegation in the present case. There is no suggestion that HCSD\u2019s <em>Moeller </em>counsel improperly transmitted any of HCSD\u2019s confidential information to Acadia to help Acadia prepare its case.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Indeed, the duty that HCSD proposes would appear to create a conflict of interest. Under Mississippi law, the <em>Moeller </em>counsel is required to act in the interests of the insured. But HCSD\u2019s theory would vest <em>Moeller </em>counsel with authority to make binding decisions on behalf of the insurer, whose interests \u2014 as the Supreme Court of Mississippi recognized in <em>Moeller, </em>707 So.2d at 1070 \u2014 may be adverse to the interests of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">We therefore decline HCSD\u2019s invitation to recognize any duty for the insurer to authorize <em>Moeller </em>counsel to settle claims on the insurer\u2019s behalf. Accordingly, given the absence of legal authority supporting HCSD\u2019s proposed counterclaim, the district court acted within its discretion when it rejected HCSD\u2019s request for leave to amend.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">For the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of Ace American\u2019s motion for summary judgment and REVERSE the district court\u2019s grant of Acadia\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We therefore REMAND for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. We also AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of HCSD\u2019s motion for leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">AFFIRMED in part, and REVERSED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b413-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

It is worth acknowledging that the Coward family's complaint does not mention Kourtney, but rather attributes responsibility for dropping M.L.C. solely to Johnston. Given the ambiguities in Mason\u2019s written statement, however, we think that the Coward family\u2019s complaint could hypothetically withstand summary judgment even based on its allegation regarding Johnston. Whatever the most elegant reading of Mason\u2019s written statement might be, it is at least a reasonable inference that Mason was referring to Johnston rather than Kourtney when she wrote, \"I know she didn\u2019t transfer her appropriately\u201d after M.L.C. was transferred \"without any help.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AqBc\">In any event, we are not faced at present with a motion for summary judgment against the Coward family. In this appeal, we are evaluating only Acadia\u2019s duty to defend, and Acadia has never once argued that coverage is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>excluded because Johnston, rather than Kourtney, was the HCSD employee identified in the Coward family\u2019s complaint. <em>See </em>Acadia Br. 44. The reason is clear enough: Kourtney was also an employee of HCSD. As provided under <em>Lipscomb, </em>75 So.3d at 559, the Mississippi courts' analysis of the duty to defend takes into account not just the allegations in the complaint, but also \"the true facts\u201d of which \"an insurer becomes aware\u201d through \"independent investigation.\u201d If Kourtney, rather than Johnston, was revealed by Acadia\u2019s investigation to be responsible for dropping M.L.C., then HCSD is potentially liable under the same agency theory invoked by the Coward family as to Johnston. At least as described in Mason's written statement, both Johnston and Kourtney were apparently acting within the scope of their employment as HCSD\u2019s teacher and assistant teacher when they transferred (or failed to transfer) M.L.C. from her wheelchair. <em>Estate of Brown By &amp; Through Brown v.

Co. v. Omnibank, </em>812 So.2d 196, 201 (Miss.2002). The majority finds the requisite allegation of accidental conduct in the Amended Complaint\u2019s assertion that Johnston \u201cdropped M.L.C.\u201d But the majority completely omits the context in which the purported drop is claimed. The relevant paragraph of the complaint states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-13\">In or about the spring of 2008, and for the period of around one year, Louise Miley Johnston, a teacher at Gary Road Intermediate School, engaged in <em>abusive behavior and other conduct </em>including, but not limited to, <em>physical and emotional abuse </em>of M.L.C. <em>For example, </em>Ms. Johnston sprayed M.L.C. in the face with a can of Aerosol spray and dropped M.L.C. She also called M.L.C. a \u2018bitch,\u2019 threw a ball at M.L.C. hitting her in the face.... Ms. Johnston also grabbed M.L.C.\u2019s face and told her, T hate you, you make me sick.\u2019 ... The <em>foregoing examples of abuse </em>by Ms. Johnston against M.L.C. are not exhaustive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-14\">Am. Compl. \u00b6 9 (emphases added). The Cowards\u2019 pled Johnston\u2019s drop as an <em>ex</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number><em>ample of abuse </em>along with other clearly intentional conduct. Read in context, the Amended Complaint does not allege an accidental drop but claims, as the district court found, that the drop was another act in a sequence of intentionally abusive behavior. <em>See Farmland Mut. Ins. Co. v. Scruggs, </em>886 So.2d 714, 719 (Miss.2004) (no duty to defend where \u201c[fjrom the face of [plaintiffs] complaint, only intentional torts are alleged\u201d and where \u201c[defendants\u2019] pattern of conduct has been one of intentional acts.\u201d). Under the majority\u2019s decision, a defendant faced with factual allegations of intentional misconduct can simply suggest that the actions could have instead been the product of negligence and thus trigger an insurer\u2019s duty to defend. This now-permissible reinterpretation of a plaintiffs allegations, even if contrary to the language of the complaint, effectively supersedes Mississippi law that an occurrence cannot result from intentional conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The single reference to Johnston\u2019s negligence (as opposed to Hinds County\u2019s own negligence in failing to identify and prevent Johnston\u2019s intentional behavior) in the Amended Complaint appears in Paragraph 13: \u201cUpon information and belief, officials of the school and school district were aware of the negligence and physical and emotional abuse to which M.L.C. was subjected at the hands of Johnston.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This conclusory use of the word \u201cnegligence\u201d does not transform the character of the factual allegations of intentional conduct against Johnston into allegations of accidental conduct constituting an \u201coccurrence.\u201d \u201cNegligence\u201d is not a factual allegation, but a legal conclusion that cannot itself bring a complaint within the scope of an insurance policy\u2019s coverage. See <em>E. E.O.C. v. S. Pub. Co., </em>894 F.2d 785, 790-91 (5th Cir.1990) (\u201cUnder Mississippi\u2019s \u2018allegations of the complaint\u2019 rule if <em>the factual </em>allegations of the complaint bring the action within coverage of the policy, the insurer has a duty to defend.\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Emp\u2019rs Reinsurance Corp. v. Martin, Gordon &amp; Jones, Inc., </em>767 F. Supp. 1355, 1359-60 (S.D.Miss.1991) (\u201c[I]t is the facts alleged, not the pleader\u2019s legal conclusions, that are relevant to the insurer\u2019s duty to defend.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">But even if we ignore the fact that the Amended Complaint alleges only intentional abuse, the \u201cnegligent\u201d drop would still not bring the complaint within the terms of the Acadia Policy. The Mississippi Supreme Court permits courts to look to evidence outside of the complaint to determine an insurer\u2019s coverage obligations. <em>See Auto. Ins. Co. of Hartford v. Lipscomb, </em>75 So.3d 557, 560 (Miss.2011). The drop referred to in the Amended Complaint was described by Larina Mason, another employee of the school district:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Avh\">On 9/08/2008 an incident occurred when I asked for assistance to get [M.L.C.] out of her wheelchair and onto a mat on the floor. While I had my back turned putting on gloves, I heard a thud. When I turned around [M.L.C.] was lying on the floor on the mat. <em>Kourtney (assistant in classroom) had transferred her without any help. She commented, </em>\u201cShe\u2019s alright. I\u2019m not going to hurt my back bending over.\u201d I did not see <em>her </em>drop [M.L.C.] on the mat, but by <em>her </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>response and the look on Ms. Johnston\u2019s face and the look on [M.L.CJs face, I know she didn\u2019t transfer her appropriately.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Statement of Larina Mason \u00b6 1 (emphases added). The majority concludes that Mason\u2019s statement is \u201cambiguous\u201d and engages in a tortured reading of the paragraph to cast uncertainty as to whom the pronouns \u201cher\u201d and \u201cshe\u201d refer. This is unconvincing because Mason\u2019s statement clearly explains that Kourtney \u2014 not Johnston \u2014 transferred M.L.C.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The next sentence states that \u201cshe\u201d \u2014 Kourtney, the subject of the preceding sentence \u2014 declared that she would not \u201churt [her] backing bending over.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mason then states that she \u201cdid not see her drop [M.L.C.] on the mat, but by her response and the look on Ms. Johnston\u2019s face ... I know she didn\u2019t transfer her appropriately.\u201d Again, Mason\u2019s use of a pronoun refers to Kourtney. Kourtney is not only the subject of the previous sentence, but is identified as the sole transferor of M.L.C., and thus the only person to whom Mason could be referring when she states that she did not \u201csee her\u201d drop M.L.C. Because Johnston is identified by name in the sentence, the majority\u2019s contention that Johnston could also be the \u201cher\u201d that Mason describes as having dropped M.L.C. is simply untenable. Replacing Johnston\u2019s name with the pronoun \u201cher\u201d would read this way: \u201cI did not see [Johnston] drop M.L.C. on the mat, but by [Johnston\u2019s] response, and the look on Ms. Johnston\u2019s face ... I know she didn\u2019t transfer her appropriately.\u201d Mason\u2019s use of the pronoun \u201cher\u201d clearly refers to Kourtney \u2014 the person whom Mason describes as dropping M.L.C. \u2014 not Johnston, who witnessed the action and, from Mason\u2019s description, presumably displayed some sort of shock indicating that Kourtney improperly transferred M.L.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">The majority, in a footnote, concludes that even if it was Kourtney and not Johnston who dropped M.L.C., the Acadia Policy would still be triggered because \u201cHCSD is potentially liable under the same agency theory invoked by the Coward family as to Johnston.\u201d Where a plaintiff is seeking to hold an employer liable for the conduct of an employee, it is the employee\u2019s conduct that determines whether there has been an \u201coccurrence\u201d triggering coverage of the liability insurer. <em>See Am. Guarantee &amp; Liab. Ins. Co. v. 1906 Co., </em>129 F.3d 802, 810 (5th Cir.1997) (\u201c[T]he \u2018ultimate question\u2019 for coverage purposes is whether the employee\u2019s intentional misconduct itself falls within the definition of an occurrence.\u201d). Thus, it is the conduct of Johnston, not HCSD, which determines whether there has been a \u201cbodily injury\u201d caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d triggering Acadia\u2019s coverage obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">But the Cowards do not allege that HCSD is liable for any <em>negligent </em>conduct by Johnston under a theory of respondeat superior. The Cowards allege claims of: (1) conspiracy; (2) breach of fiduciary duty; (3) intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress; (4) negligence; (5) negligent supervision, assignment, hiring, and retention; (6) negligent misrepresen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>tation; (7) and deprivation of constitutional rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Every claim is predicated on Johnston\u2019s <em>intentional </em>abuse of M.L.C. The Cowards\u2019 negligence claim asserts that HCSD and individual defendant officials of the school breached their duty of care to M.L.C.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">by negligently failing to act as reasonable and prudent teachers and school administrators ... Specifically, Kourtney Parnell failed to timely report Johnston\u2019s <em>mental and physical abuse </em>of M.L.C., thereby causing a delay in appropriate response to the wrongful conduct. Once the conduct was reported to defendants, they failed to take appropriate action to protect the rights of Plaintiffs under the laws of Mississippi and the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Am. Compl. \u00b6 44 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Neither Kourtney Parnell nor any other non-administrative employee is named as a defendant in the lawsuit. The Cowards seek to impute the \u201cnegligence of the teachers, administrative employees and agents of [HCSD]\u201d to the school district under the doctrine of respondeat superior. Am. Compl. \u00b6 47. But, contrary to the majority\u2019s contention, the Cowards do not claim that HCSD is vicariously liable for an unintentional tort \u2014 such as a negligent drop \u2014 committed by Johnston (most likely because, as discussed above, none is alleged). The negligence claim asserted in the Amended Complaint is that HCSD is responsible for its teachers\u2019 and administrators\u2019 failure to report Johnston\u2019s <em>intentional abuse </em>and for failing to stop the abuse once they were aware of it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Neither committing intentional abuse, nor failing to report such abuse, is an \u201caccident\u201d constituting an occurrence under the policy-</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">The only other language in the Amended Complaint that could possibly give rise to the majority\u2019s reading of a general \u201cagency theory\u201d asserting HCSD\u2019s liability for an accidental act by Johnston is the reference to respondeat superior in the Cowards\u2019 breach of fiduciary duty claim. This paragraph alleges that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAY\">[t]he <em>abuses and assaults </em>in this case arose from Ms. Johnston\u2019s exercise of authority, power, and access created by her position and employment as a teacher for the Defendants. Plaintiffs thus plead vicarious liability under the doctrine of respondeat superior and/or ratification in that the Defendants <em>knew or should have known of the dangerous propensities of Ms. Johnston </em>and could foresee Ms. Johnston\u2019s actions as arising from the duties of Ms. Johnston as a teacher of the Defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-11\"><em>Id. </em>\u00b6 35 (emphases added). Again, it is clear that the \u201cagency theory\u201d asserted here is that HCSD is liable for its administrators\u2019 failure to prevent Johnston\u2019s intentional conduct. All of the Cowards\u2019 claims are premised on HCSD\u2019s failure to uncover, warn, and stop Johnston\u2019s intentional abuse of M.L.C. The Cowards simply do not claim that HCSD is liable for any unintentional torts of Johnston and thus there is no support for the majority\u2019s position that Kourtney Parnell\u2019s \u201caccidental\u201d drop of M.L.C. could bring the Cowards\u2019 action within the scope of Acadia\u2019s coverage. <em>See Scruggs, </em>886 So.2d at 719 (\u201cA liability insurance company has an absolute duty to defend a complaint which contains allegations covered by the language of the policy, but it has absolutely no duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>to defend those claims which fall outside the coverage of the policy.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Because the Amended Complaint does not allege accidental conduct by Johnston constituting an \u201coccurrence\u201d and all of the Cowards\u2019 claims are premised on Johnston\u2019s intentional abuse of M.L.C., I would affirm the district court\u2019s ruling that Acadia has no duty to defend HCSD.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Because the Cowards\u2019 causes of action against Hinds County do not premise liability on accidental conduct of Johnston that could trigger coverage under the Acadia Policy, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Acadia\u2019s claim that it has no duty to indemnify HCSD should also be affirmed. It is true that the \u201cduty to indemnify generally cannot be ascertained until the completion of litigation, when liability is established, if at all.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. LogistiCare Solutions, LLC, </em>751 F.3d 684, 692 (5th Cir.2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). This is because the duty \u201cturns on the actual facts giving rise to liability in the underlying suit, and whether any damages caused by the insured and later proven at trial are covered by the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). But as any liability on the part of HCSD must necessarily be premised on the intentional abuse inflicted by Johnston as alleged in the Amended Complaint, there is no set of facts that could bring HCSD\u2019s liability within the Acadia Policy\u2019s coverage. Accordingly, I would also affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment that Acadia has no duty to indemnify HCSD.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-6\">. The Cowards' initial complaint did not allege any negligent conduct at all, but stated that the action was for the \"abuse, battery and infliction of emotional distress against M.L.C.,\u201d and consistently referred to Johnston's actions as \"abuse and battery.\u201d It was only after Acadia (and Ace American) refused to provide a defense or indemnify Hinds County that the Cowards filed an Amended Complaint describing Johnston\u2019s conduct as negligent. But the Amended Complaint did not contain new <em>factual </em>allegations, it merely included the word \"negligence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b424-5\">. The majority also states that the Cowards understood that Johnston, not Kourtney, dropped M.L.C. This is incorrect. In their response to Acadia\u2019s interrogatory concerning the drop, the Cowards stated: \"We do not know whether the incident where M.L.C. was dropped was intentional or not. The only information we have on the incident is ... the statement of Larina Mason on April 2, 2009.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b424-10\">. While it is unclear whether Kourtney meant that she had dropped M.L.C. because she did not want to hurt her back, or whether she meant that she was not going to pick her up off the mat because doing so would hurt her back, it is clear that Kourtney is the speaker.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b425-8\">. Likewise, the Cowards' negligent supervision and hiring claim alleges that defendants \"negligently failed to warn Plaintiffs, their family, or any of the pupils\u2019 parents of Ms. Johnston's <em>dangerous propensities </em>despite knowledge of these propensities.\u201d Am. Compl. \u00b6 49 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b426-7\">.
