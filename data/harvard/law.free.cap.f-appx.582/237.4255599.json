On appeal, Haines claims that the district court erred in admitting evidence of his prior narcotics distribution under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) and improperly enhanced his offense level under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(12) (2012). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-20\">Evidence of prior bad acts may be admitted as proof of \u201cmotive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident\u201d but \u201cnot ... to prove a person\u2019s character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with [his] character.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 404(b); <em>see United States v. Wilson, </em>624 F.3d 640, 651 (4th Cir.2010). \u201cTo be admissible under Rule 404(b), evidence must be (1) relevant to an issue other than character; (2) necessary; and (3) reliable.\u201d <em>United States v. Siegel, </em>536 F.3d 306, 317 (4th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). Potential Rule 404(b) evidence should be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by its unfair prejudice to the defendant. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>617 F.3d 286, 296-97 (4th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-21\">Here, there was an adequate connection between Haines\u2019 June 2012 narcotics distribution, which supported his present convictions, and the challenged Rule 404(b) evidence \u2014 namely Haines\u2019 participation in several controlled buys in early 2010. <em>See id. </em>Those earlier controlled buys involved Haines facilitating the sale of substantially the same varieties of drugs to the same confidential informants in the same geographic area as his instant offenses. Thus, the 2010 controlled buys were relevant. <em>See United States v. Branch, </em>537 F.3d 328, 341-42 (4th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Hodge, </em>354 F.3d 305, 312 (4th Cir.2004) (reaching same result under analogous facts).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-22\">The evidence of the 2010 controlled buys was also necessary to the Government\u2019s case. Because Haines squarely placed his knowledge and intent at issue, evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>his repeated, analogous drug transactions was instrumental to the Government\u2019s case. <em>See United States v. McBride, </em>676 F.3d 385, 398 (4th Cir.2012). Finally, the prejudice to Haines resulting from the admission of the Rule 404(b) evidence did not substantially outweigh its probative value. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the challenged evidence. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>740 F.3d 308, 314 (4th Cir.2014) (stating standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Next, Haines claims that the district court\u2019s application of USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(12) constituted impermissible double counting in light of his conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856. We review this claim for plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 134-36, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009) (discussing standard). We conclude that the district court did not err \u2014 plainly or otherwise \u2014 because the Guidelines do not proscribe applying \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(12) where a defendant is convicted under <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. <em>see United States v. Hampton, </em>628 F.3d 654, 664 (4th Cir.2010) (\u201c[TJhere is a presumption that double counting is proper where not expressly prohibited by the guidelines.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Finally, Haines contends that the district court clearly erred in finding that narcotics distribution was a primary purpose for which he maintained his residence. <em>See United States v. Manigan, </em>592 F.3d 621, 626 (4th Cir.2010) (stating standard of review). However, \u201c[m]anufacturing or distributing a controlled substance need not be the sole purpose for which the premises was maintained, but must be one of the defendant\u2019s primary or principal uses for the premises.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 17. We conclude that the evidence before the district court was clearly sufficient to support its application of \u00a7 2D1.1 (b)(12) despite the fact that Haines had lived in his home his entire life. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>698 F.3d 699, 706-07 (8th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal conclusions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
