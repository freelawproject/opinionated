The district court sentenced Burnett to a total of 200 months of imprisonment followed by five years of supervised release. Following his release, Burnett admitted violating the terms of his supervised release, and the district court revoked Burnett\u2019s supervised release and sentenced him to eleven months of imprisonment. During the revocation hearing, the court expressed concern that Burnett would not receive adequate long-term drug treatment outside of prison and relied on Burnett\u2019s need for medical care in explaining its sentence. Burnett has appealed, arguing that the sentence imposed upon him is procedurally unreasonable because the district court improperly considered his need for drug treatment while incarcerated. We hold that although the district court erred in considering Burnett\u2019s rehabilitative needs, the error did not affect Bur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>nett\u2019s substantive rights. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">We review a sentence imposed as a result of a supervised release violation to determine whether the sentence was plainly unreasonable, generally following the procedural and substantive considerations employed in reviewing original sentences. <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437 (4th Cir.2006). Moreover, although a district court must consider the policy statements in Chapter Seven of the Sentencing Guidelines along with the statutory requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583 (2012) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2012), \u201cthe court ultimately has broad discretion to revoke its previous sentence and impose a term of imprisonment up to the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 439 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\u201c[18 U.S.C.] Section 3582(a) [(2012)] precludes sentencing courts from imposing or lengthening a prison term to promote an offender\u2019s rehabilitation.\u201d <em>Tapia v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2382, 2391, 180 L.Ed.2d 357 (2011); <em>see also United States v. Bennett, </em>698 F.3d 194, 197-98 (4th Cir.2012) (court may not consider need for rehabilitation in imposing revocation sentence), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 1506, 185 L.Ed.2d 559 (2013). Here, <em>Burnett </em>\u201cdid not object at the revocation hearing on the grounds asserted here,\u201d and we therefore review this issue for plain error. <em>Bennett, </em>698 F.3d at 199. To establish plain error, Burnett must demonstrate that (1) the district court erred, (2) the error was plain, and (3) the error affected his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 200 (citing <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). Even if all three prongs are met, we have discretion to deny relief, particularly when doing so \u201cwould not \u2018result in a miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>627 F.3d 941, 954 (4th Cir.2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">In <em>Bennett, </em>we held that it is procedural error to consider rehabilitative needs in sentencing a defendant to a term of imprisonment at a revocation hearing. <em>Bennett, </em>698 F.3d at 200. The district court in that case erred by improperly considering the defendant\u2019s needs for intensive substance abuse treatment. <em>Id. </em>Despite the error, we affirmed Bennett\u2019s sentence because the procedural error did not affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights \u201cby influencing the outcome of the sentencing proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Other factors, such as Bennett\u2019s criminal acts while under supervised release, \u201cprovided independent justification for the sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">We have thoroughly reviewed the record and conclude that in the case at hand the district court committed procedural error by considering Burnett\u2019s need for drug treatment in determining his sentence. We nonetheless affirm because the error did not affect Burnett\u2019s substantial rights. As in <em>Bennett, </em>consideration of Burnett\u2019s rehabilitative needs \u201cconstituted only a minor fragment of the court\u2019s reasoning.\u201d <em>Bennett, </em>698 F.3d at 201. The district court properly relied on other factors, like the need to promote respect for the law and provide just punishment, in sentencing Burnett to eleven months\u2019 incarceration. Affirming Burnett\u2019s sentence would therefore not affect his substantial rights, nor would it result in a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-13\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We also deny Burnett\u2019s motion to file a pro se reply brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
