California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir. 2011). Boehm-McCauley has filed a response and a supplemental response. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s briefs and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Boehm-McCauley\u2019s responses. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">Any substantive challenge to the district court\u2019s failure to orally pronounce a special condition of supervised release is barred by the valid appeal waiver in this case, and we discern no clerical error. <em>See United States v. Higgins, </em>739 F.3d 733 (5th Cir. 2014); <em>see also United States v. Slanina, </em>359 F.3d 356, 357-58 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">Counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b493-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
