Although Sanchez Ramirez attempts to phrase his arguments in legal and constitutional terms, he is, in essence, seeking review of the discretionary denial of \u00a7 212(c) relief. The discretionary denial of relief under \u00a7 212(c) does not present a question of law or a constitutional claim over which this court has jurisdiction. <em>Delgado-Reynua v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 596, 599-600 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Marquez-Marquez v. Gonzales, </em>455 F.3d 548, 560-61 (5th Cir.2006). Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review Sanchez Ramirez\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s decision dismissing his appeal of the IJ\u2019s denial of his application for \u00a7 212(c) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-20\">The petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b490-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
