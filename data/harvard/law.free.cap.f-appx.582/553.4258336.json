After he stood convicted but before sentencing, Deem, who was represented by the Federal Public Defender, moved pro se to withdraw his guilty plea and to proceed pro se. Following a hearing, the district court denied Deem\u2019s motions and sentenced him above the advisory guidelines sentencing range to 240 months of imprisonment and a lifetime term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-24\">Now, Deem appeals, arguing that the district court erred in denying his motion to proceed pro se, an error conceded by the Government. We review claims concerning the right of self-representation de novo. <em>United States v. Janes, </em>421 F.3d 359, 363 (5th Cir.2005). The record reflects that the district court denied Deem\u2019s motion because it found that he lacked the skill and knowledge to represent himself competently. That a defendant\u2019s decision to represent himself may work to his detri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>ment because he lacks the knowledge or skills to represent himself competently is irrelevant \u201cto the determination whether he is competent to waive his right to counsel.\u201d <em>Godinez v. Moran, </em>509 U.S. 389, 400, 113 S.Ct. 2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321 (1993). The record reflects that Deem knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel, and he thus should have been allowed to exercise his constitutional right of self-representation. <em>See Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 815-21, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975); <em>United States v. Cano, </em>519 F.3d 512, 515-16 (5th Cir.2008). Because this error requires reversal, <em>see United States v. Majors, </em>328 F.3d 791, 794 (5th Cir.2003), we do not reach Deem\u2019s challenge to the reasonableness of his sentence, <em>see United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 377 n. 62 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The district court\u2019s denial of Deem\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea has not been challenged by Deem on appeal. That issue has thus been waived, <em>see United States v. Banks, </em>624 F.3d 261, 264 (5th Cir.2010), and Deem\u2019s conviction is AD-FIRMED. However, the right to self-representation does extend to sentencing proceedings. <em>See Cano, </em>519 F.3d at 515. Accordingly, Deem\u2019s sentence is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED to allow Deem a chance to represent himself on resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b581-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
