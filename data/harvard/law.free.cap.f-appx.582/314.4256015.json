He alleged that prison officials violated the Eighth Amendment by failing to adequately treat his skin condition caused by unsafe drinking water.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-20\">We review de novo the dismissal of a complaint pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and 1915A(b)(l) for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted. <em>Green v. Atkinson, </em>623 F.3d 278, 280 (5th Cir.2010). To state a claim, \u201ca complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Contrary to Diaz\u2019s argument, the district court was not required to allow him to conduct discovery prior to dismissing his complaint. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2), 1915A(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-21\">A prison official can be found liable under the Eighth Amendment for subjecting a prisoner to inhumane conditions of confinement or denying the prisoner adequate medical care if he is deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk of serious harm to the inmate. <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>825, 828, 832, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). The prison official must both be aware that a substantial risk of serious harm exists and disregard that risk. <em>Id. </em>at 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">In Diaz\u2019s district court pleadings, he made only general, conclusory, and speculative allegations about the unsafe nature of the drinking water and prison officials\u2019 awareness thereof. He therefore failed to allege sufficient facts from which it could be inferred that defendants knew that the drinking water posed a substantial risk of serious harm and disregarded that risk. <em>See Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937; <em>Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970. Assuming arguendo that Diaz sufficiently alleged that defendants were aware that his skin condition posed a substantial risk of harm, his allegations do not permit the inference that defendants disregarded that risk. <em>See id. </em>His complaints of medical error in diagnosing and treating his skin condition do not state valid claims of deliberate indifference. <em>See Sama v. Hannigan, </em>669 F.3d 585, 590 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Diaz has failed to show that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted. <em>See Green, </em>623 F.3d at 280. The judgment of the district court is affirmed. Diaz\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied. <em>See Cooper v. Sheriff, Lubbock County, Tex., </em>929 F.2d 1078, 1084 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Our affirmance of the district court\u2019s dismissal of Diaz\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted counts as a strike under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g); <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir. 1996). Diaz has three other strikes. <em>See Diaz v. McDuffie, </em>No. 2:13-CV-80, 2014 WL 717028 (N.D. Tex. Feb. 25, 2014); <em>Diaz v. Dockery, </em>No. 2:13-CV-111, 2013 WL 4766795 (N.D.Tex. Sept.5, 2013); <em>Diaz v. Mings, </em>No. 1:04-CV-673 (W.D. Tex. June 16, 2005). Because Diaz has accumulated at least three strikes, he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed in a court of the United States while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g). He is also warned that any future frivolous or repetitive filings in this court or any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction will subject him to additional sanctions. He should review all pending matters to ensure that they are not frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED; \u00a7 1915(G) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b342-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
