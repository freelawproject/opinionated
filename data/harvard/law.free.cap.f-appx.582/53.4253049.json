Following her guilty plea to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349, and thirteen counts of bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1344 and 2, the district court sentenced Gabbidon to ninety months\u2019 incarceration and thirty-six months\u2019 supervised release and required her to pay restitution. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural history, and issues on appeal, to which we refer only as necessary to explain our ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">Gabbidon challenges only the substantive reasonableness of the ninety-month term of imprisonment imposed by the district court. \u201c[O]ur substantive review of a sentence is akin to review under an \u2018abuse-of-diseretion\u2019 standard,\u201d <em>United States v. Park, </em>758 F.3d 193, 199 (2d Cir.2014) (per curiam), under which \u201c[w]e will ... set aside a district court\u2019s <em>substantive </em>determination only in exceptional cases where the trial court\u2019s decision \u2018cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions,\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Cavera, </em>550 F.3d 180, 189 (2d Cir.2008) (en banc) (quoting <em>United States v. Rigas, </em>490 F.3d 208, 238 (2d Cir.2007)). \u201cThe length of a sentence is outside the range of permissible decisions when \u2018affirming it would damage the administration of justice because the sentence imposed was shockingly high, shockingly low, or otherwise unsupportable as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Park, </em>758 F.3d at 200 (quoting <em>United States v. Douglas, </em>713 F.3d 694, 700 (2d Cir.2013)).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">The district court imposed its below-Guideline sentence after weighing each of the mitigating factors that Gabbidon raises on appeal and concluding that her request for a non-incarcerative sentence would be insufficient in light of her role in this serious and large-scale fraud. In particular, the district court accepted the defendant\u2019s proposition that her medical condition is highly relevant for sentencing, but noted that her conditions are either treatable within the prison environment or are exacerbated by her own noncompliance with doctors\u2019 orders. In light of the district court\u2019s appraisal of Gabbidon\u2019s leadership role in the offense, the seriousness of the fraud, and the need for general deterrence, we find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-12\">Moreover, we discern no clear evidence in the record that the district court misapprehended the scope of its authority to further depart from the Guidelines range in light of potentially overlapping enhancements. <em>See United States v. Lauersen, </em>348 F.3d 329, 344 (2d Cir.2003). Consequently, the district court\u2019s decision not to depart from the Guidelines range on the basis of overlapping enhancements is not subject to review on appeal. <em>United States v. Stinson, </em>465 F.3d 113, 114 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-13\">We have considered Gabbidon\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the reasons stated herein, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
