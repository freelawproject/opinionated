It is</p>\n<p id=\"b29-18\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s order filed April 23, 2014, be affirmed. The district court properly dismissed the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), based on its determination that the action was barred by the one-year statute of limitations prescribed by D.C.Code \u00a7 12-301(4), which applies to actions for libel, slander, malicious prosecution, and false arrest. Unlike the prior suit cited by appellant, which asserted a federal claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, here he brought tort claims that are specifically covered by section 4; therefore, contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, the three-year catch-all period of \u00a7 12-301(8) does not control. The arguments and evidence appellant has proffered in his appellate brief and appendix fail to show any error in the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-20\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
