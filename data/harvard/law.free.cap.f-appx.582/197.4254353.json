He received a seventy-two-month sentence. Sargent argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel related to the calculation of loss at sentencing. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-19\">Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel \u201care generally not cognizable on direct appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Benton, </em>523 F.3d 424, 435 (4th Cir.2008); <em>see United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). Instead, to allow for adequate development of the record, a defendant must ordinarily bring his claims in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2012) motion. <em>King, </em>119 F.3d at 295. However, we may entertain such claims on direct appeal if \u201cit conclusively appears from the record that defense counsel did not provide effective representation.\u201d <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). <em>See generally Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (setting forth standard). Because none of Sargent\u2019s alleged ineffective assistance of counsel claims conclusively appear on the record, we decline to address them in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-21\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
