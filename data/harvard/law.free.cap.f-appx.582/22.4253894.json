Counsel for defendant Anthony Gilliam moves to be relieved as counsel pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and the Government moves to dismiss Gilliam\u2019s appeal. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">I. <em>Anders </em>Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">On March 29, 2012, Gilliam entered a written plea agreement pursuant to which he agreed \u201cnot to appeal or collaterally attack in any proceeding ... the conviction or sentence imposed by the Court if that sentence does not exceed 96 months, a one-year term of supervised release, and $100,000 f\u00edne.\u201d We agree with Gilliam\u2019s counsel and the Government that there is no non-frivolous argument why this waiver should not be enforced, and Gilliam has not sought new counsel or filed a <em>pro se </em>response. Accordingly, we grant the <em>Anders </em>motion of Gilliam\u2019s counsel and the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss Gilliam\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-12\">II. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b51-13\">\u2018We review <em>de novo </em>a challenge to the sufficiency of. the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Yannotti, </em>541 F.3d 112, 120 (2d Cir.2008). \u201cA defendant challenging his conviction on sufficiency grounds faces a \u2018heavy burden.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Bala, </em>236 F.3d 87, 93 (2d Cir.2000) (quoting <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>20 F.3d 538, 548 (2d Cir.1994)). This is because the court must \u201creview the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor.\u201d <em>United States v. Gaskin, </em>364 F.3d 438, 459 (2d Cir.2004). We reverse \u201conly if no rational factfinder could have found the crimes charged proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459-60; <em>see generally Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-14\">Upon review of the record and relevant law, we conclude that the evidence was more than sufficient to support the convictions of Reyes and Daniels. At trial, six witnesses, including co-conspirators, drug suppliers, and drug buyers, testified to the existence of a vast narcotics distribution conspiracy operated and led by Reyes and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Daniels. Furthermore, evidence from DEA agents, chemists, and cooperating witnesses supported the jury\u2019s finding that Reyes and Daniels knew, or reasonably foresaw, that the conspiracy, which spanned hundreds of transactions over several months, involved at least one kilogram of heroin and 280 grams of cocaine base. <em>See United States v. Pressley, </em>469 F.3d 63, 65 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201cWithin the context of a conspiracy to distribute large amounts of narcotics, these subsidiary crimes may take the form of a series of smaller drug sales.\u201d). Accordingly, in viewing the evidence \u201cin its totality and in the light most favorable to the government,\u201d a rational jury could have found the essential elements of the charged conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Mandell, 752 </em>F.3d 544, 549 (2d Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">III. Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Where, as here, a defendant does not object to a jury instruction at trial, we review only for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Crim.P. 30(d), 52(b). Under plain error review, \u201can appellate court may, in its discretion, correct an error not raised at trial only where the appellant demonstrates that (1) there is an \u2018error\u2019; (2) the error is \u2018clear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute\u2019; (3) the error \u2018affected the appellant\u2019s substantial rights, which in the ordinary case means\u2019 it \u2018affected the outcome of the district court proceedings\u2019; and (4) \u2018the error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Marcus, </em>560 U.S. 258, 262, 130 S. Ct. 2159, 176 L.Ed.2d 1012 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">Upon plain error review, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s jury instructions as to quantity were not in \u201cerror,\u201d much less \u201cclear or obvious\u201d error. <em>Id. </em>The jury instructions expressly stated that the Government had the burden of establishing the type and amount of drugs \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The instructions made clear that the jury was to consider quantity only after \u201cthe first two elements have been established,\u201d and that \u201c[a]s with any element of the charged conspiracy\u201d the jury should not engage in guesswork or speculation. On this record, we cannot say that the instructions inadequately informed the jury that quantity was an element of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">IV. Defendants\u2019 Motion for a Mistrial</p>\n<p id=\"b52-11\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a mistrial for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>587 F.3d 573, 583 (2d Cir.2009). \u201cThe decision to declare a mistrial is left to the \u2018sound discretion\u2019 of the judge, but \u2018the power ought to be used with the greatest caution, under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Renico v. Lett, </em>559 U.S. 766, 774, 130 S.Ct. 1855, 176 L.Ed.2d 678 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-12\">We conclude that the District Court was well within its discretion in denying defendants\u2019 motion for a mistrial. The District Court quickly issued a curative instruction to the jury after the Government unintentionally elicited testimony regarding an incident in which Reyes discharged a handgun at a co-conspirator. The testimony was ordered stricken from the record, and, in view of the overwhelming evidence against defendants, there is no showing of prejudice. Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s denial of defendants\u2019 motion for a mistrial was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-13\">V. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b52-14\">We review criminal sentences for \u201creasonableness\u201d under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Cavera, </em>550 F.3d 180, 189-90 (2d Cir.2008) (en banc). A sentence is procedurally un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>reasonable if the district court \u201cfails to calculate (or improperly calculates) the Sentencing Guidelines range, treats the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selects a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or fails adequately to explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Chu, </em>714 F.3d 742, 746 (2d Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cDetermining drug quantity is a task for the sentencing court, and in performing that task it is not bound by jury findings or evidence presented at trial, but may consider any reliable proof.\u201d <em>United States v. Shonubi, </em>998 F.2d 84, 89 (2d Cir.1993) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">As stated above, ample evidence supported the jury\u2019s finding that Reyes and Daniels each knew, or reasonably foresaw, that the conspiracy involved one kilogram or more of heroin and 280 grams or more of cocaine base. Accordingly, the District Court properly calculated the quantity attributable each to Reyes and Daniels at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The District Court also properly considered the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in imposing Winston\u2019s below-guidelines sentence of 165 months\u2019 imprisonment. At sentencing, the District Court explicitly considered and rejected Winston\u2019s criminal history and sentencing parity arguments, emphasizing the nature of the offense and Winston\u2019s -violent criminal history. The District Court was not required to \u201cutter robotic incantations repeating each factor that motivates a sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Park, </em>758 F.3d 193, 197 (2d Cir.2014) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">We have considered all of the arguments raised by defendants on appeal and find them to be without merit. For the reasons stated above, we GRANT the <em>Anders </em>motion of Gilliam\u2019s counsel to be relieved as counsel and the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss Gilliam\u2019s appeal, and AFFIRM the District Court\u2019s February 20, 2013 and March 6, 2013 judgments as to Reyes, Daniels, and Winston.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b51-10\">. Reyes was also convicted of one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2), but does not contest that count on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
