On appeal, defendant contends that the District Court erroneously instructed the jury with regard to the \u201cbuyer-seller exception\u201d to conspiracy liability and with regard to its determination of the quantity of cocaine attributable to the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Counsel for defendant Joseph Jackson moves to be relieved as counsel pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and the Government moves to dismiss Jackson\u2019s appeal. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and the procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-18\">I. Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b61-19\">A jury instruction is flawed if \u201cit misleads the jury as to the correct legal standard or does not adequately inform the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>jury on the law.\u201d <em>United States v. Dinome, </em>86 F.3d 277, 282 (2d Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). Challenged jury instructions are reviewed <em>de novo </em>but will be reversed \u201conly if all of the instructions, taken as a whole, caused a defendant prejudice.\u201d <em>United States v. Bok, </em>156 F.3d 157, 161 (2d Cir.1998). Moreover, a district court \u201cenjoys broad discretion in crafting its instructions, which is only circumscribed by the requirement that the charge be fair to both sides.\u201d <em>United States v. Ghailani, </em>733 F.3d 29, 53 (2d Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Here, contrary to defendant\u2019s assertions, the jury instructions for both the \u201cbuyer-seller exception\u201d and the quantity.of cocaine attributable to defendant were legally correct and not misleading to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">II. Anders Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Frank J. Riccio II, counsel for defendant Joseph Jackson, moves for permission to withdraw as counsel pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). The Government moves to dismiss the appeal based on defendant\u2019s waiver of his appellate rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">We agree with Jackson\u2019s counsel and the Government that there were no meritorious issues to be raised on appeal because (1) Jackson\u2019s guilty plea was valid; (2) he knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal; and (3) his sentence was reasonable. However, because Jackson\u2019s waiver did not mention the special assessment and because he explicitly reserved the right to contest the forfeiture of two cash seizures totaling $72, 325.07, they are outside the scope of his waiver and he is not barred from challenging them on appeal. Nevertheless, these claims are not meritorious as both were mandatory under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3013(a)(2)(A) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(a)(l)-(2) respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">We have considered all of the arguments brought by the appellants and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that the: (1) judgment of the District Court with regard to defendant Manokus Fields is AFFIRMED; (2) the <em>Anders </em>motion with regard to defendant Joseph Jackson is GRANTED; (3) Government\u2019s motion to dismiss is GRANTED with respect to the appeal of defendant Jackson\u2019s conviction, terms of imprisonment, supervised release, and the agreed-upon portion of his forfeiture; and (4) Government\u2019s motion to dismiss with respect to the appeal of defendant Jackson\u2019s special assessment and the contested portion of his forfeiture is construed as a motion for summary affirmance, and, as so construed, is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b61-13\">. In his brief, defendant Fields also argued that the District Court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on the grounds that insufficient evidence was presented linking him to a charged narcotics conspiracy. During oral argument, however, defendant abandoned this argument and so we decline to address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b62-8\">. Jackson claims he was never notified that an attorney had been appointed to represent him on appeal, nor that an <em>Anders </em>brief has been filed in his case. Although the Clerk determined Jackson's response was untimely, we will consider Jackson's response timely filed, based on his actual receipt of the required notice in September.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
