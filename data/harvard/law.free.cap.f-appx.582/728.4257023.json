We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Toguchi v. Chung, </em>391 F.3d 1051, 1056 (9th Cir.2004), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">The district court properly granted summary judgment because Sanchez failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether defendants knew that Sanchez faced a substantial risk of serious harm to his health arising from his Hepatitis C condition, and consciously disregarded such a risk. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 835, 842, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (a prison official acts with deliberate indifference only if \u201che knows that inmates face a substantial risk of serious harm and disregards that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it\u201d); <em>Toguchi, </em>391 F.3d at 1058 (difference of opinion between a prisoner and medical authorities regarding the course of treatment does not constitute deliberate indifference; rather, the prisoner must establish that the chosen course of treatment \u201cwas medically unacceptable under the circumstances\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-11\">Sanchez\u2019s contentions regarding the district court\u2019s alleged failure to review his evidence and rely only on defendants\u2019 \u201cfabricated\u201d evidence, and defendants\u2019 allegedly improper opposition to his motion to extend his prison \u201ccopy work account,\u201d are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b757-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
