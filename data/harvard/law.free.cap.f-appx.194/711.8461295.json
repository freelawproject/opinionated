Silva thereafter moved the BIA to reconsider its decision. The BIA denied her motion. Silva now petitions this court to review the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to reconsider. She contends that the BIA erred in denying her motion to reconsider because it did not exercise independent judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-22\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for an abuse of discretion. <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cJudicial review of denials of discretionary relief incident to deportation proceedings ... is limited to determining \u2018whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Garcia-Mir v. Smith, </em>766 F.2d 1478, 1490 (11th Cir.1985) (citation omitted) (addressing a motion to reopen).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-23\">\u201cA motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). In this case, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Silva\u2019s motion to reconsider because Silva failed to specify any errors of law or fact in the BIA\u2019s decision and merely reiterated the arguments she presented in appealing the IJ\u2019s removal order. Accordingly, we deny her petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-24\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b733-19\">. Silva also contends that the IJ erred in finding that she did not establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
