Miles seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s orders denying his post-judgment motion to amend his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000) petition and his motion for reconsideration. We have reviewed the record and find that Miles has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>stitutional right. Accordingly, we deny the motion for a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We deny the motion for appointment of counsel and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process. The motion to expedite consideration of the appeal is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
