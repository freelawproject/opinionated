Moreover, Maksakuli asserts, he demonstrated, via credible testimony, that: (1) his family was blacklisted by the Albanian government because of his grandparents\u2019 opposition to the Communist regime; (2) he was persecuted by the Albanian government because of his involvement in the Democratic Party; (3) he was beaten on more than one occasion by the Albanian police because of his political beliefs; (4) he received anonymous telephone calls threatening to kidnap his daughter and force her to be a prostitute in Europe; and (5) unidentified men threatened to dismember his son. Maksakuli argues that this testimony was sufficient to demonstrate that he had suffered past persecution and was, thus, eligible for asylum. Maksakuli further notes that, although he did not submit documentary evidence corroborating his testimony, the IJ failed to consider his explanation for the absence of such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). To the extent the BIA in this case adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, we will \u201creview the IJ\u2019s analysis as if it were the [BIA\u2019s].\u201d <em>See id. </em>To the extent that the BIA\u2019s (or the IJ\u2019s, as applicable) decision was based on a legal determination, review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). The BIA\u2019s factual determination that an alien is not entitled to asylum must be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Mazariegos v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001). Under this highly deferential standard of review, a denial of asylum may be reversed only if the evidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to find that the requisite fear of persecution exists. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815 n. 1, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We recently explained that \u201conly in a rare case does the record compel the conclusion that an applicant suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1239 (11th Cir.2006) (describing how evidence presented by applicant supports an inference that she was persecuted, but does not compel such a conclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). An alien is entitled to asylum if he or she can establish, with specific and credible evidence: (1) past persecution on account of his or her membership in a particular social group, political opinion, or other statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that his or her membership in a particular social group, political opinion, or other statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. \u201c[A]n applicant must demonstrate that his or her fear of persecution is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. Establishing a nexus between the statutorily-listed factor and the feared persecution \u201crequires the alien to present specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of\u2019 the statutorily-listed factor. <em>Id. </em>at 1287 (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">If the alien demonstrates past persecution, he or she is presumed to have a well-founded fear of future persecution unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>the government can rebut the presumption. 8 C.F.R \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). If, however, the alien does not establish past persecution, he or she bears the burden of showing a well-founded fear of persecution by-showing that (1) he or she fears persecution based on his or her membership in a particular social group, political opinion, or other statutorily-listed factor; (2) there is a reasonable possibility he or she will suffer persecution if removed to his or her native country; and (3) he or she could not avoid persecution by relocating to another part of his or her country, if under all the circumstances it would be reasonable to expect relocation. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2), (3)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">As an initial matter, the IJ detailed numerous inconsistencies between Maksakuli\u2019s application and his testimony at the removal hearing, and explicitly made an adverse credibility determination. However, the BIA did not adopt or affirm the IJ\u2019s credibility determination, instead affirming the IJ\u2019s decision on other grounds, and, thus, we need not address that credibility finding. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. The BIA held that, even assuming that Maksakuli\u2019s testimony was credible, Maksakuli failed to meet his burden of proof. We conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s determinations that Maksakuli failed to demonstrate either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground, as Maksakuli failed to demonstrate that he was persecuted on account of his political opinion, his nationality, or his religion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Maksakuli points to (1) a series of threatening telephone calls, (2) an incident where individuals threatened and assaulted his son on the street, (3) the threats he received regarding his daughter, and (4) the beatings he received at political rallies. First, with regard to the threatening telephone calls and the threats to kidnap his daughter that Maksakuli allegedly received, we have explained that a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation do not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005). Second, to the extent that Maksakuli and his son were physically harmed, neither Maksakuli nor his son could definitively identify the individuals who harmed them, and, thus, they have not demonstrated that they were targeted on account of Maksakuli\u2019s political opinion. Although these incidents may permit a finding of past persecution, they do not compel such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Moreover, it is noteworthy that the 2004 Profile contradicts Maksakuli\u2019s claim that there was animosity between the Democratic Party and the Socialist Party or Socialist government, stating that \u201c[t]here are no indications that the Socialist Party, either through its own organization or through government authorities, is engaged in a pattern of repression or violent behavior against its opponents.\u201d The 2001 and 2003 Country Reports stated that the police force was corrupt, underfunded, untrained, and unreliable, and would frequently arrest and detain persons arbitrarily, but the reports indicated that there were no confirmed cases of persons being detained solely for political reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">Finally, Maksakuli failed to show that there was a reasonable possibility of persecution that could not be avoided by relocating to another part of Albania. Because Maksakuli cannot meet his burden for asylum, he also cannot meet the higher burden for withholding of removal under the INA. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1293, 1303. The BIA\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence. Upon review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Thus, we deny Maksakuli\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b706-17\">. The IJ also denied Maksakuli relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\"CAT\u201d). Maksakuli, however, only briefly mentions this claim on appeal, and makes no argument as to this issue. Therefore, this claim has been abandoned. See <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1286 n. 3 (11th Cir.2003) (stating that petitioner abandoned his CAT claim because he did not raise it in his brief on appeal); <em>Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989) (holding that a passing reference to an issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>in an appellate brief does not raise the issue for purposes of appellate review).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
