The district court sentenced Estimable to a twenty-four-month term of imprisonment to be followed by three years of supervised release. In his initial appeal, the Government moved to remand for resentencing in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We granted the motion to remand, affirmed Estimable\u2019s conviction, vacated the sentence, and remanded for resentencing. <em>United States v. Estimable, </em>131 Fed.Appx. 413 (4th Cir.2005) (No. 04-5041). On remand, the district court imposed an identical sentence, and Estimable again appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-23\">On appeal, Estimable argues that the district court erred in fading to recognize its authority to downwardly depart based on his assertions that Haiti\u2019s unwillingness to accept deportees would result in his indefinite incarceration. A district court\u2019s failure to grant a downward departure is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>not reviewable unless a district court was under the mistaken impression that it lacked the authority to depart. <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>209 F.3d 338, 352 (4th Cir.2000); <em>see also United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 333 (3d Cir.2006) (collecting cases declining to review a district court\u2019s decision not to depart, even after Booker). Our review of the transcript of the resentencing hearing convinces us that the district court clearly understood its authority to depart, but concluded that a departure was not appropriate, and that the relief sought by Estimable should be pursued before immigration authorities. The court\u2019s decision that a departure was not appropriate is therefore not reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Accordingly, we affirm Estimable\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
