On appeal, Cole argues that the district court violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by enhancing his offense level for obstruction of justice, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, and then applying the Guidelines in a mandatory fashion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>Although Cole did not raise a <em>Booker </em>objection at the sentencing hearing, he did preserve an <em>Apprendi </em>objection relating to the enhancement for obstruction of justice when, at the sentencing hearing, he argued that the enhancement \u201cwould take [the sentence] above the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>Cf. United States v. Dowling, </em>403 F.3d 1242, 1246 (11th Cir.) (finding that similar <em>Apprendi </em>objection was sufficient to preserve <em>Booker </em>claims), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 462, 163 L.Ed.2d 351 (2005). Thus, we review Cole\u2019s preserved <em>Booker </em>claims <em>de novo. See United States v. Cain, </em>433 F.3d 1345, 1347 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Candelario, </em>240 F.3d 1300, 1304 (11th Cir. 2001) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Pursuant to <em>Booker, </em>\u201cthe Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is violated where <em>under a mandatory guidelines system </em>a sentence is increased because of an enhancement based on facts found by the judge that were neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.) (emphasis in original), <em>cert. denied, </em>545 U.S. 1127, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005). We have held that there are two types of <em>Booker </em>errors: (1) constitutional error resulting from enhancements based on judicial fact-finding, and (2) non-constitutional statutory error resulting from mandatory application of the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">Here, we can discern neither type of <em>Booker </em>error. Contrary to Cole\u2019s arguments, the district court <em>explicitly </em>stated that it was applying the Guidelines in an advisory, and not mandatory, manner. <em>See </em>R3 at 50 (\u201cUnderstanding that the Guidelines are advisory and understanding what the statutory criteria are that I am required to consult and apply under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) through (7) ....\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 61 (\u201ctherefore the appropriate offense level for Mr. Cole under the <em>advisory </em>Guidelines is a level 14 with a range of 15 to 21 months. I am mindful of the statutory maximum, however, and I will not exceed that statutory maximum.\u201d). Moreover, the district court calculated the sentencing range consistent with <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174 (11th Cir.2005), and then stated that it had considered all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the 12-month statutory maximum before imposing its sentence. Accordingly, the district court satisfied its obligations under <em>Booker, </em>and there was no <em>Booker </em>error, of either a constitutional or statutory variety.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">We likewise are unpersuaded by Cole\u2019s separate argument that, pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the obstruction-of-justice enhancement impermissibly increased the penalty over the statutory maximum. In short, because Cole\u2019s sentence, which the district court imposed under an advisory sentencing scheme, did not exceed the statutory maximum prescribed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243(b), there was no <em>Apprendi </em>violation. <em>See United States v. Clay, </em>376 F.3d 1296, 1301 (11th Cir.2004) (noting that \u201cthe constitutional rule of <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply where the sentence imposed is not greater than the prescribed maximum for the offense of conviction.\u201d); <em>cf. Rodriguez, </em>398 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>F.3d at 1297 (holding that, <em>post-Booker, </em>a district court may continue to determine any enhancement when applying the Guidelines as advisory).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b881-21\">. Cole does <em>not </em>address the separate issues of whether a downward departure was warrant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>ed or whether the sentence was reasonable under <em>Booker. </em>Accordingly, he has waived those claims. <em>Cf. United States v. Hembree, </em>381 F.3d 1109, 1110 (11th Cir.2004) (prior to <em>Booker, </em>holding that claims not raised on appeal, including claims based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), are deemed waived); <em>United States v. Curtis, </em>380 F.3d 1308, 1310\u201411 (11th Cir.2004) (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
