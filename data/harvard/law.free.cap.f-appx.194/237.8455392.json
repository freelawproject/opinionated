The insured parties dispute the district court\u2019s determination that (1) claims for the personal injury to an independent contractor\u2019s employee are excluded from coverage and (2) the insurance provider did not waive its coverage defense. The court has carefully reviewed the briefs and pertinent parts of the record and has found no reversible error of law or fact. Accordingly, we AFFIRM essentially for the reasons stated by the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b260-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
