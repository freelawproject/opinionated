The record reflects that the district court properly considered the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in determining Hincapie\u2019s sentence. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b735-15\">A grand jury charged Hincapi\u00e9 with possession with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine while aboard a vessel subject to U.S. jurisdiction, in violation of 46 Appx. U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1903(a), (g), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(l)(B)(ii), and conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine while aboard a vessel subject to U.S. jurisdiction, in violation of 46 Appx. U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1903(a), (g), (j), and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(l)(B)(ii). Hincapi\u00e9 had been a crew member on a boat to which the Coast Guard linked 133 bales of cocaine. The Coast Guard had also found evidence of cocaine on the crewmembers\u2019 clothing. Hincapi\u00e9 pled guilty to the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-16\">Hincapi\u00e9 had a base offense level of 38 because his offense involved 2,692 kilograms of cocaine. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1) (2003). He received a two-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(6) and a three-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. With a total offense level of 33 and criminal history category of I, the applicable guideline range was 135-168 months imprisonment. The district court sentenced Hincapi\u00e9 to 135 months. Hincapi\u00e9 appealed, and we affirmed his sentence in part, but vacated and remanded for re-sentencing in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-17\">During the re-sentencing hearing,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hincapi\u00e9 indicated that the only issue before the court was the determination of an appropriate sentence in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. He argued that, after <em>Booker, </em>the court could consider specific offender characteristics it had not previously been able to consider in determining the sentence. He pointed out that (1) he was young, (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>he had a limited education, (3) he had three daughters, (4) this was his first such offense, (5) he had no prior record, and (6) he took part in the scheme because he was having financial problems. He further asserted that, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661, there was no limit to the information the court could consider regarding his character and conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">The government urged the court to impose a sentence within the guideline range, and, in light of the nature of the offense, the amount of drugs involved, the need to sentence the defendant consistently and avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, the court should sentence Hincapi\u00e9 to 135 months. The court indicated that it had reviewed the PSI \u201cconsistent with an advisory guideline range, and consider[ed] the statutory sentencing factors set forth in 3553(a).\u201d R4 at 14. The court observed that (1) Hincapi\u00e9 was being \u201cheld accountable for over 2600 kilograms of cocaine;\u201d (2) the charged offense was \u201cquite serious\u201d; and (3) a \u201clengthy\u201d sentence was \u201cnot only required, but appropriate to deter similar conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14-15. The court then sentenced Hincapi\u00e9 to 135 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">On appeal, Hincapi\u00e9 argues that the district court did not appropriately consider the factors provided in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in determining his sentence. He also contends that the court failed to consider the factors set out in chapter 5H of the sentencing guidelines and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the guidelines <em>de novo </em>and \u201ca defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence for reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). In imposing a sentence after <em>Booker, </em>a court must first consult the guidelines and correctly calculate the guideline range. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). The court must then consider the factors provided in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), which include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-10\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need [for the sentence] to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-11\"><em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). The district court need not explicitly discuss each factor. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[Ajcknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker.\u201d Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-12\">Here, the record reflects that the district court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining Hincapie\u2019s sentence. The court not only ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>knowledged that it had considered the factors, but it also specifically noted its belief that, in light of the nature of the offense, which it described as \u201cquite serious,\u201d a lengthy sentence was \u201cappropriate to deter similar conduct.\u201d R4 at 14-15. Accordingly, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Hincapi\u00e9 appeals the 135-month sentence imposed by the district court upon <em>post-Booker </em>re-sentencing. Because we conclude that the district court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining Hineapie\u2019s sentence, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b735-13\">. The <em>court </em>relied <em>on the </em>PSI calculations from the original sentencing hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b736-8\">. Although Hincapi\u00e9 invokes 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661, that statute only provides that \"[n]o limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.\u201d In this case, there is no allegation or indication that the court limited the information Hincapi\u00e9 presented as to these issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
