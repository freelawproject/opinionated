On appeal, Ortiz first contends that the district court erred in applying a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice, under U.S.S.G \u00a7 3C1.1, because he fled the jurisdiction due to concerns over his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings regarding the imposition of an enhancement for obstruction of justice for clear error and the district court\u2019s application of the factual findings to the guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2006). The guidelines provide that the district court is authorized to assess a two-level enhancement if \u201cthe defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction ...\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 (2005). The commentary to \u00a7 3C1.1 provides a non-exhaustive list of examples of the types of conduct to which the enhancement applies, including \u201cwillfully failing to appear, as ordered, for a judicial proceeding.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.4(e)) (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">Upon review of the record and the sentencing transcript, and upon consideration of the briefs of the parties, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">Here, the district court properly determined that Ortiz willfully failed to appear at his arraignment, and therefore, the application of the two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice under \u00a7 3C1.1 was appropriate. The record reflects that several family members testified that Ortiz left the jurisdiction in 1997 due to concerns over his family\u2019s health and safety. Having considered this testimony, the district court found that the defendant did not have to flee the jurisdiction in order to provide for the safety of his family. Therefore, the district court did not commit clear err in applying the \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement because Ortiz willfully failed to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">Ortiz next argues that because the government declined to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for downward departure, the district court effectively punished him twice for leaving the jurisdiction because the court also enhanced his sentence for obstruction of justice. The sentencing guidelines state in pertinent part that \u201c[u]pon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense, the court may depart from the guidelines.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 (2005). \u201c[T]he decision to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for downward departure from the [sentencing [guidelines ... lies within the sound discretion of the [government.\u201d <em>United States v. Alvarez, </em>115 F.3d 839, 841 (11th Cir.1997). The Supreme Court has made clear that \u201c \u00a7 5K1.1 ... gives the Government a power, not a duty, to file a motion when a defendant has substantially assisted.\u201d <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 1843, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>(1992). In the absence of a plea agreement, judicial review of the government\u2019s failure to file a substantial assistance motion is limited to unconstitutional motive, and we have noted there is a \u201creluctance to enter into the prosecutorial discretion arena of the executive branch.\u201d <em>United States v. Forney, </em>9 F.Bd 1492, 1501, 1503 n. 4. (11th Cir.1993). We have also previously held that when the government has failed to file a substantial assistance motion, any assistance the defendant might have provided the government is not a permissible ground for a downward departure in calculating an advisory guideline range. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1182 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Here, the government\u2019s decision to file a motion under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 rested solely with the prosecutor and not with the district court. But Ortiz contends it was \u201cunreasonable for the [district] court [to] apply the obstruction enhancement in light of Ortiz losing the 5K reduction.\u201d This argument ignores the fact that the court\u2019s application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 is independent of the government\u2019s decision to file a motion under \u00a7 5K1.1. Therefore, Ortiz has failed to show that the district court clearly erred in applying the two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice, pursuant to \u00a7 3C1.1. Accordingly, Ortiz\u2019s sentences are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
