The petition for review before us, however, is timely only as to the BIA\u2019s February 7, 2006, denial of Rodriguez-Lopez\u2019s motion to reconsider, not the BIA\u2019s November 16, 2005, order affirming the decision of the IJ and dismissing Rodriguez-Lopez\u2019s appeal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (requiring that petition for review be filed \u201cnot later than 30 days after the date of the final order of removal\u201d); Da<em>kane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (recognizing that the statutory limit on the time for filing a petition for review is not subject to equitable tolling because it is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional\u201d) (quotations and citations omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, we have jurisdiction only to review the BIA\u2019s denial of Rodriguez-Lopez\u2019s motion to reconsider, and we dismiss his petition insofar as it can be understood to seek review of the BIA\u2019s November 16th order affirming the decision of the IJ and dismissing Rodriguez-Lopez\u2019s appeal. <em>Cf. id. </em>(reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen, but not the merits of the underlying final order of removal, because the alien did not file a timely petition for review of that order).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">\u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cOur review is limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (internal quotes and citation omitted). \u201cA motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>see 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C). \u201cWhen the [BIA] reconsiders it takes itself back in time and looks at the case as though a decision had never been entered. Thus, if it grants the motion, the [BIA] considers the case anew as it existed at the time of the original decision.\u201d <em>Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 90 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>Here, the BIA reviewed the record and determined that Rodriguez-Lopez did not identify in his motion to reconsider any legal or factual errors in the BIA\u2019s previous decision. Instead, the BIA explained, Rodriguez-Lopez\u2019s motion \u201clargely attempted] to reiterate arguments already made in connection with his appeal and already evaluated and rejected by [the BIA].\u201d A motion to reconsider, the BIA stated, \u201cis not a substitute for an appeal\u201d and \u201cis not to be used as an opportunity for a second effort at proving factual allegations.\u201d <em>See, e.g., In re Guevara, </em>20 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 238, 248, 1990 WL 385763 (BIA 1991). In the instant appeal, Rodriguez-Lopez likewise fails to identify any specific errors of fact or law that he believes the BIA failed to address in resolving his motion to reconsider.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rather, he attempts to reargue his claims for asylum and withholding of removal on the merits. As for Rodriguez-Lopez\u2019s assertion that the BIA failed to use \u201cits own independent judgment,\u201d this too is unpersuasive because Rodriguez-Lopez fails to support it with any substantial argument or authority. <em>See Zafar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>461 F.3d 1357 (11th Cir.2006) (rejecting equal protection argument unsupported by any case law or citations to the record). Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the BIA\u2019s order denying Rodriguez-Lopez\u2019s motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b843-6\">. In his brief, Rodriguez-Lopez refers to his December 15, 2005, motion to the BIA as a motion to reopen, not just a motion to reconsider. Before the BIA, however, Rodriguez-Lopez entitled his motion only as a motion to reconsider. Likewise, the BIA referred to Rodriguez-Lopez\u2019s motion solely as a motion to reconsider. For purposes of this appeal then, we too construe Rodriguez-Lopez\u2019s motion solely as a motion to reconsider.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b843-11\">. We review issues of subject matter jurisdiction de novo. <em>Ortega v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>416 F.3d 1348, 1350 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b844-6\">. Although Rodriguez-Lopez states that the BIA and IJ \u201cshould have considered all relevant evidence\u201d in analyzing his asylum claim, he does not actually explain how any specific evidence was ignored or overlooked. Nor does he address the BIA's determination that his asylum application was untimely. In any event, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA's determination that an asylum application is untimely. <em>See Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 957 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
