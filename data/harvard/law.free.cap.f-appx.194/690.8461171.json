Blount contends that there was a bona fide doubt as to her competency, as shown by the district court\u2019s concerns about her medication at the initial change-of-plea hearing. Therefore, she argues that an evidentiary hearing on the matter should have been held. Blount, however, does not ask that her guilty plea be vacated, but only that the appeal waiver provision be severed from the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-21\">In <em>Pate v. Robinson, </em>383 U.S. 375, 385, 86 S.Ct. 836, 842, 15 L.Ed.2d 815 (1966), the U.S. Supreme Court held that the prohibition against trying an incompetent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>defendant requires a trial court to hold a competency hearing <em>sua sponte </em>when presented with information that raises a \u201cbona fide doubt as to the petitioner\u2019s competency.\u201d <em>Johnston v. Singletary, </em>162 F.3d 630, 634 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Defendants who are not competent to participate in the proceedings cannot waive their constitutional rights. <em>Godinez v. Moran, </em>509 U.S. 389, 400-01, 113 S.Ct. 2680, 2687-88, 125 L.Ed.2d 321 (1993). \u201cA defendant is considered competent to stand trial if he has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding\u2014 and if he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d <em>Johnston, </em>162 F.3d at 634 n. 4 (internal quotation omitted). Three factors are to be considered when determining whether a trial court violated a defendant\u2019s procedural due process rights by failing to conduct a competency hearing <em>sua sponte: </em>(1) evidence of the defendant\u2019s irrational behavior; (2) the defendant\u2019s demeanor; and (3) prior medical opinion regarding the defendant\u2019s competence to participate in the proceedings. <em>Tiller v. Esposito, </em>911 F.2d 575, 576 (11th Cir.1990). \u201c[T]he mere presence of mental illness or other mental disability at the time [the defendant] entered his plea does not necessarily mean that he was incompetent to plead.... The mental illness or disability must have been so debilitating that [the defendant] was unable to consult with his lawyer and did not have a rational and factual understanding of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Bolius v. Wainwright, </em>597 F.2d 986, 990 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Blount did not raise the issue of competency before the district court, but the court had a duty to raise the issue <em>sua sponte </em>if a bona fide doubt existed as to her competency. <em>Johnston, </em>162 F.3d at 634. Such doubt is not present within the record, however. The district court was in the best position to determine Blount\u2019s demeanor throughout the proceedings, and the court found that she was competent to proceed after lengthy questioning. The record does not evince erratic or irrational behavior by Blount. The district court did decide to postpone the initial change-of-plea hearing because Blount\u2019s medication dosage had been increased the previous day. This one-week postponement was a cautious response to the change in dosage, rather than a response to any indication of incompetency. Although there was evidence in the record that Blount had a history of mental illness, such a history by itself is not enough to find that a defendant is incompetent to plead. <em>Bolius, </em>597 F.2d at 990. In 2000, a state court determined that Blount was incompetent to plead guilty, but that case proceeded in 2001 when she was on medication. All indications in the record are that Blount was competent when she was receiving treatment for her bipolar disorder, as she was at the time of the plea hearing in the instant case. Accordingly, we find that the district court did not err in finding Blount competent to plead guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Once it has been determined that a defendant was competent to plead guilty, the court must ensure that the waiver of her constitutional rights was knowing and voluntary. <em>Godinez, </em>509 U.S. at 400, 113 S.Ct. at 2687. We review <em>de novo </em>the knowing and voluntary nature of a sentence appeal waiver. <em>United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1352 (11th Cir. 1993). A sentence appeal waiver may be enforced, so long as it was knowingly and voluntarily made. <em>Id. </em>at 1350.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">To prevail upon its contention that the sentencing claim is waived, we have indicated that \u201c[t]he government must show that either (1) the district court specifically questioned the defendant concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>sentence appeal waiver during the Rule 11 colloquy, or (2) it is manifestly clear from the record that the defendant otherwise understood the full significance of the waiver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1351. A sentence appeal waiver that is otherwise valid is not rendered invalid by a sentencing court\u2019s statement that a defendant can appeal. <em>See United States v. Howle, </em>166 F.3d 1166, 1168 (11th Cir.1999) (holding that district court\u2019s statement to defendant that \u201cI cannot depart in this case but I invite and welcome an appeal\u201d did not modify the sentencing appeal waiver in the plea agreement); <em>United States v. Benitez-Zapata, </em>131 F.3d 1444, 1446-47 (11th Cir. 1997) (holding that the court\u2019s statement, after imposing the sentence, that the defendant could appeal within ten days did not nullify the plea agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">In this case, the district court specifically questioned Blount concerning the sentence appeal waiver during the Rule 11 colloquy after first reading the waiver to her. <em>See Bushert, </em>997 F.2d at 1351. Although the district court made references to Blount\u2019s ability to appeal the judgment and sentence, those were made only in passing and were corrected by the government after the court already had made a direct inquiry into Blount\u2019s understanding of the waiver. Therefore, Blount knowingly and voluntarily waived her right to appeal, and we will not address her arguments that challenge aspects of her sentence because we are precluded from reviewing them by the appeal waiver. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b715-22\">.
