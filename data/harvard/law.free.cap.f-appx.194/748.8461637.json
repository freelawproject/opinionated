In his first petition, Adrien argues that the IJ and the BIA erred by finding his testimony not credible. In his second petition, Adrien argues that the BIA erred in denying his motion to reopen because his recent marriage to a United States citizen permits him to apply for adjustment of status while in removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">In his first petition, Adrien argues that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was not supported by substantial evidence and his testimony as a whole demonstrated that he was subject to persecution and threats to his life, and the incidents were directly related to his arrest of a Lavalas senator\u2019s cousin.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">We review the decision of the BIA, except to the extent that it adopts the IJ\u2019s. <em>Nreka v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>408 F.3d 1361, 1368 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). Because the BIA in this case adopted the IJ\u2019s decision, and made some additional observations, we review both. <em>Id. </em>The factual determination that an alien is not entitled to asylum is reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and must be upheld if it is supported by \u201creasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id </em>(internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-12\">\u201cCredibility determinations likewise are reviewed under the substantial evidence test.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004) (citation omitted). We may not substitute our judgment for that of the IJ with respect to credibility findings. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). \u201cA credibility determination, like any fact finding, may not be overturned unless the record compels it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citations omitted). If the only evidence presented is the applicant\u2019s testimony, an adverse credibility finding alone is sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application. <em>Id. </em>However, an adverse credibility finding does not alleviate the IJ\u2019s duty to consider other evidence produced by the applicant. <em>Id. </em>For a credibility finding to be dispositive of the appeal, the IJ must make \u201cclean determinations of credibility.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-13\">Although minor inconsistencies will not support an adverse credibility finding, inconsistencies that go \u201cto the heart of [the] asylum claim\u201d are sufficient to support such a finding. <em>See e.g., Chebchoub v. I.N.S., </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>(internal quotations and citation omitted); <em>see also Nreka, </em>408 F.3d at 1369 (holding that IJ\u2019s concerns about the credibility of the applicant on \u201ckey elements of the claim\u201d and the applicant\u2019s failure to rebut these with sufficient corroborating evidence and explanation supported finding that applicant did not qualify for asylum) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) or the Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayk\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ..., and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (emphasis added). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a); <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause such future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b); <em>Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">An alien seeking withholding of removal under the INA must show that his life or freedom would \u201cmore likely than not\u201d be threatened upon return to his country because of, among other things, his political opinion. <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 437 (11th Cir.2004) (internal quotations and citation omitted); <em>see also </em>INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). An alien bears the burden of demonstrating that \u201che more-likely-than-not would be persecuted or tortured upon his return to the country in question.\u201d <em>Sanchez, </em>392 F.3d at 437 (internal quotations and citation omitted). This standard is more stringent than the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard for asylum; thus, if an applicant is unable to meet the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard for asylum, he generally is unable to qualify for withholding of removal. <em>See e.g., Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">To obtain withholding of removal under the CAT, the burden is on the applicant to establish that it is \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d he will be tortured in the country of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-10\">Torture is defined as any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or her or a third person information or a confession, punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-11\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1). To constitute torture, an act \u201cmust be specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering!)]\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(5). Generally, when an applicant fails to establish eligibility for asylum, he likewise fails to establish eligibility for CAT relief. <em>Nreka, </em>408 F.3d at 1369 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>The LPs finding that Adrien\u2019s testimony lacked credibility was supported by substantial evidence. Most important, the IJ correctly noted that Adrien gave multiple accounts of the beating that formed the basis of his asylum application, and evidence contradicted Adrien\u2019s claim that the beating was motivated by the attackers\u2019 desire to keep negative information from affecting upcoming elections. These inconsistencies were material to Adrien\u2019s asylum claim and he failed to give sufficient explanations for the inconsistencies. Furthermore, Adrien failed to show that any mistreatment was based upon his political opinion. Because Adrien has failed to establish a claim of asylum on the merits, he also fails to establish eligibility for withholding of removal under the INA or CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Adrien argues that the new medical evidence submitted to the BIA in his motion to reopen undermines the IJ\u2019s credibility finding, and serves to explain any inconsistencies and shortcomings in his testimony. In denying the motion to reopen, the BIA held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-6\">The new diagnosis describes the respondent as having an inability to recall certain events or episodes in his life We note that the respondent has a university degree in Economics and was a police officer, presumably adept at recording facts and sequences of events, for almost four years and there is no evidence, other than his assertion, that his memory problems existed at the time of his hearing before the Immigration Judge in 2003 There is also nothing in the diagnosis that indicates when he does remember events, he recalls specific but faulty or incorrect facts. For instance, his diagnosis states that \u201cthere is no evidence of confabulation\u201d or a tendency to fill in gaps in one\u2019s memory with fabrications that one believes to be true facts (Exh. I at 4). Therefore, while his diagnosis may help explain a lack of detail or total failure to recall events, it would not explain wholly inconsistent and varying versions of events. For example, the respondent previously claimed that he was attacked in November 2000, by people who were angry because they believed he had been collecting money from the International Republic Institution in an effort to support the police union, but he later testified that he was attacked by a man named \u201cBlack\u201d and some other thugs because he had arrested the cousin of a political leader and the political leader wanted to insure the respondent did not attempt to embarrass the leader prior to the upcoming political election (Exhs. 2, 6; Tr. 30-31). Moreover, the respondent first stated that he voluntarily resigned from the Haitian police force when it was later revealed that he was the subject of an administrative investigation and his weapon and badge were confiscated (Exh. 6). Even assuming his diagnosis could explain this lack of credibility, the respondent told his doctor that he had a long-standing memory problem, which he stated began to worsen in approximately May 2005 (Exh. 1 at 1). If the respondent were\u2019 aware of long-standing memory problems, he has not explained why this information would have been unavailable or could not have been presented to the Immigration Judge at his individual hearing. As such, the respondent\u2019s motion fails to present new or previously unavailable evidence that would warrant reopening and his motion to reopen is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">BIA decision, November 18, 2005 (citation omitted). Our review of the record does not persuade us that the record including the new evidence compels a different determination with respect to the credibility issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Adrien also argues that he should have been allowed to adjust his status, despite the fact that he was an alien in removal proceedings, because the regulation preventing him from doing so, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.1(c)(8), contradicts the Congressional intent to allow him to do so, as manifested in INA \u00a7 245(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">\u201cThis Court reviews the BIA\u2019s denial of [a petitioner\u2019s] motion to reopen his deportation order for abuse of discretion. In this particular area, the BIA\u2019s discretion is quite broad.\u201d <em>Gbaya v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>342 F.3d 1219, 1220 (11th Cir.2003). Pursuant to regulation, \u201c[t]he decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen or reconsider is within the discretion of the Board, [and] ... [t]he Board has discretion to deny a motion to reopen even if the party moving has made out a prima facie ease for relief.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). We have held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-6\">At a minimum, there are at least three independent grounds upon which the Board may deny a motion to reopen: 1) failure to establish a prima facie case; 2) failure to introduce evidence that was material and previously unavailable; and 3) a determination that despite the alien\u2019s statutory eligibility for relief, he or she is not entitled to a favorable exercise of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-7\"><em>Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1302 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">In considering the part of Adrien\u2019s motion based upon his application for adjustment of status, the BIA denied the motion on two grounds: (1) he was statutorily barred from adjusting his inadmissible status under INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii) because he had falsely represented that he was a United States citizen; and (2) he was unable to establish <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for adjustment of status because, as an alien in removal proceedings, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.1(c)(8) barred him from applying for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">In his brief on appeal, Adrien challenges only the second of the two grounds relied upon by the BIA in denying the motion to reopen. Because Adrien has failed to challenge the first ground \u2014 a separate and independent ground relied upon by the BIA \u2014 he has abandoned any such challenge to that ground. Accordingly, the BIA\u2019s denial of Adrien\u2019s motion to reopen is due to be affirmed on that unchallenged ground.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-12\">Alternatively, we readily conclude that the unchallenged ground upon which the BIA relied was indeed a valid reason for the BIA to deny Adrien\u2019s motion to reopen. Adrien was statutorily barred from adjustment of status because he falsely represented himself as a United States citizen. INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-13\">(I) In general</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-14\">Any alien who falsely represents, or has falsely represented, himself or herself to be a citizen of the United States for any purpose or benefit under this chapter ... or any other Federal or State law is inadmissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-15\">(II) Exception</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-16\">In the case of an alien making a representation described in subclause (I), if each natural parent of the alien (or, in the case of an adopted alien, each adoptive parent of the alien) is or was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>a citizen (whether by birth or naturalization), the alien permanently resided in the United States prior to attaining the age of 16, and the alien reasonably believed at the time of making such representation that he or she was a citizen, the alien shall not be considered to be inadmissible under any provision of this subsection based on such representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">Here, the BIA did not abuse its discretion when it found that Adrien was statutorily barred from adjustment of status because no waiver to his inadmissibility existed. Adrien admitted removeability pursuant to INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii) for falsely representing himself as a United States citizen. Unlike aliens deemed inadmissible under subsections (a)(4), (5), (6)(C)(i), and (7)(A), no waiver exists for aliens deemed inadmissible under INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii). <em>See </em>INA \u00a7\u00a7 209(c) and 212(a)(6)(C)(iii) and (i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1159(c) and 1182(a)(6)(C)(iii) and (i). Accordingly, in order to be excepted from inadmissibility, he would have had to prove that: (1) each of his parents was a United States citizen; (2) he permanently resided in the United States prior to attaining the age of 16; and (3) he reasonably believed at the time of making his false representation that he was a United States citizen. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(ii)(II), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(II). This exception under subsection (a)(6)(C)(ii)(II) was not applicable to Adrien, and he was statutorily barred from adjusting his status.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">PETITIONS DENIED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b774-9\">. For this reason, and also because our decision can and does not rest entirely on the other separate and independent ground\u2014 which itself is valid \u2014 we need not, and do not, address the effect on Adrien\u2019s eligibility for adjustment of status because of the fact that he was an alien in removal proceedings. <em>But see Scheerer v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>445 F.3d 1311 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b775-27\">.
