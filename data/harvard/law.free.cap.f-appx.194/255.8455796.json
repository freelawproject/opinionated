She argues that her sentence of twenty-four months\u2019 imprisonment exceeds the guidelines range and is unreasonable in light of the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-15\">When a defendant violates a condition of probation, the district court, after a hearing and after considering the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), may revoke the sentence of probation and resentence the defendant under the general provisions of subchapter A, which are found at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3551-3559, taking into account the nonbinding policy statements of Guidelines Manual Chapter 7. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565(c); <em>United States v. Pena, </em>125 F.3d 285, 287 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-16\">Cloud\u2019s original offense of conviction carried a penalty of not more than five years. <em>See </em>\u00a7 501(c). Her sentence of twenty-four months does not exceed the statutory term and therefore is a lawful sentence. <em>See Pena, </em>125 F.3d at 288. Cloud is correct that her term of imprisonment exceeds the guidelines range for her original offense of six to twelve months, but the district court was not limited to the guidelines range that was available at the time of the initial sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-17\">The district court determined that Cloud\u2019s violation was a Class C violation. With a criminal history category of I, the guidelines set forth an advisory range of three to nine months. U.S.S.G.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>\u00a7 7B1.4(a). The record confirms that the court implicitly considered the factors set forth in \u00a7 3558(a), including the nature and circumstances of the offense, Cloud\u2019s history and characteristics, and the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, to provide just punishment for the offense, and to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>see United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 930 (5th Cir.2001). More specifically, the court concluded that Cloud had violated numerous conditions of her probation, had committed crimes while on probation that were similar to her initial crime of embezzlement, and had continued to engage, while on probation, in a pattern of failing to take responsibility for her actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Therefore, although the sentence is in excess of the advisory guidelines range, it was imposed after consideration of the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) and was neither unreasonable nor plainly unreasonable in light of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 119-20 (5th Cir. 2005), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1804, 164 L.Ed.2d 540 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">The judgment of revocation is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b278-11\"> Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
