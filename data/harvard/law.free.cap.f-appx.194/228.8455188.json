Clark appeals her 120-month sentence for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Clark\u2019s sentence included an upward departure from Criminal History Category VI pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. Clark argues that her sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">When a defendant appeals a sentence imposed pursuant to the advisory guidelines scheme required by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this court determines whether the sentence was reasonable. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 706 (5th Cir.2006). The sentencing court\u2019s factual findings are accepted unless clearly erroneous, and the application of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">A sentence imposed \u201cwithin a properly calculated Guidelines range ... is afforded a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 707. A sentencing court also \u201cmay impose a sentence that includes an upward or downward departure as allowed by the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because such a departure is derived from the Guidelines, the sentence is a \u201cguideline sentence,\u201d and the decision to depart and the extent of the departure are both reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">The district court based its decision to upwardly depart on permissible grounds including Clark\u2019s prior convictions for numerous offenses for which she was not assessed criminal history points and numerous pending charges. <em>See </em>\u00a7 4A1.3(a)(2)(A), (D); <em>United States v. Simkanin, </em>420 F.3d 397, 416 n. 21 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1911, 164 L.Ed.2d 663 (2006). In addition, the district court considered the nature of Clark\u2019s convictions, when it remarked that Clark\u2019s extensive criminal history was replete with convictions for forgery, theft, and possession of a controlled substance. <em>See </em>\u00a7 4A1.3, comment. (n.2(B)). This court has stated that \u201cdrug crimes, and theft ... pose an obvious danger to society.\u201d <em>See United States v. Lee, </em>358 F.3d 315, 329 (5th Cir.2004). Also, the district court\u2019s comments reflect 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s requirement to consider the seriousness of the offense, the need for punishment, deterrence, and protection from future crimes by Clark. Moreover, the degree of the upward departure, which resulted in a guidelines range 14% greater than Clark\u2019s guidelines maximum, was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 492-93 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 713, 163 L.Ed.2d 543 (2005); <em>Simkanin, </em>420 F.3d at 416 n. 21. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s upward departure was not an abuse of discretion and Clark\u2019s sentence was reasonable. <em>See Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 706. Clark\u2019s sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b251-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
