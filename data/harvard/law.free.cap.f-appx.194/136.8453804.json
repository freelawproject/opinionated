Brown appealed the district court\u2019s original sentence of 137 months in prison. We vacated Brown\u2019s sentence and remanded for resentencing, concluding that, under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), Brown\u2019s sentence violated the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-24\">Upon remand, the district court sentenced Brown to 115 months in prison, based on the original guideline calculation as modified to reflect a two-level reduction in offense level granted pursuant to the government\u2019s post-remand Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b) motion for a reduction in sentence. Brown timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-25\">Brown argues that his sentence following <em>Booker </em>violates his due process rights, as informed by ex post facto principles. This claim is foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-26\">Accordingly, we affirm Brown\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
