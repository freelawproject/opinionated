Church\u2019s attorney initially filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), appealing \u201cfrom the judgment, including the sentence,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 1, and raising three potential sentencing errors under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) :(1) the career offender sentence, (2) the calculation of Church\u2019s criminal history, and (3) the calculation of the offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>level. However, counsel asserted that, in his view, there were no meritorious issues for appeal. Church filed a pro se supplemental brief, also alleging <em>Blakely </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">In a supplemental brief filed after the Supreme Court decided <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), Church argues that the district court\u2019s determination that he was a career offender violated the Sixth Amendment and that the district court also erred by applying the guidelines as mandatory. Church maintains that he preserved the issue of the mandatory application of the guidelines by making a <em>Blakely </em>objection to his sentence enhancements and by moving for a downward departure. He further contends that he was prejudiced by the court\u2019s mandatory application of the guidelines because the court\u2019s comments indicated that it likely would have imposed a lower sentence had it not been required to follow the guidelines. As explained below, we affirm Church\u2019s conviction, but we vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Church robbed a bank in Yadkinville, North Carolina, of $1940 on January 6, 2004, and led police on a high-speed chase on the highway and through residential areas. Church managed to evade capture, but he was arrested a few days later. Because Church had prior convictions for bank robbery, breaking and entering, and common law robbery, the court determined that Church qualified for sentencing as a career offender under USSG \u00a7 4B1.1. His guideline range was 151-188 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">The district court overruled Church\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>objection to the career offender designation, then declined to depart downward for diminished capacity based on sexual abuse Church suffered as a child. The court noted that the case was not outside the heartland, but added, \u201cI don\u2019t say that I\u2019m not sympathetic. And on a clean slate, would impose somewhat of a different sentence.\u201d The court opined that a departure was unlikely to be affirmed. Favorably impressed by Church\u2019s allocution, the court indicated that it would impose a sentence that was \u201cconsiderably less\u201d than it would usually impose for a defendant with such a long criminal record. The court imposed a sentence of 156 months imprisonment. The court commented that the sentence was \u201cabout three years less than I would ordinarily give you or in that neighborhood. It\u2019s still a sufficient time, and I think it\u2019s fair to you, fair to the government, and fair to the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">First, Church\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d 515, 521-23 (4th Cir. 2005) (applying <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005)). Church did not dispute that he satisfied the requirements for career offender status; moreover, the court could determine from the judicial record of Church\u2019s prior robbery convictions that each clearly qualified as a crime of violence. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a) <em>&amp; </em>comment. (n.l) (defining \u201c[cjrime of violence\u201d to include robbery). We conclude that no Sixth Amendment violation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">However, the sentencing court erred under <em>Booker </em>in treating the guidelines as mandatory. <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 215 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 668, 163 L.Ed.2d 539 (2005). Because Church objected at sentencing under <em>Blakely </em>to being sentenced as a career offender, we review this claim de novo. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>433 F.3d 411, 415 (4th Cir. 2006) . We conclude that the court\u2019s comments raise a question as to whether it would have imposed a lesser sentence under an advisory guidelines system. Therefore, the government has not shown that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>the mandatory application of the guidelines was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>this court has reviewed the record for other reversible error and found none. We therefore affirm Church\u2019s conviction, but we vacate his sentence and remand the case for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker. </em><footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Although the sentencing guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \u201cconsult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 543 U.S. at 264, 125 S.Ct. 738. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for imposing a non-guidelines sentence as required by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b186-7\"> Just as we noted in <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>\"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district court judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Church\u2019s sentencing. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 545 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
