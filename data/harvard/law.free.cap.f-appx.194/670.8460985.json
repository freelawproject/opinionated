Hammond argues that the district court erred by refusing to grant a mistrial after government witnesses, on two separate occasions, incidentally made improper references to his criminal record. The district court gave a curative instruction after the first objection, but declined to do so after the second so as not to highlight the improper testimony. Having considered the briefs and after reviewing the record, we doubt that the improper testimony substantially influenced the jury\u2019s guilty verdicts, given the weight of the evidence. We also find no indication of prosecutorial misconduct in procuring the testimony. Furthermore, we find no abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion in refusing to grant a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
