He was sentenced to three concurrent terms of imprisonment of 51 months, to be followed by three concurrent three-year terms of supervised release. Furlow now appeals the sentence imposed by the district court upon revoca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>tion of his supervised release. Furlow argues that, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court erred in imposing an unreasonable sentence of imprisonment and an additional term of supervised release. Furlow argues that the district court failed to consider the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). However, Furlow admitted to the court that he was an addict and that he had mental health issues, and defense counsel requested a term of imprisonment so that Furlow could complete the prison drug treatment program. Moreover, Furlow began abusing drugs shortly after being released to supervision, and he admitted that his attempts at self-treatment of his mental health issues had been unsuccessful. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1) &amp; (2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The sentence imposed upon revocation of Furlow\u2019s supervised release did not exceed the statutory maximum term of imprisonment that the district court could have imposed. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3583(e)(3). Furthermore, the district court noted in its written order that it had considered all of the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) in determining Furlow\u2019s sentence. In light of Fur-low\u2019s admissions at the revocation hearing and defense counsel\u2019s agreement that Fur-low needed help, the sentence imposed by the district court was neither \u201cunreasonable\u201d nor \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>See United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 120 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1804, 164 L.Ed.2d 540 (2006). The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b274-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
