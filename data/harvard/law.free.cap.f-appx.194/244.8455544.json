The REAL ID Act limits appellate jurisdiction over petitions for review in cases such as this, where petitioner is a felon, to solely \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Although Trevino-Cavazos phrases his main argument in legal terms (\u201cdisregard of applicable case law\u201d), he uses those terms to cloak a request for review of the BIA\u2019s discretionary decision (the failure to consider \u201chardship\u201d in the balancing of favorable and adverse factors). This argument is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-19\">2. Due process claims are reviewed de novo. <em>DeZavala v. Ashcroft, </em>385 F.3d 879, 883 (5th Cir.2004). \u201cDue process challenges to deportation proceedings require an initial showing of substantial prejudice.\u201d <em>Anwar v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 140, 144 (5th Cir.1997). \u201cThe rules of evidence, including those that exclude hearsay, do not govern deportation proceedings.\u201d <em>Olabanji v. INS, </em>973 F.2d 1232, 1234 (5th Cir.1992) (citations omitted). Trevino-Cavazos does not demonstrate that the information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>contained in the PSR was false or that the IJ would have reached a contrary conclusion even had the PSR not been considered. There has been no showing of \u201csubstantial prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">PETITION DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b267-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined, that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
