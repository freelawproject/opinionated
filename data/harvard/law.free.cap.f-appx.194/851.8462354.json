Stat. \u00a7 796.05(1);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) failing to file a written statement with the Commissioner of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) within five days of \u201ckeep[ing], maintaining], controlling], supporting], or harboring] in any house or place for the purpose of prostitution ... any individual, knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that the individual is an alien,\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2424(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">On appeal, Hernandez argues that the district court clearly erred in finding that the shotgun he possessed was involved in the other felonies because: (1) he was not shown to have actually gained earnings, support, or maintenance from prostitution, as required by Florida state precedent interpreting \u00a7 796.05; (2) the statute sanctions economic gain from prostitution rather than suggesting punishment for weapons violations; and (8) section 2424(a) is only a ministerial reporting requirement, and \u201c[t]he temporary possession of the firearm by [Hernandez] had nothing to do with the non-reporting to the INS and was therefore not connected.\u201d He also appears to argue for the first time on appeal that the offenses under \u00a7 796.05(1) and \u00a7 2424(a) should have been combined, for sentencing purposes and pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 8D1.2,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> with each other and with the offense of conviction because these three offenses occurred contemporaneously and \u201calthough legally distinct offenses, represent!] essentially the same wrongful conduct!.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">\u201cThis court reviews the district court\u2019s application and interpretation of the sentencing guidelines under the <em>de novo </em>standard of review, but reviews its findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d 690, 693 (11th Cir.2002). The district court\u2019s determination that the defendant use a firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d another felony offense is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Whitfield, </em>50 F.3d 947, 949 n. 8 (11th Cir.1995); <em>see also United States v. Gainey, </em>111 F.3d 834, 837 (11th Cir.1997) (holding that district court\u2019s factual finding that the defendant possessed firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d his heroin offense was not clearly erroneous). Because Hernandez did not raise an argument under \u00a7 3D1.2 in the district court, we review this argument for plain error. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1328-29 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide that, for a defendant like Hernandez, who was convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), the base offense level is 14. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6), comment, (n.3). \u201cIf the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense; or possessed or transferred any firearm or ammunition with knowledge, intent, or reason to believe that it would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense,\u201d his offense level is increased by 4 levels, or to a minimum of level 18. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). The Guidelines define the term \u201canother felony offense\u201d as \u201coffenses other than explosives or firearms possession or trafficking offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1, comment. (n.15).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>Because the Guidelines do not define the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d in \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), we have held that the phrase should be interpreted expansively, not restrictively, and \u201cmerely reflects the context of [the defendant\u2019s] possession of the firearm.\u201d <em>See Rhind, </em>289 F.3d at 695 (brackets in original, quotations and citations omitted). \u201c[T]he firearm does not have to facilitate the underlying offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Additionally, even if the \u201cother\u201d offense occurs contemporaneously with, and without a distinction of conduct from, the offense of conviction, the four-level enhancement may still be applied. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>276 F.3d 1231, 1234 (11th Cir.2001) (upholding enhancement where defendant pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, which offense occurred contemporaneously with the \u201cother\u201d state felony of assault and battery of police officers). Further, firearm possession is \u201cin connection with\u201d other criminal activity when the possession \u201cembolden[s]\u201d the defendant to undertake the other criminal activity. <em>See id. </em>at 1234-35 (noting that when defendants\u2019 possession of firearms \u201clen[t] support to an inference that the defendants would have, if necessary, used their firearms in furtherance of their crimes[,]\u201d this inference permitted a finding that the possession was \u201cin connection with\u201d the crimes of conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">The district court did not err, plainly or otherwise, in failing to group Hernandez\u2019s illegal conduct together or clearly err in finding that Hernandez possessed the shotgun in connection with other offenses. First, Hernandez\u2019s argument that the two prostitution-related offenses each constituted just \u201cany other\u201d and not \u201canother\u201d felony offense is without merit because the Guidelines specifically provide that the term \u201canother felony offense\u201d includes \u201coffenses other than explosives or firearms possession or trafficking offenses.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, comment. (n.15). Hernandez\u2019s \u201cother offenses\u201d were prostitution-related offenses, which did not involve explosives, firearms, or trafficking. Likewise, no \u201cdistinction of conduct\u201d between the offense of conviction and the other felony offense need exist. <em>See Jackson, </em>276 F.3d at 1234.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">Additionally, Hernandez\u2019s argument that these offenses should have been grouped together, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2, is without merit. Section 3D1.2 provides that \u201c[a]ll <em>counts </em>involving substantially the same harm shall be grouped together into a single Group.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2 (emphasis added). Hernandez was only charged with <em>one count </em>of firearm possession by an illegal alien. Therefore, there were no <em>counts </em>to be grouped together. <em>Cf. </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2, comment, (n.6) (providing that firearms counts are to be grouped together when \u201c[t]he defendant is convicted of <em>three counts </em>of unlicensed dealing in firearms\u201d) (emphasis added). Thus, the district court did not commit error, plain or otherwise, in applying the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">Furthermore, Hernandez\u2019s argument that these offenses were not \u201cin connection with\u201d his offense of conviction com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>duct also fails. Hernandez admitted to the facts recalled in the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), which stated that he worked for approximately six months at a house where he knew there was a shotgun and loaded it on one occasion; and where he performed the duties of protecting the house (possibly with the aid of the shotgun), and ensuring that patrons paid in advance for sex with individuals whom Hernandez believed to be illegal aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Under our expansive view of the phrase \u201cin connection with,\u201d Hernandez\u2019s admissions provided facts upon which the district court could easily determine that Hernandez\u2019s shotgun possession occurred in connection with both: (1) his derivation of support or maintenance from prostitution, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 796.05(1);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and (2) his failure to file a written statement with the Commissioner of the INS within five days of keeping, maintaining, controlling, supporting, or harboring individuals he knew to be aliens in the house for the purpose of prostitution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2424(a). <em>See Rhind, </em>289 F.3d at 695 (concluding that this Court expansively interprets the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d). Like the defendants discussed in <em>Jackson, </em>Hernandez\u2019s shotgun possession, which he admitted served to protect the prostitution house, emboldened him in undertaking his other criminal activities of earning money from prostitution and failing to report prostitution performed by illegal aliens. <em>See Jackson, </em>276 F.3d at 1234-35 (defendants\u2019 firearm possession \u201clen[t] support to an inference that the defendants would have, if necessary, used their firearms in furtherance of their crimes\u201d). Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in applying the four-level enhancement, and we affirm Hernandez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b874-12\">. This violation is punishable up to five years imprisonment. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 775.082(3)(d), 796.05(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b875-7\">. This violation is punishable up to 10 years imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2424(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b875-8\">. This guideline provides that ''[a]ll counts involving substantially the same harm shall be grouped together into a single Group.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b875-9\">. To establish plain error, Hernandez must show that there is: \"(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1328-29 (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b876-5\">. Hernandez\u2019s citation of <em>United States v. Szakacs, </em>212 F.3d 344 (7th Cir.2000) (persuasive authority), is unpersuasive. In <em>Szakacs, </em>the defendants were convicted for conspiracy to steal firearms from a licensed dealer, and the Seventh Circuit refused to apply \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5)\u2019s four-level enhancement for the \"other\u201d state felony of conspiracy to commit burglary because \"the state law offense and the federal offense were essentially the same crime.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 349-50. Here, however, Hernandez\u2019s offense of conviction (firearm possession by an illegal alien) is substantively different than the prostitution-related offenses underlying the enhancement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b877-6\">. Hernandez's contention that the government did not show that he derived support from prostitution is without merit because he admitted to <em>working </em>for six months as a doorman at a house of prostitution. <em>Cf. State v. Morris, </em>540 So.2d 226 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1989) (holding that merely getting support from someone known to engage in prostitution is insufficient for a conviction under \u00a7 796.05(1)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
