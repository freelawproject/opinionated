Alexander appeals his 180-month sentence for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, he argues the district court violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) \u2014 which, in relevant part, requires a district court to \u201cimpose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d \u2014 because it failed to state on the record that his sentence was \u201cnot greater than necessary.\u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">The parties are familiar with the facts, and we do not recount them here. Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), \u00a7 3553(a) \u201c \u2018remains in effect, and sets forth numerous factors that guide sentencing. Those factors in turn will guide appellate courts, as they have in the past, in determining whether a sentence is unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 766). Although <em>Booker </em>directs district courts to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires a district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1328-29 (11th Cir.2005). Rather, a statement that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is sufficient in <em>post-Booker </em>sentences. <em>Id. </em>at 1329.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-13\">After carefully reviewing the sentencing transcript, the parties\u2019 briefs, and the relevant case law, we reject Alexander\u2019s argument that the district court violated \u00a7 3553(a) by failing to state on the record that his sentence was \u201cnot greater than necessary.\u201d At the sentencing hearing, the district court stated it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and \u201cthe facts and circumstances surrounding this particular case\u201d before imposing the mandatory statutory minimum sentence of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment. As explained above, such statements alone are sufficient to support a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We thus affirm Alexander\u2019s 180-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b907-10\">. The mandatory statutory minimum sentence for Alexander\u2019s offense is 180 months, which is greater than his advisoiy Guidelines range of 135-168 months; thus, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(b), his Guidelines sentence is also 180 months. Because the Government did not file a substantial assistance motion, the district court lacked discretion to sentence him below this 180-month sentence. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1333 n. 10 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that district courts remain bound by statutory m\u00ednimums despite <em>Booker's </em>remedial holding that the Guidelines are merely advisory). Although Alexander concedes that \"the district court had no discretion but to impose the 180-month sentence,\" he nevertheless brings this appeal because he believes \"it will change the [sentencing] process.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b907-17\">. To the extent Alexander implicitly contends his sentence is \"greater than reasonable\" (i.e., unreasonable), we conclude he has failed to carry his burden of establishing his sentence is unreasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>tors. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
