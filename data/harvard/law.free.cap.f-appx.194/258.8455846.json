President\u2019s IFP motion is a challenge to the magistrate judge\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">President\u2019s change in custodial status, as alleged in his complaint, does not affect a protectable liberty interest or violate his constitutional rights. <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 486, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995). Further, President did not allege that the loss of his good time credits pursuant to a disciplinary proceeding violated the procedural protections provided by <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 556, 564-66, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974), or allege that he received any other punishment that would implicate a due process concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">President\u2019s retaliation claims likewise fail because he does not show that but for his grievance filed in December 2000 regarding the prison\u2019s smoking policy, he would not have been subject to disciplinary proceedings. <em>Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1166 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">President has not shown that the district court erred in certifying that an appeal would not be taken in good faith. He has not shown that he will present a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, the motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-14\">The dismissal of this appeal counts as one strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). President is CAUTIONED that if he accumulates three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-15\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b281-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
