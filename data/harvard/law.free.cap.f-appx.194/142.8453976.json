This court previously granted a certificate of appealability and issued a limited remand solely for the purpose of directing the district court to determine whether Robeson\u2019s counsel failed to file a notice of appeal from the criminal judgment after being directed to do so. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Giving Robeson the benefit of the doubt, the district court granted relief under <em>United States v. Peak, </em>992 F.2d 39 (4th Cir.1993), vacated the criminal judgment and reinstated the judgment to afford Robeson the opportunity to file a direct appeal. We note that Robeson\u2019s direct appeal currently is pending before this court. Because the remaining claims on which the district court denied \u00a7 2255 relief may be raised in the reinstated direct appeal, we grant Robeson\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability, modify the district court\u2019s dismissal of Robeson\u2019s remaining claims to be without prejudice, and affirm the dismissal as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Robeson\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel and for general relief are denied. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
