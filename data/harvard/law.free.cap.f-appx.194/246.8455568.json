Reviewing for abuse of discretion, we affirm for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-26\">1. Pursuant to immigration regulations, a filing fee is required in connection with the filing of a motion to reopen, unless the motion to reopen \u201cis based exclusively on an application for relief [such as asylum] that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>does not require a fee.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.24(b)(2)(i)(2005). Siewe\u2019s motion to reopen is not based exclusively on an asylum application. Siewe\u2019s original application for asylum was withdrawn and the proceeding below addressed only the merits of her 1-130 request for adjustment of status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Siewe\u2019s motion to reopen was based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. While that claim was related to advice Siewe received regarding asylum, Siewe\u2019s motion to reopen did not address her eligibility for asylum, and she did not attach an asylum application to the motion. <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 1003.23(b)(3) (a motion to reopen for the purpose of acting on an application for relief must be accompanied by the application and all supporting documents).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">2. Because the basis of Siewe\u2019s motion to reopen did not fall within the fee exemptions set out in \u00a7 1003.8, we agree with the BIA\u2019s determination that a filing fee was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">3. Because we conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen for lack of a filing fee, we do not address Siewe\u2019s argument that her motion met the requirements of <em>In re Lozada, </em>19 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 637, 1988 WL 235454 (BIA 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b268-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
