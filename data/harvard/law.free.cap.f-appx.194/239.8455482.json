Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Jauregui argues that his sentence was not reasonable because the guideline range was not properly calculated. He argues that the two previous loads of cocaine were improperly included because he had not admitted these facts at his rearraignment and so it was constitutionally impermissible to count them. Jauregui objected in writing in the district court to the calculation of drug quantity based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). He properly preserved his objection. <em>United States v. Medina-Anicacio, </em>325 F.3d 638, 642 (5th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Mesa, </em>443 F.3d 397, 404 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-14\">By rendering the Guidelines advisory, <em>Booker </em>eliminated the Sixth Amendment concerns that prohibited a sentencing judge from finding facts relevant to sentencing. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Consequently, following <em>Booker, </em>\u201c[t]he sentencing judge is entitled to find by a preponderance of the evidence all the facts relevant to the determination of a Guideline sentencing range and all facts relevant to the determination of a non-Guidelines sentence.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 553 (5th Cir.2006)(district court can consider relevant conduct, even if defendant does not admit conduct, without violating Sixth Amendment). Jauregui\u2019s argument that his sentence was unreasonable because his guideline range was not properly calculated in violation of the Sixth Amendment is without merit. <em>See Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 553-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-18\">Jauregui argues that the district court erred in not awarding him a two-level adjustment under the safety-valve provision pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 5C1.2 and 2Dl.l(b)(7). According to the Government, Jauregui was not forthcoming in providing all the information he had with regard to his role in a larger conspiracy. Jauregui has not shown that the district court clearly erred. <em>United States v. Treft, </em>447 F.3d 421, 426 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-19\">Jauregui argues that the district court erred in not giving him a minor role adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>\u00a7 3B1.2(b). He argues that he was a \u201cmule\u201d or courier of drugs, did not give directives to others or recruit accomplices, and was not a wholesaler or distributor. The record indicates that Jauregui played an integral role in transporting 55.75 kilograms of cocaine hidden in a vehicle and that he pleaded guilty to substantive counts of possessing the cocaine with an intent to distribute and to importing cocaine. The persons hiring him trusted him enough to give him sole possession of a large quantity of cocaine. Jauregui admitted that he had transported two previous loads. The district court did not clearly err in finding that Jauregui was not entitled to a downward adjustment for a mitigating role in the offense. <em>United States v. Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d 135, 138 (5th Cir. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b262-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
