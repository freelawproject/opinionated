Saintilma argues that the IJ applied the wrong legal standard and erroneously determined that he did not suffer past persecution and did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution. He also argues that the IJ erroneously determined that he was fleeing from general civil strife and could relocate within Haiti.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">Saintilma\u2019s asylum claim is based on two incidents in which the Chimere, a group supporting former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide, threatened him because Saintilma is opposed to Aristide. We conclude from a review of the record that the BIA\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, and the record does not compel a conclusion contrary to the IJ\u2019s findings that the encounters with the Chimere do not rise to the level of persecution and that Saintilma failed to show a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 187 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 304 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b255-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
