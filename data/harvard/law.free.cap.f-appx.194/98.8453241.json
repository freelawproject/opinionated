Hernandez-Sanchez\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising three issues but stating that he finds no meritorious grounds for appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Hernandez-Sanchez asserts that the district court erred by failing to sustain his objection to a two-point increase in his criminal history calculation for committing the offense of illegal reentry into the United States while under a criminal justice sentence. The record reflects, however, that Hernandez-Sanchez was under a criminal justice sentence on the date he was \u201cfound in\u201d the United States, August 8, 2004. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a)(2). We therefore find that the district court did not err in adding these points pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4Al.l(d) (2004), in the calculation of Hernandez-Sanchez\u2019s advisory guideline range. In addition, the district court did not err in declining to resolve an objection regarding one criminal history point from a disputed South Carolina conviction because that single point did not affect Hernandez-Sanchez\u2019s Criminal History Category. Finally, the sixty-month sentence the district court imposed was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Hernandez-Sanchez\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b121-9\"> The Government did not file an answering brief, and although advised of his right to do so, Hernandez-Sanchez did not file a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
