Vasil sues Appellee United Parcel Service Claims Review Committee (the Committee) pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq., </em>claiming the Committee erred when it denied her benefit payments under an employer-provided group long-term disability policy. The district court conducted a de novo review and concluded the Committee\u2019s benefits-denial decision was not \u201cwrong.\u201d Accordingly, the district court granted the Committee summary judgment under the first step of the test we articulated in <em>Williams v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc. See </em>373 F.3d 1132, 1138 (11th Cir.2004) (stating the district court\u2019s first step in reviewing a claim administrator\u2019s benefits-denial decision is to \u201c[a]pply the <em>de novo </em>standard to determine whether the claim administrator\u2019s benefits-denial decision is \u2018wrong\u2019 <em>(i e., </em>the court disagrees with the administrator\u2019s decision); if it is not, then end the inquiry and affirm the decision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-21\">On appeal, Vasil argues the first step of the <em>Williams </em>test contravenes the precedent the Supreme Court established in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number><em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </em>489 U.S. 101, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989). Recognizing that this panel cannot overturn <em>Williams, </em>Vasil petitioned for hearing en banc on May 26, 2006. <em>See Morrison v. Amway Corp., </em>323 F.3d 920, 929 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201cA prior panel decision of this Court is binding on subsequent panels and can be overturned only by the Court sitting en banc.\u201d). No judge in regular service on the Court requested that the Court be polled on hearing en banc, however, and we denied Vasil\u2019s petition on August 23, 2006. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 35; 11th Cir. R. 35-5. <em>Williams </em>thus remains binding precedent in our circuit, and Vasil\u2019s challenge to the first step of the <em>Williams </em>test must fail. Moreover, after reviewing the record, the parties\u2019 briefs, and the relevant case law, we conclude the district court did not err when it determined the Committee\u2019s benefits-denial decision was not \u201cwrong.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We accordingly affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-6\">. In the interests of thoroughness, the district court also analyzed Vasil\u2019s claim under the <em>Williams </em>test's four remaining steps and held the Committee was entitled to summary judgment under these steps as well. Because we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the Committee's benefits-denial decision was not \u201cwrong\u201d under the first step of the <em>Williams </em>test, we need not address the district court's alternative holdings that the Committee was also entitled to summary judgment under the other steps of the <em>Williams </em>test.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
