He appeals the two-year term of imprisonment imposed following the revocation of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Although that two-year term exceeded the sentencing range indicated by the policy statements in chapter 7 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, it did not exceed the statutory maximum term of imprisonment the district court could have imposed. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Accordingly, Rivera\u2019s revocation sentence was neither \u201cunreasonable\u201d nor \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>See United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 120 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1804, 164 L.Ed.2d 540 (2006).
