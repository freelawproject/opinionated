He argues that the evidence presented in support of the enhancement of his sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), was not sufficiently reliable to support the district court\u2019s finding that he had three qualifying predicate offenses under the ACCA, and his sentence thus was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">Section 924(e) subjects a defendant convicted under \u00a7 922(g) to a minimum sentence of 15 years if he has three prior convictions for \u201ca violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another.\u201d \u00a7 924(e)(1). The Government presented no evidence whatsoever to support the fact of Meyer\u2019s prior convictions as required under <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 601-02, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), and <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 15-16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). <em>See id.; United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 274 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005); <em>United States v. Martinez-Cortez, </em>988 F.2d 1408, 1415 &amp; n. 30 (5th Cir.1993). Accordingly, Meyer\u2019s sentence is vacated and the case is remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-15\">On remand, the district court should order the Government to supplement the record with documentary evidence authorized under <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Shepard </em>to aide its determination of whether Meyer\u2019s prior convictions warrant the ACCA enhancement. <em>See United States v. Bonilla-Mungia, </em>422 F.3d 316, 321 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 819, 163 L.Ed.2d 644 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-18\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING; DISTRICT COURT DIRECTED TO ALLOW SUPPLEMENTATION OF THE RECORD.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b277-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
