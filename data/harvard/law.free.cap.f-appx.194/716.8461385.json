Davis appeals his sentence after pleading guilty to two counts of possession with intent to distribute and distribution of crack cocaine. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. Davis argues that (1) his sentence should be vacated because he was entitled to sentencing by a different district court judge after the government breached its obligation under his plea agreement and (2) his sentence under section 841(b) violates <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-25\">On three occasions in January 2004, Davis sold crack cocaine to an undercover agent of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Davis was arrested and in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>dieted on three counts of possession with intent to distribute and distribution of crack cocaine. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. Davis entered a written plea agreement in which the government agreed to dismiss the third count of the indictment and recommend a sentence \u201cat the low end of the applicable guideline range\u201d in exchange for Davis\u2019s pleading guilty to the first two charges. On August 4, 2005, Davis pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">At Davis\u2019s sentencing hearing, the district court calculated a guidelines range of 84 to 105 months of imprisonment. The government recommended a sentence \u201cwithin the guidelines range.\u201d The district court commented on Davis\u2019s prior drug convictions and sentenced Davis to 100 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">After the district court adjourned the hearing, Davis reminded the government of its obligation to recommend a sentence at the low end of the guidelines range. The government requested that the district court reopen the sentencing hearing and advised the district court that it was \u201ccontractually bound to recommend\u201d a sentence of 84 months. The district court reopened the hearing and permitted both parties an opportunity to argue. The district court then stated that it does not always follow the recommendation of the government, spent a \u201clong time looking through [Davis\u2019s] background,\u201d and determined that the sentence of 100 months was an \u201cappropriate and fair sentence, given the crime involved, given the defendant\u2019s background, and given the defendant\u2019s history.\u201d Davis did not object to the sentence or that it was imposed by the same district court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>the remedy for a violation of a plea agreement by the government. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>132 F.3d 628, 631 (11th Cir.1998). We review <em>de novo </em>the constitutionality of a statute. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>364 F.3d 1266, 1268 (11th Cir.2004). \u2018We review arguments raised for the first time on appeal for plain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Clark, </em>274 F.3d 1325, 1325 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">Davis argues that resentencing by the same district court judge was an insufficient remedy for the breach of the plea agreement by the government. Because Davis failed to object to this remedy, we review for plain error. <em>See id. </em>We will find plain error only where (1) there is an error in the district court\u2019s determination; (2) the error is plain or obvious; (3) the error affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights in that it was prejudicial and not harmless; and (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Chisholm, </em>73 F.3d 304, 307 (11th Cir.1996)). \u201cIn regard to this third prong, \u2018it is the defendant rather than the government who bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1299 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1778, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">Even if the district court committed error that is plain by reopening the sentencing hearing and resentencing Davis, <em>see Johnson, </em>132 F.3d at 631, Davis cannot establish prejudice. Davis must establish a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that his sentence would have been lower. <em>Id. </em>Davis offers no evidence that his sentence would have been lower had his sentencing been reassigned to an \u201cuntainted\u201d district court judge. To the contrary, the district court stated that it considered the recommendation of the government but chose not to follow it because of Davis\u2019s conduct, background, and history. Davis suffered no prejudice when he was resentenced by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>same district court judge after the breach was brought to the attention of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Davis also argues that his sentence is unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, because section 841(b) allows facts not found by a jury to increase the sentence beyond the statutory maximum. Davis failed to raise this argument before the district court, and this Court recently held that section 841 does not violate <em>Apprendi </em>and its progeny. <em>See United States v. Underwood, </em>446 F.3d 1340, 1345 (11th Cir.2006). We find no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
