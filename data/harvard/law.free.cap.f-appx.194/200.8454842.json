The court transferred the action to this court under the authority of the Real ID Act. <em>See </em>Real ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, 302-11 (May 11, 2005). The Real ID Act instructs district courts to transfer to the appropriate courts of appeals all \u00a7 2241 petitions challenging final orders of removal, deportation, or exclusion \u201cpending in a district court on the date of the enactment of the Act,\u201d May 11, 2005. 119 Stat. 231, 311; <em>see Rosales v. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, </em>426 F.3d 733, 736 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1055, 163 L.Ed.2d 882 (2006). Because Bentley\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition was not pending in the district court on May 11, 2005, the transfer of the case to this court under the Real ID Act was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-17\">Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 permits a transfer if this court would have been able to exercise jurisdiction on the date the case was filed in the district court, the district court lacked jurisdiction over the case, and the transfer is in the interest of justice. Despite Bentley\u2019s argument that this court has jurisdiction to consider his nationality claim, we lack jurisdiction to determine his claims, because his petition was not filed within thirty days of a final order of removal and because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-18\">The petition for review is therefore DISMISSED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION. The motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b223-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
