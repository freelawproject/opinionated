The district court concluded that the suit is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-17\">With the benefit of liberal construction, we glean that Douglas argues that defendants exposed him to an unreasonable risk of harm to his health by removing a medical restriction on his work assignment and requiring that he work in the prison laundry. Although Douglas has a history of cardiac and kidney problems, he has failed to show that defendants knowingly assigned him to sedentary work knowing that the classification would significantly aggravate his condition; Douglas\u2019s disagreement with his medical classification does not state a constitutional claim. <em>See Wilson v. Budney, </em>976 F.2d 957, 958 (5th Cir.1992); <em>Jackson v. Cain, </em>864 F.2d 1235, 1246 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-20\">Douglas\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Douglas is cautioned that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous, and the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint as frivolous, count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). He is warned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be permitted to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-21\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b214-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
