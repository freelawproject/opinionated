Hynds-Matute argues that he should have received a minor-role reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, and that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence when it failed to calculate correctly the guidelines imprisonment range by not accounting for a minor-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-18\">We review the district court\u2019s finding concerning the defendant\u2019s role in the offense for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir. 1999) (en banc). The defendant bears the burden of proving that he played a minor role by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2002). We cannot conclude on this record that the district court clearly erred in declining to apply a minor-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-19\">We also review a defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence for reasonableness in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005). The burden of proving that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and these factors rests on the challenger. <em>United States v. Talley, 431 </em>F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-20\">To impose a reasonable sentence, the district court must correctly calculate the guidelines imprisonment range and then consider the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Hynds-Matute\u2019s only argument of unreasonableness is based on the district court\u2019s refusal to grant him a minor-role reduction. As noted above, this refusal was not clearly erroneous. Furthermore, the district court correctly calculated the guidelines imprisonment range and sentenced Hynds-Matute at the bottom of the range, explicitly acknowledging that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors before imposing its sentence. There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>fore, Hynds-Matute has failed to prove that his sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
