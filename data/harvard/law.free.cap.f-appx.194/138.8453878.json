We previously vacated his 188-month sentence and remanded for resentencing in accordance with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). On remand, the district court determined that the applicable guideline range was 188 to 235 months of imprisonment. The court then heard argument from the parties regarding the 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2006) factors and ultimately decided that the previous sentence was both reasonable and appropriate. On appeal, Scott contends that his sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-17\">We review a district court\u2019s sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). \u201cConsistent with the remedial scheme set forth in <em>Booker, </em>a district court shall first calculate (after making the appropriate findings of fact) the range prescribed by the guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546. Scott does not assert that the district court erred in determining the applicable advisory guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-18\">Next, the district court must consider this range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and \u00a7 3553(a) and impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47. \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-19\">A sentence may be unreasonable for either procedural or substantive reasons. \u201cA sentence may be procedurally unrea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>sonable, for example, if the district court provides an inadequate statement of reasons or fails to make a necessary factual finding.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 434 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). While a district court must consider the various factors in \u00a7 3553(a) and explain its sentence, it need not \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection\u201d or \u201cexplicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>445 F.3d at 345. \u201cThis is particularly the case when the district court imposes a sentence within the applicable Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">In this case, the district court calculated the guideline range and heard the arguments of counsel that discussed <em>inter alia </em>Scott\u2019s post-sentencing rehabilitation and attempts to provide substantial assistance. In addition, the court stated that it considered Scott\u2019s written memorandum. Although the district court did not discuss its sentencing deliberations in great detail, the court specifically cited <em>Booker, Hughes, </em>and \u00a7 3553 and imposed a sentence at the low end of the advisory guideline range. We find that, contrary to Scott\u2019s assertions, the sentencing transcript reflects that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and adequately explained its reasoning in selecting the sentence imposed. Moreover, Scott has failed to overcome the presumption that his sentence, at the low end of the guideline range, was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Accordingly, we affirm Scott\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
