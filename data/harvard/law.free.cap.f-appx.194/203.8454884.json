Bennett asserts that the sentence is above the advisory sentencing guidelines range and is plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-26\">Since <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we have yet to determine whether sentences imposed following the revocation of supervised release should be reviewed under the plainly unreasonable standard previously applicable or the unreasonableness standard set forth in <em>Booker, </em>and we need not do so in this case, because the sentence passes muster under either standard. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number><em>United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 119-20 (5th Cir.2005). The sentencing guidelines pertaining to supervised release revocations have always been advisory, and the sentence is less than the statutory maximum. <em>See id.; </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Bennett\u2019s most serious supervised release violation was a drug offense involving more than 400 grams of cocaine and 600 grams of cocaine base. The original sentence was the result of a downward departure from the applicable guideline range, a factor that can warrant an upward departure under the guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4, comment, (n.4). The sentence was neither unreasonable nor plainly unreasonable. <em>See Hinson, </em>429 F.3d at 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b225-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
