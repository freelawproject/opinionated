Following the due process hearing, the hearing officer concluded, by decision of August 25, 2003 (the \u201cAdministrative Decision\u201d), that the Board\u2019s proposal (the \u201cProposed IEP\u201d) was legally insufficient under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1400 <em>el seq. </em>(the \u201cIDEA\u201d). Thus, the Board was ordered to develop an appropriate IEP for A.L. in accordance with the IDEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-17\">In December 2003, the Board filed its complaint in the district court, seeking review of the Administrative Decision. Thereafter, by Opinion and Order of January 18, 2005, <em>County Sch. Bd. of York </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number><em>County, Va. v. A.L., </em>No. CA-03-174 (E.D. Va. filed Jan. 18, 2005) (the \u201cCourt Decision\u201d), the court affirmed the three rulings of the Administrative Decision challenged by the Board in this appeal: (1) that the Board committed procedural violations regarding the Proposed IEP (the \u201cProcedural Ruling\u201d); (2) that the sign language communication assistance contemplated by the Proposed IEP failed to comply with Virginia\u2019s regulations (the \u201cSign Language Ruling\u201d); and (3) that A.L. is entitled to an IEP providing him with direct occupational therapy services (the \u201cOT Ruling\u201d). Additionally, at oral argument the Board asserted, for the first time, that the Court Decision should be vacated on mootness grounds. As explained below, we reject the Board\u2019s contentions and affirm the district court\u2019s order that an IEP be developed \u201cwhich provides A.L. a [free appropriate public education] under the IDEA.\u201d Court Decision at 12.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">A.L. is a 20-year-old student at Grafton High School in York County, Virginia. As a result of Down Syndrome, A.L. has difficulty speaking, and he must use sign language to clarify his communications with others. Because of his disability, A.L. is eligible for special education and related services by the Board. His access to such education and services is governed by the IDEA, which mandates that school districts provide IEPs for disabled students. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(d). Under the IDEA, an IEP is a written statement setting forth a school district\u2019s plan for educating and accommodating a child with a disability, prepared by an \u201cIEP team\u201d consisting of a representative of the school district, the disabled student\u2019s teachers, the student\u2019s parents, and the student. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1414(d)(1)(A)-(B); <em>MM v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville County, </em>303 F.3d 523, 527 (4th Cir.2002). An IEP must contain statements concerning the disabled student\u2019s level of functioning, set forth measurable annual achievement goals, describe the services to be provided, and establish objective criteria for evaluating the child\u2019s progress. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1414(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">The Board first developed and implemented an IEP for A.L. in June 2001. A.L.\u2019s IEP was thereafter revised by certain addenda, the most recent in August 2002. Although the IEP team members met several times during the 2002-2003 school year to develop a new IEP for A.L., they were unable to reach any consensus. During that time, A.L.\u2019s parents expressed their desire for him to participate in the Virginia Alternate Assessment Program (the \u2018VAAP\u201d), a test employed to assess the performance of students, such as A.L., who have traditionally been exempt from educational assessment programs. A chief source of disagreement among the IEP team members concerned whether A.L. should receive sign language services consistent with Virginia\u2019s Regulations Governing Special Education Programs. The IEP team members also disagreed on whether A.L. was required to continue receiving direct OT services. Although the Proposed IEP resulted from these meetings and various discussions among the IEP team, it was not agreed to by A.L.\u2019s parents because it failed to provide A.L. with direct OT services and a sign language interpreter (an \u201cSLI\u201d) meeting the qualifications for an SLI, as established by the pertinent Virginia regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">In May 2003, the Board requested a due process hearing, pursuant to 20 U.S.C \u00a7 1415(f)(1)(A), seeking authorization to implement the Proposed IEP. As a result of this request, a hearing officer was appointed by the Virginia Department of Education\u2019s Division of Special Education, and the due process hearing was conducted over a period of five days in July and August 2003 (the \u201cHearing\u201d). The Hearing revealed, inter alia, that A.L. had been excluded from participation in the VAAP. A.L.\u2019s parents had earlier agreed with the Board that A.L. should participate in the VAAP, and that agreement had been spelled out in an earlier draft of the Proposed IEP. See Administrative Decision at 44;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>see also </em>J.A. 44-46. The parents first learned at the Hearing, however, that the Board had removed the VAAP provision from the Proposed IEP because A.L. had been \u201cpromoted\u201d to the twelfth grade, which, the Board asserted, rendered him (at the time of the Hearing) ineligible for the VAAP. Administrative Decision at 6. On August 25, 2003, by the Administrative Decision, the hearing officer concluded that the Proposed IEP was legally insufficient under the IDEA because it failed to provide A.L. with a \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d (a \u201cFAPE\u201d). The Administrative Decision also detailed the hearing officer\u2019s findings and conclusions in connection with its rulings, which are summarized, in pertinent part, below.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">On the Procedural Ruling, the hearing officer concluded that the Board had contravened the IDEA\u2019S requirements in two ways: (1) it had revised the Proposed IEP to exclude A.L. from participation in the VAAP, without notifying A.L. and his parents of its decision; and (2) it had failed to inform A.L. and his parents that the revision to the Proposed IEP triggered their due process rights. <em>See </em>Administrative Decision at 45. The hearing officer observed that A.L.\u2019s parents had requested (during the May 5, 2003 IEP team meeting) that he participate in the VAAP, but the Board later decided that he should not do so. <em>Id. </em>at 44-45. The officer also found that the Board\u2019s failure to permit A.L. to participate in the VAAP, as well as its failure to properly notify his parents thereof, had impaired A.L.\u2019s ability to receive an IEP appropriately formulated for his individual needs and abilities. <em>Id. </em>at 45. Moreover, the officer observed that A.L.\u2019s promotion to the twelfth grade \u201cappears to be one in name only as [A.L.] made minimal progress, at best, in core subjects and he will remain a 12th grader for 3 years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The hearing officer then concluded that the Board\u2019s procedural violations rendered the Proposed IEP legally insufficient under the IDEA, and she ordered the Board to formulate a new IEP consistent with IDEA-mandated procedures. <em>Id. </em>at 51-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Next, with respect to the Sign Language Ruling, the Proposed IEP called for A.L. to receive \u201c[cjommunication [assistance with expressive language/oral communication with peers and teachers,\u201d which assistance was to \u201cinclude use of basic sign language as appropriate.\u201d <em>See </em>Administrative Decision at 46; <em>see also </em>J.A. 42. The Proposed IEP did not specify, however, who was to provide such communication assistance to A.L. J.A. 42. The hearing officer determined that the Proposed IEP was defective with respect to communication assistance services in two ways: (1) it was an inadequate accommodation of A.L.\u2019s Down Syndrome <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>disability, as well as of his Oral Motor Apraxia (\u201cOMA\u201d), a condition of the palate interfering with articulation;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (2) it did not satisfy Virginia\u2019s Regulations Governing Special Education Programs, because the Board proposed utilizing a \u201cteacher assistant (basic sign language)\u201d who did not satisfy the requirements of an SLI under the Virginia regulations. <em>Id. </em>at 46-48. Accordingly, the hearing officer mandated that the Board provide A.L. with a qualified SLI throughout the school year. <em>Id. </em>at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Finally, with regard to the OT Ruling, A.L.\u2019s parents and the Board disputed whether A.L required direct OT services in order to offset his deficiencies in the use of fine motor and visual skills. <em>See </em>Administrative Decision at 48. According to occupational therapist Julie Herndon, who had been providing A.L. with direct OT services since 2001, he did not require OT services at all, based on her 2001 assessment. <em>Id. </em>at 31. Thus, as a compromise, the Board incorporated consultative (rather than direct) OT services into the Proposed IEP, maintaining that such services sufficiently satisfied A.L.\u2019s needs. <em>Id. </em>at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">In determining that the Board should continue to provide A.L. with direct OT services, however, the hearing officer rejected Herndon\u2019s evaluation and the Board\u2019s proposed solution, as well as the testimony of Dr. Lawrence Leichtman, A.L.\u2019s treating physician and a specialist in mental retardation. Instead, the Board credited a medical evaluation of A.L. submitted by his parents, which had been made in 2003, two years after the evaluation relied upon by the Board. <em>See </em>Administrative Decision at 49. The 2003 evaluation by occupational therapist Kristin Weisz indicated that A.L. was \u201cslow,\u201d that he had difficulty with bilateral tasks and bilateral hand use, and that he required direct OT services. <em>Id. </em>at 32. Based on this more recent evaluation and Weisz\u2019s recommendation, the hearing officer ordered the Board to continue providing A.L. with direct OT services. <em>Id. </em>at 52.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">On December 30, 2003, the Board filed its complaint in the Eastern District of Virginia, pursuant to 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A), seeking to overturn the adverse rulings of the Administrative Decision. On January 18, 2005, after reviewing the record of the administrative proceedings and considering additional evidence submitted by the Board (as authorized under \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A)), the court upheld the Procedural Ruling, the Sign Language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Ruling, and the OT Ruling, concluding that the Board had not carried its burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the hearing officer\u2019s determinations on these issues were erroneous. <em>See </em>Court Decision at 11-12.\u00ae The court thus ordered the Board to \u201cdevelop an IEP which provides A.L. a FAPE under the IDEA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Board has timely appealed, and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">As a preliminary matter, the Board asserted at oral argument (for the first time), and thereafter by way of a supplemental brief, that a February 28, 2006 IEP addendum (the \u201c2006 Addendum\u201d) served as a \u201creplacement IEP which substantially alters A.L.\u2019s placement and moots the issues in the case.\u201d <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Supp. Br. at 1. Specifically, the Board contends that the 2006 Addendum removed the goals and objectives of the Proposed IEP, with the exception of speech and language therapy, to address vocational training needs and measure the progress of vocational skills. <em>Id. </em>at 7. Accordingly, the Board has requested that we vacate the Court Decision and remand with instructions to dismiss its complaint. A.L. correctly asserts, however, that the issues on appeal have not been rendered moot by the 2006 Addendum because it does not constitute, and the parties have not agreed to, \u201cany IEP addressing or resolving the issues before this Court.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Supp. Br. at 7. Specifically, the 2006 Addendum does not allow A.L. to participate in VAAP, and it does not provide him with a qualified SLI in accordance with Virginia\u2019s regulations, or with direct OT services, all of which A.L. and his parents continue to seek. As the parties have not agreed on the services A.L. is to be provided, the controversies with respect to the Administrative Decision are ongoing and viable, and the issues on appeal are not moot. <em>See City of Erie v. Pap\u2019s A.M., </em>529 U.S. 277, 277, 120 S.Ct. 1382, 146 L.Ed.2d 265 (2000) (observing that case is moot when issues presented no longer constitute live controversy or when parties are without legal interest in outcome). Thus, we reject the Board\u2019s mootness contention, and turn to the merits of the other issues it has raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s interpretations of the IDEA. <em>See AW v. Fairfax County Sch. Bd., </em>372 F.3d 674, 677 (4th Cir.2004). When a district court reviews a hearing officer\u2019s administrative decision under the IDEA, it is obliged to make an \u201cindependent decision based on a preponderance of the evidence,\u201d according \u201cdue weight\u201d to the officer\u2019s findings. <em>Id. As </em>we have explained, such a court should, \u201cto the extent possible, defer to the considered rulings of the administrative officers, who also must give appropriate deference to the decisions of professional educators.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number><em>MM v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville County, </em>303 F.3d 523, 533 (4th Cir.2002). Findings of fact made in such administrative proceedings are \u201cconsidered prima facie correct, and if a reviewing court fails to adhere to them, it is obliged to explain why.\u201d <em>G v. Fort Bragg Dependent Schs., </em>343 F.3d 295, 302 (4th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). And, of course, a party challenging the conclusions of a hearing officer bears the burden of establishing that such rulings were erroneous. <em>See Spielberg v. Henrico County Pub. Schs., </em>853 F.2d 256, 258 n. 2 (4th Cir.1988). When additional evidence has been received and considered by a district court, we review any findings of fact premised thereon for clear error. <em>See G, </em>343 F.3d at 302 n. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Congress enacted the IDEA in 1990 to \u201censure that all children with disabilities receive a [FAPE],\u201d that includes \u201cthe special education and related services required to meet the unique needs\u201d of disabled children. <em>See MM v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville County, </em>303 F.3d 523, 526 (4th Cir.2002). Under the IDEA, a FAPE must provide a disabled child with meaningful access to the educational process, and it must be reasonably calculated to confer some educational benefit on the child. <em>See Bd. of Educ. v. Rowley, </em>458 U.S. 176, 207, 102 S.Ct. 3034, 73 L.Ed.2d 690 (1982). Such an educational benefit must be provided to the disabled child in the least restrictive environment available, with the child participating, to the extent possible, in the same activities as non-disabled children. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(5)(A). And while a school district \u201cmust provide specialized instruction and related services sufficient to confer some educational benefit upon the handicapped child, ... the Act does not require the furnishing of every special service necessary to maximize each handicapped child\u2019s potential.\u201d <em>Hartmann v. Loudoun County Bd. of Educ., </em>118 F.3d 996, 1001 (4th Cir.1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">The IDEA establishes a series of elaborate procedural safeguards, which are \u201cdesigned to ensure that the parents or guardian of a child with a disability are both notified of decisions affecting their child and given an opportunity to object to these decisions.\u201d <em>Gadsby v. Grasmick, </em>109 F.3d 940, 956 (4th Cir.1997). Parents and school officials are each entitled to request and receive a due process hearing before a state administrative officer to determine the appropriateness of a proposed IEP. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(b), (f). And, any party aggrieved by the findings or decision of the administrative officer at such a due process hearing may seek judicial review in either state or federal court. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1415(i)(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">In assessing whether an IEP satisfies the requirements of the IDEA, a court is obliged to employ the two-fold inquiry spelled out by the Supreme Court in <em>Rowley. </em>First, it must determine whether the school district has complied with the procedures set forth in the IDEA. <em>See Rowley, </em>458 U.S. at 206, 102 S.Ct. 3034. And second, the court must assess whether the IEP is reasonably calculated to allow the disabled child to receive educational benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 207, 102 S.Ct. 3034; <em>see also Spielberg, </em>853 F.2d at 258. With this framework in mind, we assess in turn the Board\u2019s contentions of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-11\">With regard to the Procedural Ruling, the hearing officer found that the Board had committed two procedural violations: (1) failing to notify AL.\u2019s parents that it had revised the Proposed IEP to remove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>him from any participation in the VAAP; and (2) failing to notify AL.\u2019s parents that this revision of the Proposed IEP triggered their due process rights. As we have heretofore recognized, \u201cit is possible for a school district\u2019s failure to abide by the IDEA\u2019S procedural requirements to constitute an adequate basis for contending that the district has failed to provide a disabled child with a FAPE.\u201d MM, 303 F.3d at 533. Where a school district has failed to abide by the IDEA\u2019S procedural requirements, a reviewing court is \u201cobliged to assess whether it resulted in the loss of an educational opportunity for the disabled child, or whether, on the other hand, it was a mere technical contravention of the IDEA.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Generally speaking, pursuant to 20 U. S.C. \u00a7 1415(d), a school district must give written prior notice of a proposed alteration of an IEP to a disabled child\u2019s parents, and it must also inform them of their due process rights. In this case, the Board maintains that its \u201ctechnical violations\u201d of this statutory mandate, as spelled out by the hearing officer, essentially constituted harmless error and should be disregarded because they did not negatively impact the development of the Proposed IEP or the provision of a FAPE. The Board also contends that, in any event, AL. \u2019s parents did not consent to his participation in the VAAP because they failed to agree to the Proposed IEP. The hearing officer, however, found the Board\u2019s procedural violations harmful, resulting in a lost educational opportunity for A.L., in that his participation in the VAAP would have resulted in a more appropriate IEP that would have better \u201creflect[ed] the results of the assessment test and aid[ed] [AL.\u2019s] transition to the adult world.\u201d Administrative Decision at 45. Moreover, the hearing officer deemed AL.\u2019s \u201cpromotion\u201d to the twelfth grade to be \u201ctroubling,\u201d in that the Board apparently had surreptitiously promoted him out of the eleventh grade, where testing was available, to the twelfth grade, where it was not. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Finally, the hearing officer found that AL.\u2019s parents had specifically requested his participation in the VAAP, even though they did not sign off on the entire Proposed IEP. <em>Id. </em>at 44; <em>see also id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">In the district court, the Board renewed its contention that its failure to comply with the IDEA\u2019S procedural mandate did not prejudice AL.\u2019s ability to receive a FAPE. <em>See </em>Court Decision at 5. The court determined, however, that the Board\u2019s contention on this point was insufficient to meet its burden of establishing that the hearing officer\u2019s finding was erroneous, and it thus affirmed the hearing officer on the Procedural Ruling. <em>Id. </em>at 6. In these circumstances, we agree that the Board\u2019s stark assertion that its procedural errors were harmless fails to overcome the prima facie correctness of the Administrative Decision, and we therefore affirm the Court Decision on the Procedural Ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">With regard to the Sign Language Ruling, the Board contends on appeal that a VQAS Level III interpreter is unnecessary for A.L., because he rarely relies on sign language in order to be understood in school.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> And ordinarily, of course, \u201c[a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>court] should be reluctant ... to second-guess the judgment of education professionals,\u201d as reflected in their development of a Proposed IEP. <em>MM, </em>303 F.3d at 532. Indeed, a reviewing court is \u201cobliged to defer to educators\u2019 decisions as long as an IEP provided the child the basic floor of opportunity that access to special education and related services provides.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In this case, however, the hearing officer found the communication assistance provided to A.L. by the Proposed IEP to be an inadequate accommodation, in that it fails to comply with Virginia\u2019s Regulations Governing Special Education Programs. <em>See </em>Administrative Decision at 48. Pursuant to Virginia law, the SLIs employed by the school districts must be certified at the VQAS Level III or higher. <em>See </em>8 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 20-80-45(E)(1)(a). As we have recognized, \u201c[t]he IDEA expressly incorporates State educational standards,\u201d and the courts should not \u201cusurp state educational standards and policy [by] rewriting] state teaching certification requirements----\u201d <em>Hartmann, </em>118 F.3d at 1004 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the hearing officer was correct in concluding that the communication assistant proposed by the Board to assist A.L. (qualifying at VQAS Level II only) failed to comply with Virginia\u2019s regulatory requirements for personnel providing sign language interpretation services.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">In the district court, the Board was permitted to present additional evidence, not heard or considered by the hearing officer, that A.L. made significant progress in communications skills in the year following the Hearing, and that he requires a VQAS Level II SLI only, because he seldom relies on an interpreter in order to be understood. The court, however, rejected this proposition, and it agreed with the hearing officer that any sign language interpreter provided for A.L. had to meet the qualifications specified in Virginia\u2019s regulations. <em>See </em>Court Decision at 10. The court also affirmed the hearing officer\u2019s finding that the Board\u2019s failure to comply with Virginia\u2019s regulations had resulted in a proposed IEP that was not reasonably calculated to provide A.L. with a FAPE. <em>Id. </em>at 11. Although the pertinent Virginia regulations unequivocally mandate that all SLIs employed in Virginia\u2019s school districts be qualified at the VQAS Level III, <em>see </em>8 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 20-80-45(E)(1)(a), the Proposed IEP provided for an SLI qualified at the VQAS Level II only. We are therefore obliged to affirm the Court Decision on the Sign Language Ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-13\">In making the OT Ruling in the Administrative Decision, the hearing officer concluded that A.L. was entitled to continue receiving direct OT services, thereby rejecting the Board\u2019s contention that such sendees were unnecessary. In that regard, Herndon, testifying for the Board at the Hearing, asserted that she had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>providing direct OT services to A.L. on a weekly basis since 2001 and that, based on her 2001 assessment of A.L., he did not require OT services at all. <em>See </em>Administrative Decision at 31. According to Herndon, the consultative (rather than direct) OT services provided for as a compromise in the Proposed IEP would be sufficient to meet A.L.'s needs. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">In response, A.L.\u2019s parents submitted to the hearing officer the evaluation of Weisz, who had assessed A.L. in July 2003, just prior to the Hearing being conducted. <em>See </em>Administrative Decision at 32. Utilizing a \u201cmedical\u201d (rather than an \u201ceducational\u201d) model, she concluded that A.L. suffered from a deficit in his motor and visual skills, causing him to have difficulty performing routine tasks, such as using both hands simultaneously or catching a ball. <em>Id. </em>Weisz thus recommended that A.L. continue to receive direct OT services. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, A.L.\u2019s parents presented the hearing officer with the testimony of Dr. Leichtman, who testified that OT services issues should be left \u201ctotally to the discretion of the therapist at the school,\u201d asking only that the therapist \u201cevaluate [A.L.] and, if [the therapist deems] he needs treatment, to treat him.\u201d J.A. 1016-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">In concluding that A.L. was entitled to continue to receive direct OT services, the hearing officer credited Weisz\u2019s 2003 evaluation over Herndon\u2019s 2001 educational assessment and Dr. Leichtman\u2019s testimony, primarily because Weisz\u2019s evaluation was more recent. <em>See </em>Administrative Decision at 49. In so doing, the hearing officer observed that the deficits A.L. exhibited, such as being unable to use two hands simultaneously, were skills necessary in both school and in the workplace. <em>Id. </em>The hearing officer therefore rejected the Board\u2019s contention that A.L. no longer required direct OT services.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">In assessing the OT Ruling, the district court concluded that, \u201cdespite the deference typically due ... the judgment of professional educators,\u201d the hearing officer\u2019s reliance on Weisz\u2019s assessment was justified because her 2003 report was more recent than the evaluations relied upon by the Board. <em>See </em>Court Decision at 10. In these circumstances, we are unable to say that the district court erred in deferring to the hearing officer\u2019s view of the evidence, and we thus affirm the Court Decision on the OT Ruling as well.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">Pursuant to the foregoing, we reject the Board\u2019s contentions and affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-10\">. Down Syndrome (also known as Down\u2019s Syndrome) is a \"congenital disorder caused by the presence of an extra 21st chromosome and marked by moderate to severe mental retardation, short stature, and a flattened facial profile.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s II New College Dictionary </em>342 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b197-8\">. The Court Decision is found in its entirety at pages 1186 through 1197 of the Joint Appendix.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b198-6\">. The Administrative Decision is found in its entirety at pages 1049 through 1101 of the Joint Appendix.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b199-7\">. Beginning in 2001, A.L.\u2019s parents contended that A.L. was entitled to be dually labeled with both Down Syndrome and OMA, but the Board determined that the OMA label was unnecessary. A.L.'s parents later consented to an addendum to the 2001 IEP, made in August 2002, providing full-time interpreter services to assist A.L. in his oral and/or sign language communications skills \u2014 an accommodation for his Down Syndrome, but not for his OMA. Although the hearing officer acknowledged that she had not been appointed to review the Board\u2019s determinations regarding OMA, she nonetheless premised certain of her rulings on A.L.\u2019s need for OMA accommodations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b199-12\">. The hearing officer further concluded that, because the IEP was inappropriate under the IDEA, it was also inappropriate under the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, which mandates school districts to provide a FAPE to \"handicapped persons\u201d as adequate as that which is provided to \"nonhandicapped persons.\u201d <em>See </em>34 CFR \u00a7 104.33(b)(1). Under the federal regulations implementing the Rehabilitation Act, the development and implementation of an IEP \"in accordance with the [IDEA] is one means of meeting [this] standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 104.33(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b200-6\">. The district court concluded that the hearing officer had erred in premising the Sign Language Ruling, in part, on the finding that A.L. required services for OMA. <em>See </em>Court Decision at 9. The court determined that any such error was harmless, however, because the hearing officer also correctly found that the IEP did not comply with Virginia\u2019s pertinent regulations. <em>Id. </em>at 10. We agree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b200-11\">. With no evidence of bad faith or gross misjudgment on the part of the Board having been presented, however, the district court concluded that the Board had not discriminated against A.L. under the Rehabilitation Act. <em>See </em>Court Decision at 12. Nevertheless, the court ruled that the Proposed IEP was inadequate under the Rehabilitation Act, and it thus ordered the Board to develop an IEP that provides A.L. with a FAPE, in compliance with the Rehabilitation Act. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b202-7\">. Although the Board maintained at the Hearing that A.L.\u2019s transition to the twelfth grade made him ineligible for participation in the VAAP, the Board subsequently allowed A.L. to participate therein. <em>See </em>Appellee\u2019s Supp. Br. at 1. Accordingly, it appears that A.L. is eligible for the VAAP, notwithstanding the Board\u2019s earlier assertion to the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b202-14\">. In Virginia, SLIs employed by the school districts must have the following qualifications:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>a Virginia Quality Assurance Screening (VQAS) Level III, any Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf Certificate (excluding Certificate of Deaf Interpretation), or any other state or national certification recognized by the Virginia Department for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing as equivalent to or exceeding the VQAS Level III.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-9\"><em>See </em>8 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 20-80-45(E)(l)(a). The VQAS assessment process involves interpreting sign language for a screening panel. To achieve a VQAS Level III, one must correctly interpret 80% of the signs presented. <em>See </em>22 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 20-30-110(D)(2)(b). The Board contends that it would be sufficient to provide a Level II interpreter (one who correctly interpreted 65% of signs presented in the VQAS assessment).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b204-6\">. As discussed above, <em>see supra </em>notes 5 and 7, the hearing officer and the district court each concluded that the Proposed IEP was inadequate under the Rehabilitation Act, for the same reasons it was inadequate under the IDEA. Because we agree that the Proposed IEP did not comply with the IDEA, we need not resolve the question of the IEP's propriety under the Rehabilitation Act. We observe, however, that a failure to provide an appropriate IEP under the IDEA would not, in and of itself, establish discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act, absent some evidence of \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\" on the part of the school authorities. <em>Sellers v. Sch. Bd. of Manassas, Va., </em>141 F.3d 524, 529 (4th Cir.1998). And, as we have recognized, \"to prove discrimination in the education context, \u2018something more than a mere failure to provide the \u2018free appropriate education\u2019 required by [the IDEA] must be shown.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Monahan v. Neb., </em>687 F.2d 1164, 1170 (8th Cir.1982)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
