Because we find the district court erred in applying the guidelines, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-15\">After Atkins pled guilty to theft of Government property, she was assigned a sentencing guidelines base offense level of twelve. Two levels were added for having stolen a firearm and two levels were deducted for acceptance of responsibility. At sentencing, the Government moved for a two-level reduction for substantial assistance. The district court granted the motion, but imposed a four-level reduction, leaving Atkins with an offense level of eight. Because she was in criminal history category I, the range of imprisonment was 0 to 6 months. As a result of being in Zone A of the sentencing table, Atkins was eligible for a sentence of probation. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5Bl.l(a)(1) (2005). The court sentenced Atkins to three years\u2019 probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-16\">Atkins admitted she violated her probation and the district court noted its intention to sentence Atkins to a term of imprisonment. The court erroneously noted Atkins\u2019 total offense level was ten. Thus, the court understood her sentencing range to be six to twelve months\u2019 imprisonment. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565(a) (2000), the court had authority to revoke the sentence of probation and resentence Atkins under the provisos of the original sentencing proceeding. Because the court assumed Atkins had an offense level of ten instead of eight, Atkins was exposed to a six to twelve month range of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-17\">As a result of the district court\u2019s error in assuming Atkins had an offense level of ten, it imposed a sentence outside the properly calculated range of imprisonment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-18\">A sentence falling outside of the properly calculated Guidelines range is not <em>ipso facto </em>unreasonable. But if that sentence is based on an error in construing or applying the Guidelines, it will be found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>unreasonable and vacated. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8742(f)(1). The same is true if the sentence is imposed outside the Guideline range and the district court provides an inadequate statement of reasons or relies on improper factors in departing from the Guidelines\u2019 recommendation. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3742(f)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-5\"><em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">We find the twelve month sentence was unreasonable.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we vacate the sentence and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b181-20\"> If the district court intended to upwardly depart from the range of imprisonment, it provided an inadequate statement of reasons for departing. <em>See Green, </em>436 F.3d at 457.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
