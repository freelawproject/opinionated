Her appeal challenges the district court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment on allegations that West discriminated against her because of her sex and national origin in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2 and 1981. Having considered the briefs and the record, we agree with the district court that although Pate produced evidence that the \u201cprocesses and interactions leading to her termination were opaque and misleading\u201d Pate nevertheless failed to bring forth sufficient evidence that West\u2019s reasons for terminating her were a pretext for discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
