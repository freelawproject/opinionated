He argues that the district court erred in increasing his offense level after finding that the offense \u201cinvolved intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person,\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5). Even after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines de novo and the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 202 &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 268, 168 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The record reflects that Renteria was driving a tractor trailer carrying six illegal aliens. One of the aliens was hiding under the bed in the trailer\u2019s sleeper compartment and the other five aliens were hiding in the sleeper compartment\u2019s closets in \u201ccramped fetal positions.\u201d The district court did not err in concluding that these circumstances qualified as intentional or reckless creation of a \u201csubstantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person.\u201d <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Mesa, </em>443 F.3d 397, 401-03 (5th Cir.2006); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1, comment, (n.6).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b252-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
