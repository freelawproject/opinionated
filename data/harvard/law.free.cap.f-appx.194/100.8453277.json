In November 2005, De Los Santos-Mora filed a complaint under the Alien Tort Statute,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350 (2000), seeking $2,000,000 in damages on the ground that the arresting officers and the United States Attorney failed to advise him of his rights under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court dismissed the action without prejudice, concluding that De Los SantosMora\u2019s action was barred by the holding in <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), because his criminal conviction has not been set aside and a judgment in this action would necessarily imply the invalidity of that conviction. De Los Santos-Mora timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">After the district court issued its decision and while this appeal was pending, the Supreme Court of the United States issued its decision in <em>Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, </em>\u2014U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2669, 165 L.Ed.2d 557 (2006). The Supreme Court noted that Article 36 addresses a foreign national\u2019s entitlement to consular notification concerning his arrest, but does not implicate any right to consular intervention or cessation of the criminal investigation and that violation of any rights under Article 36 would not trigger application of the exclusionary rule. <em>Id. </em>at 2681. In light of <em>Sanchez-Llamas, </em>we find that the district court erred by finding De Los SantosMora\u2019s action to be Hecfc-barred.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-15\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order dismissing De Los SantosMora\u2019s action without prejudice pursuant to <em>Heck </em>and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. De Los Santos-Mora\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-16\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-11\">. This statute establishes jurisdiction in the district courts over a civil action by an alien for a tort committed in violation of a treaty of the United States. <em>See generally Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, </em>542 U.S. 692, 124 S.Ct. 2739, 159 L.Ed.2d 718 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b123-26\">. The Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, Apr. 24, 1963, art. 36, 21 U.S.T. 77, 101, requires an arresting government to inform a foreign national who has been arrested of his right to contact his consul.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b123-27\">. We express no opinion concerning whether Article 36 creates a private right of action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
