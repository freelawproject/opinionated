Jones argues that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by enhancing his sentence based on his possession of a firearm in connection with a drug offense, of which the trial jury had acquitted him. Jones contends that the jury\u2019s verdict of acquittal denied the district court the authority to impose a sentencing enhancement based on the acquitted conduct. We have held that \u201c[a] jury\u2019s verdict of acquit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>tal does not prevent the sentencing court from considering conduct underlying the acquitted charge, so long as that conduct has been proved by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Valdez, </em>453 F.3d 252, 264 (5th Cir.2006)(citing <em>United States v. Watts, </em>519 U.S. 148, 157, 117 S.Ct. 633, 136 L.Ed.2d 554 (1997); <em>United States v. Cathey, </em>259 F.3d 365, 368 (5th Cir.2001)). The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Watts </em>remains valid after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Vaughn, </em>430 F.3d 518, 526-27 (2d Cir. 2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1665, 164 L.Ed.2d 405 (2006); <em>United States v. Price, </em>418 F.3d 771, 788 (7th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Magallanez, </em>408 F.3d 672, 684 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 468, 163 L.Ed.2d 356 (2005); <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1304-05 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 432, 163 L.Ed.2d 329 (2005). Jones has not shown that the district court\u2019s enhancement of his sentence based on acquitted conduct was error. <em>See Valdez, </em>453 F.3d at 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">Jones also argues that the sentence imposed on remand by the district court was unreasonable. Following <em>Booker, </em>sentences are reviewed for reasonableness. <em>U.S. v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cIf the sentencing judge exercises her discretion to impose a sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range, in our reasonableness review we will infer that the judge has considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 519. Further, the district court need not give a detailed explanation for its choice of a sentence that is within the guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>Indeed, there is a presumption that a post-<em>Booker </em>discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is reasonable. <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-14\">In Jones\u2019s case, the district court departed upward pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l) because Jones\u2019s original criminal history score seriously underrepresented the seriousness of Jones\u2019s criminal history and the likelihood that he would commit another crime. Jones\u2019s sentence is thus considered a Guidelines sentence because the district court\u2019s authority to depart derived from the Guidelines themselves. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006). We review both the decision to depart and the extent of that departure for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Desselle, </em>450 F.3d 179, 182 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Simkanin, </em>420 F.3d 397, 415-16 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1911, 164 L.Ed.2d 663 (2006). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion if it departs on the basis of legally unacceptable reasons or if the degree of the departure is unreasonable.\u201d <em>Desselle, </em>450 F.3d at 182. In assessing the extent of a departure, this court continues to look to <em>pre-Booker </em>case law for guidance. <em>Id. </em>This court ultimately determines whether the sentence is unreasonable with regard to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-17\">On remand, the district court imposed the same 78-month sentence that it imposed at the original sentencing, stating that it considered the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) <em>&amp; </em>(2), and stating that the sentence was appropriate for the reasons previously set forth at the original sentencing. Our review of the record reveals that the district court gave numerous reasons for the sentence it imposed and these reasons indicate that it considered the factors in \u00a7 3553(a)(1) &amp; (2), including the nature of the crime and Jones\u2019s history, the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of Jones\u2019s crime, the need to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>deter, to protect the citizenry, and to give Jones care or correctional treatment he may need, and the pertinent guidelines range. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a). Jones has not shown that the district court abused its discretion because it departed on the basis of legally unacceptable reasons or because the degree of the departure was unreasonable. <em>See Desselle, </em>450 F.3d at 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Jones has also failed to show that the sentence violates the \u201cproportionality principle\u201d of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) as he has not presented evidence such as average sentences for similarly situated defendants or a case in which a similarly situated defendant received a lesser sentence. <em>See Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b219-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
