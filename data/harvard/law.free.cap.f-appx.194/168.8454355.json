For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-20\">Smiley asserts that his sentence, which is fifteen months above the recommended advisory guideline range of 84 to 105 months\u2019 imprisonment, is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. Smiley argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not adequately consider the factors under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2006) or the arguments of defense counsel. Smiley argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court found no facts, other than those considered by the sentencing guidelines, which justified Smiley\u2019s above-the-guidelines sentence. Smiley\u2019s arguments are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-21\">A <em>post-Booker </em><footnotemark>*</footnotemark> sentence may be unreasonable for procedural and substantive reasons. \u201cA sentence may be procedurally unreasonable, for example, if the district court provides an inadequate statement of reasons.... A sentence may be substantively unreasonable if the court relies on an improper factor or rejects policies articulated by Congress or the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 434 (4th Cir.) (citations omitted), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). While a district court must consider the various factors in \u00a7 3553(a) and explain its sentence, it need not \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection\u201d or \u201cexplicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006). Even if the sentence exceeds the advisory guideline range, it will generally be deemed reasonable \u201cif the reasons justifying the variance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>are tied to \u00a7 3553(a) and are plausible.\u201d <em>Moreland, </em>437 F.3d at 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">We find the district court\u2019s explanations of its reasons for sentencing Smiley satisfied these standards, and Smiley\u2019s sentence was therefore reasonable. The court cited several \u00a7 3553(a) factors in concluding that the guideline range was inadequate. The court reviewed \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense\u201d and the \u201chistory and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d \u00a7 3553(a)(1), observing that Smiley served nine years in prison for another string of robberies and had been out of jail only eight months when he committed the instant offenses. With respect to the need for the sentence imposed, the court went on to consider the seriousness of the offense and the goals to promote respect for the law, to deter criminal conduct, and to protect the public. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), (B). The court concluded that the combination of Smiley\u2019s past criminal history, the current offenses and his drug addiction supported a higher sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">We conclude that the variance sentence imposed by the district court was \u201cselected pursuant to a reasoned process in accordance with the law.\u201d <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). We also find that the extent of the variance, which was the minimum sentence the district court found proper to impose under the circumstances, was reasonable. <em>See Moreland, </em>437 F.3d at 436 (\u201cThe second question we must address is whether the extent of the variance was reasonable.\u201d). We therefore conclude that the district court acted reasonably in imposing this variance sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b190-18\"> <em>United States v.
