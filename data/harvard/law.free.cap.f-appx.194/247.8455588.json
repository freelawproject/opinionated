Meek, Texas prisoner # 505329, appeals the dismissal of his complaint filed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Meek had 30 days from the entry of the June 30, 2005, judgment to file a timely notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). Meek\u2019s pro se August 12, 2005, notice of appeal was untimely. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b269-26\">A district court may grant a defendant an additional 30 days in which to file a notice of appeal upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5). Meek\u2019s notice of appeal, which was filed within this additional 30-day period, sufficed as a motion under Rule 4(a)(5). <em>See United States v. Golding, </em>739 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>F.2d 183, 184 (5th Cir.1984); <em>see also Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 276, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988) (holding that a notice of appeal submitted by a pro se prisoner is deemed filed on the date the prisoner submits it to prison officials for mailing).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Accordingly, Meek\u2019s appeal is held in abeyance, and the case is REMANDED to the district court for a ruling under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5). Upon ruling, the district court shall promptly return the case to this court for dismissal or further proceedings, as may be appropriate.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b269-10\">Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
