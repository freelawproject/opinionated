Perez filed a notice of appeal from his judgment and sentence on November 15, 2005. Several weeks later, on December 5, 2005, Perez filed a motion to vacate his plea and sentence pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. He argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the government breached the plea agreement at sentencing by not opposing the presentence investigation report\u2019s (\u201cPSI\u201d) recommended sentencing enhancement for abuse of trust (which was ultimately applied), and by disclosing to the district court a cooperating witness\u2019s position regarding the charge filed against Perez and the sentence recommended by the plea agreement. On December 8, 2005, the district court denied the motion to vacate for lack of jurisdiction because it was filed after Perez\u2019s notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-20\">On appeal, Perez contends that the district court erred in failing to grant his motion to vacate his plea and sentence. More specifically, he claims that the government breached the parties\u2019 plea agreement at sentencing by not opposing the enhancement for abuse of a position of trust, and by disclosing the cooperating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>witness\u2019s position on Perez\u2019s offense and plea agreement to the district court. In response, the government argues that we lack jurisdiction to hear this appeal, because Perez did not file a notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to vacate, or move to amend his earlier notice of appeal to include that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">We review questions regarding our subject matter jurisdiction de novo. <em>United States v. Cartwright, </em>413 F.3d 1295, 1299 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1116, 163 L.Ed.2d 924 (2006). Where an appellant notices the appeal of a specified judgment only, a court \u201chas no jurisdiction to review other judgments or issues which are not expressly referred to and which are not impliedly intended for appeal.\u201d <em>Whetstone Candy Co., Inc. v. Kraft Foods, Inc., </em>351 F.3d 1067, 1079-80 (11th Cir.2003) (quotations and citations omitted); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(1)(B). Generally, a notice of appeal does not include orders that have not been entered at the time when the notice of appeal is filed. <em>Bogle v. Orange County Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>162 F.3d 653, 661 (11th Cir.1998). Here, Perez filed his notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s judgment and sentence weeks before he moved to vacate his guilty plea and sentence, and he offers no reason as to why his earlier notice of appeal, even when liberally construed, can be said to encompass the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to vacate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We therefore lack jurisdiction to review, in the course of the instant appeal, the district court\u2019s order denying Perez\u2019s motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">To the extent that Perez raises a direct challenge on appeal regarding whether the government breached the plea agreement, our review is for plain error because Perez did not raise that objection at sentencing (i.e., he did not claim that the government had breached the plea agreement). <em>See United States v. Mahique, </em>150 F.3d 1330, 1332 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam) (ruling that where the district court affords the defendant an opportunity to object after the imposition of sentence and the defendant does not do so, \u201cany objections to the sentence are barred absent manifest injustice,\u201d and that inquiry is equivalent to \u201creview for plain error\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We ask whether \u201c(1) error occurred, and (2) the error is plain, (3) affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and (4) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Romano, </em>314 F.3d 1279, 1281 (11th Cir.2002). For an error to affect substantial rights, the error generally \u201cmust have been prejudicial: It must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1778, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). The defendant bears the burden of establishing prejudice. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>1299 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>545 U.S. 1127, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Here, Perez has not established that his substantial rights were affected by (1) the government\u2019s reference to the abuse of trust enhancement as \u201cfair,\u201d which was immediately followed by the government\u2019s caveat that it \u201cdid not anticipate\u201d that enhancement and was \u201cbound\u201d by the plea agreement, which recommended no offense role enhancement; or (2) a special agent\u2019s testimony \u2014 in response to queries by the district court \u2014 that the cooperating witness (against Perez) felt that Perez\u2019s anticipated sentence \u201cshould have been considerably higher\u201d and the charges against him \u201cmore stringent than what they are.\u201d At the time the government commented on the abuse of trust enhancement, the district court had already calculated the total offense level and applicable Guidelines range, without any objection by Perez.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Furthermore, the district court made it clear that, in light of the facts set forth in the PSI-to which Perez did not object at sentencing \u2014 and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), it would not \u201cgo along\u201d with the parties\u2019 proposed sentence of 2 months\u2019 home confinement. In particular, the district court commented that \u201cit is egregious to use your official authority and to disclose confidential information in this day and age after 911,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, it has to be more than house arrest because the offense was much too serious for that.\u201d Ultimately the court determined that, notwithstanding \u201call of the positive factors\u201d emphasized by Perez\u2019s attorney, \u201cthis is not the type of case to go below the guidelines [range of 4-10 months].... I cannot go along with that.\u201d Thus, Perez has not demonstrated plain error, and we affirm his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b828-6\">. We have acknowledged that in <em>Intel Corp. v. Terabyte Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>6 F.3d 614, 617-18 (9th Cir.1993), the Ninth Circuit held that a prior notice of appeal encompassed a subsequent district court order granting attorney\u2019s fees because the appellant\u2019s opening brief, which had been filed within 30 days of the final order on attorney's fees, essentially satisfied the requirements of Fed. R.App. P. 3. <em>See LaChance v. Duffy\u2019s Draft House, Inc., </em>146 F.3d 832, 837-38 (11th Cir.1998). Perez\u2019s opening brief, however, was not filed within 10 days of entry of the district court\u2019s order denying the motion to vacate. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b828-11\">. Perez asserted that the sentence was unreasonable in light of the factors reviewed by the district court, and in light of the fact that the sentence exceeded the recommendation in the parties\u2019 plea agreement, but Perez did not claim that the government had breached the plea agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b829-6\">. Perez asserts that the government should have objected to the district court\u2019s application of the abuse of trust enhancement based on the plea agreement, but this is unpersuasive in light of the fact that Perez himself did not object to the Guidelines calculation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
