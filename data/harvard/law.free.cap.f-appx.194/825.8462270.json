After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">A district court \u201cmay vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(a). Motions for new trial based on newly discovered evidence must be filed within three years of a guilty verdict, while motions based on any other grounds must be filed within seven days of a guilty verdict. Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(b)(1), (2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">Fields\u2019s Rule 33 motion is based on allegedly newly discovered evidence and had to be filed in 1998, within three years of the 1995 guilty verdict. Thus, Fields\u2019s motion filed in 2005 is seven years too late. Given that his motion is far too late, Fields argues on appeal that the government has waived the timeliness issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">We have previously held that \u201c[t]he timeliness of a motion for new trial is a jurisdictional question,\u201d <em>United States v. Correa, </em>362 F.3d 1306, 1308 (11th Cir. 2004), which would mean waiver could not help Fields. However, the Supreme Court recently clarified that \u201cRule 33 ... is a claim-processing rule,\u201d not a jurisdictional rule, but \u201cone that is admittedly inflexible because of Rule 45(b)\u2019s insistent demand for a definite end to proceedings.\u201d <em>Eberhart v. United States, </em>546 U.S. 12, -, 126 S.Ct. 403, 407, 163 L.Ed.2d 14 (2005). Thus, Rule 33\u2019s time limitations may be waived or forfeited. <em>Id. </em>at-, 126 S.Ct. at 404, 407 (noting that because the government opposed Eberhart\u2019s untimely Rule 33 motion on the merits in the district court and raised an untimeliness defense for the first time on appeal, the government forfeited any untimeliness defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-18\">Based on <em>Eberhart, </em>Fields argues on appeal that the government forfeited the issue of timeliness. We disagree because the facts in Fields\u2019s case are materially different from <em>Eberhart. </em>In <em>Eberhart, </em>the government had opposed the Rule 33 motion on the merits and never raised the timeliness issue in the district court. After the district court granted the Rule 33 motion, the government raised a timeliness defense for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-19\">In contrast, here the district court <em>sua sponte </em>denied Fields\u2019s motion and never directed the government to file a response to Fields\u2019s motion. Further, the government never filed a response to Fields\u2019s motion. Nothing in <em>Eberhart </em>precludes a <em>sua sponte </em>determination of untimeliness by the district court, especially where Fields\u2019s Rule 33 motion was filed ten years after the jury\u2019s verdict and was seven years too late. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Fields\u2019s Rule 33 motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b848-10\">.
