On appeal, Freeman argues: (1) that the portion of his sentence imposing a life term of supervised release is unreasonable in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors; and (2) that his Fifth Amendment due process rights were violated because the district court did not apply a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard in sentencing him to a life term of supervised release. After careful review, we find no error and affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-14\">The relevant facts are these. On August 30, 2005, Freeman was indicted for knowingly receiving and attempting to receive material containing child pornography (two videotapes identified as \u201c# 7\u201d and \u201c# 23\u201d), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2252A(a)(2) and (b)(1) (Count 1), and knowingly and intentionally possessing material containing child pornography (videotapes \u201c# 7\u201d and \u201c# 23\u201d), in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(b) and (b)(2). Freeman pled guilty to both counts and proceeded to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-15\">According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Freeman was arrested after ordering, receiving, and submitting payment for two child pornography videos, in response to an advertisement on the internet. After his arrest, federal agents also found 83 files of child pornography on his computer hard drive, 68 of which were analyzed and confirmed by agents to involve actual children. The PSI recommended a base offense level of 22, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(a)(2), and the following adjustments: (1) a 2-level reduction because Freeman\u2019s conduct was limited to the receipt of child pornography without the intent to distribute, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(a)(2); (2) a 2-level enhancement because the material involved prepubescent minors, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2); (3) a 4-level enhancement because the material portrayed sadistic or masochistic conduct, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4); (4) a 2-level enhancement because a computer was used in the receipt of the material, U.S.S.G. 2G2.2(b)(6); and (5) a 2-level enhancement because the offense involved more than 10, but less than 150, images, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(6). After a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b), Freeman\u2019s adjusted offense level was a 27. With a criminal history category I, Freeman faced a Guidelines imprisonment range of 70 to 87 months, and a Guidelines supervised release range of any term of years or life.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">At the sentencing hearing, Freeman made no objections to the PSI or to the application of the Guidelines. The district court directed that the details of 14 chat-room conversations between Freeman and other individuals be included in the PSI report as relevant conduct, to which there was no objection. Freeman presented an expert witness, Dr. Eric Imhoff, a certified provider of sex offender treatment, who opined that Freeman had paraphilia, a condition in which an individual has engaged in \u201csexual thoughts, urges or behaviors involving ... children\u201d for more than six months. Dr. Imhoff also opined that Freeman was treatable, had accepted responsibility, and \u201cpresented] a low risk for a hands-on offense.\u201d Dr. Imhoff then was extensively cross-examined by the prosecutor and thoroughly questioned by the district court concerning the foundation for his opinion regarding Freeman\u2019s low risk for recidivism.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">The district court also heard testimony from Freeman, his counsel, and his mother who urged the court to \u201callow [Freeman] to be continued to be monitored, if it\u2019s possible, without sending him far away.\u201d Defense counsel argued for the district court to impose a lesser imprisonment sentence, and in doing so noted that the court had \u201cunlimited power in terms of supervised release,\u201d which would \u201cbe an opportunity to make sure that [Freeman] [was] progressing on the right track\u201d and \u201cwould be something that [Freeman would] have to live with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">The district court, after considering the aforementioned evidence, along with the advisory Guidelines range of 70 to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment and the factors of \u00a7 3553(a), sentenced Freeman to a 75-month term of imprisonment followed by a life term of supervised release. The district court stated that the supervised-release portion of Freeman\u2019s sentence was \u201cappropriate in this matter based upon [Freeman\u2019s] history of deviant sexual conduct, the 83 images of child pornography that were found on his computer, in addition to the offenses for which he stands before the Court and the approximately 14 chatroom conversations in which [Freeman] explicitly discusses and solicits sexual conduct with persons representing themselves to be minor females.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">Freeman asserts that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court did not adequately consult some of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He makes various arguments, some that he raised in the district court and others that he raises for the first time here, in support of mitigation. We are unpersuaded by any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">Our reasonableness review is guided by the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). And our \u201c[r]eview for reasonableness is deferential.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir. 2005). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>These factors include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-4\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-5\">(2) the need for the sentence imposed\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-6\">(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-7\">(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-8\">(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-9\">(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-10\">(3) the kinds of sentences available;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-11\">(7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-12\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Although sentencing courts must be <em>guided </em>by these factors, \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Robles, </em>408 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that, <em>post-Booker, </em>district courts need not conduct an accounting of every \u00a7 3553(a) factor and expound on how each factor played a role in the sentencing decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-13\">Based on our careful review, with particular attention to the sentencing transcript and the PSI, we readily conclude that Freeman\u2019s sentence is reasonable. The district court explicitly stated that it had consulted \u00a7 3553(a) prior to imposing a sentence that fell <em>within </em>the advisory Guidelines range. <em>Cf. Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788 (observing that \u201cwhen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one\u201d). Before announcing its sentence, the court considered the testimony of Dr. Imhoff, Freeman\u2019s mother, and Freeman, and heard Freeman\u2019s arguments, all of which pertained to \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3553(a)(1), since they concerned Freeman\u2019s family and work responsibilities, his diagnosis for paraphilia, and his remorse and desire for rehabilitation. Moreover, in imposing sentence, the district court highlighted the serious nature of Freeman\u2019s crime involving a \u201chistory of deviant sexual conduct,\u201d including \u201cthe 83 images of child pornography that were found on his computer, in addition to the offenses for which he stands before the Court and the approximately 14 chatroom conversations in which [Freeman] explicitly discusses and solicits sexual conduct with persons representing themselves to be minor females.\u201d <em>Cf </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2) (discussing factors pertaining to need for sentence imposed \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense\u201d and \u201cto afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct\u201d <em>and </em>\u201cto protect the public from further crimes of the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-15\">We also note that the life term of supervised release is entirely consistent with both defense counsel\u2019s argument and Freeman\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony in favor of continued monitoring rather than a longer term of imprisonment. <em>Cf. id. </em>at \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D) (discussing need for sentence \u201cto provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>the most effective manner\u201d). Finally, the parties\u2019 arguments and the PSI\u2019s calculations outlined \u201cthe kinds of sentences available,\u201d as discussed in \u00a7 3553(a)(3). On this record, Freeman\u2019s sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Freeman\u2019s argument that the district court failed to apply a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard in imposing a life term of supervised release is without merit. The government bears the burden of proving the applicability of guidelines that enhance a defendant\u2019s offense level. <em>United States v. Cataldo, </em>171 F.3d 1316, 1321 (11th Cir.1999). The district court\u2019s factual findings for purposes of sentencing may be based on, among other things, evidence heard during trial, undisputed statements in the PSI, or evidence presented during the sentencing hearing. <em>United States v. Saunders, </em>318 F.3d 1257, 1271 n. 22 (11th Cir .2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">It is well-settled that where a defendant does not object to the facts of the PSI, they are deemed admitted for <em>Booker </em>purposes. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that a defendant admits to the PSI\u2019s factual statements about his relevant conduct where he raises no objections to those statements). \u201cIt is also established law that the failure to object to a district court\u2019s factual findings precludes the argument that there was error in them.\u201d <em>United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006) (citing <em>United States v. Weir, </em>51 F.3d 1031, 1033 (11th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Norris, </em>50 F.3d 959, 962 (11th Cir.1995)). In the case at bar, the facts stated in the PSI, upon which the district court made its factual findings, were admitted and deemed established because Freeman made no objection to \u201cthe Court\u2019s finding of facts and conclusions of law ... [or] to the manner in which [the] sentence was imposed,\u201d when specifically asked whether he wished to do so. <em>See </em>DE:51 at 22. Thus, the district court properly made and considered the factual findings supporting a life term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b800-12\">. The government contends that we should review Freeman\u2019s claims for only plain error because he did not make any objections to the sentence at his sentencing hearing. Because we find no error based on the district court\u2019s \u00a7 3553(a) analysis, we need not, and do not, reach the issue of whether there was <em>plain </em>error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
