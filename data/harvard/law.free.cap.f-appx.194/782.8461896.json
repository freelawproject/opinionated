As a threshold matter, the government argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), limits our review of the IJ\u2019s order of removal regarding Peque\u00f1o. We agree that we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s order denying withholding of removal; however, we retain jurisdiction to consider the legal question of whether Pequeno\u2019s crime constitutes an aggravated felony for purposes of cancellation of removal. Concluding that his crime was an aggravated felony, we DISMISS in part and DENY in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">Peque\u00f1o is a native and citizen of Cuba and has been a legal permanent resident of the United States since 1967. On 2 January 2003, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> issued Peque\u00f1o a Notice to Appear, charging him with removability as an alien who had been convicted of a crime of moral turpitude. At the removal hearing, Peque\u00f1o admitted that he had been convicted in a Florida court for unlawful use of collected tax, a violation of Florida Statute \u00a7 206.56, and that the offense of conviction was a crime involving moral turpitude. He stated his intent to seek cancellation of removal because he was a legal permanent resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-13\">Peque\u00f1o subsequently filed an application for cancellation of removal. According to the application, Peque\u00f1o had departed and reentered the United States twice: (1) in June 2001 for a Carribean cruise and (2) in July 2002 for a vacation in Alaska. Peque\u00f1o admits that he was arrested for theft of state funds, for which he was \u201cwithheld\u201d and served 5 years probation. The information charged Peque\u00f1o with \u201cknowingly obtaining] or us[ing] ... taxes collected ... with the intent ... to deprive the state of a right to the funds or a benefit therefrom, or appropriate the funds to his ... own use ... in the amount of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or more, in violation of s. 206.56(2)(a).... \u201d Administrative Record (\u201cAR\u201d) at 307. According to the order of conviction, Peque\u00f1o was \u201cfound guilty of the charge of unlawful use of tax collected/100 +.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-16\">The IJ denied Pequeno\u2019s application for cancellation of removal. In his oral decision, the IJ found that, having admitted to being convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude, Peque\u00f1o was subject to removal. It further found that Peque\u00f1o was not eligible for cancellation of removal because his conviction for unlawful use of collected tax constituted an aggravated felony pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>Peque\u00f1o filed a notice of appeal with the BIA, arguing that the IJ erred in granting the government\u2019s untimely motion to pretermit Pequeno\u2019s application for cancellation of removal, but, alternatively, should have granted Peque\u00f1o a continuance to seek other forms of relief. In his supporting brief, Peque\u00f1o also argued that he was not an aggravated felon because the statute of conviction did not constitute either an offense involving fraud or deceit or a theft offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, finding no error in the IJ\u2019s \u201cdetermination that [Peque\u00f1o] is removable as charged and, pursuant to his conviction for an aggravated felony, ineligible for cancellation of removal.\u201d AR at 2. Specifically, the BIA found that Pequeno\u2019s conviction for unlawful use of tax collection was a theft offense, which qualified as an aggravated felony, and that no harm resulted from the IJ accepting the government\u2019s untimely motion to pretermit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Peque\u00f1o argues that his conviction under Florida statute for the unlawful use of collected tax does not constitute an aggravated felony. He also argues that the charged offense does not contain the elements of deceit or fraud, as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i). He further contends that he was not convicted, as defined under Section 322(a) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(A),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because the state trial court withheld adjudication of guilt and did not impose a punitive penalty or sentence. Peque\u00f1o maintains that, because he is not an aggravated felon, he was entitled to cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b806-11\">Before we can consider whether the BIA properly denied his application for cancellation of removal, we must determine whether we have jurisdiction over Pequeno\u2019s petition. We always have jurisdiction to determine our jurisdiction. <em>Fitzgerald v. Seaboard Sys. R.R., Inc., </em>760 F.2d 1249-51 (11th Cir.1985) (per curiam) (observing that federal courts have the power to determine their jurisdiction). \u201c[T]he REAL ID Act expanded courts of appeals\u2019 jurisdiction to consider constitutional and legal questions presented in a petition for review.\u201d <em>Alexandre v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>452 F.3d 1204, 1206 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). Peque\u00f1o presents two questions that could serve to give us jurisdiction: first, whether he is removable based on some criminal offense; second, whether the BIA committed an error of law when it determined that he was not entitled to cancellation of removal. We consider these questions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-12\">A. <em>Jurisdiction Vis-a-vis Removal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b806-13\">For purposes of the present petition, jurisdiction is provided by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), as limited by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). <em>Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2002). The limitation provides, in pertinent part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-14\">[notwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory), includ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>ing section 2241 of Title 28, or any other habeas corpus provision, and sections 1361 and 1651 of such title, and except as provided in subparagraph (D), no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section 1182(a)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) (as amended by the REAL ID Act \u00a7 106(a)). Criminal offenses covered in \u00a7 1182(a)(2) include crimes \u201cinvolving moral turpitude.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Our review, therefore, requires us to determine whether a petitioner is: \u201c(1) an alien; (2) who is removable; (3) based on having committed a disqualifying offense.\u201d <em>Moore v. Ashcroft, </em>251 F.3d 919, 923 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cIf these three conditions are satisfied, our jurisdiction over the petition for review of the final order of removal disappears.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, our jurisdiction depends on whether Peque\u00f1o was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">At his removal hearing, Peque\u00f1o admitted that he had been convicted of unlawful use of collected tax and that it was a crime involving moral turpitude.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, the scope of our review is limited by \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C)\u2019s restrictions. <em>See Fernandez-Bernal v. Att\u2019y Gen. of U.S., </em>257 F.3d 1304, 1310 (11th Cir.2001) (holding that \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) stripped the court of jurisdiction to review a final order of removal where the petitioner \u201cadmitted, through his counsel, to committing [a disqualifying offense.]\u201d). Thus, we do not have jurisdiction to inquire further into this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">B. <em>Cancellation of Removal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">We have jurisdiction, however, to review the legal question of whether Peque\u00f1o was an aggravated felon and, thus, ineligible for cancellation of removal. <em>See Alexandre, </em>452 F.3d at 1206. Peque\u00f1o does not raise any other legal questions. Thus, the only remaining issue over which we have jurisdiction is the legal question of whether the conviction for unlawful use of collected tax is an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision. We, therefore, review the BIA\u2019s decision. To the extent that the BIA\u2019s decision was based upon a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir. 2001). The decision we review is the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Pequeno\u2019s conviction was an aggravated theft felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-12\">A conviction is an aggravated felony for immigration purposes if the offense involves \u201ca theft offense ... for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G). The statute of conviction in this case provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-13\">(1) Any person who knowingly obtains or uses, or endeavors to obtain or use, taxes collected pursuant to this chapter, with the intent, either temporarily or permanently, to deprive the state of a right to the funds or a benefit therefrom, or appropriate the funds to his or her own use or to the use of any person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>not entitled thereto, commits theft of state funds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-4\">(2)(a) If the total amount of revenue involved is $100,000 or more, the offense is a felony of the first degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 206.56(1), (2)(a). The statute is clearly a theft statute, so our only remaining inquiry involves whether the minimum term of imprisonment was at least a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Under the state sentencing guidelines in effect at the time, the base offense level for first degree felony theft was 56, and the guidelines sentencing range was 21-35 months. <em>See </em>AR at 312-13. Thus, the minimum term of imprisonment for theft of state funds exceeded one year. It does not matter that imposition of the sentence was withheld pursuant to the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Christopher, </em>239 F.3d 1191, 1193 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">For these reasons, Pequeno\u2019s conviction was an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G). Having answered the legal question that we have jurisdiction to review, we do not have jurisdiction to further review his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">Peque\u00f1o seeks review of the BIA\u2019s decision affirming the IJ\u2019s order denying his application for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b, based on the finding that he is an aggravated felon. We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s order denying withholding of removal; however, we retain jurisdiction to consider the legal question regarding whether Pequeno\u2019s crime constitutes an aggravated felony for purposes of cancellation of removal. Concluding that his tax offense was an aggravated felony, we dismiss the petition to the extent it sought review of the denial of withholding and deny the petition as to the presented legal question. DISMISSED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b805-11\">. On 25 November 2002, President Bush signed into law the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2125. The Homeland Security Act created a new Department of Homeland Security, abolished the INS, and transferred its functions to the new department. However, because this case was initiated while the INS was still in existence, this opinion refers to the agency as the INS rather than the Department of Homeland Security.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b806-7\">.
