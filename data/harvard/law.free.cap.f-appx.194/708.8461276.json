Daniel, through counsel, petitions for review of an order issued by the Bureau of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) dismissing his appeal from the denial by the immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) of his claim for withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). The BIA concluded that country conditions had changed such that former anti-military demonstrators like Daniel would not be singled out for persecution. Because substantial evidence in the record supports this conclusion, we DENY the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-22\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b730-23\">In September 1993, Daniel, a native and citizen of Haiti, arrived in the United States without being properly admitted or paroled. He had fled Haiti after he was beaten by the military for organizing an anti-military protest. In 1998, he sought asylum and withholding of removal. The order we consider was issued by the BIA in November 2005, following an appeal from the IJ\u2019s denial of Daniel\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cCAT\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>The BIA\u2019s order observed that Daniel\u2019s past persecution had come at the hands of the Haitian military and that the military had been disbanded in 1995. The BIA acknowledged that there was still crime and violence in Haiti but that there was insufficient evidence to establish that Daniel had an objectively reasonable basis to believe that he would be sought out for future persecution based on his membership in a particular social, political, or religious group. The BIA concluded that there was insufficient evidence to find the current country conditions were such that Daniel would more likely than not face persecution or torture upon his return to Haiti.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">On appeal, Daniel argues that the BIA erred in holding (1) that the evidence showed that the country conditions have changed in Haiti since he fled in 1993, and (2) that, as a result of these changed conditions, he no longer has a reasonable fear of persecution at the hands of the former Haitian military.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Daniel also asserts that the BIA violated his due process rights by taking judicial notice of alleged changed conditions in finding that he was not more likely than not to be tortured upon his return, while faffing take notice of the articles he attached to his BIA brief showing that the former Haitian military was continuing to wreak havoc.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, \u201cexcept to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s\u201d decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). In this case, the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision, instead relying on its own reasoning. Therefore, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. \u201cTo the extent that the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, [our] review is <em>de novo.\u201d Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">The BIA\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and this Court must affirm the BIA\u2019s decisions \u201cif [they are] supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284 (citation and quotations omitted). The substantial evidence test is \u201cdeferential\u201d and does not allow \u201creweighfing] the evidence from scratch.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. Office of U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001) (quotations omitted). \u201cTo reverse the ... fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>To qualify for withholding of removal under the INA, an alien must show that, if returned to his country, \u201cthe alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened\u201d on account of \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). \u201cAn alien bears the burden of demonstrating that he more-likely-than-not would be persecuted or tortured upon his return to the country in question.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. If a petitioner is unable to meet the standard of proof \u201cfor asylum, he is generally precluded from qualifying for ... withholding of removal.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Where an alien has established past persecution in his country on account of a statutorily protected ground,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9r\">it is presumed that his life or freedom would be threatened upon return to his country unless the INS shows by a preponderance of the evidence that, among other things, (1) the country\u2019s conditions have changed such that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would no longer be threatened upon his removal; or (2) that the alien could avoid a future threat to his life or freedom by relocating to another part of the proposed country of removal, and it would be reasonable to expect him to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-5\"><em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. Nevertheless, even an alien who has not shown past persecution may still be entitled to withholding of removal \u201cif he can demonstrate a future threat to his life or freedom on a protected ground in his country.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2)). An alien need not show that he would be singled out for persecution if he establishes that in his home country \u201cthere is a pattern or practice of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to [him] on account of [a protected ground].\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2)(i). If the threat of violence equally affects all people in a country, without regard for their membership in a group or class recognized by the INA, then that general threat of violence \u201cwill not support a finding of a well-founded fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Palma-Mazariegos v. Gonzales, </em>428 F.3d 30, 37 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">A review of the record shows that the BIA\u2019s finding of changed conditions is supported by substantial evidence. While the evidence reveals that Haiti suffers from abject poverty and violence, there is no indication that members of the former military would single out Daniel for persecution on account of his 1993 anti-military activities; that is, there is insufficient support for a belief that the threat of violence is greater for people in Daniel\u2019s identified social, political, or religious class. Thus, Daniel has failed to establish that members of the former military will engage in a pattern or practice of targeting its cirea1993 opponents on account of a statutorily protected ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">Daniel has petitioned us to review the BIA\u2019s order dismissing his appeal from the IJ\u2019s denial of his claim for withholding of removal under the INA. The BIA concluded that country conditions had changed such that former anti-military demonstrators would not be singled out for persecution. Because substantial evidence in the record supports this conclusion, we DENY the petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-6\">. Daniel does not raise any challenge in his appellate brief to the denial of his asylum claim as untimely or to the denial of his claim for relief under CAT. Accordingly, he has abandoned these issues. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b731-7\">. The scope of our appellate review is limited to the administrative record on which the IJ\u2019s order of removal is based. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A); <em>see also In re Fedorenko, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 57, 74, 1984 WL 48585 (BIA 1984) (holding that it was inappropriate for the BIA to accept new evidence proffered by the respondent that was not before the IJ because the BIA was \"an appellate body whose function [was] to review, not to create, a record\u201d). Furthermore, we conclude that, contrary to Daniel\u2019s claim, the evidence shows that the BIA, in its decision, did not take judicial notice of the changed conditions in Haiti, but instead relied on the evidence included in the administrative record. Thus, the BIA did not violate Daniel\u2019s due process rights by refusing to review documents that were not included in the administrative record compiled by the IJ. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A); <em>In re Fedorenko, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 74.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
