We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-14\">Jackson contends that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support a conviction under \u00a7 922(g) because it did not establish that he knowingly possessed a firearm. He argues that the police officers\u2019 testimony failed to establish a link between the items the officers saw Jackson drop and throw while being chased by police and the pistol and loaded pistol magazine later recovered from the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-16\">\u201cWe review challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Futrell, </em>209 F.3d 1286, 1288 (11th Cir.2000). The jury has the exclusive power to determine the credibility of witnesses. <em>United States v. Chastain, </em>198 F.3d 1338, 1351 (11th Cir.1999). Testimony is incredible as a matter of law if it includes \u201cfacts that [the witness] physically could not have possibly observed or events that could not have occurred under the laws of nature.\u201d <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>775 F.2d 1559, 1561 (11th Cir.1985) (internal quotations omitted) (brackets in original). We will deem the evidence sufficient if a reasonable fact-finder could have found that the evidence established that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. McDowell, </em>250 F.3d 1354, 1365 (11th Cir .2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-17\">\u201cTo establish a violation of \u00a7 922(g)(1), the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt three elements: (1) that the defendant was a convicted felon, (2) that the defendant was in knowing possession of a firearm, and (3) that the firearm was in or affecting interstate commerce.\u201d <em>United States v. Deleveaux, </em>205 F.3d 1292, 1296-97 (11th Cir.2000). Knowing possession can by shown by either actual or constructive possession, so long as there is a reasonable inference that the accused maintained \u201cdominion and control\u201d over the weapon. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>933 F.2d 962, 965 (11th Cir.1991)</p>\n<p id=\"b611-18\">Because Jackson concedes that elements (1) and (3) were shown, we only need address the sufficiency of the evidence as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>to element (2). Officers Chad Hughes and Claude Debnam both testified that they saw Jackson: (1) drop an object after he fell while running from police; and (2) throw an object over the roof of a shed as he ran. Debnam testified that he went to the area where Jackson had dropped the object and found a pistol magazine containing ammunition. Officer Clifford Huggins testified that at one point during the chase, he was on the east side of a shed and Jackson was on the west side. Huggins testified that a handgun was thrown over the shed and landed on the ground in front of him. Based on this trial testimony, a reasonable factfinder could have found that the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that Jackson knowingly possessed a firearm. <em>See Deleveaux, </em>205 F.3d at 1296-97; <em>Rivera, </em>775 F.2d at 1561; <em>McDowell, </em>250 F.3d at 1365; <em>Sweeting, </em>933 F.2d at 965. Because sufficient evidence supported the jury\u2019s verdict, we affirm Jackson\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
