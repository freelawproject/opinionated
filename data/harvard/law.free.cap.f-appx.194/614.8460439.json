No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-14\">Archibald first asserts that the district erred in denying him a minor role reduction, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.203).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He contends that he was less culpable than the other persons found on the \u201cgo-fast\u201d boat, which was carrying 1,759 kilograms of cocaine, because he was a crew member who had no ownership interest in the smuggled drugs and was paid little in comparison to the value of the smuggled drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-15\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s determinations about a defendant\u2019s role in an offense. <em>United States v. Ryan, </em>289 F.3d 1339, 1348 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cThe defendant has the burden of establishing his role by a preponderance of evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b), \u201c[a] defendant warrants a two-level reduction for playing a minor role in an offense if he is less culpable than most other participants, although his role could not be described as minimal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-16\">Sentencing courts should consider two elements when determining a defendant\u2019s role in an offense: \u201cfirst, the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which [he] has been held accountable at sentencing, and, second, [his] role as compared to that of other participants in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 940 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-17\">The district court committed no clear error in determining that Archibald\u2019s role in the offense was more than minor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>About the first element, Archibald\u2019s sentence was based only on the relevant conduct for which he was held accountable at sentencing: the 1,759 kilograms of cocaine seized from the \u201cgo-fast\u201d boat. And the district court correctly pointed to the large drug quantity in denying Archibald a minor role reduction. <em>See id. </em>at 943 (noting that, in the drug courier context, the amount of drugs is a \u201cmaterial consideration\u201d in assessing defendant\u2019s role in his relevant conduct). About the second element, Archibald was one of only five crew members on the \u201cgo-fast\u201d boat, which was carrying nearly two tons of cocaine. He has not established that he was less culpable than the other crew members; and we see no clear error in the district court\u2019s refusal to apply a minor role reduction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Archibald next argues that his sentence was unreasonable under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He contends that the district court\u2019s failure to make sufficient findings \u2014 including articulating why a sentence within Archibald\u2019s Guideline range was appropriate and discussing specifically the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors used to calculate his sentence \u2014 indicates that his sentence was unreasonable. Archibald was sentenced after the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Booker; </em>and we review Archibald\u2019s sentence for reasonableness in the light of the factors set out in section 3553(a). <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244-46 (11th Cir. 2005).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">We conclude that Archibald\u2019s sentence was reasonable. The district court correctly calculated Archibald\u2019s Guideline imprisonment range as 135-168 months; and the court sentenced Archibald to the lowest point of his Guideline range.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In sentencing Archibald, the district court noted the section 3553(a) factors and commented on the quantity of drugs involved. The district court judge was not required to discuss all of the section 3553(a) factors at Archibald\u2019s sentencing hearing. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the section 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the section 3553(a) factors\u201d). And nothing in the record convinces us that Archibald\u2019s sentence was unreasonable in the light of the section 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-11\">. On appeal Archibald also argues for the first time that he was entitled to a minimal role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B 1.2(a). Because we conclude that the district court did not err in refusing to apply a minor role reduction, we reject Archibald\u2019s argument about a minimal role reduction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b637-19\">. Archibald also argues that the district court erred in denying him a minor role reduction because the court failed to make fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>tual findings on this decision. Because we have explained that, \"[i]n making the ultimate determination of the defendant's role in the offense, the sentencing judge has no duty to make any specific subsidiaiy factual findings,\u201d Archibald\u2019s claim is without merit. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b638-6\">. The government asserts that we should conclude that a sentence imposed within a defendant\u2019s applicable Guideline range, such as Archibald's, is presumptively reasonable. Although we have acknowledged that \"the use of the Guidelines remains central to the sentencing process,\u201d we have rejected the argument that a sentence within the Guidelines is <em>per se </em>reasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 787 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b638-14\">. Except for disputing the district court\u2019s decision not to apply a minor role reduction to his sentence, Archibald does not challenge the district court\u2019s calculation of his Guideline range.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b638-15\">. The government argues that Archibald's failure to raise an objection in district court to the reasonableness of his sentence, or to ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>gue that the district court did not consider sufficiently the section 3553(a) factors, indicates that, instead of reviewing his sentence for reasonableness, we should review Archibald\u2019s challenge on appeal to the reasonableness of his sentence only for plain error. We need not decide this issue because, for the reasons discussed, Archibald\u2019s claim that his sentence was unreasonable fails under either standard of review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
