The defendants claim that the district court erred or abused its discretion (1) by finding that it had subject matter jurisdiction, (2) by finding that the defendants willfully infringed two of Macklin\u2019s works, (3) by denying their post-verdict request for a jury trial or an evidentiary hearing to determine damages; and (4) by finding that they were properly served with filings and motions. After thoroughly considering the briefs and the record, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
