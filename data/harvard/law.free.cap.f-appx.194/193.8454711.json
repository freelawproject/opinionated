He argues that the district court erred in allowing him to represent himself during a portion of the trial without first ensuring that he knowingly and intelligently waived the right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-22\">Our de novo review of the record establishes that the district court sufficiently cautioned Hearn regarding the perils of self-representation such that he \u201c[knew] what he [was] doing and his choice [was] made with eyes open.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>421 F.3d 359, 363 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>269 F.3d 514, 518 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The district court fully adhered to the recommended inquiry set forth in the Benchbook for U.S. District Court Judges before finding that Hearn\u2019s waiver of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was knowing and voluntary, and the record does not establish that any further admonition was warranted based on the circumstances of Hearn\u2019s case. <em>See Jones, </em>421 F.3d at 363-64 &amp; n. 3; <em>Davis, </em>269 F.3d at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b215-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
