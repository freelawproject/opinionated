The plaintiffs, all permanent members of the regular Cambridge police force, brought an action for themselves and on behalf of other permanent members of the force against the defendants, seeking a declaration under G. L. c. 231A that service time as an inactive reserve officer should be credited in the computation of a police officer\u2019s entitlement to vacation. Intrinsic to the dispute\u2019s resolution was the need to determine (a) whether Cambridge ordinance no. 154,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> enacted on May 17, 1948 (defining service for computation of vacation as commencing with the date of a policeman\u2019s appointment as a reserve officer) had been superseded or repealed by the city\u2019s acceptance of two pieces of permissive State legislation concerning the topic of police vacations,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or by the city\u2019s general recodification of all of its ordinances enacted on May 8, 1972; and (b) whether the plaintiffs\u2019 seven year delay in pursuing their claims after the city abandoned computing vacation credit in light of the definition of service in ordinance no. 154 amounted to laches. A judge heard the dispute on stipulated facts and agreed exhibits and declared the rights of the parties to the effect that (1) ordinance no. 154 was not superseded nor repealed by the city\u2019s acceptance of permissive legislation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>regarding police vacations, but was effectively repealed by the city\u2019s recodification of its ordinances in 1972, (2) that the 1972 recodification was properly enacted, and (3) any claims the plaintiffs may have had between 1967 and 1972 as a result of the city\u2019s change in vacation policy were lost by laches on their part.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">1. <em>Conflict between the statutes and the ordinance. </em>We agree with the judge that ordinance no. 154 was not repealed or superseded by the city\u2019s acceptance of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 111D and 111L, establishing length of police vacations. Repeal of a municipal ordinance by supervening Statewide legislation of general content is disfavored unless there exists \"some positive repugnancy\u201d between the terms of the ordinance and the legislation. <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Marlborough, </em>318 Mass. 610, 613 (1945). See also <em>Druzik </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Haverhill, </em>324 Mass. 129, 135-136 (1949). A local ordinance may permissibly regulate the same subject covered by the statute \"[i]f the State legislative purpose can be achieved in the face of a local ordinance or by-law on the same subject....\u201d <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>363 Mass. 136, 156 (1973). Sections 111D and 111L of G. L. c. 41 provide for length of vacations based on years of service on the police force but are otherwise silent on how that service is to be calculated. Ordinance no. 154 could permissibly coexist within the interstices of the statutes to provide a definition of \"service\u201d (commencing with the date of reserve appointment) for purposes of allocating vacation time, a subject not addressed expressly or by necessary implication in either \u00a7 HID or \u00a7 111L of c. 41. The two enactments were, as ruled by the judge, \"fully capable of being read together in furtherance of a common purpose.\u201d See <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Assn. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>367 Mass. 368, 372-373 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">2. <em>Effect of the 1972 recodification. </em>The judge also correctly concluded that the general recodification of the Cambridge ordinances enacted by the city council on May 8,1972, repealed ordinance no. 154. The 1972 compilation was intended as a complete overhaul and updating of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>of the city\u2019s ordinances. Not only the ordinance in contest, but also all other ordinances then in effect, were repealed by the clear and unequivocal language of \u00a7 1-5 of the 1972 code which expressly provided that \"aZZ <em>ordinances </em>of the City <em>heretofore in force </em>are hereby repealed\u201d (emphasis supplied). Further support for the fact that ordinance no. 154 was repealed is found in \u00a7 15-5 of the revised code. That section provides fourteen days\u2019 annual vacation for police officers after six months of service. Significantly, it omits any reference to the definition of reserve service contained in ordinance no. 154. Taken as a whole, the 1972 ordinances deal with police vacations by allocating in \u00a7 15-5 two weeks of time off to officers with less than five years\u2019 service, and by leaving vacation benefits for officers with more than five years of service to the provisions of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 HID and 111L.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">We see nothing in the city solicitor\u2019s letter to the city manager dated November 8, 1971, to aid the plaintiffs\u2019 position that the revised code was intended to maintain ordinance no. 154 in effect. In that letter, apparently admitted without objection, the solicitor informed the city manager with regard to the revised ordinances that \"[n]o substantive changes have been made except the total fine has been increased to fifty dollars which is the legal maximum at present. Conflicting, redundant and repealed ordinances have been eliminated.\u201d The plaintiff argues that this language manifests an intent that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>substantive changes were to be made in the existing ordinances with the exception of altering fines, thus leaving ordinance no. 154 in effect. But the fact that in 1967 the city had abandoned use of the date of reserve appointment for purposes of computing vacation time, and the fact that the council acted on the full text of the revised ordinances (which expressly repealed \"all\u201d prior ordinances, made no mention of the contents of ordinance no. 154, and provided a different scheme for vacations) sufficiently dispel any value that this correspondence may have for the conclusion that the provisions of ordinance no. 154 were incorporated by implication into the revised code. Moreover, the letter read in context indicates that the revision was indeed designed to repeal all existing ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Nor does the language in \u00a7 1-9 of the revised ordinances, which provides that \"[t]his Code shall not affect ... any right accrued ...,\u201d help the plaintiffs\u2019 position. While it is true that the repeal of an ordinance cannot act to deprive a person of vested economic rights or impair contractual obligations (see 6 McQuillan, Municipal Corporations \u00a7\u00a7 21.15 and 21.45 [3d ed. 1969]), there is nothing in ordinance no. 154 which expressly vests a contractual entitlement to a certain amount of vacation time, a circumstance which the plaintiffs apparently recognized by the negotiation of two collective bargaining agreements which incorporated the city\u2019s computation of service for vacation credit, and abandoned the plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on the provisions of the repealed ordinance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">3. <em>Procedural defects in the recodification. </em>The plaintiffs contend that the recodification was invalid because the city failed to comply with the provisions of G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 23, and the second paragraph of \u00a7 3 of c. 1 of the Cam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>bridge ordinances of1943. The first sentence of G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 23, as appearing in St. 1935, c. 68, \u00a7 1, which added the emphasized phrase, provides, \u2018Every proposed ordinance or loan order, except emergency measures as herein-before defined <em>and revenue loan orders, </em>shall be published once in full in at least one newspaper of the city, and in any additional manner that may be provided by ordinance, at least ten days before its final passage.\u201d The remainder of \u00a7 23, which was unaffected by St. 1935, c. 68, \u00a7 1, includes an exemption from publication for any \"codification of ordinances or proposed ordinances ... (which) exceed[s] in length eight octavo pages of ordinary book print.\u201d The exemption permits, in lieu of advertising, publication in a \"printed pamphlet\u201d at least ten days prior to final passage of the ordinances. The first paragraph of \u00a7 3 of c. 1 of the 1943 Cambridge ordinances replicates of G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 23, as in effect prior to St. 1935, c. 68, \u00a7 1. The second paragraph of that same section, however, replicates the first sentence of G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 23, as appearing in St. 1935, c. 68, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The full text of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>1972 code of ordinances exceeded eight octavo pages of ordinary book print and the city, in reliance on the exemption from publication, contained in c. 43, \u00a7 23, and the first paragraph of \u00a7 3 of c. 1 of the 1943 ordinances, prepared a looseleaf photocopy of the new code and published three separate notices in the Cambridge Chronicle that the entire text of the ordinances would be available for examination in the city clerk\u2019s office.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We find, as did the judge below, that the second paragraph of \u00a7 3, c. 1, of the 1943 ordinances did not require publication of the entire text of the recodification and that a looseleaf photocopy of the code satisfied the requirement in the statutory exemption that a \"printed pamphlet\u201d be prepared. Any apparent inconsistency between the first and second paragraphs of \u00a7 3 of c. 1 of the 1943 ordinances is remedied by a construction which concludes that the second paragraph was added to the chapter as an inept, but effective, attempt to conform the chapter to G. L. c. 43, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>\u00a7 23, as appearing in St. 1935, c. 68, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Such a construction is reasonable and sensible, harmonizes both paragraphs of the ordinance with each other and with G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 23, and promotes the legislative purpose of avoiding newspaper publication of the entire text of documents of extraordinary length. Publication in a looseleaf binder of a photocopy of the ordinances sufficiently complied with the printed pamphlet requirements of both the statute and the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">4. <em>Laches. </em>The final issue concerns the plaintiffs\u2019 seven-year delay in commencing suit after knowledge of the city\u2019s change in computation of vacations. Some time during the summer of 1967 the city ceased using inactive reserve time in computing vacations and instead measured length of service for vacations solely on an officer\u2019s active reserve or permanent service time. The judge ruled that the city had met its burden of establishing the defense of laches to cut off its liability to the plaintiffs for any damages between 1967 and 1972, when ordinance no. 154 remained in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Laches is an equitable defense consisting of unreasonable delay in instituting an action which results in some injury or prejudice to the defendant. <em>Security Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>345 Mass. 434, 441 (1963). <em>Pettinella </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>355 Mass. 412, 414-415 (1969). <em>Three Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Phoenix Ins. Co., </em>357 Mass. 271, 278 (1970). Its presence is ordinarily a determination of fact based on the particular circumstances of the case. <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>C.T. Sherer Co., </em>291 Mass. 35, 59-60 (1935). <em>Tzitzon Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Mustonen, </em>352 Mass. 648, 650 (1967). There were findings that between 1971 and 1974 the city and the police union negotiated and signed two collective bargaining agreements.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Both agreements adopted \"current policies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>and benefits relating to vacations ..which had the effect of incorporating into the agreements the city\u2019s practice of using the date of an officer\u2019s permanent appointment in determining his vacation credit. The agreements also spelled out a grievance procedure for resolution of any dispute concerning the application or interpretation of any provision of the agreement and any disagreements with reference to \"any law, ordinance, rule or regulation, policy or practice relating to the Police Department and its operations----\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The judge found as well that both the city and the police settled on the vacation clause in the agreements with full knowledge of the costs and benefits implicit in the current vacation policy and that the city, in reliance on the negotiated results embodied in the agreements, committed itself to funding the contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">We agree that the delay in commencing suit was inordinate<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and that, under the circumstances, the delay worked to the disadvantage of the city. The police failed, over the life of the first contract and during a portion of the time the second agreement was in force, to invoke the grievance apparatus either to test the city\u2019s interpretation of vacation benefits or to determine the applicability of the benefits purportedly granted by ordinance no. 154. There is merit in the defendant\u2019s argument that if the police had insisted on the pre-1967 vacation practices at the bargaining table, the city might have changed its position on other topics covered by the contracts, seeking in the give and take of negotiations some concessions from the union in exchange for lengthier vacations. Fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>thermore, based in part on the vacation policies as expressed in the executed agreements, the city appropriated amounts in its municipal budgets earmarked to implement the financial obligations required by the contracts. We conclude that the judge\u2019s findings as to laches are not clearly erroneous and are sound in law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The circumstances are governed in substance by the rule that \"it would not be in accordance with sound principles to permit the plaintiff to accept in silence a stipulated weekly wage week after week and then, without previous notice, seek to recover more.\u201d <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Woburn, </em>220 Mass. 416, 420 (1915).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b719-6\"> Ordinance no. 154 provided vacations of varying length for permanent Cambridge police officers based on their length of service and defined service as running from \"the day of appointment as a Reserve Police Officer in the Police Dept.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b719-7\"> On October 24, 1949, Cambridge accepted St. 1949, c. 384 (now G.

On June 20, 1968, the city accepted St. 1968, c. 33 (now G.

L. c. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 HID and 111L, in effect. The omission of the language contained in ordinance no. 154 also has to be viewed in light of the provisions of \u00a7 1-5 that \"the provisions of this Code, in so far as they are substantially the same as ordinance provisions previously adopted by the City relating to the same subject matter, shall be construed as restatements and continuations thereof....\u201d The omission of any provisions in the revision similar to the text of ordinance no. 154 indicates a lack of intent to incorporate it into the revised code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b722-7\"> The judge also found, based on stipulated facts, that continuously from the summer of1967, the city computed service time for vacations for most permanent police officers on the basis of the officer\u2019s date of assignment to active duty using reserve time only in some \"undefined\u201d and \"episodic\u201d instances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b723-5\"> The full text of c. 1, \u00a7 3, of the 1943 Cambridge general ordinances provides as follows: \"Every proposed ordinance or loan order, except emergency measures as hereinbefore defined, shall be published once in full in at least one newspaper of the city, and in any additional manner that may be provided by ordinance, at least ten days before its final passage.
