By this action pursuant to G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 11, the commission seeks to enforce its order, set forth in a supplemental decision dated October 25, 1976, that the city cease and desist from prohibited practices and pay each affected firefighter ten percent of his regular hourly wage for each hour spent on night floor patrol performing desk duty. The Superior Court granted judgment for the commission on the pleadings, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">The city\u2019s contention that the commission\u2019s order was not supported by substantial evidence is foreclosed by the city\u2019s failure to file an appeal under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, from either the commission\u2019s original or supplemental decisions. Under \u00a7 11 of G. L. c. 150E (\"Labor Relations: Public Employees\u201d), as amended by St. 1974, c. 589, \u00a7 3, the commission is authorized to \"institute appropriate proceedings in the superior court ... for enforcement of its order ....\u201d There is no provision in c. 150E, \u00a7 11, for review of the commission\u2019s orders by an aggrieved party. The city argues that an enforcement proceeding under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>c. 150E, \u00a7 11, should be conducted in a manner similar to the procedures outlined in G. L. c. 150A, \u00a7 6(e), governing enforcement proceedings by the commission in cases involving private sector employees. Chapter 150A, \u00a7 6(e), as amended through St. 1974, c. 725, \u00a7 3, provides that in an action by the commission for enforcement of its order, the order \"shall be reviewed in accordance with the standards for review provided in\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7), the State Administrative Procedure Act. See <em>Labor Relations Commn. </em>v. <em>University Hosp., Inc., </em>359 Mass. 516, 520 &amp; n.3 (1971). Thus, the city argues that it should be entitled to a scope of judicial review comparable to that provided for by G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7), even though it filed no appeal. We do not agree. The absence of any provision in G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 11, for review of the commission\u2019s decisions leads to the conclusion that the Legislature intended judicial review of orders of the commission in cases involving public employees to proceed by way of appeal under the State Administrative Procedure Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and not under c. 150E, \u00a7 11. \"Where no statutory form of judicial review or appeal is provided, judicial review shall be obtained by means of a civil action\u201d commenced within thirty days after receipt of notice of the final decision of the agency. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, as amended by St. 1976, c. 411. Since the city failed to file a complaint seeking judicial review of the commission\u2019s final decision and order within the thirty-day limit required by c. 30A, \u00a7 14,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the only issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>before the Superior Court was whether the commission\u2019s decision was within its jurisdiction. See <em>Department of Pub. Welfare </em>v. <em>Billerica, </em>350 Mass. 56, 57 (1966); <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Tewksbury, </em>350 Mass. 507, 508-509 (1966); <em>Director of Div. of Water Pollution Control </em>v. <em>Uxbridge, </em>361 Mass. 589, 592-593 (1972). We conclude that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Under G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 11, the commission, once it determines that a prohibited practice under c. 150E, \u00a7 10, has been committed, is authorized to issue a cease and desist order to the offending party \"and shall take such further affirmative action as will comply with the provisions of this section ....\u201d We construe the language \"further affirmative action\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as contemplating remedial measures to be determined by the commission including, but not limited to, those specified in the statute, such as reinstatement with or without back pay of an employee discharged or discriminated against in violation of c. 150E, \u00a7 10.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Analogous language in the Federal Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c) (1976), has been construed by Federal courts as endowing the National Labor Relations Board with broad remedial powers to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>devise remedies to effectuate the policies of the Act. <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Seven-Up Bottling Co., </em>344 U.S. 344, 346 (1953). <em>Fibreboard Paper Prod. Corp. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>379 U.S. 203, 215-216 (1964). The Board\u2019s authorization under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c) \"to take ... affirmative action\u201d has been construed \"to include the conduct of proceedings to determine the amount of back pay following court enforcement of a Board order directing payment of back pay in general terms.\u201d <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Nickey Chevrolet Sales, Inc., </em>493 F.2d 103, 105 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 834 (1974).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is well established that the reference to reinstatement with back pay in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c) is only illustrative of affirmative action and does not exhaust the possibilities. See <em>Phelps Dodge Corp. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>313 U.S. 177, 188, 194 (1941), and Note, 84 Harv. L. Rev. 1670, 1684 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Since the unilateral change instituted by the employer in the hours during which firefighters were required to perform floor patrol was found by the commission to constitute a refusal to bargain collectively in good faith and hence an unfair labor practice under c. 150E, \u00a7 10(a)(5), the commission had the power under c. 150E, \u00a7 11, to order the employer to make whole those employees who were required to perform additional duties while the mayor\u2019s order was in effect. As the Federal courts have held, any employer guilty of a refusal to bargain by unilaterally changing working conditions may be ordered to make the affected employees whole for the losses caused by the unilateral changes. <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Frontier Homes Corp., </em>371 F.2d 974, 981 (8th Cir. 1967). <em>Overnite Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>372 F.2d 765, 770 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 389 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>U.S. 838 (1967). It does not appear that the commission here has compelled the employer to agree to any substantive contractual provision of a collective bargaining agreement (contrast <em>H.K. Porter Co. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>397 U.S. 99, 106-108 [1970]); it is merely attempting, in compliance with the provisions of c. 150E, \u00a7 11, to restore the situation as nearly as possible to that which would have existed but for the unfair labor practice. <em>J.H. Rutter-Rex Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>399 F.2d 356, 361 (5th Cir. 1968), reversed on other grounds, 396 U.S. 258 (1969). The judgment of the Superior Court enforcing the commission\u2019s order directing the city to cease and desist and to make payment due to the firefighters for hours worked on night floor patrol is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b846-5\"> We note that G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 178F and 178L (both repealed by St. 1973, c. 1078, \u00a7 1), the predecessor statutes to G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 11, contained no provision for review by a party aggrieved by an order of the commission. Review in such cases was permitted under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. See, e.g., <em>School Comm. of Stoughton </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 262, 265-266 (1976) (after further appellate review was allowed by the Supreme Judicial Court, 370 Mass. 867 [1976], the appeal was voluntarily dismissed by agreement of the parties). Compare G. L. c. 150A, \u00a7 6(f), which provides for review of an order of the commission by an aggrieved party who files an appeal within thirty days after receipt of notice of the order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b846-6\"> The city did not at any time prior to the commencement of the commission\u2019s action for enforcement file an appeal. The commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>filed its complaint on February 7,1977,105 days after issuance of its supplemental decision and order and 278 days after issuance of its original decision and order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b847-9\"> In <em>Labor Relations Commn. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Dracut, </em>374 Mass. 619, 624 (1978), the court construed similar language in G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178L, in which no provision for judicial enforcement of commission orders was made, to mean resort to the equitable powers of the Supreme Judicial Court and the Superior Court. Since G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 11, was amended by St. 1974, c. 589, \u00a7 3, to include an express provision for judicial enforcement of the commission\u2019s orders, we think the phrase \"further affirmative action\u201d provides relief broader in scope than that permitted through equitable powers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b847-10\"> This court has held, in a case arising under c. 149, \u00a7 178L, that the term \"reinstatement\u201d is to be construed broadly. \"[Ojne may be 'reinstated\u2019 to a former status and awarded back pay even though he has not been discharged.\u201d <em>School Comm. of Stoughton </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., supra </em>at 270.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b848-6\"> While it is the ordinary practice of the NLRB not to consider the amount of back pay until its general remedial order has been enforced by the court on its merits, <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Nickey Chevrolet Sales, Inc., supra </em>at 106), we see no reason for this court to refrain from treating the original and supplemental orders of the commission in one proceeding. The city raises no argument concerning the amount of the monetary award ordered by the commission to be made to the employees, challenging only the commission\u2019s authority to make the award.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
