The administrator\u2019s use of existing rents as the measure for such items is no less rational than the use by the Housing Court judge of requested rents as such measure. Since existing rents may be too low, and requested rents may be too high, both figures are subject to comparable infirmities. Which of the two alternatives, if any, is to be chosen, is a matter within the substantial discretion of the administrator. Cf. <em>Sherman, </em>367 Mass. at 8. Mathematical exactitude is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">We also have no difficulty in accepting the administrator\u2019s findings as to heating costs which he estimated based on figures received by him from the landlord\u2019s gas company. A petitioner proposing a rent increase has the burden of proving his expenses. Implicit in the statutory requirement that rents be adjusted so as to yield efficient<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> landlords a \"fair net operating income\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is the fundamental requirement that adequate evidence be made available to the administrator. Cf. <em>Travelers Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>362 Mass. 301, 305 (1972). See also <em>Zussman, </em>371 Mass. at 638; <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Brookline, ante </em>110, 119 (1979). The landlord cannot complain if the gaps left by his data are only partially closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">In order to compute a fair rent, the administrator determined a \"value\u201d for the property. This is clearly authorized. The pertinent statute, St. 1970, c. 842,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> has been construed to require \"that rents be set so as to assure to landlords a reasonable return on their investment.\u201d <em>Marshal House, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Brookline, </em>358 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Mass. 686, 703 (1971). This standard is somewhat higher than one which requires only that the rate be nonconfiscatory. <em>Id. </em>While the term \"investment\u201d has not been defined, a return on investment need not mean a return on purchase price, <em>Zussman </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Brookline, </em>371 Mass. at 639, nor need it mean a return on fair market value, <em>Niles </em>v. <em>Boston Rent Control Admr., </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 135, 147-148 (1978), especially where the figures are inflated.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">It is a far simpler task to state what \"value\u201d is not than to chart a course for determining what it is. As pointed out by the court in <em>Troy Hills Village </em>v. <em>Township Council of Parsippany </em>\u2014 Troy <em>Hills, </em>68 N.J. 604, 623-626 (1975),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> no one method is always suitable, and each has its own problems. For these reasons, another route for the determination of a fair operating return is often taken. In <em>Niles </em>v. <em>Boston Rent Control Admr., </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. at 141-148, we held, under the facts there presented, that a fair return was provided by following a regulation of the administrator which did not require a computation of value. The regulation presumed that 1971 rents yielded a fair operating return, <em>Niles, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. at 138, 147, and permitted the landlord to pass through to the tenants increases in costs incurred after 1971. While the cost pass-through method yielded a fair return in that case, we recognized the possibility that there may be instances when it does not. <em>Niles, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. at 147, 149-150. Apparently, this is such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The administrator had little evidence before him. Few figures were provided by the landlord, and his 1971 costs were not substantiated so as to enable the administrator to use the cost pass-through method. The landlord has not appealed, and our examination of the record does not disclose any hint that the landlord suggested any method of valuing the property or that he provided any data as to valuation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>After hearing evidence that the landlord considered taxes too high and that a tenant thought the building overassessed, the hearing officer calculated value according to the following procedure: 1) he divided the total then current rents by three to obtain a figure called \"hypothetical taxes\u201d; 2) he divided \"hypothetical taxes\u201d by the Boston tax rate adjusted to obtain a \"hypothetical assessment\u201d in dollars; and 3) he then multiplied the \"hypothetical assessment\u201d by three.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The administrator adopted the figure so computed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">A majority of the panel,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> in the narrow circumstances of this case, and having in mind the presumptive validity of the agency decision, <em>Zussman, </em>371 Mass. at 642 (Wilkins, J., concurring), do not find the decision irrational. The record shows the paucity of the data supplied by the landlord and does not include any regulations of the administrator.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>While we are not disturbing the method used by the administrator here in light of the sparse record presented, we do not suggest that it would be appropriate in other factual situations. Inherent in the statutory scheme of St. 1970, c. 842, is the requirement that matters left to the expertise of the administrator be carefully considered by him and that he \"exercise informed judgment.\u201d <em>Sherman, </em>367 Mass. at 10. This obligation is implicit in \u00a7 5(d), the provision which permits the administrator to make studies and investigations, gives him subpoena powers and authorizes him to obtain such information as is necessary for promulgating regulations, rules or orders. It is also implicit in \u00a7 7, which lists specific factors which the administrator must take into account in making rent adjustments, in the procedural provisions requiring hearings (see \u00a7\u00a7 7[e], 8[a] and 8[b]), and in \u00a7 5(c), which envisions the promulgation of regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The judgment of the Housing Court is reversed and the case remanded to that court for entry of judgment putting into effect the rent adjustment approved by the administrator retroactive to the date of the administrator\u2019s first decision<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> of April 10,1975. <em>Zussman </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Brookline, </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 135, 143-144 n.14 (1976), reversed on other grounds, 371 Mass. 632 (1976). <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Brookline, supra </em>at 119-120.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">So <em>ordered.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b345-16\"> The Housing Court judge allowed an annual increase of $1,920, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>which would raise total annual rents to $8,880.

There is no transcript of testimony, but notes of the hearing officer state that the landlord testified that attempts to obtain abatements had failed and that, in the absence of an increase in rents, the building would be lost.
