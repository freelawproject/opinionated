The land in question (land or the lots) consists of two of approximately ten undeveloped lots at the bay tip of Saquish Peninsula in Plymouth. The peninsula is about seven miles long and extends from the mainland of the town of Duxbury into Plymouth Bay. Thus, the Saquish area of Plymouth is accessible from Plymouth center only by travelling across Plymouth Bay or through the town of Duxbury. Land access to the lots is by means of Landing Road, which runs the length of the peninsula and which may be travelled only by four-wheel drive vehicles. This road has been in use for at least thirty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-15\">On July 26,1973, Plymouth adopted \u00a7 300.05 of its zoning by-law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which requires that before any building or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>other permit can issue the lot subject to the application must have either frontage on and access to a street or some kind of access to a public way, the adequacy of which has been approved by the planning board. On June 24,1974, Spalke filed with the Plymouth zoning administrator and building inspector a paper which was styled as an application for a \"zoning permit\u201d and in which he requested permission to erect a summer cottage on this land. We have been presented only \u00a7 300.05 of the by-law, and neither there nor anywhere in the record is the specific meaning of \"zoning permit\u201d set out. However, we have reviewed the application together with \u00a7 300.05, and we think it is clear that what Spalke sought was a building permit. The building inspector and zoning administrator denied the application because \"in the opinion of the Plymouth Planning Board the lots on the ways in Saquish do not have the required frontage on or access to a street which has adequate access to a Public Way.\u201d Spalke appealed from this denial to the Plymouth zoning board of appeals (board), which affirmed the denial, finding that construction on the lots \"would pose a hazard to vehicular access thereto because the only present methods of access ... are by means of ... especially equipped four-wheel drive vehicles,... boats, or ... helicopters.\u201d It further found that construction in this area would increase the potential for sewage to become mixed with ground water and ocean water during periods of high tide.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Spalke appealed from this decision to the Superior Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 21,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> where a judge annulled the decision of the board. The board appeals from this judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">In the Superior Court Spalke presented numerous arguments: that the land was not a resubdivision as defined by G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81L; that it qualified for the exemption of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81FF; that \u00a7 300.05 of the Plymouth by-law was not applicable to the lot because of the zoning exemption of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 5A; that the Atlantic Ocean was a public way for zoning and subdivision purposes; and that the board\u2019s decision was an arbitrary exercise of power because it did not decide his appeal within sixty days, as mandated by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 18. The judge did not reach any of those issues, ruling that none of them was central to a resolution of the matter because in light of \"all of the circumstances of this case the decision to deny a zoning permit... in Saquish [had been] arbitrary and unreasonable.\u201d This determination was based on the fact that after the enactment of \u00a7 300.05 in 1973, and after the denial of Spalke\u2019s application for a building permit, the board had granted a building permit for construction of a summer home on Clarke\u2019s Island. This island is situated in Plymouth Bay and is also under the municipal jurisdiction of Plymouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">We reach the issues raised by Spalke because the board\u2019s action as to Clarke\u2019s Island cannot be the determinative factor. Obviously, there is no land access to Clarke\u2019s Island, whereas Spalke\u2019s site is accessible by land. While it is appealing and indeed logical to conclude, as did the trial judge, that access to the Saquish lots is superior to that of the island because of the former\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>connection, to the mainland, we do not see this as a material comparison. General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 12, is clear in its requirement that a building permit \"shall\u201d be withheld \"if the building or structure as constructed... would be in violation of any zoning ... by-law----\u201d We have nothing before us pertaining to Clarke\u2019s Island other than the bare fact of the issuance of a building permit. Further, there has been no showing that Clarke\u2019s Island was subject to the zoning by-law at the time the permit was granted. See <em>Marblehead </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>316 Mass. 124, 125-126 (1944) (\"[n]othing in the statute ... or in common sense requires a municipality to impose restrictions upon all of its territory as a condition of the exercise of its zoning powers\u201d); <em>Granby </em>v. <em>Landry, </em>341 Mass. 443, 445 (1960); <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>Quincy, </em>346 Mass. 22, 23-24 (1963). The only question before the trial judge was what the law required as to the lots in question on the basis of the facts presented. The Clarke\u2019s Island building permit is an irrelevancy, and we review the matter of Spalke\u2019s building permit application on its own footing.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Spalke\u2019s procedural argument that the board acted arbitrarily and unreasonably in not deciding his appeal within the sixty-day time period prescribed by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 18,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> cannot prevail. Spalke filed his appeal with the board on July 3, 1974, a public hearing was held on August 6, 1974, and a decision was filed with the town clerk on May 13,1975. Although Spalke argues that this delay is unreasonable, the sixty-day provision of \u00a7 18 has been consistently construed as a directory and not a mandatory provision of the statute. That is, the time provision was enacted for public convenience and not as a condition precedent to the validity of an official act. Noncompliance with that provision does not render an act by the board void. <em>Cullen </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of No. Attleborough, </em>353 Mass. 671, 679-680 (1968), citing <em>Cheney </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number><em>Coughlin, </em>201 Mass. 204, 211 (1909). See <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Wellesley, </em>356 Mass. 159, 162 (1969); <em>Crosby </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Weston, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 713, 713-714 (1975). Compare <em>Casasanta </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Milford, </em>377 Mass. 67 (1979). This section was subsequently replaced by the present G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 15,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which extends the period within which a decision must be made by the board to seventy-five days, and mandates that a failure to comply results in an automatic granting of the relief sought from the board. As noted in <em>Casasanta, </em>377 Mass. at 69 n.3, \"There have been suggestions in the cases that where delay was excessive and unjustified or prejudice could be shown \u00a7 18 might be read in a more drastic way,\u201d citing <em>Burwick </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Worcester, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 739, 745 (1974). However, the record before us gives no indication that the delay was unjustified or, more important, that Spalke \"ha[s] been prejudiced in any respect by the board\u2019s failure to comply with any of the provisions of \u00a7 18____\u201d <em>Burwick, supra </em>at 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Turning now to the substantive issues of the appeal, we note from the outset that we view this matter as one arising under The Zoning Enabling Act, G. L. c. 40A, and the Plymouth zoning by-law, \u00a7 300.05. At every level of these proceedings the parties have mixed the concepts of zoning regulation under c. 40A, with those of subdivision control under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 81K-81GG. The record clearly shows that Spalke applied for a building permit. The zoning by-law provides that such permits can be issued only for lots having \"the required frontage on and access to a street\u201d or, in the alternative, \"having adequate access to a public way approved by the Planning Board.\u201d The board found that under <em>both </em>the zoning by-law and \u00a7 81M of the Subdivision Control Law, the lots did not have the required frontage and access. Although both The Zoning Enabling Act and the Subdivision Control Law allow the regulation of building construction on the basis of front<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>age and access, see G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7\u00a7 3,12; G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81M, Spalke was, at this time, seeking only a building permit.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The sole issue raised by his request was whether the building would be in violation of \u00a7 300.05; that is, whether Landing Road or the Atlantic Ocean provide the lots with the characteristics necessary to satisfy \u00a7 300.05 and thereby entitle him to a building permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The first alternative available to Spalke under \u00a7 300.05 was to show that the lots had \"the required frontage on and access to a street.\u201d By this very phrase, if Landing Road was not a street then Spalke\u2019s arguments concerning frontage thereon and access thereto are irrelevant. We are unable on this record to hold that Landing Road, a roadway usable only by four-wheel drive vehicles, is a \"street.\u201d We have not been presented anything to show that the word \"street\u201d denotes something in the by-law other than its ordinary meaning, and we deem it to be employed in its usual sense. Compare <em>Gem Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Milton, </em>341 Mass. 99, 102 (1960). In the absence of such a showing to the contrary, cases have interpreted \"street\u201d to mean an accepted highway or town way. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>16 Pick. 442, 445 (1835). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boston Barre &amp; Gardner R.R., </em>135 Mass. 550, 551 (1883). <em>Siegemund </em>v. <em>Building Commr. of Boston, </em>259 Mass. 329, 333 (1927). The record offers no showing that Landing Road had been accepted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>by the town. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>12 Met. 231, 232 (1847); <em>Casagrande </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Harvard, </em>377 Mass. 703, 706 (1979); <em>W.D. Cowls, Inc. </em>v. <em>Woicekoski, ante </em>18, 19-20 (1979); <em>Fenn </em>v. <em>Middleborough, ante </em>80, 84-85 (1979). We do not attempt to define the word \"street\u201d in a land use control context; we hold only that this four-wheel drive roadway (at the end of a seven-mile peninsula) which is not shown to have been accepted by the municipality, is not a street. Compare <em>Jenckes </em>v. <em>Building Commr. of Brookline, </em>341 Mass. 162, 164-166 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Reaching the second alternative under \u00a7 300.05, whether the lots have \"adequate access to a public way approved by the Planning Board,\u201d we conclude that Spalke cannot prevail no matter how we view Landing Road. Spalke has not shown that Landing Road was ever accepted by Plymouth as a public way. In addition, the planning board specifically found that the road did not provide adequate access to the lots from a public way. See <em>Lucianelli </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>288 Mass. 535, 536 (1934); <em>Casagrande, supra </em>at 706; <em>W.D. Cowls, Inc., supra </em>at 19-20; <em>Fenn, supra </em>at 84-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Additionally, Spalke has expended great effort in arguing that the Atlantic Ocean is a public way for access purposes under the by-law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We reject this assertion. Cases have been brought to our attention concerning the ocean as a public way, but they are inapposite to the by-law in question because they deal with the use of navigable waters for commerce or pleasure. See e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charlestown, </em>1 Pick. 180, 182 (1822); <em>Charlestown </em>v. <em>County Commr. of Middlesex, </em>3 Met. 202, 203 (1841); <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>108 Mass. 436, 439-440 (1871). Even were we inclined to view the Atlantic Ocean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>as a public way for access purposes, we note, again, that the record offers no showing of planning board approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Having concluded that the lots do not comply with either of the alternatives under \u00a7 300.05, we reach Spalke\u2019s final contention, that the lots are exempt from the operation of the by-law under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 5A. This provision protects lots shown on an appropriately recorded plan from subsequently enacted zoning amendments which increase the necessary area, frontage, width, depth, or yard requirements. <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Nantucket, </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 467, 473-474 (1976). In holding that \u00a7 5A is of no assistance to Spalke, we need only note that it does not deal with access requirements. Therefore, even were it applicable as to frontage, Spalke would still not be entitled to a building permit because of insufficient access.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The judgment is reversed, and a new judgment is to enter declaring that the decision of the board was not in excess of its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">So <em>ordered.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b702-16\"> We note in passing that Spalke has described himself simply as the \"prospective owner\u201d of the land. If he had standing on this basis to request a building permit in the first instance, he qualifies as a \"person aggrieved\u201d by the board\u2019s decision under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 21, as in <em>effect </em>prior <em>to St. </em>1975, c. 808, \u00a7 3. Cf. <em>Kuklinska </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Wakefield, </em>357 Mass. 123, 129 (1970); <em>Waltham Motor Inn, Inc. </em>v. <em>La Cava, </em>3 Mass.

On the other hand, \u00a7 81FF, as appearing in St. 1953, c. 674, \u00a7 7, would exempt the lots if they were ones \"which had been sold and were held in ownership separate from that of the remainder of the subdivision when said law went into effect....\u201d The Subdivision Control Law became effective in Plymouth July 5, 1951. The lots are shown on a plan, dated 1914, which was recorded in the registry of deeds. On July 5, 1951, the lots were held by the same owner; in 1969, they were conveyed into separate ownership. Consequently, under \u00a7\u00a7 81L and 81FF, the lots are subject to the Subdivision Control Law.
