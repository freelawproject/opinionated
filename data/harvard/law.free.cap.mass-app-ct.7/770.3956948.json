Simultaneously with its petitions to the board, Tufts filed a petition for declaratory relief in the Land Court, pursuant to G. L. c. 240, \u00a7 14A, and G. L. c. 231A, \u00a7 1, seeking a determination of the validity and applicability to it of certain provisions of the Medford zoning ordinance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On March 29, 1978, the board held a hearing on Tufts\u2019 petitions, and the meeting, described as \"tumultuous,\u201d was attended by about five hundred residents who expressed their opposition to Tufts\u2019 petitions. The board granted the variance and special permit and filed its decision with the city clerk on May 5, 1978. On May 24,1978, the plaintiffs commenced this action seeking review of that decision in the Superior Court and on that same day served the city clerk in hand with a copy of the complaint and sent copies by certified mail to the board chairman and Tufts\u2019 president. A \"certificate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>service\u201d reciting these facts was attached to the complaint. Three weeks later, on June 14 and 16, the plaintiffs again served the chairman<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and president, respectively, this time by a deputy sheriff. On June 20 the plaintiffs sent copies of their complaint by certified mail to the three remaining board members. No affidavit of service as to those board members was filed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Tufts did not answer the complaint but instead filed a motion to dismiss, asserting (1) that the complaint recited the wrong jurisdictional basis for the action, (2) that the plaintiffs had neither timely served the board nor filed an affidavit of notice as required by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, as in effect prior to St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 32, and (3) that the plaintiffs would not be prejudiced by a dismissal because they could intervene in the action pending in the Land Court. The board had previously filed an answer, and neither then nor at any time thereafter did it raise any of the procedural defects asserted by Tufts. The judge allowed the motion to dismiss and entered a judgment for Tufts which was subsequently amended to include judgment for all the defendants.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Tufts\u2019 first point, that the plaintiffs erroneously cited G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81BB, as the jurisdictional basis of their action instead of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, is not decisive. While the former provision deals with appeals under the Subdivision Control Law, the substantive allegations of the complaint clearly and specifically establish that the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>peal was taken to annul the board\u2019s granting of the variances and permit and was a proper appeal under G. L. c. 40A. Unlike the cognate provisions of Fed.R.Civ.P. 8 (a) (1), our rule, Mass.R.Civ.P. 8 (a), 365 Mass. 749, (1974), does not require that a pleading recite the basis of the court\u2019s jurisdiction, although it is good practice to do so. The fact that the plaintiffs did purport to recite a basis for jurisdiction is of no consequence. This discrepancy is, at best, a minimal type of defect which never has been fatal to an action <em>(Springfield </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>349 Mass. 267, 270 [1965]; <em>Charbonnier </em>v. <em>Amico, </em>367 Mass. 146, 152-153 [1975]; <em>Gaillard </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Lexington, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 834 [1978]), and, if regarded as significant, which we doubt, it could have been cured by an amendment. Mass.R.Civ.P. 15 (a), 365 Mass. 761 (1974). See also <em>Evans Prod. Co. </em>v. <em>D.J. Dev. Corp., </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 306, 309 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The main issue raised by Tufts\u2019 motion was the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to comply with the service and affidavit provisions of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, in that they did not timely serve all the board members or file an affidavit of service. In reviewing the dismissal on the basis of such defects, we are guided by <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Carver, </em>369 Mass. 804 (1976), where it was held that not all errors in the procedures of such actions require dismissal, citing <em>Schulte </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>369 Mass. 74, 79-80 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">When the plaintiffs served the city clerk in hand with a copy of the complaint, they \"furnish[ed] \u2018constructive\u2019 notice to interested persons that the decision of the board of appeals ha[d] been challenged and [might] be overturned.\u201d <em>Pierce, supra </em>at 808. Cf. <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Lexington, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 441, 442-443 (1975) (failure to comply with this requirement was fatal to the appeal). Actual notice to all of the board members was given,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> although it was not timely. In such a situation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>\"the indicated course has been, at most, to leave the sanction to the discretion of the judge rather than mechanically to destroy the action.\u201d Pierce, <em>supra </em>at 809. The key issue in this regard is whether the defendants wereprejudic\u00e9d <em>(Pierce, supra </em>at 811-812 n.13), and in the absence of prejudice a dismissal of the complaint is not required. <em>Raia </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of No. Reading, </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 318, 321 (1976). <em>City Council of Waltham </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Waltham, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 773 (1977). <em>Mele </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Milford, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 779 (1977). Neither Tufts nor the board alleged or demonstrated prejudice arising out of the manner in which either had received notification.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For this reason the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to file the affidavit of notice is not fatal. <em>Shaughnessy </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Lexington, </em>357 Mass. 9, 14 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Although none of these procedural defects requires a dismissal as matter of law, Tufts argues that we should not upset the judgment because the judge did not abuse his discretion, citing <em>Curdo </em>v. <em>Russo, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 730 (1975). However, there the plaintiff sought to amend her complaint to name all the board members as defendants. In affirming the denial of the motion to amend, we pointed out that the record failed to disclose that <em>any </em>of the defendant board members had ever been given notice, timely or otherwise. The present record is silent as to the reasons for allowing the motion, but we note that, unlike <em>Curdo, </em>here all the board members actually received notice and one board member and Tufts received timely notice. Therefore, we infer from this record that the basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>of the dismissal could not have been the existence of the nonprejudicial defects; rather, it wjas Tufts\u2019 insistence that the plaintiffs could fully litigate-the identical issues raised in this action by intervening in the LancTCourt action previously commenced by Tufts. Such was not a proper basis for the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The action in the Land Court.was brought under G. L. c. 240, \u00a7. 14A, as amended through St. 1977, c. 829, \u00a7 14, and under G. L. c. 231A, \u00a7 1, for the purpose of determining whether Tufts\u2019 use of its land is exempt from the Medford zoning ordinance under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 3,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> as a use for an educational purpose. The sole issues raised by Tufts in the Land Court are the validity and the extent of the applicability of the zoning ordinance. See <em>Pitman </em>v. <em>Medford, </em>312 Mass. 618, 620-621 (1942); <em>Addison-Wesley Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Reading, </em>354 Mass. 181, 185 (1968); <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Braintree, </em>355 Mass. 651, 654 (1969). On the other hand, the plaintiffs asserted in their \u00a7 17 complaint that the board had acted arbitrarily and exceeded its authority by not holding separate hearings on the requests for the variances and the permit, that some of the board members were disqualified due to alleged conflicts of interest, and that the board had not made findings sufficient to support its decision. While the parties have argued the question whether the Land Court had jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, as in effect prior to St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 32, or under G. L. c. 240, \u00a7 14A, G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 l(j %), and G. L. c. 231A,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that question is of no relevance in determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>the correctness of the allowance of Tufts\u2019 motion. Even assuming the Land Court had jurisdiction over the issues raised by the plaintiffs, they cannot be deprived of their statutory right to seek review in the Superior Court by virtue of the existence of possible alternative remedies, cf. <em>Sisters of the Holy Cross </em>v. <em>Brookline, 347 </em>Mass. 486, 498-499 (1964), and the trial judge, in exercising his discretion, could not look to whether other unexercised remedies existed for the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Because (1) it was error to look to the Land Court action as a remedy for the plaintiffs, (2) \"[t]here is nothing in the record even faintly suggestive of any... prejudice\u201d to the defendants due to the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to comply with some aspects of \u00a7 17, <em>City Council of Waltham, supra, </em>and (3) \"it is highly unlikely on the facts that [the judge] would have dismissed in the exercise of discretion\u201d due to any such failure, <em>Pierce, supra </em>at 812, the judgment of the Superior Court is reversed and the complaint is to be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">So <em>ordered.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b789-10\"> Tufts maintains that as an educational institution its use of the land for educational purposes is exempt from zoning regulation. G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 3, as appearing in St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b790-7\"> The \"certificate of service\u201d and the sheriff's return on the summons indicate that the plaintiffs were of the mistaken belief, at that time, that service upon the chairman was sufficient service on the board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b790-8\"> The record appendix contains an affidavit of such service, but the docket entries do not indicate it was filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b790-9\"> Tuffs\u2019 motion relied on service defects as to the board; the board here argues the propriety of the dismissal. Because the judgment was amended to include all defendants and because of our decision in this case, we do not pass upon the propriety of the board\u2019s asserting on appeal that which it never raised in the Superior Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b791-7\"> One board member failed to sign for his certified letter containing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>the notice. We regard him as having actual notice. Cf. <em>Consent to Adoption of a Minor, </em>363 Mass. 537, 543 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b792-8\"> At oral argument Tufts brought to our attention the fact that a loan commitment for the construction of the dormitories was in danger without a speedy resolution of this controversy. There is nothing in the record before us to indicate that this point had been brought to the attention of the judge and thus it cannot have been the basis of a finding by him of prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b793-6\"> Because the only question before us is the propriety of the dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 17 action, it is unnecessary to determine whether \u00a7 2, as amended through St. 1959, c. 607, \u00a7 1, or its successor \u00a7 3, as appearing in St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 3, controls the exemption issue in the Land Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b793-7\"> Because we need not reach this jurisdictional issue, we point out only in passing that G. L. c. 231A, \u00a7 9, inserted by St. 1945, c. 582, \u00a7 1, is explicit on the point that \"[njothing in this chapter shall be held to affect the jurisdiction of the land court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b794-7\"> Massachusetts Rule of Civil Procedure 12 (b) (9), 365 Mass. 755 (1974), allows a dismissal on the ground of the \"pendency of a prior action in a court of the Commonwealth.\u201d However, that rule is not here applicable because at the time of the dismissal there was no action pending which raised these issues or involved the plaintiffs. They did not seek to intervene in the Land Court action until after their \u00a7 17 complaint had been dismissed with prejudice. Further, by the Superior Court action the plaintiffs were exercising their absolute right of review, and they were not attempting to subject Tufts to harassment by multiple lawsuits. Cf. <em>Stahler </em>v. <em>Sevinor, </em>324 Mass. 18, 23 (1949). Additionally, Tufts was not urging rule 12 (b) (9) as a basis for dismissal; rather, it was relying upon the pendency of the Land Court action, which it had commenced, to bolster its argument that the neighbors would not be prejudiced by a dismissal of the \u00a7 17 complaint on the basis of the service and notice defects.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
