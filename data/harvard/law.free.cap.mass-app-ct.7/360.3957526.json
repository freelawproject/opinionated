From this decision of the commission, the selectmen appealed to the Superior Court under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. The court correctly affirmed the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">1. While the open meeting law contained in G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23A-23C, \"manifests in | 23B a general policy that all meetings of a governmental body should be open to the public,\u201d <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Taunton, ante </em>226, 229 (1979), it is permissible to conduct collective bargaining in executive session. G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B. See <em>Ghiglione </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Southbridge, </em>376 Mass. 70, 73 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">2. This leaves the question whether declining to draw a shade on the sunshine law constitutes a refusal \"to bargain collectively in good faith with the exclusive representative as required in section six [of G. L. c. 150E].\u201d G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 10(a)(5), as amended by St. 1974, c. 589, \u00a7 2. In reviewing the action of an administrative agency we bear in mind our duty to \"give due weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, as amended by St. 1976, c. 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">Since the policy of the open meeting law is to conduct public business in the open, the selectmen suggest that going behind closed doors, even though permissible, derogates from the policy of the statute. Supporting a policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>of open covenants openly arrived at, the selectmen say, cannot be tantamount to an unfair labor practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Yet the very fact that an exception for collective bargaining appears in the statute evidences a legislative judgment that there is something to be said for closed door labor negotiations. Indeed, when it considered the question in the context <em>of </em>an open meeting statute that did not provide a collective bargaining exception, the New Hampshire Supreme Court observed that there was considerable support for the proposition that \u201cthe delicate mechanisms of collective bargaining would be thrown awry if viewed prematurely by the public.\u201d <em>Talbot </em>v. <em>Concord Union Sch. Dist., </em>114 N.H. 532, 535 (1974). The court in <em>Talbot </em>also noted the position of several State labor bqards that bargaining in public would tend to prolong negotiations and damage the procedure of compromise inherent in collective bargaining.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>See <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Braddock, </em>262 So. 2d 425 (Fla. 1972). The reason underlying this conclusion is that the presence of press and public induces rigidity and posturing by the negotiating teams and provokes in them anxiety that compromise will look like retreat. Commentators share this view. 1 Werne, Law and Practice of Public Employment Labor Relations \u00a7 15.3, at 266-267 (1974).
