They appeal under the provisions of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33 A-33G. At the trial, conducted prior to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, </em>376 Mass. 426 (1978), evidence of unfavorable results of a polygraph test of the defendant Foley and evidence of inconclusive results of a polygraph test of the defendant Baldwin was admitted as part of the Commonwealth\u2019s case in chief. Since the results of a polygraph examination may not be introduced during the Commonwealth\u2019s case in chief as substantive evidence of guilt, the judgments of the Superior Court must be reversed, the verdicts set aside, and a new trial ordered. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, </em>376 Mass. at 451-452. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>377 Mass. 674, 675, 677 (1979). There is no question that the unrestricted admission of the polygraph examinations was harmful.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">Since a new trial will be necessary, we consider the defendants\u2019 contentions which are likely to recur at a second trial. We will also discuss Baldwin\u2019s claim that his motion for a directed verdict should have been granted. The jury could have found the following facts. On July 3, 1976, at approximately 2:30 p.m., a station wagon driven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>by Baldwin pulled up in front of a tourist attraction and gift shop called the Boston Tea Party Ship. Foley and an unidentified companion jumped out of the wagon and entered the gift shop while Baldwin waited outside. Once in the shop, Foley\u2019s companion pulled out a large black pistol stating, \"This is a stickup.\u201d While his companion held the persons in the shop at gunpoint, Foley emptied the contents of three cash registers, one after the other, into a bag resembling a pillow case. Thereafter, the two men fled to Baldwin\u2019s waiting car and drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The defendants relied on an alibi. Both claimed that at the time of the robbery they had been at Katey\u2019s Lounge, and their alibi was supported by five additional witnesses. Each of the five testified that both defendants had been at Katey\u2019s Lounge during the entire afternoon of July 3, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">We now turn to the defendants\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">1. <em>Presentation of the polygraph testimony. </em>As Foley may choose to testify at a second trial, his polygraph test results will, in the trial judge\u2019s discretion, be admissible for the limited purposes and under the conditions set forth in <em>Vitello. </em>In no event will the results of Baldwin\u2019s examination be admissible against him. As his test results were inconclusive, they have no relevance for the sole purpose for which they can be admitted, that is, they can neither impeach nor corroborate Baldwin\u2019s credibility if he testifies at a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">The defendants argue that the trial judge permitted undue reliability to be attributed to the polygraph and its operator. This argument raises one of the major concerns of <em>Vitello, </em>namely, that the polygraph may appear to the jury to have an aura of \"mystic infallibility,\u201d and may \"usurp the jury\u2019s historic role of determining the credibility of witnesses ....\u201d 376 Mass. at 444, 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">The defendants\u2019 claim is based on a number of items relating to the polygraph testimony. The polygraph expert, Charles Zimmerman, was asked, \"How reliable is the polygraph?\u201d Although Zimmerman stated that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>had to rely on \u201ccompetent researchers at various colleges and their results,\u201d he was permitted, over the defendants\u2019 objection, to answer. He testified that \u201cthe degree of reliability and validity is in excess of eighty-five and as high as ninety-five point five percent.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ANR\">Zimmerman should not have been permitted to testify before the jury as to the statistical reliability of polygraph examinations. Such testimony raised serious questions of intruding into the province of the jury, is hearsay, and is of minimal probative value. Even if statistical evidence of the general reliability of the polygraph were valid, such evidence would not warrant a finding of reliability in a particular case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Sargent </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Accident Co., </em>307 Mass. 246, 250 (1940). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whynaught, </em>377 Mass. 14, 19-21 (1979). Here, the statistical studies and the reliability of the polygraph in general are still the subject of great controversy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, </em>365 Mass. 421, 425, 428-429 (1974). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, </em>376 Mass. at 441-442. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fatalo, </em>346 Mass. 266, 268-269 (1963). Moreover, it appears that the question of reliability may itself be unmeasurable. Reid &amp; Inbau, Truth and Deception 303-304 (2d ed. 1977) (hereinafter cited as Reid &amp; Inbau). For these reasons testimony of statistical reliability should not be presented to the jury and should be limited to preliminary hearings before the trial judge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, </em>365 Mass. at 429-430; <em>Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number><em>wealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, </em>376 Mass. at 433-434, 446-447; see also <em>Schaeffer </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>372 Mass. 171, 178 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The defendants also complain that Zimmerman was put on a par with scientific experts where, as yet, the polygrapher does not belong. See <em>Vitello, supra </em>at 442. For example, Zimmerman was permitted over objection to testify that the American Polygraph Association is \"patterned and styled after the American Bar Association and the American Medical Association,\u201d and the judge, in the course of advising the jury on the purpose of admitting expert testimony, characterized experts as people who have superior knowledge such as \"surgeons, architects, polygraph experts, engineers, ballistic experts, handwriting experts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">On retrial, the judge should impose some restraint on the usual puffery involved in qualifying an expert and some protective measures against treating the polygraph and its operators on a par with scientific achievements in more established fields. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>365 Mass. at 447 (Quirico, J., dissenting).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">2. <em>Severance. </em>Prior to trial, Baldwin filed a motion for severance of his trial, based on the effect which the admission of Foley\u2019s polygraph results would have on him if the two defendants were to be tried together. Similar questions were raised but not decided in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graziano, </em>371 Mass. 596, 599-600 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Baldwin contends that since both defendants are asserting a common alibi, the admission in evidence of Foley\u2019s polygraph result is so devastating that the jury will not be able to comply with limiting instructions by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>judge. See <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 135 (1968); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 673, 676 (1977). If Foley\u2019s polygraph examination does not support the \"candor\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of his answer to the question as to where he was on July 3, 1976, Baldwin\u2019s defense might be substantially undercut, even if the judge were to give limiting instructions. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>State, </em>527 P.2d 169, 175 (Okla. Crim. App. 1974) (overruled to the extent that <em>Jones </em>permitted introduction of polygraph evidence, <em>Fulton </em>v. <em>State, </em>541 P.2d 871, 872 [Okla. Crim. App. 1975]); Reid &amp; Inbau, 330. It is true that under the rule of <em>Vitello, </em>Foley\u2019s polygraph result may be introduced only if Foley takes the stand and is thus available for cross-examination. <em>California </em>v. <em>Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 164 (1970). <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>402 U.S. 622, 626-630 (1971). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nolin, </em>373 Mass. 45, 49-50 (1977). Nevertheless, Baldwin\u2019s ability to protect himself by cross-examination against this damaging testimony might be minimal. The most he could hope for on cross-examination would be an explanation of why Foley failed on the polygraph examination. Also, Baldwin cannot protect himself, as can Foley, by a decision not to testify. In <em>Vitello, </em>this protection was considered most important in reaching the decision that polygraph evidence could be used. 376 Mass. at 455. Baldwin\u2019s decision whether to testify may depend wholly on whether Foley\u2019s test results are admitted. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>377 Mass. at 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Here, where the impact of the unfavorable testimony looms so large, the trial judge should hold a pretrial hearing where these matters should be discussed. If it seems likely that the prosecutor will be able to introduce the polygraph evidence because Foley makes known his good faith intention to take the stand, the judge should carefully consider the instructions he intends to give to the jury as to the limited purpose of the polygraph testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>(see <em>Vitello, </em>376 Mass. at 456), and should also consider whether such instructions will be understandable and complied with by the jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. at 676. If not, the trial judge should feel impelled, as a matter of fairness to Baldwin, to give the prosecutor the option of trying the defendants separately or of waiving the use of Foley\u2019s test results. See ABA standards Relating to the Administration of Criminal Justice, Joinder &amp; Severance \u00a7 13-3-2(b) and (c) (Approved Draft 1978); Mass.R.Crim.P. 9(d), effective July 1, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">3. <em>Admission of Foley\u2019s gun and bullets. </em>The defendants also contend that it was error for the judge to admit in evidence a gun and bullets found in Foley\u2019s possession at the time of his arrest. We disagree. A gun found in a defendant\u2019s possession at the time of his arrest is admissible if it might have been used in the commission of the crime charged. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>352 Mass. 218, 229-230, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 916 (1967). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mendes, </em>361 Mass. 507, 514 (1972). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 545, 547 (1973). There was testimony that the gun used by Foley\u2019s companion was a large black automatic pistol which looked like a .45, and Foley admitted that the gun taken from him looked like a .45, though larger. The evidence was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">4. <em>Other claims of the defendants. </em>The defendants also complain that improper statements with respect to the credibility of witnesses were made by the prosecutor during his closing argument. This and other contentions of the defendants are not discussed as they are not likely to arise at a second trial. We assume the prosecutor will comply with S.J.C. Rule 3:22A, PF 13(b), promulgated by the Supreme Judicial Court on February 19, 1979, 377 Mass. 927.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">5. <em>Baldwin\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. </em>Baldwin\u2019s <em>contention </em>that his motion for a directed verdict should have been granted is without merit. There was evidence, when read in the light most favorable to the Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>wealth, from which the jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Baldwin was the driver of the getaway car and was part of a joint venture which resulted in the robbery at the Boston Tea Party Ship. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blow, </em>370 Mass. 401, 407-408 (1976). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>365 Mass. 1, 7-9 (1974). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallagher, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 661, 664 (1976). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sampson, ante </em>514, 518 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The judgments are reversed, the verdicts are set aside, and the cases are remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">So <em>ordered.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b627-13\"> This is confirmed by the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument where he stated, \"Now, I would be less than candid if I were to admit to you that this was not a close case but for one exception,... and that exception I submit to you was invited by Thomas Foley and Leonard Baldwin, and that one exception is Mr. Charles Zimmerman \u2014 the [polygraph] expert who testified.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b629-5\"> After the defendants\u2019 objections, the latter portion of the statement, namely, \"and as high as ninety-five point five percent,\u201d was struck, but the first part was permitted to stand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b629-6\"> As to the problems of assessing the integrity of the results in a particular case see <em>Vitello, </em>376 Mass. at 451.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b629-7\"> We note that part of the function of the polygraph examiner is to establish the infallibility of the process, at least in the eyes of the person being tested. See <em>Vitello, </em>376 Mass. at 434-435. See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>526 F.2d 161,168 (8th Cir. 1975), where the court pointed out that the polygrapher\u2019s assessment of the test\u2019s reliability will generally be well in excess of ninety per cent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b630-9\"> The defendants also contend that the polygraph expert should not have been permitted to testify to physiological responses such as \"inhalation-exhalation ratios.\u201d However, the chart recordings and the physiological sensors are an inherent part of the polygraph, and testimony concerning them is proper as a basis for the examiner\u2019s conclusion. We assume they are understood by a competent examiner. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, </em>376 Mass. at 437 n.9 &amp; 438 n.11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b631-6\"> Zimmerman was asked if he had an opinion \"as to the candor\u201d of a particular answer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
