We reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-13\">It was decided in <em>Bianco </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>371 Mass. 420, 422 (1976), that G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, as appearing in St. 1974, c. 565, empowers a Probate Court to make an equitable division of property upon a divorce. This court in <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 10,16-17 (1977) (hereinafter <em>Putnam I), </em>considered the findings necessary under \u00a7 34 to support such a division. In that case, the deficiencies in the judge\u2019s findings were explained at length, and the judgment, identical in all material respects to the one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>now before us, was reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the principles set out in the opinion. Specifically, this court noted that the Probate Court judge might have grounded the assignment of property either upon his findings as to the capital contributions of the parties towards the acquisition and maintenance of the marital house during their marriage or upon his findings as to the wife\u2019s conduct. <em>Id. </em>Each of these alternatives was held to be an improper foundation for an equitable division under \u00a7 34. As to the wife\u2019s conduct, \"we caution against the view that either alimony or a transfer of property may be justified purely on the basis of the blameworthy conduct of one of the spouses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15-16. With regard to the contributions of the parties, \"the contributions of the spouses to the house should not be considered in isolation from the total contributions of the spouses towards all marital expenditures, whether current or capital.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16-17. The judge\u2019s findings did not rise to the required level, set out at 17: \"An order for equitable division should normally encompass all substantial assets jointly owned and any separate property representing accretion during the marriage and should be based on a comprehensive analysis of all major elements of contribution by the spouses during the marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">On remand the parties declined to offer additional evidence and rested their cases, notwithstanding the fact that the judge called their attention to \u00a7 34 and that they had the benefit of the <em>Putnam I </em>explanation of the necessary evidentiary foundation for an assignment of property. The judge noted that he could not consider all the factors listed in \u00a7 34 because the parties had failed to bring forth evidence on some of the factors. In addition to his rulings made at the conclusion of the first hearing, the judge further ruled that he based the assignment of the marital home upon the parties\u2019 contributions to its acquisition and renovation <em>and </em>upon the wife\u2019s conduct. He thereby removed any speculation concerning the ra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>tionale of the apportionment. In <em>Bianco, supra </em>at 423, it was explicitly stated that \"the record must show beyond doubt that the judge considered all the factors set forth by the statute. Otherwise the objectives of the statute will not be satisfied.\u201d The record establishes that the judge was well aware of the \u00a7 34 factors and the need for their consideration. However, when parties decline to offer evidence on these factors, or some of them, and there is, therefore, nothing upon which findings can be made, obviously a trial judge cannot be required to consider all the factors. In these instances, consideration of the factors thereby omitted can properly be deemed waived.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The husband nevertheless argues that the evidence is sufficient to justify a division of the house under \u00a7 34. Such an assertion could be accepted only if we ignore the notion of \"contributions of the parties\u201d as described in <em>Putnam I, supra </em>at 17: \"The concept of property assignment or equitable division under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, must be read to apply in a broad sense to the value of all contributions of the respective spouses towards the marital enterprise; it contemplates something more than determining which spouse\u2019s money purchased a particular asset.\u201d A reading of the transcript shows that the testimony concentrates on two issues to the almost total exclusion of all others: (1) the improper relationship between the wife and a teenage neighbor, which commenced sometime in the same year the husband filed for divorce, and (2) the contributions to the acquisition and renovations of the house. The parties gave little attention, if any, to their respective contributions to the five-year \"marital enterprise\u201d at the first hearing and refused to offer additional evidence at the hearing after remand. There is no evidence of the noneconomic contributions of the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>to the marital enterprise and there is scant evidence of the economic contributions, other than as they pertain to the house.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the evidence before us does not provide a sufficient basis for the comprehensive analysis contemplated by <em>Bianco </em>and <em>Putnam I.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The result of such a failure of the evidence is the impossibility of an equitable division under \u00a7 34. \"An equitable division should not be ordered in a case where the evidence introduced by the parties does not warrant findings comprehensive of those factors. <em>Rothman </em>v. <em>Rothman, </em>65 N.J. 219, 232-233 (1974).\u201d <em>Putnam I, supra </em>at 17. Therefore, the judgment ordering the sale of the house and an appointment of the net proceeds cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The divorce itself, which has not been at issue, became final long ago, and all that remained was resolution of the ownership of the marital home.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \"[T]he operation of a divorce of the parties upon a tenancy by the entirety creates a tenancy in common.\u201d <em>Bernatavicius </em>v. <em>Bernatavicius, </em>259 Mass. 486, 490 (1927). Should the parties still seek any other division of their respective interests in the former marital home, they must now do so by means other than resort to \u00a7 34. See <em>Maze </em>v. <em>Mihalovich, ante </em>323, 326 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The judgment entered on June 30, 1977, is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b692-6\"> While a determination of waiver is not to be made lightly, it is proper when the record fully supports such a ruling. It is appropriate in this instance because of the lack of evidence in the trial court after remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b693-8\"> The parties testified that they pooled their earnings in a joint bank account from which household operating expenses were paid. Although the husband earned more than the wife when he was employed, the total respective earnings of each spouse during the period of the marriage are very similar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b693-9\"> We note that there was evidence on some of the factors of \u00a7 34 upon which findings unrelated to the contribution of the parties, economic or otherwise, could have been made. However, because this case comes before us on the sole issue of the equitable division of the parties\u2019 house we see no need to remand the matter for the purpose of making such findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b693-10\"> Neither party ever requested a stay of the judgment of divorce pending the appeal.
