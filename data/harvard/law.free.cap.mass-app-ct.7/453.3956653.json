These hours were curtailed from 2:00 a.m. to 12:00 midnight. From the board\u2019s orders the plaintiffs purported to appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 67, as amended through St. 1971, c. 477, \u00a7 4, to the Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission (commission), resting ju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>risdiction on the theory that a reduction in hours constitutes a modification of an alcoholic beverages license. The Superior Court correctly dismissed the action. A reduction in hours is not a modification of a license issued under G. L. c. 138. <em>Casa Loma, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm., </em>377 Mass. 231, 234 (1979). That case held that the hours of operation of a licensee from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. and from 11:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are a matter of local control, subject only to judicial review of a local licensing authority\u2019s failure to give a proper hearing. Thus, the plaintiffs\u2019 appeals to the commission were without statutory authority, there was no adjudicatory proceeding before the commission, and, therefore, the plaintiffs could not appeal from the commission\u2019s decision to the Superior Court under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, as they have attempted to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The plaintiffs have argued that in some circumstances, and in the circumstances of these cases (which were presented in the Superior Court in a single petition for review under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14), a reduction in hours is tantamount to a revocation of license. <em>Casa Loma </em>decided that the hours of operation of a liquor licensee are a local option question. It would defeat the statutory scheme, in which the court in <em>Casa Loma </em>discerned a legislative intention to permit unreviewable policy considerations to govern, to carve out a special class of \"de facto license revocations.\u201d Every licensee who suffered a cut in business hours would infallibly claim that in his case the wound was mortal. Nor do we perceive any reason why the considerations which guide a local licensing authority in the setting of permissible hours for business, notably the effect on the surrounding neighborhood, should give way to the economic considerations of a licensee.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b472-7\"><em> </em>This is the closing hour mandated by G.
