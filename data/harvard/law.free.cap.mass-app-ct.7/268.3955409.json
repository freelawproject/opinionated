L. c. 139, \u00a7 16A, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 12. The plaintiffs, twelve voters of the town of Danvers, appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-14\">The only question before us is whether the all-alcoholic license granted to the defendant under G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 12, was lawfully issued; if not, the plaintiffs can invoke the provisions of G. L. c. 139, \u00a7 16A, to abate, as a common nuisance, the sale of liquor at the defendant\u2019s restaurant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number><em>Jasper </em>v. <em>Michael A. Dolan, Inc., 355 </em>Mass. 17, 18 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The validity of the license depends on whether G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 16C, as amended through St. 1971, c. 586, \u00a7 2, is applicable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The relevant portion of that section reads: \"Premises ... located within a radius of five hundred feet of a church or school shall not be licensed for the sale of alcoholic beverages if the governing body of such church or school files written objection thereto____\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The facts as found by the trial judge are not in dispute. The defendant operates a restaurant in Danvers located within five hundred feet of the Maple Street Congregational Church (church). In June, 1976, with the written consent of the church, the defendant obtained a wines and malt beverages license. In January, 1977, the defendant applied for an all-alcoholic license, but this time the church objected. Despite the church\u2019s written objection, the board of selectmen (board) granted the license, and the Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission upheld the board\u2019s action, ruling that \"Chapter 138, section 16C is not applicable here.\u201d The trial judge agreed and construed the fifth paragraph of \u00a7 12<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as authorizing the board to accept the surrender of the wines and malt beverages license and to issue an all-alcoholic license since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>the premises were already \"licensed for the sale of alcoholic beverages\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 16C.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The plaintiffs argue that the all-alcoholic beverages license was a new license, that \u00a7 16C applies, and that the issuance of the license over the objection of the church was in excess of the board\u2019s statutory authority. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Section 16C must be read in connection with the other provisions of c. 138 relating to the granting of licenses and in.light of its history. Prior to 1954, the only provisions in c. 138 relating to the licensing of premises close to churches or schools were a general provision in \u00a7 12 permitting local licensing authorities to take into account the character of the neighborhood,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and a requirement in \u00a7 15A <em>(infra, </em>note 9) that notice of an application for an original license had to be mailed to abutters, and to schools, churches and hospitals within a radius of five hundred feet of the property where the license was intended to be exercised.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">As originally passed in 1954,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u00a7 16C contained a flat prohibition against the licensing of premises for the sale of alcoholic beverages within a certain distance of a school or a church. In 1968<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the prohibition was made inapplicable to a church assenting to the licensing, and, in 1970, by St. 1970, c. 192, \u00a7 1, the prohibition was made applicable only to a church filing a written objection. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Section 2 of the same act also amended \u00a7 15A to require that the notice sent to a church or school \"shall indicate the necessity of a written objection to prevent the issuance or transfer of such license under the provisions of section sixteen C.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Section 15A<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> relates to the procedures required to obtain original licenses, and \u00a7 16A relates to applications for renewal of licenses. The latter section was amended by St. 1970, c. 352, to provide that, if on renewal the application is not for \"the same type as the expiring license ..., it shall be treated as an application for a <em>new </em>license and all the procedures set forth under [\u00a7 15A] shall be applicable thereto\u201d (emphasis supplied). Since \u00a7 15A nowhere refers to applications for <em>new </em>licenses, but only to applications for <em>original </em>licenses (see n.9), we read the 1970 amendment of \u00a7 16A to mean that the \u00a7 15A procedures for \"original\u201d licenses shall be applicable. This analysis leads to the conclusion that if the defendant had, at the time of the expiration of his wines and malt beverages license, applied for an all-alcoholic license under \u00a7 16A, the board would have been required to \"treat\u201d the application as one for an original (\"new\u201d) license. The church would have had to receive notice under \u00a7 15A, and would have had the right to object under \u00a7 16C.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>The trial judge ruled that once the premises were licensed for alcoholic beverages, the defendant could surrender his wines and malt beverages license and obtain an all-alcoholic license under the fifth paragraph of \u00a7 12 (see note 4, supra) without \u00a7\u00a7 15A or 16C being applicable. If this procedure were to be permitted, a licensee by proper timing could structure his application under the fifth paragraph of \u00a7 12 instead of applying for a renewal under \u00a7 16A, and thus vitiate the requirement that an application not of the \"same type as the- expiring license\u201d be treated as an application for a new license subject to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 15A and 16C. Once having obtained the change under \u00a7 12, such a licensee could then, in November at the time for renewal, obtain a license under \u00a7 16A of the \"same type as the expiring license\u201d and never have to comply with \u00a7 15A. We do not construe the statute to permit such an anomalous result, and we do not believe that the fifth paragraph of \u00a7 12 was intended as an alternate means of obtaining a license without going through the requirements for either an original or a renewal license.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Our conclusion is buttressed by the difference between wines and malt beverages and hard liquors. An all-alcoholic license is distinct both in quality and in character from a wines and malt beverages license.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The House <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Report accompanying the bill which was a forerunner of G. L. c. 138 pointed out the \"great difference between the inherent harmfulness of different kinds of alcoholic beverages ... .\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Courts, too, have recognized the difference between wine and hard liquor, particularly in zoning contexts. Thus, an all-alcoholic license was not protected as a preexisting use where the former use was pursuant to a wines and malt beverages license. <em>Jasper </em>v. <em>Michael A. Dolan, Inc., </em>355 Mass. 17, 24 (1968). In <em>Salerni </em>v. <em>Scheuy, </em>140 Conn. 566, 571 (1954), cited in <em>Jasper </em>at 24, the court said: \"As a matter of common knowledge it is also true that ordinarily a restaurant with a full liquor permit is quite a different sort of enterprise from a restaurant which sells only beer. It is a more ambitious establishment, partaking to at least some degree of the characteristics of a night club, rather than a quiet family eating place.\u201d See also <em>Town Council of Los Gatos </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, </em>141 Cal. App. 2d 344, 349 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The purposes and effect of \u00a7\u00a7 15A, 16A and 16C would, in our view, be frustrated if consent to a wines and malt beverages license by an institution entitled to object under \u00a7 16C precluded later objection to an all-alcoholic license or, as the defendant\u2019s logic would require, to a tavern license. We do not construe the fifth paragraph of \u00a7 12 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>as eliminating the need to comply with these sections. We hold, therefore, that an applicant with an existing wines and malt beverages license who seeks an all-alcoholic license is subject to the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 15A and 16C, whatever be the timing of his application.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">In reaching this conclusion we are not unmindful of <em>Jasper </em>v. <em>Michael A. Dolan, Inc., </em>355 Mass. 17, 20-21 (1968), where the court construed a saving clause applicable to \u00a7 16C in a manner not fully consistent with our construction. However, we do not view <em>Jasper </em>as precluding the result reached here for a number of reasons, including: (1) the 1970 amendments of \u00a7\u00a7 15A, 16A and 16C show an integral connection among those sections; (2).at the time of <em>Jasper, </em>\u00a7 16C contained a flat prohibition against the granting of liquor licenses in close proximity to a church; and (3) the question before the court was not whether the issuance of a wines and malt beverages license foreclosed later objection to an application for an all-alcoholic license. It should also be noted that in that case the court, for other reasons, enjoined the selling of all alcoholic beverages as a nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b287-7\"> All statutory references in this opinion, except where otherwise stated, are to G.

Arno v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commn., </em>377 Mass. 83 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b287-9\"> Section 12 relates to licenses for beverages to be drunk on the premises and governs both wines and malt beverages licenses and all-alcoholic beverages licenses. The fifth paragraph of the section has not changed since its enactment by St. 1934, c. 385, \u00a7 3, and reads in part: \"The local licensing authorities may accept the surrender of a license issued under this section and may issue in place thereof to the same licensee any other form of license authorized under this section .... Different licenses issued as aforesaid for any portion of the same license year to the same licensee shall count as one license for the purposes of section seventeen.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b288-8\"> The second sentence of the ninth paragraph of \u00a7 12 reads: \"The licensing authorities may refuse to grant licenses under this section in certain geographical areas of their respective cities or towns, where the character of the neighborhood may warrant such refusal.\u201d The provision first appeared in the seventh paragraph of \u00a7 12, as originally enacted by St. 1933, c. 376, \u00a7 2, and has remained unchanged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b288-9\"> The requirement was inserted in \u00a7 15A in 1939 and was continued in all subsequent amendments of that section.

The second paragraph provides in part that: \"Every applicant for an original license under section twelve ... or for a transfer of such a license from one location to another, or an applicant for a change in the description of a licensed premises ...\u201d shall send a copy of the published notice to the abutters, and to schools, churches and hospitals if located within a radius of five hundred feet of the premises. \"The notice sent to such school, church or hospital shall indicate the necessity of a written objection to prevent the issuance or transfer of such license under the provisions of section sixteen C.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Statute 1971, c. 477, \u00a7 2, added the requirement that the notice to hospitals in the second paragraph of \u00a7 15A indicate the necessity of a written objection to prevent the issuance of a license under \u00a7 16C, although hospitals are not mentioned in \u00a7 16C and have no right to object under that section.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b289-8\"> Since \u00a7\u00a7 15A and 16C were both amended by St. 1970, c. 192, we read the sections together to mean that if notice to a church is re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>quired under \u00a7 15A, the church has the right to object under \u00a7 16C.

The fifth paragraph is set forth in note 4, <em>supra; </em>\u00a7 16A as inserted by St. 1934, c. 385, \u00a7 6, read in part as follows: \"The holder of a license ... who applies prior to December first in any licensing period for a license of the same class for the next succeeding licensing period shall be prima facie entitled thereto\u201d provided that enough licenses are issuable under \u00a7 17. \"Class\u201d was not defined.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b290-8\"> The fees are also different. Section 12 prescribes a minimum fee of $250 and a maximum of $2,500 for a restaurant for an all-alcoholic beverages license and a minimum of $100 and a maximum of $1,000 for a wines and malt beverages license.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b291-7\"> The House Report (1933 House Doc.

That sentence reads in part as follows: \"The provisions for the issue of licenses and permits hereunder imply no intention to create rights <em>generally for </em>persons to <em>engage or </em>continue in the transaction of the business authorized by the licenses or permits respectively, but are enacted with a view only to serve the public need and in such a manner as to protect the common <em>good----\u201d</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
