H.), J. <em>pro </em>tem.</author>\n<p id=\"ALB\">Plaintiff recovered judgment against defendants in this suit to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien. Defendants moved for a new trial, which was denied. Plaintiff filed a \u201csupplemental memorandum of costs\u201d for $15.50, covering items incidental to the hearing on the motion for new trial, including a <em>per diem </em>of $12.50 for the court reporter who had reported during the trial, $2 notary\u2019s fees and $1 service fees. Defendants moved to strike this cost bill \u201cupon the ground that there is no statutory authorization for costs upon a motion for a new trial and upon the further ground that it was not served and filed within the time allowed by law. \u2019 \u2019 The motion to strike was granted. Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">It is plaintiff\u2019s contention that since the court reporter was required to attend at the hearing of the motion if requested by plaintiff (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 660), and did so attend, it became a cost chargeable against defendants, and that the other items were similarly a proper part of the adequate presentation of plaintiff\u2019s views on that occasion. We find no support for this contention.  The allowance of costs is strictly statutory. <em>(Sepulveda </em>v. <em>Apablasa, </em>25 Cal. App. (2d) 381 [77 Pac. (2d) 526].) \u201cIt must ever be borne in mind that costs were not recoverable at common law. He who would claim costs must put his finger on a statute which awards the same. The measure of the statute is the measure of the right. \u2018In England it seems that statutes relating to costs were considered penal in their nature and were to be strictly construed and, with scarcely an exception, this is the rule generally adopted in this country where the question has been raised and considered by the courts. \u2019 (15 Corpus Juris, p. 24, sec. 9.) \u201d <em>(Sime </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>55 Cal. App. 157, 159 [202 Pac. 967].)</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>\u201cThe right to recover costs exists solely by virtue of statute <em>(Begbie </em>v. <em>Begbie, </em>128 Cal. 154 [49 L. R. A. 141, 60 Pac. 667]), and warrant for their recovery must be found in some statute. In the absence of statutory authorization, it cannot avail that under the circumstances of a particular case it appears to a court that a charge is, as matter of fact, fair and reasonable.\u201d <em>(Turner </em>v. <em>East Side Canal &amp; Irr. Co., </em>177 Cal. 570, 573 [171 Pac. 299].)</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">There is no statutory provision for costs on a motion for a new trial, and the trial court properly granted the motion to strike the supplemental cost bill on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Moore, P. J., and Wood, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied October 31, 1941, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied November 27, 1941.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
