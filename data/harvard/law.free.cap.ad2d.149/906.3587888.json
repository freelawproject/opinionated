Judgment unanimously modified on the law and as modified affirmed, in accordance with the following memorandum: Defendant pleaded guilty to five counts of an eight-count indictment arising from two incidents in which he was allegedly driving while intoxicated. With respect to one incident, he pleaded guilty to both statutory and common-law driving while intoxicated (Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a71192 [former (2), (3)]) and aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle in the first degree (Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 511 [3] [a]).. With respect to the other incident, he pleaded guilty to common-law driving while intoxicated and aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle in the first degree. He was sentenced to concurrent terms of incarceration of <em>IV3 </em>to 4 years on each count of driving while intoxicated and six months on each count of aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle. He also was fined $500 on each of the five counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">Defendant filed a supplemental <em>pro se </em>brief after his assigned counsel filed a <em>Crawford </em>brief. Defendant joins in counsel\u2019s motion to be relieved of the assignment, but he seeks appointment of new counsel. Defendant in his <em>pro se </em>brief contends, and the People concede, that the fines imposed for violation of Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 511 (3) (a) violate Penal Law \u00a7 80.15 <em>(see. People v Grader, </em>142 AD2d 997). We further find that imposition of fines for both statutory and common-law driving while intoxicated, arising from the same act, likewise violates Penal Law \u00a7 80.15. We therefore vacate the fines imposed under counts 1, 3 and 6 of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">We have examined the record, and we find no other nonfrivolous issue requiring the appointment of substitute counsel.
