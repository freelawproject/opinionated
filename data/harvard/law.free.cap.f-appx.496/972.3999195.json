On appeal, Cog-dell makes the following arguments: (1) the district court erred by denying his Rule 26 motion; (2) the court at his original sentencing failed to make requisite factual findings -with regard to his objection to paragraph 43 of the PSI and failed to append its written determinations to a copy of the PSI, pursuant to Fed. R.Crim.P. 32; (3) the court erred in determining that the crime in paragraph 43 was a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 and (4) he did not plead guilty to aggravated assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-23\">We review <em>de novo </em>legal questions concerning the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. <em>United States v. Spears, </em>443 F.3d 1358, 1361 (11th Cir.2006). We also review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s application of Rule 36. <em>United States v. Portillo, </em>363 F.3d 1161, 1164 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-24\">In this case, the district court did not err in denying Cogdell\u2019s Rule 36 motion or motion for reconsideration because there was no clerical error. Further, there were no controverted facts, and, therefore, the district court was not required to make findings or append a copy of such findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>to the PSI, pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 32. Moreover, any challenge to Cogdell\u2019s career-offender classification is an attempt to challenge the validity of the district court\u2019s sentencing guidelines calculation, and, thus, is an inappropriate use of Rule 36. <em>See Portillo, </em>363 F.3d at 1164-65. Furthermore, any potential error in paragraph 43 of the PSI with regard to Cogdell pleading <em>nolo contendere </em>to aggravated assault was invited because, in his objection to paragraph 43, he clearly asserted that he pled guilty to aggravated assault. <em>United States v. Silvestri, </em>409 F.3d 1311, 1327 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"AOv\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AIh3\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
