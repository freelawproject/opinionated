On appeal, Earnest argues that the court should have calculated his sentence reduction without regard to the statutory minimum sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. Relying on a recent Supreme Court decision and changes to the Guidelines occasioned by Amendment 759, he contends that the statutory minimum was waived when the court departed from that minimum based on his substantial assistance at the original sentencing hearing. Finding a lack of jurisdiction, we vacate the district court\u2019s order reducing Earnest\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court to reimpose Earnest\u2019s original sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-23\">In 2009, Earnest pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base, commonly known as \u201ccrack cocaine,\u201d in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. According to Earnest\u2019s original presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Earnest had a total offense level of 29, a criminal history category of III, and an applicable guideline range of 108 to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment. However, the statutory mandatory minimum for his of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>fense was 10 years\u2019 imprisonment, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii). Thus, his guideline range became 120 to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(c)(2). Before sentencing, the government filed a motion for a two-level downward departure based on his substantial assistance, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e). The government noted that \u00a7 3553(e) authorized such a departure below the applicable mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">At sentencing, the district court granted the government\u2019s substantial-assistance motion and applied a 2-level downward departure, lowering Earnest\u2019s total offense level to 27 and his resulting range to 87 to 108 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court sentenced Earnest to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment (below the mandatory minimum of 120 months) based on its consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">In 2011, a probation officer filed a memorandum that indicated that Earnest was eligible for a sentence reduction, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on retroactive application of Amendment 750. The probation officer, the government, and Earnest agreed that Amendment 750 authorized the district court to re-impose a departure for substantial assistance comparable in degree to the departure imposed at the first sentencing. They disagreed, however, on the starting point for the comparable departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">The probation officer and the government argued that, after application of Amendment 750, the mandatory minimum was the guideline sentence. Thus, it was the starting point for a comparable substantial-assistance reduction. Using the mandatory minimum as the starting point and applying their proposed calculations, they determined that Earnest\u2019s post-departure range was 78 to 97 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">In contrast, Earnest argued that the statutory minimum in his case was waived when the original sentencing court granted his motion for substantial assistance and, thus, that minimum could not be the starting point in his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding for a comparable two-level reduction for his substantial assistance. He argued that, when the statutory minimum was not considered in calculating his sentence reduction, his amended guideline range, with the comparable departure for substantial assistance, became 70 to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">The district court agreed with the probation officer and the government that the amended range, after the comparable departure, was 78 to 97 months. It then reduced Earnest\u2019s sentence from 87 months\u2019 imprisonment to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court rejected Earnest\u2019s argument that the statutory minimum had been waived when the court granted the government\u2019s substantial-assistance motion at the original sentencing hearing. Instead, it determined that any reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) had to begin with the lowest offense level in criminal history category III that included a 120-month statutory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusion about its jurisdiction under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070, 1074 (11th Cir.2010). The Supreme Court has held that subject-matter jurisdiction is the court\u2019s power to adjudicate a case and cannot be waived. <em>See United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 630, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1785, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002). Federal courts are obligated to inquire <em>sua sponte </em>into jurisdiction where it may be lacking. <em>Williams v. Chatman, </em>510 F.3d 1290, 1293 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">Generally, a district court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>imposed. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339 (11th Cir.2008). However, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) provides that a court may reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence where the defendant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a). Any reduction must be consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission and must be based on a retroactively applicable guideline amendment listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a) &amp; comment, (backg\u2019d). According to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, a sentence reduction is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) where it does not have the effect of lowering a defendant\u2019s \u201capplicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). Commentary further clarifies that the operation of another guideline or statutory provision, such as a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment, would not have the effect of lowering the applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">Under the Guidelines, where a statutory minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable Guideline sentencing range, the statutory minimum shall be the guideline sentence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(b). Where a statutory minimum sentence exceeds part, but not all, of the guideline range, the district court may impose a sentence at any point between the statutory minimum and upper end of the guideline range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(c)(2). A district court may downwardly depart from the Guidelines and impose a sentence below a statutory minimum in order to reflect a defendant\u2019s substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another offender upon the government\u2019s motion. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e). Where a defendant is subject to a statutory minimum sentence, the starting point for a downward departure at an original sentencing hearing for a defendant\u2019s substantial assistance is that minimum. <em>United States v. Head, </em>178 F.3d 1205, 1206-08 (11th Cir.1999) (discussing substantial-assistance departures in the context of an original sentencing hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">In <em>United States v. Williams, </em>we held that Amendment 706, which amended the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c) offense levels for crack cocaine offenses, did not apply to a defendant who was sentenced to a statutory minimum, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(b), because that minimum displaced his shorter sentence calculated pursuant to \u00a7 2D1.1(c). 549 F.3d at 1339-40. Williams had originally received a downward departure from the statutory minimum based on his substantial assistance. <em>Id. </em>at 1338-39. Nonetheless, we determined that the district court\u2019s initial point of departure for the substantial-assistance reduction was from the statutory minimum, and thus, Amendment 706\u2019s lowering of the crack offense levels had no effect on the court\u2019s point of departure upon which Williams\u2019s ultimate sentence was based. <em>Id. </em>at 1340. This finding was consistent with our earlier decision in <em>United States v. Pope, </em>58 F.3d 1567 (11th Cir.1995). <em>Id. </em>In <em>Pope, </em>the defendant was originally subject to a guideline range of 97 to 121 months\u2019 imprisonment and a statutory minimum sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. 58 F.3d at 1568. Based on the overlap in these figures, he had a guideline range of 120 to 121 months\u2019 imprisonment and received a downward departure to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment based on his substantial assistance. <em>Id. </em>at 1568-69 &amp; n. 1. Although a subsequent retroactive guideline amendment changed his offense level, the amendment did not affect the applicability of the statutory minimum. <em>Id. </em>at 1572. Thus, we determined that he was ineligible for a sentence reduction based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>on the amendment, regardless of the amendment\u2019s effect on the underlying offense level. <em>Id. </em>at 1569,1572.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Following <em>Williams, </em>we held that, where a defendant was sentenced on the basis of a statutory minimum, pursuant to \u00a7 5G1.1(b), a sentencing court lacked jurisdiction to consider a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction, even if a retroactive amendment would lower the defendant\u2019s otherwise applicable sentencing range. <em>Mills, </em>613 F.3d at 1078; <em>see United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2012) (providing that the holding in <em>Mills</em>\u2014that a sentencing court lacks jurisdiction to consider a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion where the defendant was sentenced on the basis of a statutory minimum \u2014 controlled).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, made retroactively applicable by Amendment 759, made permanent an amendment revising the crack cocaine quantity tables listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750, Reason for Amend.; U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 748, Reason for Amend.; U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 759 (adding parts A and C of Amendment 750 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c)). As a result of these amendments, \u00a7 2D1.1(c) now assigns a base offense level of 28 in cases involving at least 112 grams but less than 196 grams of crack cocaine. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amends. 748, 750; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(c)(6) (2011). Previously, \u00a7 2Dl.l(e) assigned a base offense level of 30 in cases involving at least 50 grams but less than 150 grams of crack cocaine. <em>See, e.g., </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(5) (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">Although the parties do not address this issue in their briefs, we are obligated to inquire into the district court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction <em>sua sponte. Williams, </em>510 F.3d at 1293. As we have previously stated, a district court lacks jurisdiction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence that is not based on a sentencing range that the Sentencing Commission has lowered, but is instead based on a statutory minimum. <em>Mills, </em>613 F.3d at 1078; <em>see United States v. Lawrence, </em>535 F.3d 631, 636, 638 (7th Cir.2008) (providing that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) confers subject-matter jurisdiction on a court and that the parties cannot waive a district court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction); see <em>also United States v. Dunn, </em>631 F.3d 1291, 1292 n. 1 (D.C.Cir. 2011) (noting that the government\u2019s failure to raise whether the defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction was proper did not relieve the Circuit of its obligation to assure that the district court had jurisdiction to reduce his sentence, pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2)). Amendment 750 does not affect Earnest\u2019s applicable 120-month statutory minimum, which was the district court\u2019s point of departure for the substantial-assistance departure at the original sentencing hearing. <em>See Head, </em>178 F.3d at 1208; <em>Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1340. Accordingly, so long as the statutory minimum was not waived by the substantial-assistance departure below that minimum, the district court lacked jurisdiction to reduce Earnest\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">Earnest raises several arguments for why the statutory minimum was waived on appeal. However, these arguments are without merit. In <em>Williams, </em>we held that an original substantial-assistance departure below a statutory minimum does not waive that minimum. <em>Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1341. Earnest argues that <em>Williams </em>is distinguishable from his case because his statutory minimum was based solely on drug quantity, rather than prior felony drug convictions. However, in <em>United States v. Mills, </em>we extended the holding of <em>Williams </em>to defendants, like Earnest, who were sentenced to statutory m\u00ednimums, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii), based on drug quantity, rather than prior felony drug convictions. <em>See Mills, </em>613 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>F.3d at 1078 (providing that the holding in <em>Williams </em>extends to defendants who were effectively sentenced under the statutory minimum of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii), notwithstanding their PSI\u2019s \u00a7 2D1.1 drug quantity calculations).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">Next, Earnest argues that <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), abrogates <em>Head </em>and <em>Williams, </em>which hold that a substantial-assistance departure below a statutory minimum sentence does not waive that minimum. In <em>Freeman, </em>the Supreme Court addressed the question of whether defendants who entered into Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreements, which include binding sentencing recommendations, were eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. <em>Freeman, </em>564 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2690, 2692. A plurality of the Court determined that such defendants were eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because a district court\u2019s decision to accept a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea was based on the Sentencing Guidelines, as it had to evaluate the recommended sentence in light of a defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range before accepting it. <em>Id. </em>at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2692-95 (plurality opinion). Justice Soto-mayor concurred in the judgment only and determined that a defendant was only eligible to seek \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief where the Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement expressly applied a guideline range and the Sentencing Commission later lowered that range.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2695, 2697-99 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-15\">In <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>we held that <em>Freeman </em>was not clearly on point to our decision in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), holding that a defendant was ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction based on Amendment 706 because he was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and thus, <em>Moore </em>remained binding precedent. <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1320-21 (11th Cir. 2012). Similarly, <em>Freeman </em>is not clearly on point to our decisions in <em>Head </em>and <em>Williams. Head, </em>178 F.3d at 1206-08; <em>Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1341. In deciding <em>Freeman, </em>neither the plurality nor Justice Sotomayor in her concurrence addressed substantial-assistance departures, much less addressed whether a court\u2019s downward departure from a statutory minimum based on a defendant\u2019s substantial assistance waived that minimum. <em>See generally Freeman, </em>564 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2685. Thus, <em>Head </em>and <em>Williams </em>remain binding precedent as <em>Freeman </em>did not address the issue presented in those cases. <em>See Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-17\">Earnest argues that he is eligible for a sentence reduction because retroactive application of Amendment 750 lowers his \u201cguideline range,\u201d which, after language was added to the commentary to \u00a7 1B1.10 by Amendment 759, corresponds to \u201cthe offense level and criminal history category determined pursuant to \u00a7 1Bl.1(a),\u201d as opposed to his \u201cguideline sentence,\u201d as calculated pursuant to \u00a7 5G1.1. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(A)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We reject Earnest\u2019s argument that his \u201capplicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>guideline range\u201d does not encompass any changes to that range made pursuant to \u00a7 5G1.1, as, even after Amendment 759, a court must still determine whether \u00a7 5G1.1 applies in determining a defendant\u2019s guideline range, pursuant to \u00a7 1Bl.1(a). <em>See Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1340-41 (rejecting Williams\u2019s argument that his \u201cguideline sentence\u201d calculated pursuant to \u00a7 5Gl.l(b), should be viewed as distinct from his \u201cguideline range\u201d because, where the statutory minimum exceeded the range for the entire offense level, the \u201cguideline sentence\u201d was the same as the \u201cguideline range\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Earnest next contends that his argument, that his statutory minimum was dispensed with by his substantial-assistance departure, is supported by the special treatment the Guidelines give to defendants who have received departures on the basis of substantial assistance. Specifically, he points to \u00a7 1B1.10\u2019s recently amended statement that a reduction to a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment to less than the minimum of the amended guideline range is only permitted for those defendants who receive substantial-assistance departures. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 759. However, we rejected this argument in <em>United States v. Glover. See Glover, </em>686 F.3d at 1207-08 (holding that the fact that a court may only reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment to less than the minimum of the amended guideline range where a defendant had received a substantial-assistance departure does not mean that a departure below a statutory minimum waived that minimum). Finally, despite Earnest\u2019s arguments to the contrary, he has not identified any ambiguity in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and \u00a7 1B1.10 as to whether a statutory minimum is waived by a substantial-assistance departure, such that the rule of lenity applies, as he argues. <em>See United States v. Svete, </em>556 F.3d 1157, 1169 (11th Cir.2009) <em>(en </em>banc) (explaining that the mere possibility of articulating a narrower construction does not by itself make the rule of lenity applicable).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the district court\u2019s order because it lacked jurisdiction to reduce Earnest\u2019s sentence and remand this case to the district court to reimpose Earnest\u2019s original sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b928-13\">. Generally, when a Supreme Court decision lacks a majority opinion, the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those justices who concurred in the judgment on the narrowest grounds. <em>Marks v. United States, </em>430 U.S. 188, 193, 97 S.Ct. 990, 993, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b928-14\">.
