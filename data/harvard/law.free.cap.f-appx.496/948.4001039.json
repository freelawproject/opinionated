The term of Sutton\u2019s sentence is 12 months below the applicable guideline sentence range of 108 to 135 months\u2019 confinement. Sutton contends that it is unreasonable because, among other things, the District Court gave too much weight to the content of his online chats, and failed to give enough weight to his diminished capacity. Relying on <em>United States v. Portman, </em>599 F.3d 633 (7th Cir.2010), he argues that, because his diminished capacity directly led to his offense, he was entitled to a 36- to 48-month downward variance from the guideline sentence range. We are not persuaded and accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-12\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41,128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We reverse only if \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-15\">The District Court did not abuse its discretion by imposing a sentence 12 months below the guideline range. The court properly considered the nature and circumstances of Sutton\u2019s offense, his personal characteristics, the available sentencing alternatives, and the sentencing goals of \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Sutton\u2019s offense was particularly serious because his actions bordered on production of child pornography. He engaged in numerous online conversations with children and parents of minor children, encouraging them to engage in bizarre sexual acts and send him nude photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-16\">The record reflects that the court sufficiently considered evidence regarding Sutton\u2019s mental capacity. When exercising its discretion in weighing this evidence, the court found that Sutton had \u201cissues\u201d and was not \u201coperating at full speed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b971-17\">Sutton cites <em>Portman </em>for the proposition that a court must address uncontested evidence of a defendant\u2019s diminished capacity and must make a finding of whether the defendant\u2019s diminished capacity contributed substantially to the offense. <em>Portman, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>599 F.3d at 637-38 (holding that the district court\u2019s alleged failure to make findings on the defendant\u2019s capacity was harmless because the defendant\u2019s capacity did not substantially contribute to the commission of his crime). But <em>Portman </em>does not require the court, as Sutton seems to argue, to impose a downward variance greater than 10% of the low end of the guideline range where the defendant\u2019s diminished capacity contributed to his offense. What the record shows here is that the District Court sufficiently considered evidence of Sutton\u2019s diminished capacity, as contemplated by <em>Portman </em>and \u00a7 3553(a)(1), in fashioning his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
