No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cThe review for substantive unreasonableness involves examining the totality of the circumstances, including an inquiry into whether the statutory factors in [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We do not apply \u201ca presumption of reasonableness\u201d to sentences -within the guideline range. <em>United States v. Phaknikone, </em>605 F.3d 1099, 1107 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 643, 178 L.Ed.2d 486 (2010). But we \u201cordinarily expect\u201d a within-guideline sentence to be reasonable, and will only remand for re-sentencing if the district court committed a \u201cclear error of judgment\u201d in weighing the section 3553(a) factors. <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-13\">Here, the district court correctly determined that Castanon-Chadnes\u2019s prior conviction in a Georgia court for statutory rape constituted a crime of violence. A defendant is subject to a 16-point increase in his offense level if he previously has been deported after being convicted of a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) (2011). \u201cStatutory rape\u201d is listed as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under section 2L1.2. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 1(B)(iii). Castanon-Chadnes argues that his prior conviction for statutory rape should not be considered a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because it did not involve the kind of physical force required to qualify as a crime of violence. Still, \u201c[i]t is well settled that a felony conviction for an enumerated offense qualifies as a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under \u00a7 2L1.2, whether or not the use of physical force is an element of the crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 1317, 1327 (11th Cir.2010); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 722 (Enumerated offenses \u201care always classified as \u2018crimes of violence,\u2019 regardless of whether the pri- or offense expressly has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-16\">Castanon-Chadnes also argues that his sentence was unreasonable be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>cause it was greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals of section 3553(a), thereby violating the so-called \u201cparsimony principle.\u201d We disagree. In the light of Castanon-Chadnes\u2019s prior conviction for statutory rape and his subsequent illegal reentry into the United States after a prior deportation, the district court could reasonably determine that nothing less than 46 months would suffice to deter him from committing future crimes and that a within-guideline sentence was necessary to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, and protect the public. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)-(C). Notably, the \u201cweight to be accorded any given [section] 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">In this ease, the district court\u2019s sentence of 46 months\u2019 imprisonment fell at the low-end of the guideline range of 46 to 57 months; and we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324. In addition, the 46-month sentence was well below the 20-year statutory maximum for Castanon-Chadnes\u2019s offense. <em>See United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir. 2005) (comparing, as one indication of reasonableness, the actual prison term imposed against the statutory maximum).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Finally, Castanon-Chadnes contends that this Court has affirmed downward variances in other cases dealing with less compelling defendants charged with more serious crimes. While that may be so, such cases do not imply that a downward variance was required in this particular case, as the district court had broad discretion to impose an individualized sentence that lay within \u201cthe range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324; <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1241 (11th Cir.2009) (stating that this Court\u2019s affirmance of lesser variances in other cases did not warrant a reversal of a greater variance in the instant case).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">In sum, the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the section 3553(a) factors warranted a within-guideline sentence of 46 months. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)-(2); <em>Clay, </em>483 F.3d at 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b36-10\">. Under section 3553(a), a sentencing court must impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to comply with the purposes of sentencing set forth in section 3553(a)(2), which include the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant's further crimes. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Other factors to be considered in imposing a sentence include the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the available sentences, the applicable guideline range, the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b36-18\">. Castanon-Chadnes\u2019s argument \u2014 that the district court erred by applying a 16-level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>enhancement to his offense level and a 2 point increase to his criminal history score based on his single prior statutory rape conviction \u2014 is without merit. We have repeatedly rejected this kind of \u201cdouble counting\u201d argument. <em>See e.g., United States v. Wyckoff, </em>918 F.2d 925, 927-28 (11th Cir. 1990) (noting that, the Sentencing Commission intended the results that flow from the implementation of their guidelines, and recognized that the offense level and the criminal history category represent two distinct ideas, each of which are to be evaluated and calculated separately).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
