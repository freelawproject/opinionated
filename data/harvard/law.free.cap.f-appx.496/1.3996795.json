The district court found that Foster was an armed career criminal under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4, based in part on two prior Florida convictions for resisting an officer with violence, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01, which the court deemed \u201cviolent felon[ies]\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). On appeal, Foster argues that the district court\u2019s finding and the Eleventh Circuit precedent on which it relied are erroneous. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-28\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s ruling that an offense is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>under the ACCA. <em>United States v. McGill, </em>618 F.3d 1278, 1274-75 (11th Cir.2010). We may affirm on any basis supported by the record, even if not relied on by the district court. <em>United States v. Al-Arian, </em>514 F.3d 1184, 1189 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">To determine whether an offense constitutes a \u201cviolent felony,\u201d we use a categorical approach, looking only at the fact of the defendant\u2019s conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense. <em>United States v. Llanos-Agostadero, </em>486 F.3d 1194, 1196-97 (11th Cir.2007). In so doing, we have applied the same analysis to both violent felony enhancements under the ACCA and career offender provisions in the sentencing guidelines, although the provisions differ slightly in their wording. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Lockley, </em>632 F.3d 1238, 1243 n. 5 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">Florida law makes it a felony to \u201cknowingly and willfully resist[ ], obstruct ], or oppose[ ] any officer ... in the lawful execution of any legal duty, by offering or doing violence to the person of such officer.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01. The ACCA defines a \u201cviolent felony\u201d as any felony that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-6\">(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; <em>or</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-7\">(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b24-8\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) (emphasis added). Thus, a crime is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d if it satisfies either the \u201celements clause,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i), or the \u201cresidual clause,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-9\">In <em>United States v. Romo-Villalobos, </em>674 F.3d 1246 (11th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 248, 184 L.Ed.2d 132 (2012), the precedent relied upon by the district court, we held that a violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01 constituted a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). There, \u201ccrime of violence\u201d was defined under the sentencing guidelines nearly identically with \u201cviolent felony\u201d under subsection (B)(i) of the ACCA (the elements clause), <em>i.e., </em>as an offense that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d <em>Romo-Villalobos, </em>674 F.3d at 1248-49; <em>compare </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i), <em>with </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.1(B)(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-12\">In addition, in <em>United States v. Nix, </em>628 F.3d 1341 (11th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 258, 181 L.Ed.2d 150 (2011), we reviewed the offense found in Fla. Stat. 843.01 under subsection (B)(ii) of the ACCA (the residual clause), and'determined that it constituted a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1342. We are bound to follow <em>Romo-Villalobos </em>and <em>Nix </em>unless and until they are overruled by this Court <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court. <em>United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008) (quotations omitted) (\u201cUnder the prior precedent rule, we are bound to follow a prior binding precedent \u2018unless and until it is overruled by this court en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-15\">In this case, the district court did not err in concluding that Foster\u2019s two prior Florida convictions for resisting an officer with violence constitute \u201cviolent felonies\u201d within the ACCA. First, <em>Romo-Villalobos </em>held that a violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01 constituted a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under an enhancement provision of the sentencing guidelines that contains nearly identical language to subsection (B)(i) of the ACCA. <em>Romo-Villalobos, </em>674 F.3d at 1248-49. Moreover, in <em>Nix, </em>we reviewed the offense and determined that it constituted a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under subsection (B)(ii) of the ACCA. <em>Nix, </em>628 F.3d at 1342. Accordingly, our prior precedent dictates that a violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01 constitutes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>violent felony under both the elements clause and the residual clause of the statute. We affirm Foster\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
