On appeal, Sairras argues that the Florida court\u2019s adjudication of his each of his claims was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-17\">First, Sairras argues that, under <em>State v. Warner, </em>762 So.2d 507 (Fla.2000), there was a presumption of judicial vindictiveness in his sentencing that constituted a reversible error, and his counsel was ineffective in failing to object on this basis. Second, Sairras argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file a motion to dismiss the charges against him on the basis that the state did not receive sworn testimony from a material witness before commencing the prosecution. Third, Sairras argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move to suppress unlawfully intercepted communications that were utilized at trial. Fourth, Sairras contends that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>agreeing with the trial court\u2019s answer given to the jury\u2019s request for a definition of \u201cdistribution.\u201d Fifth, Sairras argues that his appellate counsel was ineffective in failing to argue on appeal that the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments during closing argument rendered his trial fundamentally unfair. The specific comments are that (1) Sairras was \u201cpart of an underworld where drugs were bought and sold for a price,\u201d and should not be compared to \u201cregular law abiding citizens,\u201d (2) \u201c[w]hen the ecsta-cy deal doesn\u2019t work because the defendant says, oh, but I can probably get you cocaine. The defense of entrapment means that he has no predisposition in the world to be able to do it,\u201d (B) \u201cat no point in time did he say no, no, no,\u201d (4) \u201c[njormal law abiding citizens don\u2019t talk that way,\u201d and (5) \u201ccrimes conceived in hell are not witnessed by angels.\u201d Sixth, Sairras argues that during closing argument, his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for disclosing his incarcerated status to the jury. Finally, Sairras argues that the trial court erred by denying his renewed motion to dismiss and motion for judgment of acquittal, as the evidence established that he was entrapped as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">After reviewing the record, and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Sims v. Singletary, </em>155 F.3d 1297, 1304 (11th Cir.1998). A habeas petition based on ineffective assistance of counsel presents a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">A person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted habeas relief unless the state court\u2019s decision on the merits was (1) \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) ... based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). When a state court\u2019s application of governing federal law is challenged, the decision \u201cmust be shown to be not only erroneous, but objectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Yarborough v. Gentry, </em>540 U.S. 1, 5, 124 S.Ct. 1, 4, 157 L.Ed.2d 1 (2003). When reviewing a state court\u2019s decision applying federal law, a federal court must not determine the accuracy of the result, but rather, whether the result was unreasonable, which is \u201ca substantially higher threshold.\u201d <em>Schriro v. Landrigan, </em>550 U.S. 465, 473, 127 S.Ct. 1933, 1939, 167 L.Ed.2d 836 (2007). A state court\u2019s factual determinations are presumed correct unless rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">In <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), the Supreme Court set out a two-part inquiry for ineffective assistance of counsel claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-11\">First, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-12\">466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. A habeas petitioner claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must succeed on both prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>test. <em>Johnson v. Alabama, </em>256 F.3d 1156, 1176 (11th Cir. 2001). If the defendant makes an insuffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>cient showing on the prejudice prong, the court need not address the performance prong, and vice versa. Holladay v. Haley, 209 F.3d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"AZFE\">\"To establish deficient performance, a defendant must show that his counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness in light of prevailing professional norms at the time the representation took place.\" Cummings v. Secretary for Dept. of Corrections, 588 F.3d 1331, 1356 (11th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"In judging the reasonableness of counsel's performance, the issue is not what is possible or what is prudent or appropriate, but only what is constitutionally compelled [, and performance must fall].... outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance\" to be considered deficient. Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). \"The Federal Constitution imposes one general requirement: that counsel make objectively reasonable choices.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Reviewing courts employ a strong presumption that trial counsel's performance was reasonable and that counsel exercised reasonable professional judgment in making all significant decisions. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"Atf\">Prejudice is a \"reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional er~ rors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. A reasonable probability is one sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. Id. It is not enough for the defendant to show that the error had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding. Id. at 693, 104 S.Ct. at 2067. He must show that the result would have been different. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqud\">The standard of review is \"doubly deferential\" when a Strickland claim is evaluated under the \u00a7 2254(d)(1) standard. Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U.S. 111, 123, 129 S.Ct. 1411, 1420, 173 L.Ed.2d 251 (2009). \"The question is not whether a federal court believes the state court's determination under the Strickland standard was incorrect but whether that determination was unreasonable-a substantially higher threshold.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"A49\">Florida law does not proscribe Judicial participation in the plea bargaining process, but rather, sets certain limits on judicial involvement in order to \"minimize the potential coercive effect on the defendant, to retain the function of the judge as a neutral arbiter, and to preserve the public perception of the judge as an impartial dispenser of justice.\" Warner, 762 So.2d at 513 (internal quotation marks omitted). Where the trial judge participates in plea negotiations and then imposes a harsher sentence after the defendant is convicted in a jury trial, instead of applying a presumption of vindictiveness, Florida has adopted a totality of the circumstances test to determine whether there is a \"reasonable likelihood\" that the harsher sentence was imposed in retaliation for the defendant exercising his right to a jury trial. In evaluating the totality of the circumstances, the reviewing court considers: (1) whether the trial judge initiated the plea discussions in violation of Warner; (2) whether the trial judge appears to have departed from his role as an impartial arbiter, either by urging the defendant to accept a plea, or by implying or stating that the sentence imposed would hinge on future procedural choices; (3) the disparity between the plea offer and the sentence imposed; and (4) the lack of any facts on the record that explain the reason for the increased sentence. Wilson v. State, 845 So.2d 142, 156 (Fla.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"A3u\">Here, we conclude from the record that the Florida court's determination under the Strickland standard was not un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>reasonable. Although the court\u2019s initiation of the plea discussions is a factor, a totality of the circumstances analysis shows that there was not a reasonable likelihood that the harsher sentence was imposed in retaliation for Sairras\u2019s exercise of his right to a jury trial. Therefore, there was no judicial vindictiveness under Florida law, and, consequently, Sairras\u2019s counsel could not have been deficient in failing to object on this basis. Because counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient, we need not analyze prejudice under <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ASy\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"Aj7\">Florida Statute \u00a7 923.03(2) requires that any indictment or information contain a sworn oath of the state attorney certifying that \u201cthe allegations as set forth in the foregoing information are based upon facts that have been sworn to as true and which, if true, would constitute the offense therein charged.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 923.03(2) (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"AZo\">Again, we conclude from the record that the state court\u2019s adjudication of this claim was reasonable because Sairras did not meet his burden of showing that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. To establish that his counsel was ineffective in this regard, Sairras would have to show that the state did not receive sworn testimony from a material witness before commencing the prosecution, and that his counsel knew that the state had not received such testimony. However, there is no indication in the record that such testimony was not received, and Sairras does not assert that his trial counsel was aware of the alleged deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"Aoo\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"Asq\">For purposes of obtaining evidence of a criminal act, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 934.03(2)(c), authorizes a law enforcement officer to intercept a communication electronically when one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent. <em>State v. Welker, </em>536 So.2d 1017, 1020 (Fla.1988). Proof of consent for this purpose is governed by the traditional rules of evidence, and there is no requirement that consent be proven by the testimony of the consenting party. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AW3\">Sairras has failed to show that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient in failing to file a motion to suppress. Counsel filed a motion <em>in limine </em>seeking to prevent the state from mentioning, introducing, or inviting any hearsay statements made by the confidential informant (\u201cCl\u201d) and any testimony regarding any audiotapes of recorded conversations between the Cl and Sairras, and counsel objected to the disputed testimony at trial. Thus, while it would have been possible for Sair-ras\u2019s counsel to file a motion to suppress the evidence, counsel\u2019s choice to utilize a motion <em>in limine </em>to keep the disputed evidence from the jury was not objectively unreasonable. Further, Sairras cannot establish prejudice because he has not shown that the trial court would have granted a motion to suppress the recordings and any related testimony. It 1is clear from the testimony at trial that the confidential informant consented to the recording, which is sufficient to prove consent for purposes of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 934.03(2)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"Afg\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"AhuL\">Florida law gives courts discretion in responding to jury questions. Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.410 (upon request by the jurors, \u201cthe court may give them additional instructions\u201d). Further, Florida courts can define terms in the jury instructions by referring the jurors to the instructions previously given, or giving them a \u201cbrief, clear response.\u201d <em>See Perriman v. State, </em>731 So.2d 1243, 1247 (Fla.1999). The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>should not give instructions which are confusing or unclear. <em>Id. </em>at 1246-47.</p>\n<p id=\"AWB\">Here, we conclude that Sairras\u2019s counsel was not ineffective m failing to object to the trial court\u2019s answer to the jury\u2019s request for a definition of the word \u201cdistribution.\u201d The court\u2019s instruction for the jurors to use their experience and common sense to interpret the term was brief and clear, not confusing or misleading. Thus, because the trial court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s question was appropriate, Sairras\u2019s counsel could not have been deficient for failing to object to the response.</p>\n<p id=\"A07\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"A-v\">Claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel are governed by the same standards applied to claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel under <em>Strickland. See Heath v. Jones, </em>941 F.2d 1126, 1130 (11th Cir.1991). In assessing an appellate attorney\u2019s performance, we are mindful that \u201cthe Sixth Amendment does not require appellate advocates to raise every non-frivolous issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1130-31. Rather, an effective attorney will weed out weaker arguments, even though they may have merit. <em>See id. </em>at 1131. In order to establish prejudice, we must review the merits of the omitted claim. <em>See id. </em>at 1132. Counsel\u2019s performance will be deemed prejudicial if we find that \u201cthe neglected claim would have a reasonable probability of success on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where an issue is not preserved for appellate review, appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise the issue is not constitutionally deficient as it is based on the reasonable conclusion that the appellate court will not hear the issue on its merits. <em>Atkins v. Singletary, </em>965 F.2d 952, 957 (11th Cir. 1992); <em>see also Farina v. State, </em>937 So.2d 612, 629 (Fla.2006) (appellate counsel may not be deemed ineffective for failing to challenge an unpreserved issue on appeal unless it resulted in fundamental error).</p>\n<p id=\"A2hA\">Pursuant to Florida law, failing to raise a contemporaneous objection when improper closing argument comments are made waives any claim concerning such comments for appellate review. <em>Brooks v. State, </em>762 So.2d 879, 898 (Fla.2000). \u201cThe sole exception to the general rule is where the unobjected-to comments rise to the level of fundamental error, which has been defined as error that reaches down into the validity of the trial itself to the extent that a verdict of guilty could not have been obtained without the assistance of the alleged error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 898-99.</p>\n<p id=\"AWX\">The role of the attorney in closing arguments is to assist the jury in analyzing, evaluating, and applying the evidence. <em>Ruiz v. State, </em>743 So.2d 1, 4 (Fla.1999). \u201cComments on matters outside the evidence are clearly improper.\u201d <em>Pope v. Wainwright, </em>496 So.2d 798, 803 (Fla.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"AZo5\">The record demonstrates that all but one of the contested statements were comments on matters in evidence, and were, therefore, not improper. On the other hand, the comment\u2014\u201c[w]hen the ec-stacy deal doesn\u2019t work because the defendant says, oh, but I can probably get you cocaine. The defense of entrapment means that he has no predisposition in the world to be able to do it,\u201d\u2014was improper because it referred to testimony that had been specifically struck by the court and not admitted as evidence. However, the comment did not amount to fundamental error under Florida law. Accordingly, appellate counsel was not deficient in failing to raise this issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"A6e\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"Al7t\">Viewed in the context of the trial as a whole, t\u00edairras s counsel chose to reveal that Sairras was still incarcerated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>an attempt to appeal to the jury\u2019s sympathy, a choice which was not objectively unreasonable. Sairras has not pointed to any authority establishing that revealing his incarcerated status was constitutionally erroneous. Further, even if the comment was improper, Sairras has not established prejudice, because there is not a reasonable probability that this single, isolated comment changed the outcome of the proceeding. Accordingly, we conclude that the state court\u2019s application of <em>Strickland </em>to this issue was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">It is well-settled that the defense of entrapment is not of constitutional dimension. <em>United States v. Russell, </em>411 U.S. 423, 433, 93 S.Ct. 1637, 1643, 36 L.Ed.2d 366 (1973). However, the Supreme Court has recognized that there may arise \u201ca situation in which the conduct of law enforcement agents is so outrageous that due process principles\u201d would bar the prosecution. <em>Id. </em>at 431-32, 93 S.Ct. at 1643.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Here, there was no outrageous government conduct that would implicate Due Process. The Cl was supervised throughout the investigation, and an officer instructed the Cl prior to any meeting with Sairras. Thus, there is no indication that the Cl was allowed to operate in a manner that could be deemed outrageous. The Florida court\u2019s adjudication of this issue was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment denying habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
