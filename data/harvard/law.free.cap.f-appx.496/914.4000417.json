(\u201cSCSI\u201d). In his complaint, Lee alleged that Caterpillar caused SCSI to terminate Lee\u2019s employment when Caterpillar falsely reported to SCSI that Lee had been involved in an altercation at Caterpillar\u2019s assembly plant in Griffin, Georgia. The district court held that Lee\u2019s complaint alleged a single claim for defamation, which was time-barred, and there was no basis on which to toll the statute of limitations. The district court also rejected Lee\u2019s argument that his complaint actually comprised five separate causes of action, but nevertheless analyzed the elements of these claims and concluded that Lee had failed to state a claim as to any of them. On appeal, Lee argues that: (1) the district court erred in holding that no other claims besides a defamation claim were alleged in the complaint; (2) the district court erred in concluding that Lee\u2019s tortious-interference-with-employment claim failed to allege that Caterpillar was a stranger to Lee\u2019s employment relationship with SCSI; and (3) the district court erred in concluding that Lee\u2019s negligence claim failed to allege that Caterpillar owed any duty to him. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of judgment on the pleadings, applying the same legal standard as the trial court. <em>See Hart v. Hodges, </em>587 F.3d 1288, 1290 n. 1 (11th Cir.2009). Judgment on the pleadings under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c) is appropriate only \u201cwhen no issues of material fact exist, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on the substance of the pleadings and any judicially noticed facts.\u201d <em>Cunningham v. District Attorney\u2019s Office for Escambia County, </em>592 F.3d 1237, 1255 (11th Cir.2010). In considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the court should resolve all reasonable doubts about the facts in the favor of the non-movant, and draw all justifiable inferences in his or her favor. <em>See id. </em>Moreover, \u201cwhile notice pleading may not require that the pleader allege a \u2018specific fact\u2019 to cover every element or allege \u2018with precision\u2019 each element of a claim, it is still necessary that a complaint \u2018contain either direct or inferential allegations respecting all the material elements necessary to sustain a recovery under some viable legal theory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Financial Sec. Assur., Inc. v. Stephens, Inc., </em>500 F.3d 1276, 1282-83 (11th Cir. 2007) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">First, we find no merit in Lee\u2019s argument that the district court erred in granting judgment on the pleadings for his tortious-interference-with-employment claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To state a claim for tortious interference with employment under Georgia law, a plaintiff must allege: (1) the existence of an employment relationship; (2) interference by one who is a \u201cstranger\u201d to the relationship; and (3) resulting damage to the employment relationship. <em>See Hylton v. American Ass\u2019n, </em>214 Ga.App. 635, 448 S.E.2d 741, 744 (1994). In tortious interference cases, the term \u201cstranger\u201d has been interpreted broadly by Georgia courts. <em>See Britt Paulk Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Vandroff Ins. Agency, Inc., </em>952 F.Supp. 1575, 1584 (N.D.Ga.1996) (citing cases). \u201cOne is not a stranger to the contract just because one is not a party to the contract.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number><em>Mabra v. SF, Inc., </em>316 Ga.App. 62, 728 S.E.2d 737, 740 (2012) (quotation omitted). \u201cThose who have a direct economic interest in or would benefit from a contract with which they are alleged to have interfered (even though not intended third-party beneficiaries of the contract) are not strangers to the contract and cannot have tortiously interfered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, \u201call parties to an interwoven contractual arrangement are [not strangers and therefore] not liable for tortious interference with any of the contracts or business relationships.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">Here, Lee admits in his brief that Caterpillar contracts with various vendors and staffing services (including SCSI) for, among other things, inspection and auditing services for incoming parts and outgoing engine and generator assemblies. Through SCSI, Lee worked at a Caterpillar facility as an auditor to provide inspection services of engine assemblies prior to deliver to Caterpillar\u2019s customers. Lee\u2019s position arose out of the increasing number of complaints Caterpillar was receiving from its customers regarding the quality of Caterpillar\u2019s products. To address these concerns, an independent auditor position was created to assure Caterpillar\u2019s customers of the quality of products being manufactured by Caterpillar. Lee alleges that Caterpillar\u2019s actions that are the subject of this action are in retaliation for the number of negative citations that Lee made against Caterpillar during the course of performing his job as an auditor. Based on these allegations, it is clear that Caterpillar was not a stranger to the employment contract between Lee and SCSI. SCSI employed Lee to provide services to Caterpillar based on a contract between Caterpillar and SCSI, and Caterpillar therefore benefited from Lee\u2019s employment contract with SCSI. Lee\u2019s assertion that only Caterpillar\u2019s customers (and not Caterpillar itself) benefitted from the contract carries no weight \u2014 Caterpillar clearly benefits if its customers receive better products from Caterpillar.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">As for Lee\u2019s claim that Caterpillar \u201ccontracted\u201d away its right to argue that it is not a stranger, this argument was not raised below. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004) (noting that we have \u201crepeatedly held that an issue not raised in the district court and raised for the first time in an appeal will not be considered\u201d) (quotation omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In any event, Lee fails to explain how \u2014 even if this allegation were true \u2014 Caterpillar\u2019s agreement not to interfere with or wrongfully influence SCSI\u2019s employment decisions (included in its contract with SCSI) means that Caterpillar is a stranger as a matter of law for purposes of a tortious interference claim. He also cites no ease law in support of his argument. Nor does he cite any case law in support of the proposition that the \u201cstranger\u201d element is an affirmative defense, rather than an element he must prove. In short, Lee has failed to establish the elements of a tortious interference claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">We are also unpersuaded by his claim that the district court erred in granting judgment on the pleadings for his negligence claim. To state a claim for negligence, a plaintiff must allege: (1) a legal duty; (2) a breach of this duty; (3) an injury; and (4) a causal connection between the breach and the injury. <em>Rasnick </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number><em>v. Krishna Hospitality, Inc., </em>289 Ga. 565, 713 S.E.2d 835, 837 (2011). \u201cBefore negligence can be predicated upon a given act, some duty to the individual complaining must be sought and found, the observance of which duty would have averted or avoided the injury or damage.\u201d <em>City of Douglasville v. Queen, </em>270 Ga. 770, 514 S.E.2d 195, 197 (1999) (quotation omitted). Lee claims that he alleged the duty element by pleading that \u201cDefendant ha[d] a duty and obligation not to improperly interfere with or wrongfully influence the employment determinations of SCSI or otherwise improperly manipulate the auditing services provided by SCSI.\u201d However, while this allegation describes a purported duty to SCSI, it notably describes no duty to Lee himself. Lee failed to allege any other duty on which his negligence claim is based before the district court, and therefore has waived any argument on this issue. <em>Access Now, </em>385 F.3d at 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Nevertheless, Lee now claims for the first time on appeal that Caterpillar had a \u201cgeneral duty\u201d not to subject others to unreasonable risk of harm under Georgia law. <em>See Braun v. Soldier of Fortune Magazine, Inc., </em>968 F.2d 1110, 1114 (11th Cir.1992) (\u201cGeorgia courts recognize a general duty one owes to all the world not to subject them to an unreasonable risk of harm\u201d) (citing <em>Bradley Center, Inc. v. Wessner, </em>250 Ga. 199, 296 S.E.2d 693 (1982)). However, the Georgia Supreme Court has instructed that in these general negligence eases, \u201cthe common law and statutes regard conduct involving an unreasonable risk of harm as <em>antisocial conduct. </em>This is the essence of negligence law.\u201d <em>Ellington v. Tolar Const. Co., </em>237 Ga. 235, 227 S.E.2d 336, 339 (1976) (emphasis added). Lee cites nothing for the proposition that Caterpillar\u2019s statements to SCSI and Lee\u2019s termination amount to the \u201cunreasonable risk of harm\u201d envisioned by the \u201cgeneral duty\u201d standard in <em>Bradley Center </em>or <em>Ellington.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">Indeed, all of the cases cited by Lee involved some sort of serious act or omission resulting in physical injury or death\u2014 such as publishing an advertisement for a hired killer, obstructing a roadway with a company\u2019s trash container, or leaving a gun accessible to a prisoner on work detail, <em>see </em>Blue Br. at 17-18 \u2014 and Lee provides nothing of the sort in his case. At most, he says that Caterpillar selectively reported about an altercation involving Lee to SCSI, and failed to give Caterpillar exculpatory evidence. This allegation does not satisfy the duty standard of Georgia\u2019s negligence cause of action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b937-7\">. To begin with, we need not address whether Lee's complaint properly framed his claims because the district court never required him to provide a more definite statement and instead addressed the claims on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b938-5\">. Lee also complains that he had no opportunity before the district court to raise his waiver argument. However, Lee had more than enough opportunity to establish the \"stranger\u201d element of the tort, since it was Lee's burden, as the plaintiff, to somehow establish the elements of his claims in the complaint itself. <em>See Financial Sec. Assur., </em>500 F.3d at 1282-83.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b939-6\">. As for Lee\u2019s claim that negligence claims in Georgia are not susceptible to pretrial adjudication, Georgia courts have clearly held that under Georgia law, the existence of a legal duty presents a threshold question of law for the court. <em>First Federal Sav. Bank of Brunswick v. Fretthold, </em>195 Ga.App. 482, 394 S.E.2d 128, 131 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
