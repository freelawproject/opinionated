No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-26\">We review a district court\u2019s decision not to reduce a sentence pursuant to section 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number><em>States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir .2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">When the Guidelines range pursuant to which a prisoner has been sentenced is later lowered, a prisoner can move for a reduction in sentence in accordance with that modification. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Such a reduction must also be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A sentence reduction is not authorized under section 3582(c)(2) if the amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Amendment 750, which has been made retroactive, adjusted the base offense levels listed in the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c) to limit the sentencing disparity between powder cocaine and crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C., amend. 750; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Here, the district court properly denied O\u2019Neal\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction because Amendment 750 did not alter his guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). As the record shows, at his original sentencing hearing in 1998, the district court calculated a total offense level of 36 and a criminal-history category of III, resulting in a guideline range of 235 to 293 months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court ultimately sentenced O\u2019Neal to 293 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">After the Sentencing Commission promulgated Amendment 706, the district court did grant O\u2019Neal\u2019s first section 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduction in sentence in August 2010. Under the revised calculation then, O\u2019Neal\u2019s base offense level was reduced by 2 levels to 32, resulting in a total offense level of 34. Coupled with a criminal history category of III, his amended guideline range became 188 to 235 months; and the district court ultimately reduced O\u2019Neal\u2019s sentence to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-12\">Contrary to O\u2019Neal\u2019s argument, Amendment 750 did not further alter his guideline range. Under Amendment 750, the quantity of powder and crack cocaine that O\u2019Neal was held responsible for \u2014 342.024 grams of crack cocaine and 2 kilograms of powder cocaine \u2014 would be equivalent to 1,621 kilograms of marijuana, resulting in a base offense level of 32. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(4) (2011). When combined with the other guideline applications made at O\u2019Neal\u2019s original sentencing hearing, the total offense level remains at 34 and the applicable guideline range is unchanged at 188 to 235 months.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying O\u2019Neal\u2019s section 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction under Amendment 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-13\">O\u2019Neal also argues that, even assuming that his guideline range remains un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>changed after the application of Amendment 750, the district court should have sentenced him to the low-end of the applicable guideline range. His argument is premised on his erroneous belief that his original sentence was based on the low-end of the applicable guideline range. In fact, due to the amount of crack cocaine involved in the offense conduct and because O\u2019Neal had been a fugitive for over 4 years before his arrest, the district court originally imposed a sentence at the high-end of the then applicable guideline range: 235 to 293 months. More important, a section 3582(c)(2) proceeding does not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing, and \u201call original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (emphasis omitted). Because O\u2019Neal\u2019s guideline range was not lowered by Amendment 750, the district court was without authority to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b41-9\">. The presentence investigation report (\"PSI\u201d) noted that O\u2019Neal was accountable for a total of 342.024 grams of crack cocaine and 2 kilograms of powder cocaine, which was calculated at the time to be equivalent to 7,240 kilograms of marijuana and led to a base offense level of 34. Following a 2-level enhancement for possession of a firearm and a 2-level enhancement for his leadership role, the PSI calculated O\u2019Neal\u2019s total offense level to be 38. At sentencing, the district court awarded O\u2019Neal a 2-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility; and his total offense level was 36.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b41-14\">. O\u2019Neal's claim of ambiguity in the record appears to stem from the district court\u2019s order granting O'Neal\u2019s first section 3582(c)(2) motion in 2010. The court\u2019s order lists O'Neal\u2019s original offense level at 34 and his amended offense level \u2014 following the application of Amendment 706 \u2014 at 32. It is clear, however, that the court was referring to O\u2019Neal's base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), and not his total offense level. Following the application of Amendment 706, O\u2019Neal's total offense level went from 36 to 34 and his amended guideline range became 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
