(\u201cVeranda\u201d) and also the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to strike some of Veranda\u2019s pleadings. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-13\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b478-14\">Veranda filed this suit against Hooper in Texas state court for breach of contract after Hooper allegedly abandoned a multi-year commercial lease. Hooper removed the case to federal court on the basis of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382 diversity jurisdiction, claiming that as a New York domiciliary he was diverse from Veranda, a Texas domiciliary, and that the amount in controversy exceeded the jurisdictional minimum of $75,000. Veranda filed a motion to remand and for sanctions, alleging that Hooper was actually domiciled in Texas and that diversity jurisdiction was therefore improper. Hooper then moved to strike Veranda\u2019s pleadings on the grounds that they included immaterial information and that they were deficient with respect to a number of local rules governing typography, formatting, and electronic filing. The district court granted Veranda\u2019s motion to remand, denied sanctions on the ground that Veranda had not complied with the service requirement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, awarded Veranda costs and fees, and ordered Veranda to supplement the record so as to allow the amount awarded to be fixed. It also denied Hooper\u2019s motion to strike. After Veranda supplemented the record, the district court set the amount of costs and fees at $14,859.27. Hooper timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Hooper contends that the district court abused its discretion in awarding attorney fees and costs to Veranda because he had an objectively reasonable basis for removal. In the alternative, he argues that the district court abused its discretion in setting the amount of its award. Finally, he asserts that the district court abused its discretion in failing to grant his motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s section 1447(c) order for attorney fees under an abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Hornbuckle v. State Farm Lloyds, </em>385 F.3d 538, 541 (5th Cir.2004). A district court \u201cmay award attorney\u2019s fees when the removing party lacks an objectively reasonable basis for removal,\u201d and \u201cattorney\u2019s fees should be denied if an objectively reasonable basis exists.\u201d <em>Howard v. St. Germain, </em>599 F.3d 455, 457 (5th Cir.2010) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">For the purposes of diversity jurisdiction, a party\u2019s \u201ccitizenship has the same meaning as domicile. It imports permanent residence in a particular state with the intention of remaining.\u201d <em>Stine v. Moore, </em>213 F.2d 446, 448 (5th Cir.1954).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWr\">In determining a litigant\u2019s domicile, the court must address a variety of factors. No single factor is determinative. The court should look to all evidence shedding light on the litigant\u2019s intention to establish domicile. The factors may include the places where the litigant exercises civil and political rights, pays taxes, owns real and personal property, has driver\u2019s and other licenses, maintains bank accounts, belongs to clubs and churches, has places of business or employment, and maintains a home for his family.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-8\"><em>Coury v. Prot, </em>85 F.3d 244, 251 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">Hooper contends that he had an objectively reasonable basis for removing because he was domiciled in New York at the time of the suit. In support of his purported New York domicile, Hooper advances the facts that, despite residing in Texas with his family, he was registered to vote in New York, he owned property in New York, he maintained driver\u2019s and law licenses in New York, and he maintained an office in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">However, the district court considered these facts and nevertheless concluded that Hooper was domiciled in Texas at the time of the suit and that he therefore had no objectively reasonable basis for removal. In doing so, it noted the uncontrovert-ed facts that Hooper had purchased a home in Texas for his family in 2007 and that, in a lawsuit against the sellers of that home, Hooper\u2019s wife stated that she and Hooper had intended to live and raise their children there. The district court also described Hooper\u2019s long history of maintaining residences in Texas, carrying on business dealings in Texas, and being party to lawsuits in Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">Considering the record before the district court, and viewing Hooper\u2019s various factual arguments in light of our longstanding rule, as stated in <em>Prot, </em>that \u201c[n]o single factor is determinative,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 251, we see no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s determination that Hooper had no objectively reasonable basis for removal, and we therefore affirm the award of attorney fees and costs to Hooper.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-13\">Hooper also argues that, even if an award of fees and costs was appropriate, the district court abused its discretion in the amount of its award because Veranda claimed fees that were either unnecessary or irrelevant to its motion for remand. In particular, Hooper takes issue with claimed fees and costs for legal research and administrative tasks occurring before the notice of removal had been filed with the district court, claimed fees and costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>related to a motion for sanctions that the district court denied, and claimed fees and costs related to Veranda\u2019s investigation into Hooper\u2019s life as far back as the 1990\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">None of these arguments are availing. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) provides that \u201c[a]n order remanding the case may require payment of just costs and any actual expenses, including attorney fees, incurred as a result of the removal.\u201d Veranda\u2019s fees and costs related to the removal that were incurred prior to removal being docketed still were \u201cincurred as a result of the removal,\u201d as were Veranda\u2019s fees and costs related to the sanctions motion\u2014had Hooper not removed the case, none of these fees and costs would have been incurred. Furthermore, in light of the fact-intensive nature of the remand issue, and particularly in light of what the district court termed Hooper\u2019s \u201cefforts to conceal and mislead\u201d with respect to jurisdictional facts, the background investigation conducted by Veranda\u2019s counsel was highly relevant to its remand motion. In short, we see no abuse of discretion in the amount of the district court\u2019s fees and costs award.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Finally, Hooper contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to strike Veranda\u2019s pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f). In particular, Hooper argues that the district court misapplied the law in holding that the objected-to documents and allegations were related to the issue of the propriety of a remand. He asserts that, since motions to remand are considered purely on the basis of jurisdictional facts present at the time of removal, the extensive information about his life and dealings provided by Veranda in its pleadings were unrelated and should have been stricken. Furthermore, he alleges that the district court abused its discretion in not striking documents containing his Unredacted address and pictures of his minor children.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to strike for abuse of discretion only. <em>United States v. Coney, </em>689 F.3d 365, 379 (5th Cir.2012). \u201cThe motion to strike should be granted only when the pleading to be stricken has no possible relation to the controversy.\u201d <em>Augustus v. Bd. of Pub. Instruction, </em>306 F.2d 862, 868 (5th Cir.1962) (quoting <em>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. United States, </em>201 F.2d 819, 822 (6th Cir.1953)); <em>see Coney, </em>689 F.3d at 379. We agree with the district court that the pleadings that were the subject of Hooper\u2019s various motions to strike were in fact \u201cdirectly relevant [as] to the central issue of the removal.\u201d Although Hooper is correct that only his domicile at the time of removal is relevant to the remand issue, where he has lived, for how long, and in what capacity \u2014 all of which are spoken to by the pleadings in question \u2014 are undeniably relevant in assessing his proper domicile at the time of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Furthermore, we see no reason why inclusion of Hooper\u2019s unredacted address and a picture of one of his minor children in Veranda\u2019s pleadings or the purported failure of the pleadings to accord with certain formatting standards would necessitate the drastic remedial measure of striking those pleadings. We therefore decline to find an abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Hooper\u2019s motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b478-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
