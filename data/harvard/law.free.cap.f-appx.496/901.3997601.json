The district court determined that Riley was not entitled to a reduction of his sentence under Amendment 750 of the Sentencing Guidelines. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-20\">The district court did not err. Amendment 750 did not alter Riley\u2019s sentencing range. Riley was responsible for distributing 34.17 kilograms of crack cocaine and was ineligible for a sentence reduction. United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2Dl.l(e)(l). Riley argues that the district court should have considered the sentencing factors, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), but a district court applies the sentencing factors only when it has the authority to reduce a sentence and decides to grant a reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-21\">We AFFIRM the <em>sua sponte </em>decision of the district court to deny Riley a reduction of his sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
