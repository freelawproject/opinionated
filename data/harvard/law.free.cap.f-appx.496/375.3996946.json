After the City had moved for summary judgment and Leza had filed his response in opposition, he was informed by the magistrate judge that his attorney was ineligible to practice before the court because of his suspension in state court. In response, Leza retained new counsel. New counsel filed a motion to amend the scheduling order, seeking to re-open discovery for a period of 90 days so additional discovery could be taken and Leza\u2019s response to the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment could be supplemented. The district court denied Leza any additional discovery, finding that Leza had not shown good cause pursuant to Rule 16(b)(4) to modify the court\u2019s scheduling order and that his motion to re-open discovery was procedurally defective under Rule 56(d). Subsequently, the district court granted the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Leza appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to reopen discovery. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-16\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision regarding amendment of pretrial orders for an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under Rule 16(b)(4), \u201c[a] schedule may be modified only for good cause and with the judge\u2019s consent.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cThe good cause standard requires the \u2018party seeking relief to show that the deadlines cannot reasonably be met despite the diligence of the party needing the extension.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, courts consider four factors in determining whether to allow a scheduling modification for good cause under Rule 16(b): (1) the explanation for the failure to complete discovery on time, (2) the importance of the amendment, (8) the potential prejudice in allowing the amendment, and (4) the availability of a continuance to cure such prejudice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-17\">Similarly, this Court reviews the denial of a Rule 56(d) motion for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In reviewing the district court\u2019s ruling, we must bear in mind that the district court has \u201cbroad discretion to preserve the integrity and purpose of the pretrial order\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that district court judges have \u201cpower to control their dockets by refusing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>to give ineffective litigants a second chance to develop their case.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">We cannot conclude the district court abused its discretion in finding Leza had not shown good cause for amending the scheduling order pursuant to Rule 16(b). In his motion, Leza argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0J\">[P]laintiff requests an opportunity to take the deposition of Carlos Villarreal to determine his reasons for overruling the decision of the grievance panel that found Mr. Leza\u2019s termination unjustified and that he should be reinstated. Plaintiff also needs to determine what evidence was relied upon by the City to terminate Mr. Leza.... The entry of an amended scheduling order would go a long way toward making sure that the case is decided on the merits and plaintiff Robert Leza is not unfairly penalized for the actions or inactions of prior counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">In denying his motion, the district court reasoned that Leza failed to establish good cause because he \u201c[made] no effort to explain how the deposition testimony sought will have any bearing on the issues raised in the Defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Moreover, where, as here, the party seeking to re-open discovery fails to make any specific allegations to support his claim that the action or inaction of his previous attorney negatively impacted his case, such that good cause for an amendment would exist, we cannot conclude the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion. Although it is true that the court below sanctioned Leza\u2019s former counsel for failing to appear at a pre-trial scheduling conference, it is not at all clear how that sanction correlates with a failure to adequately conduct discovery, especially given the fact that Leza\u2019s former attorney conducted some discovery, including the taking of depositions. Moreover, former counsel\u2019s ineligibility to practice before the court below does not in and of itself constitute a showing of poor performance, given the fact that his bar suspension and ineligibility to practice were unrelated to his performance in Leza\u2019s case. In other words, Leza made no showing that his former attorney provided poor representation that negatively impacted his discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">In addition, Leza made no showing of diligence on his part. The interviews that Leza alleges show diligence occurred after the district court entered its order, making it illogical for us to conclude that the district court abused its discretion by failing to consider such interviews in its analysis of good cause. In short, Leza has made no showing that he was denied discovery or that his former counsel \u201cfumbled representation\u201d or \u201cnegatively impacted\u201d his case, such that good cause existed for the requested amendment, and thus we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in denying Leza\u2019s motion to reopen discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">Turning to the second basis for the district court\u2019s decision, the district court did not abuse its discretion by finding Leza\u2019s motion to re-open discovery was procedurally defective under Rule 56(d). In his motion, Leza requested additional discovery to supplement his response to the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Rule 56(d) requires a party requesting additional discovery as to facts essential to its opposition of a motion for summary judgment to present an affidavit or declaration. Leza does not dispute that requirement but instead argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>\u201cto require [him] to have verified this by affidavit or otherwise was redundant, inappropriate, and bureaucratic.\u201d Regardless of whether Leza personally believes the affidavit requirement contained in Rule 56(d) is \u201credundant,\u201d \u201cinappropriate,\u201d or \u201cbureaucratic,\u201d it is what Rule 56 requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">For the reasons set forth above, we cannot find the district court abused its discretion in denying Leza\u2019s motion to reopen discovery and thus we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b398-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
