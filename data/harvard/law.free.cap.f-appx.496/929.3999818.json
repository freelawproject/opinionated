Pool appeals the restitution portion of his total sentence. Pool pled guilty to: (1) conspiring to fraudulently obtain mortgage loans from banks, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349; (2) engaging in substantive bank fraud over the same period, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344; and (3) conspiring to launder the proceeds of his bank fraud scheme, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h). He was sentenced to a total of 57 months\u2019 imprisonment and ordered to pay $2,302,957.60 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-25\">Pool\u2019s offenses involved a total of six residential properties, two of which are relevant in this appeal: (1) 87 Grande Pointe Drive in Santa Rosa Beach, Florida; and (2) 1720 Morrill Street, Unit 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>Building # 1 in Sarasota, Florida. The Government, in support of its restitution estimate, presented documentary and testimonial evidence that a victim bank loaned Pool $1.2 million to finance the purchase of the Santa Rosa Beach property, foreclosed on that property in September 2010, and resold it in July 2011 for $845,000. The Government also presented evidence that a victim bank loaned Pool $239,270 to finance the purchase of the Sarasota property, foreclosed on that property in December 2009, and resold it in January 2010 for $27,001. Relying on the resale values as evidence of the victim banks\u2019 putative losses, the district court ordered Pool to make restitution of $855,000 with respect to the Santa Rosa Beach property, and $212,269 with respect to the Sarasota property.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">On appeal, Pool argues the district court erred in calculating his restitution liability on the Santa Rosa Beach and Sarasota properties. Noting the Government introduced no evidence concerning the fair market value of the properties on their foreclosure dates, Pool asserts the gaps between the foreclosure dates and the resale dates were too wide for any estimate of the fair market values to be reasonable, \u201cparticularly given the legendary and precipitous slide in Florida residential real estate values at that very point in time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">The district court\u2019s determination as to the specific amount of restitution is a factual finding reviewed for clear error, while questions of law relating to restitution are subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>United States v. Futrell, </em>209 F.3d 1286, 1288-89 (11th Cir.2000). The Government bears the burden to establish the restitution amount by a preponderance of the evidence. Id. at 1290; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">Under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act, the district court is required to order restitution \u201cto each victim in the full amount of each victim\u2019s losses.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(1)(A). This statutory mandate requires that a \u201crestitution award \u2018must be based on the amount of loss <em>actually </em>caused by the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Huff, </em>609 F.3d 1240, 1247 (11th Cir.2010) (emphasis in original). However, where difficulties arise in establishing the exact amount of restitution, a district court may accept a reasonable estimate of the loss based on the evidence presented. <em>Futrell, </em>209 F.3d at 1292.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">Here, the district court had adequate evidence upon which to base its restitution determinations. The Government submitted documentary and testimonial evidence to establish loss amounts for the value of the properties following foreclosure. The district court made a specific finding that the actual loss to the victim banks for restitution purposes was the difference between the amount Pool borrowed and the amount the banks were able to obtain upon reselling the properties. The district court did not err in relying on the resale prices. <em>See Huff, </em>609 F.3d at 1248 (holding that district courts, when making a reasonable determination of the restitution amount, should \u201cresolv[e] uncertainties with a view toward achieving fairness to the victim\u201d) (quotation omitted). Moreover, absent any evidence relating to the time frame of a housing market \u201ccrash\u201d in Santa Rosa Beach and Sarasota \u2014 much less how such a crash affected the values of the properties in question \u2014 the court would have been required to engage in impermissible speculation to credit Pool\u2019s restitution liability below the amount established by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
