The deficiency resulted from the Internal Revenue Commissioner\u2019s recharacterization of losses related to real estate rental activities from nonpassive activity losses to passive activity losses. Section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code limits the ability of taxpayers to deduct passive activity losses. I.R.C. \u00a7 469(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-11\">While rental activity is typically considered a passive activity, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 469(c)(2), it is not passive if the taxpayer is involved in \u201creal property business\u201d as defined by I.R.C. \u00a7 469(c)(7)(B). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 469(c)(7)(A). A taxpayer is deemed to be involved in \u201creal property business,\u201d if he \u201cper-formfed] more than 750 hours of services during the taxable year in real property trades or businesses in which [he] materially participates.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 469(e)(7)(B)(ii). Here, the Tax Court determined that the Harnetts \u201cfailed to establish that for any year at issue petitioner meets the 750 hour requirement.\u201d The court therefore \u201csustain[ed] [the Commissioner\u2019s] determination that the losses at issue are attributable to per se passive activities and are subject to the section 469 limitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b987-13\">The Harnetts make several challenges to the Tax Court\u2019s determination. First, they argue that the Tax Court erred in finding that Mr. Harnett was not in a real property trade or business as defined by I.R.C. \u00a7 469(c)(7)(B). Second, they argue that the Tax Court erred by not shifting the burden of proof to the Commissioner after the Harnetts made an initial showing that Mr. Harnett \u201cwas involved in a real estate trade or business.\u201d Third, they argue that the Tax Court committed reversible error by not admitting into evidence a \u201cNarrative Summary\u201d prepared by Mr. Harnett. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-15\">To begin, the Tax Court held that the Harnetts failed to prove that their rental real estate losses were nonpassive activity losses, and therefore deductible, because they did not prove Mr. Harnett \u201cperformed] more than 750 hours of services during [each] taxable year in real property trades or businesses in which [he] materially participated].\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 469(c)(7)(B)(ii). The Harnetts challenge this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-17\">In the Tax Court, the taxpayer \u201chas the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the Commissioner\u2019s determination is erroneous.\u201d <em>Estate of Whitt v. Comm\u2019r, </em>751 F.2d 1548, 1556 (11th Cir. 1985). \u201cWhen the Tax Court approves a deficiency determination, its findings of fact will not be set aside unless they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review the Tax Court\u2019s legal determinations <em>de novo. Bone v. Comm\u2019r, </em>324 F.3d 1289, 1293 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-3\">The Tax Court properly determined that the Harnetts had to prove that Mr. Harnett \u201cperformfed] more than 750 hours of service\u201d during each of the audit years \u201cin real property trades or businesses\u201d in which Mr. Harnett \u201cmaterially participat[ed]\u201d in order to claim the rental activity losses as nonpassive activity losses. I.R.C. \u00a7 469(c)(2), (7). This is an explicit requirement in the Internal Revenue Code and applies to all types of taxpayers, whether they are suspected of investing in a tax shelter or not. <em>See generally </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 469. A taxpayer must satisfy this requirement <em>in addition to </em>demonstrating that \u201cmore than, one-half of the personal services [he] performed in trades or businesses\u201d during the audit years was \u201cperformed in real property trades or businesses in which the taxpayer materially participate[d].\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 469(c)(7)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">As part of their challenge to the Tax Court\u2019s analysis of the 750-hour requirement, the Harnetts argue that the Tax Court misunderstood them when it determined that they had \u201cwaived any argument that [Mr. Harnett] materially participated\u201d with respect to the properties at Kim Brett Drive, Laurel Lane, Ocean Drive, and adjacent to Batts Neck Plantation and therefore did not count \u201cany hours that [Mr. Harnett] spent with respect to th[ese] properties] ... toward the 750-hour requirement.\u201d If this was an error, it was harmless. The hours claimed each year for the properties at Kim Brett Drive, Laurel Lane, and Batts Neck were minimal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Also, Mr. Harnett claimed that he worked substantially more hours on the condominiums at Ocean Drive, however the Tax Court explained that even if those hours did count towards the 750-hour requirement, the court was not convinced that Mr. Harnett had actually spent much time on those properties. Specifically, the court stated that the documents submitted \u201ccontained] no evidence that improvements were made to these units during the years at issue\u201d and called into question Mr. Harnett\u2019s claim that he \u201cspent very much time personally tending to the marketing and sale of these properties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AYI\">The Harnetts also argue that the Tax Court ignored some of the evidence they presented. But, much of the evidence the Harnetts claim that the Tax Court ignored was more relevant to the \u201cmore than one-half of ... personal services\u201d requirement than the 750-hour requirement. For example, the Harnetts argue that the Tax Court ignored Mr. Huffman\u2019s testimony that \u201cMr. Harnett spent only a day or two per month [working] at the bank, and the rest of the time on his personal real estate deals.\u201d This testimony would be very helpful for determining whether Mr. Harnett worked more at Washington Savings Bank or on the properties he owned. It is not particularly useful, however, for determining how many hours Mr. Harnett spent working on his properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">Other evidence that the Harnetts claim the Tax Court ignored demonstrated that Mr. Harnett spent some time working on these properties, but would not have necessarily proved that Mr. Harnett satisfied the 750-hour requirement. For example, one of the lawyers the Harnetts claim the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>Tax Court ignored testified that Mr. Har-nett spent, at most, 60-80 hours in one year working on legal issues related to one of the properties. As before, this testimony supports Mr. Harnett\u2019s assertion that he spent hours working with lawyers dealing with one of his properties, but it does not prove that Mr. Harnett reached the 750-hour threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">Ultimately, the Tax Court\u2019s determination rests on its decision that the primary evidence the Harnetts relied on to prove that Mr. Harnett met the 750-hour requirement, Mr. Harnetts testimony, was not convincing. The Tax Court had significant credibility concerns about the number of hours Mr. Harnett claimed to have spent on each property each year. \u201cIt was for the Tax Court to determine the credibility that was to be afforded the testimony of [Mr. Harnett] and the verity that was to be afforded his records.\u201d <em>Stein v. Comm\u2019r, </em>322 F.2d 78, 82 (5th Cir.1963).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such \u201c[credibility determinations are typically the province of the fact finder because the fact finder personally observes the testimony and is thus in a better position than a reviewing court to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">\u201cIf testimony ... stretch[es] the credulity of the Court it can decline to believe it if the taxpayer\u2019s credibility is already before the Court.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Comm\u2019r, </em>250 F.2d 242, 247-48 (11th Cir.1957). A taxpayer\u2019s credibility ean be before the court if, for example, parts of his testimony are not supported by the documentary evidence. <em>See id. </em>Portions of Mr. Harnett\u2019s testimony reconstructing the hours he spent participating in his real estate activities were contradicted or unsupported by the evidence. For example, the Tax Court discounted the hours claimed for Batts Neck Plantation because Mr. Harnett attributed those hours to \u201cpersonally ... renovating the barn\u201d and doing other work on the property, while contractors who worked on the property testified that they \u201cnever saw [Mr. Harnett] working on the property.\u201d Also, the Tax Court pointed out that Mr. Harnett \u201ctestified in 2005 he tore down a stone wall\u201d at one of his properties, while an invoice showed that \u201cthe wall was not repaired during the years at issue\u201d and, in any event, it was not Mr. Harnett who actually tore down the wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-11\">The Tax Court did not clearly err in determining that the Harnetts did not prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Mr. Harnett \u201cperform[ed] more than 750 hours of services\u201d during 2008, 2004, and 2005 \u201cin real property trades or businesses in which the taxpayer materially participate[d].\u201d <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 469(c)(7)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-14\">The Harnetts also argue that the Tax Court erred by not shifting the burden of proof to the Commissioner. Section 7491 of the Internal Revenue Code does allow the burden of proof on factual matters to shift from the taxpayer to the Commissioner. I.R.C. \u00a7 7491(a)(1). However, the burden may shift <em>only </em>if the \u201ctaxpayer introduces credible evidence with respect to any factual issue relevant to ascertaining the liability of the taxpayer;\u201d the taxpayer has complied with the substantiation and record maintenance requirements; and the taxpayer \u201chas cooperated with reasonable requests by the Secretary for witnesses, information, documents, meetings, and interviews.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>\u00a7 7491(a)(2). The Tax Court\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed for clear error. <em>Piggly Wiggly Southern, Inc. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>803 F.2d 1572, 1576 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">The Tax Court did not shift the burden to the Commissioner because it determined that the Harnetts \u201cfailed to present credible evidence sufficient to establish that [Mr. Harnett] meets the 750-hour requirement.\u201d Specifically, the Tax Court found that the evidence presented was not credible because it was \u201cvague, exaggerated, and unsupported or contradicted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">The Tax Court did not clearly err in making this determination. Evidence is not credible under I.R.C. \u00a7 7491(a)(2) if \u201cthe court is not convinced that it is worthy of belief.\u201d <em>Higbee v. Comm\u2019r, </em>116 T.C. 438, 442 (Tax.Ct.2001) (quotation marks omitted). In addition, \u201cthe court is not bound to accept testimony at face value even when it is incontroverted if it is improbable, unreasonable, or questionable.\u201d <em>Comm\u2019r v. Smith, </em>285 F.2d 91, 96 (5th Cir.1960). The Tax Court was not convinced that Mr. Harnett\u2019s testimony regarding the hours he worked on each property each audit year was worthy of belief, and viewed the testimony as questionable. Thus, it was permissible for the Tax Court to find that the Harnetts had not presented credible evidence regarding the 750-hour requirement and as a result, decline to shift the burden of proof to the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">The Harnetts next argue that the Tax Court erred by not admitting into evidence two separate documents: a narrative summary, marked as Exhibit 29-P, and a grid detailing the number of hours Mr. Harnett spent on each property each month, marked as Exhibit 22-P. We review the Tax Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>See Pollard v. Comm\u2019r, </em>786 F.2d 1063, 1067 (11th Cir.1986); <em>cf. United States v. Brown, </em>415 F.3d 1257, 1264-65 (11th Cir.2005). Even if an evidentiary ruling was an abuse of discretion, it will not result in reversal if the error was harmless. <em>See Pollard, </em>786 F.2d at 1067; <em>cf. United States v. Bradley, </em>644 F.3d 1213, 1270 (11th Cir.2011). \u201cAn [evidentia-ry] error is harmless unless there is a reasonable likelihood that [it] affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>Bradley, </em>644 F.3d at 1270 (alteration in original) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">Turning first to the narrative summary, the Harnetts\u2019 counsel specifically stated that they were not seeking to have that document put into evidence. We cannot say that the Tax Court abused its discretion by refusing to admit a document into evidence that was never offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-10\">The Harnetts attempted to enter the grid into evidence, but the Tax Court did not admit it because it did not \u201cprovide! ] any additional probative value.\u201d The only information a reader can learn from the grid, Exhibit 22-P, is the list of properties; an estimated number of hours Mr. Harnett worked on each property each day during the audit years; and estimated totals. Mr. Harnett came up with the estimates he put in the grid by looking through his records and \u201creconstructing] as best [he] could [his] participation in each property.\u201d He did this reconstruction in 2008 to help the IRS \u201cunderstand [his] enormous project.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b990-11\">Mr. Harnett was permitted to testify about how he came up with the number of hours listed in the grid and he was allowed to use the grid to refresh his recollection and answer how many \u201chours that [he] ... had reconstructed for the work that [he] did on [a] particular property.\u201d For each property, Mr. Harnett testified to the total estimated hours he spent working on the property for each of the audit years.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>Being that the numbers on the grid only represented Mr. Harnett\u2019s reconstruction of the hours he worked and that he was allowed to rely on the grid to testify about the information it contained, the Tax Court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to admit the grid into evidence. <em>See United States v. Wood, </em>943 F.2d 1048, 1053 (9th Cir.1991) (explaining that \u201ccharts or summaries of testimony or documents already admitted into evidence are merely pedagogical devices\u201d that \u201cshould be used only as a testimonial aid, and should not be admitted into evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">For these reasons we affirm the judgments of the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b988-5\">. Mr. Harnett claimed 38.5 hours, 5.5 hours, and 1 hour of work at Kim Brett Drive for years 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively.
