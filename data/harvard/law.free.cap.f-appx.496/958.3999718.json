On appeal, Dennis argues that the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>should not have invoked <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 481-82, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 2369-70, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), to bar his claims for relief. He asserts that <em>Heck </em>does not apply because he challenged Schwarzauer\u2019s denial of his constitutional right of access to the courts, not the validity of his conviction. Dennis claims that Schwarzauer violated his right of access to the courts when she mistakenly sent the wrong inmate\u2019s DNA to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals and failed to properly attach an amendment Dennis filed with a petition for post conviction relief that was ultimately dismissed by the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">We review the grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Robinson v. Tyson Foods, Inc., </em>595 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir.2010). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, presents no genuine issue of material fact and compels judgment as a matter of law in favor of the moving party.\u201d <em>Holloman v. Mail-Well Corp., </em>443 F.3d 832, 836-37 (11th Cir.2006). We may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on any ground supported by the record. <em>Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., </em>257 F.3d 1249, 1256 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">State prisoners must use habeas corpus, not 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, when seeking to invalidate their convictions. <em>Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 78-82, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 1245-48, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005). This bar to challenges under \u00a7 1983 to the fact or duration of confinement was first articulated by <em>Heck, </em>which held that a \u00a7 1983 action will not lie where \u201cestablishing the basis for the damages claim necessarily demonstrates the invalidity of the conviction.\u201d 512 U.S. at 481-82, 114 S.Ct. at 2369-70. The Supreme Court has stressed the importance of the term \u201cnecessarily,\u201d noting that even where the relief sought may ultimately prove exculpatory, the \u201cnecessarily\u201d standard is not satisfied if the outcome is \u201chardly inevitable.\u201d <em>Skinner v. Switzer, </em>562 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 1289, 1298-99, 179 L.Ed.2d 233 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-11\">Access to the courts is a right grounded in several constitutional amendments, including the First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. <em>Chappell v. Rich, </em>340 F.3d 1279, 1282 (11th Cir.2003). To assert an access-to-the-courts claim, the plaintiff must possess a non-frivolous, arguable underlying cause of action, the presentation of which was prevented by the defendant. <em>See Barbour v. Haley, </em>471 F.3d 1222, 1226 (11th Cir.2006). Indeed, the plaintiff must describe the underlying cause of action specifically enough in the complaint to show it is more than hope. <em>Cunningham v. Dist. Attorney\u2019s Office, </em>592 F.3d 1237, 1271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-12\">Here, we conclude from the record that the district court correctly found that Dennis\u2019s claim that Schwarzauer sent the wrong inmate\u2019s DNA to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals was invalid under <em>Heck. </em>His complaint did not argue that his constitutional right of access to the courts was infringed by the DNA error but that the error caused him to be \u201cconvicted under someone elses (sic) name.\u201d As such, Dennis\u2019s DNA-related \u00a7 1983 claim attacked his conviction\u2019s validity and should have been brought as a habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-13\">The district court also properly dismissed Dennis\u2019s claim regarding the misfiled amendment. Dennis did not describe the amendment in the complaint specifically enough to prove the amendment had merit. In the absence of proof that the underlying amendment itself was arguable and non-frivolous, his access-to-the-courts claim was correctly dismissed. According<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>ly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
