Martin P.

Based upon a report of a Minimum Wage Board convened in 1957 by the Industrial Commissioner pursuant to section 654 of the Labor Law, the Commissioner promulgated Minimum Wage Order No. 6-d for the hotel industry. This order was framed to include within the definition of \u201chotel industry\u201d all hotels, lodging houses, boarding houses and certain other accommodations not material here. The petitioners who operate a type of lodging house for men in New York City known as \u201c Flop Houses \u201d instituted on January 14, 1958 before the Board of Standards and Appeals a proceeding to review the validity and reasonableness of Order No. 6-d in pursuance of section 110 of the Labor Law which, as it then read, provided that this board could \u201crevoke or amend\u201d an order of this character if it \u201cfinds\u201d that it is \u201cinvalid or unreasonable\u201d (subd. 4). The section (subd. 3) authorized the board to conduct a hearing. A hearing was held upon the petition; proof was taken on the character of the petitioners\u2019 operations; and the Board of Standards and Appeals revoked Order 6-d on the ground that it was \u201c unreasonable and invalid\u201d to classify \u201cBowery Flop Houses\u201d operated by petitioners as hotels or as part of the hotel industry. Findings of fact were made as to the nature of flop houses and a rational conclusion was developed in the board\u2019s decision as to why they should not be treated for minimum wage purposes as hotels. Among other things the board was of opinion that one of the main policy reasons then existing for minimum wage orders was to protect women and children in industry; and there was a factual finding that \u201cNo women and minors are employed in \u2018Flop Houses\u2019\u201d. The Commissioner has appealed from the decision thus delimiting the scope of Order 6-d. The petitioners-respondents previously moved to dismiss the appeal to this court on the ground it was not timely and the motion was denied (8 A D 2d 987) with leave to renew on the argument but we now deny the motion and reach the issue on the merits. Our review, however, of the determination of the Board of Standards and Appeals is to be viewed against the background of the board\u2019s power to review the order of the Commissioner. The board may \u201crevoke or amend\u201d such an order if it finds it is \u201cinvalid or unreasonable\u201d (\u00a7 110, subd. 4). This court may review such an order \u201c on any question of law \u201d (\u00a7 662). Whether an order is \u201c invalid \u201d may well involve a question of law; but whether it is \u201cunreasonable\u201d is quite another matter and involves, in this special context, embracing a power to amend, an evaluation of applicability; and hence a matter of administrative judgment. This is especially the ease in view of the board\u2019s right to take new proof \u201c to determine\u201d the \u201cissues raised\u201d before it (subd. 3). In the ease before us the additional proof pointed up special problems in petitioners\u2019 operation not developed in the record when Order 6-d was promulgated. We reach the conclusion that the board had the power on this record to determine that Order No. 6-d should not be applied to flop houses and that its application to them was unreasonable and should be amended accordingly by excluding petitioners\u2019 operations from its scope. Whether such an amendment was desirable; or whether these petitioners ought, as a matter of administrative judgment, to have been excluded from the minimum wage order, are matters within the competence of the board, and no error of law of which we should take cognizance has been demonstrated by the Commissioner. Motion to dismiss appeal denied; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>determination affirmed, without costs. Bergan, P.
