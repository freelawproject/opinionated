Two Border Patrol agents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>on roving patrol, Henderson and Gilbert, were parked on the side of the highway observing traffic. That particular stretch of Interstate 8 was known by the agents to be an area with a high incidence of transportation of \u201cillegal\u201d aliens. When Bugarin\u2019s car passed by them, the agents noted that Bugarin appeared to be of Mexican descent, that he was apparently alone in the car, and that the car was \u201criding low\u201d in the rear. Agent Gilbert was aware that a station wagon of that model had a compartment in the rear into which the back seats could be folded, and that aliens had been found hidden in such compartments. Their suspicions aroused, the officers stopped the car. The stop was made about twelve to fifteen miles from the Mexican border.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Agent Gilbert approached Bugarin, who remained in the ear, and asked his citizenship. Agent Henderson walked to the rear of the car. While Gilbert was questioning Bugarin, Henderson saw through the rear window that the floorboard panels covering the compartment were slightly ajar. Through a crack about an inch and a half wide he saw packages, wrapped in blue paper and covered by cellophane, underneath the panels. In his 16 years as a Border Patrol agent he had seen kilo packages of marijuana similarly wrapped \u201chundred of times,\u201d and he concluded immediately that the packages contained marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Gilbert told Bugarin to open the back of the station wagon. Bugarin got out of the ear, opened the rear window of the station wagon, and then lowered the tailgate. Gilbert too saw the packages. The agents then opened the compartment and found a considerable quantity of marijuana. Bugarin was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">A pre-trial motion to suppress the marijuana was denied. Bugarin was convicted of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a). On appeal Bugarin contends only that his motion to suppress should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">We delayed submission of the case pending decision by the Supreme Court of Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, 1973, 413 U.S. 266, 93 S.Ct. 2535, 37 L.Ed.2d 596 (June 21, 1973), because the government relied primarily on our decision in that case to sustain the search (United States v. \u2022 Almeida-Sanchez, 9 Cir., 1971, 452 F.2d 459). In its decision, the Supreme Court held that border patrol agents, on roving patrol such as this one, cannot stop and search cars, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1357 and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 281.7, without probable cause or a warrant. We conclude, however, that <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>does not control this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">We have held that a stop may be made by such agents, based on a \u201cfounded suspicion,\u201d which may be less than probable cause. United States v. Barron, 9 Cir., 1972, 472 F.2d 1215; United States v. Roberts, 9 Cir., 1972, 470 F.2d 858; United States v. Brown, 9 Cir., 1970, 436 F.2d 702; Wilson v. Porter, 9 Cir., 1966, 361 F.2d 412. If after a valid investigatory stop probable cause arises, the search may then be made. United States v. Roberts, <em>supra, </em>United States v. Leazar, 9 Cir., 1972, 460 F.2d 982; Duprez v. United States, 9 Cir., 1970, 435 F.2d 1276; United States v. Blackstock, 9 Cir., 1971, 451 F.2d 908. Here, without a search, agent Henderson saw packaged marijuana in plain view. At that point probable cause had arisen to justify the search, which Henderson testified he would have undertaken had Gilbert not done so himself.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>The question remains whether the stop itself was valid \u2014 i. e., whether there existed the requisite \u201cfounded suspicion.\u201d Bugarin argues that under United States v. Mallides, 9 Cir., 1973, 473 F.2d 859, the stop was invalid <em>ab initio. </em>In <em>Mallides </em>we held that the presence of six men, apparently of Mexican descent, sitting \u201cstiffly\u201d in a large sedan and not turning to look at a passing police car, did not itself justify stopping the car on the suspicion that the passengers were \u201cillegal\u201d aliens, even though the area in which the car was stopped was one with a high incidence of \u201cillegal\u201d alien activity. We emphasized that the mere fact that a passenger in an automobile appeared to be of Mexican descent would not indicate whether he was \u201can American citizen, a Mexican national with proper entry papers, or a Mexican alien without papers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 860. The focus in <em>Mallides </em>was clearly on the question of the likely race or national origin of the passenger, alone, as justifying the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Here more was involved. Although agent Gilbert did at one point, as Bugarin emphasizes, answer affirmatively the question, \u201cWas [the fact that Bugarin appeared to be of Mexican descent] the primary reason you stopped him?\u201d, both Gilbert and Henderson testified that it was a number of factors in addition to Bugarin\u2019s Mexican appearance that led them to stop the car \u2014 the fact that he was alone, the fact that the car was riding low (particularly unusual in that there was only one visible passenger), and the fact that the agents knew that the model car Bugarin was driving was of the sort that had been used to secrete aliens in a floor compartment over the rear axle.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If Bugarin had not been of apparent Mexican descent, we think that these other factors were sufficient to justify the stop. <em>See </em>United States v. Roberts, <em>supra. </em>It follows that the fact that Bugarin did appear to be of Mexican descent \u2014 even considering that this was one of the factors that led the agents to make the stop \u25a0 \u2014 should not require a different holding in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Mallides, supra, </em>certainly does not stand for the proposition that if agents have grounds for a stop, they are forbidden to make the stop because the driver appears to be of Mexican de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>scent. It only holds that the apparent ethnic background of persons in a car is a neutral fact, justifying neither a stop nor a search.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b908-7\">. The fact that the agents were intending at the time they stopped the car to search it in any event \u2014 generally the sort of search held unconstitutional in Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, <em>supra, </em>\u2014 does not render the search, supported by independent probable cause, invalid. <em>See </em>Williams v. United States, 9 Cir., 1959, 273 F.2d 781, 790-795, cert, denied, 362 U.S. 951, 80 S.Ct. 862, 4 L.Ed.2d 868; Green v. United States, 10 Cir., 1967, 386 F.2d 953; Sirimarco v. United States, 10 Cir., 1963, 315 F.2d 699, cert, denied, 374 U.S. 807, 83 S.Ct. 1696, 10 L.Ed.2d 1032; <em>see also </em>Lowe v. United States, 9 Cir., 1969, 407 F.2d 1391.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b909-7\">. Appellant\u2019s counsel asked Agent Henderson :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-8\">\u201cQ. In this particular instance, did you happen to notice the defendant\u2019s ethnic background, or where he was from, before you stopped him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-9\">A. He appeared to be of Mexican descent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-10\">Q. Was that one of the reasons he was stopped?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-11\">A. No. Not as such, no. Just the fact that the vehicle was sitting low in the rear, with only one passenger, or one person showing in the vehicle at that time of day. It is very common as an alien smuggling operation in that particular area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-12\">Q. Do you stop every ear that passes your area that\u2019s low in the rear?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-13\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-14\">Q. So it\u2019s actually a combination of factors, isn\u2019t it, that creates the necessity for the stop, in your mind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-15\">A. Yes, it\u2019s a combination of factors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-16\">Appellant\u2019s counsel also questioned Agent Gilbert:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-17\">\u201cQ. Now, in the past, when you\u2019ve stopped persons driving cars on this Route 8, at that junction, and there has been a Mexican person driving, have you stopped most of these cars when the person is alone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-18\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-19\">A. It depends on the circumstances. No, I do not stop every person I see of Mexican descent. I usually have some other reason, due to my experience, that I feel to stop them for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-20\">Q. So Mexican descent combined with the lowness of the automobile, or some other factor that would make this car unusual to you. Would that be correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-21\">A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b909-22\">. Agent Henderson testified that about 50% of the \u201clow-riding\u201d cars that he stopped are driven by those appearing to be Mexican. Thus the agents might well have stopped Bugarin\u2019s car had he not appeared to be of Mexican descent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
